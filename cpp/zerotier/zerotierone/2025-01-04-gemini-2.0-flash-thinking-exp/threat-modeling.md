# Threat Model Analysis for zerotier/zerotierone

## Threat: [Unauthorized Network Access](./threats/unauthorized_network_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ZeroTier network by exploiting weaknesses in ZeroTier's access control mechanisms or through compromised network membership secrets. This allows the attacker to bypass intended network segmentation and access resources they should not.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of data, disruption of services, lateral movement within the network, and potential reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** ZeroTier Central Service (for authorization), ZeroTier Client (for joining and authenticating), ZeroTier Network (as a whole).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls within the ZeroTier network, requiring explicit authorization for new members.
        *   Securely manage and store ZeroTier network membership secrets. Avoid embedding them directly in client-side code or easily accessible configuration files.
        *   Regularly review and revoke access for inactive or unauthorized members.
        *   Utilize ZeroTier's managed routes and flow rules to segment the network and restrict access to specific resources based on identity.
        *   Monitor network membership changes and login attempts for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack within the ZeroTier Network](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_within_the_zerotier_network.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, having gained unauthorized access to the ZeroTier network, intercepts communication between application components within the virtual network. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in ZeroTier's encryption implementation or key management to decrypt, modify, or inject malicious traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data theft, manipulation of application logic, injection of malware, and compromise of communication integrity.
    *   **Affected Component:** ZeroTier Network (data plane), potentially ZeroTier Client (if vulnerabilities in encryption handling exist).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rely on ZeroTier's built-in end-to-end encryption. Ensure it is enabled and functioning correctly.
        *   Stay updated with ZeroTier releases to patch any potential vulnerabilities in their encryption implementation.
        *   Implement application-layer encryption for sensitive data as an additional defense-in-depth measure.
        *   Enforce mutual authentication between communicating parties within the ZeroTier network.

## Threat: [ZeroTier Client Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/zerotier_client_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability in the ZeroTier client software running on a host. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation on the host, or denial of service of the ZeroTier client, directly impacting the application's ability to use the network.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the host system, potential access to sensitive data stored on the host, disruption of network connectivity for the application running on that host, and potential lateral movement to other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** ZeroTier Client (specific modules or functions depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the ZeroTier client software updated to the latest stable version. Implement automatic updates where feasible.
        *   Monitor ZeroTier security advisories and apply patches promptly.
        *   Follow security best practices for the host operating system, including regular patching and strong access controls.
        *   Run the ZeroTier client with the least necessary privileges.
        *   Consider using endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to detect and prevent exploitation attempts.

## Threat: [ZeroTier Central Service Compromise (Indirect Threat, but Directly Impacts ZeroTier Functionality)](./threats/zerotier_central_service_compromise__indirect_threat__but_directly_impacts_zerotier_functionality_.md)

*   **Description:** While primarily a risk to ZeroTier itself, a compromise of ZeroTier's central infrastructure would directly impact the functionality of any application relying on it. An attacker gaining control could manipulate network configurations, access authorization information, or disrupt the entire ZeroTier network, affecting your application's connectivity and security.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread disruption of ZeroTier networks, potential unauthorized access and data breaches across multiple networks, and loss of trust in the platform, directly impacting your application's ability to function.
    *   **Affected Component:** ZeroTier Central Service (all aspects).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   This threat is primarily mitigated by ZeroTier's security practices. Stay informed about their security measures and any reported incidents.
        *   Consider the potential impact of such an event on your application's availability and have contingency plans.
        *   Implement application-level security measures that do not solely rely on ZeroTier for security.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering via Compromised ZeroTier Account](./threats/configuration_tampering_via_compromised_zerotier_account.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the ZeroTier account managing the network your application uses. With this access, they can directly manipulate ZeroTier network configurations, such as routing rules or access controls, to disrupt connectivity, grant unauthorized access, or isolate application components within the ZeroTier network.
    *   **Impact:** Disruption of network connectivity, unauthorized access to resources, potential isolation of application components, and denial of service directly impacting the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** ZeroTier Central Service (account management, network configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all ZeroTier accounts managing the network.
        *   Implement strong password policies for ZeroTier accounts.
        *   Regularly review ZeroTier network configurations for unauthorized changes.
        *   Restrict access to the ZeroTier management interface to authorized personnel only.
        *   Monitor account activity for suspicious logins or configuration changes.
