## Attack Tree Path: [1. Gain Unauthorized Access to the ZeroTier Network [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__gain_unauthorized_access_to_the_zerotier_network__critical_node_.md)

**Brute-force or Credential Stuffing of Network Join Key:** An attacker attempts to guess or use previously compromised credentials for the ZeroTier network join key.
    * *Attack Vector:* Repeatedly trying different keys until the correct one is found, or using lists of known or leaked credentials.
**Insider Threat - Malicious Administrator/Member:** A legitimate member of the ZeroTier network with malicious intent uses their authorized access to compromise the network or its resources.
    * *Attack Vector:* Abusing administrative privileges or leveraging access to sensitive information within the network.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack within the ZeroTier Network [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_within_the_zerotier_network__high_risk_.md)

**ARP Spoofing/Poisoning on the Virtual Network:** An attacker within the ZeroTier network sends forged ARP messages to associate their MAC address with the IP address of another host (e.g., the application server), allowing them to intercept traffic.
    * *Attack Vector:* Using tools to send spoofed ARP packets, redirecting traffic intended for another host through the attacker's machine.
**Compromise a Legitimate Peer and Intercept Traffic:** An attacker compromises another device already connected to the ZeroTier network and uses it as a pivot point to intercept traffic between other peers.
    * *Attack Vector:* Exploiting vulnerabilities on a peer device (e.g., malware, unpatched software) and using it to eavesdrop on network communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Application's Interaction with ZeroTier One [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_application's_interaction_with_zerotier_one__critical_node_.md)

**API Abuse [HIGH RISK]:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses in how the application uses the ZeroTier One API or CLI.
    **Inject Malicious Commands via API Calls:** The application constructs commands for the ZeroTier API using user-provided input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
        * *Attack Vector:* Providing specially crafted input that, when used in an API call, executes unintended commands on the ZeroTier system.
    **Exploit Logic Flaws in Application's ZeroTier Integration:** The application's logic for interacting with the ZeroTier API has flaws that can be exploited to achieve unintended actions or bypass security controls.
        * *Attack Vector:* Triggering unexpected behavior by manipulating the sequence of API calls, providing unexpected input values, or exploiting error handling vulnerabilities.
    **Unauthorized API Access:** The application's API endpoints for interacting with ZeroTier lack proper authentication or authorization, allowing unauthorized users on the network to manipulate the ZeroTier connection.
        * *Attack Vector:* Directly calling the application's API endpoints responsible for ZeroTier interaction without proper credentials or by bypassing authentication mechanisms.
        * *Attack Vector:* Intercepting legitimate API calls and replaying or modifying them to perform unauthorized actions.
