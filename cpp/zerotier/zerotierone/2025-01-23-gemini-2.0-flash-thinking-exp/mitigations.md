# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for zerotier/zerotierone

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Network Authorization and Access Control](./mitigation_strategies/strong_network_authorization_and_access_control.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strong Network Authorization and Access Control within ZeroTier
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize ZeroTier Member Management:**  Access the ZeroTier Central web interface or API. Navigate to your network and the "Members" section.
    2.  **Authorize Each Device Individually:** For every device joining, locate the device in the "Members" list (it will initially show as "REQUESTED"). Click the checkbox next to the device to authorize it.
    3.  **Apply Principle of Least Privilege:**  Within ZeroTier Central, consider creating multiple networks if different application components require different access levels. Assign devices only to the networks they need to access.
    4.  **Regularly Review Member List:**  Set a recurring schedule (e.g., monthly) to review the "Members" list in ZeroTier Central. Remove any devices that are no longer authorized or should not have access.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access (High Severity):** Prevents devices not explicitly authorized within ZeroTier from joining the network and accessing resources.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** Limits unauthorized lateral movement by ensuring only approved devices are on the network.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Member authorization is used for production environments, but development and testing environments sometimes bypass it for quicker setup.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formalize and schedule regular member list reviews. Enforce member authorization consistently across all environments, including development and testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Access Control Lists (ACLs)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_access_control_lists__acls_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement and Enforce ZeroTier Access Control Lists (ACLs)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Network Traffic Requirements:**  Map out the necessary communication flows between devices on your ZeroTier network (e.g., server A needs to access port X on server B).
    2.  **Create ACL Rules in ZeroTier Central:**  In ZeroTier Central, navigate to your network and the "Flow Rules" section (ACLs). Use the visual rule editor or the code editor to define rules.
    3.  **Implement Granular Rules:** Create rules that specify source and destination ZeroTier addresses (or tags), IP protocols (TCP, UDP, ICMP), and ports.
    4.  **Deny All by Default:** Ensure your ACL rules include a final "drop" rule (e.g., `drop {};`) to deny any traffic not explicitly allowed by previous rules.
    5.  **Test ACLs via ZeroTier Central:** Use the "Test Rules" feature in ZeroTier Central to simulate traffic and verify that your ACLs are working as expected before deploying them.
    6.  **Regularly Review and Update ACLs:** As application needs change, revisit and update your ZeroTier ACL rules to maintain security and functionality.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lateral Movement (High Severity):**  Significantly restricts lateral movement by controlling traffic flow at the ZeroTier network level.
    *   **Network Segmentation Bypass (Medium Severity):** Enhances segmentation by enforcing rules within ZeroTier, independent of physical network infrastructure.
    *   **Unnecessary Service Exposure (Medium Severity):** Prevents unintended access to services by limiting communication to defined paths and ports.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Lateral Movement:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Network Segmentation Bypass:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Unnecessary Service Exposure:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic ACLs exist, but they lack fine-grained port and protocol restrictions in certain areas.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Expand ACLs to include specific port and protocol rules based on application requirements. Implement automated testing of ACL rules. Document the purpose and logic of existing ACL rules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Network Key Management](./mitigation_strategies/secure_network_key_management.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely Manage ZeroTier Network Keys
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Treat Network Keys as Secrets:** Understand that the ZeroTier network key grants access to your private network. Handle it with the same security as passwords or API keys.
    2.  **Avoid Embedding Keys in Code:** Do not hardcode the network key directly into application source code or configuration files that are version controlled or easily accessible.
    3.  **Utilize Environment Variables or Secrets Management:** Store the network key as an environment variable on systems that need to join the network. For more robust management, use a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
    4.  **Secure Key Distribution:** When sharing the network key with authorized users or systems, use secure channels like encrypted messaging or secure configuration management tools. Avoid insecure methods like email.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access if the network key is compromised and used by malicious actors.
    *   **Confidentiality Breach (Medium Severity):** Protects the confidentiality of network traffic and potentially application data if the network key is exposed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Network Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Network keys are stored as environment variables in production. Development environments sometimes use less secure methods for convenience.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforce secure key storage practices across all environments. Explore integrating with a secrets management solution for enhanced control and auditing. Formalize key distribution procedures.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep ZeroTier Client Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_zerotier_client_updated.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Maintain Up-to-Date ZeroTier Client Software
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Update Procedures:** Create a process for regularly updating the ZeroTier client (`zerotier-cli`, `zerotier-one` service) on all devices in your ZeroTier network.
    2.  **Monitor ZeroTier Release Channels:** Subscribe to ZeroTier's official release channels (website, GitHub releases, mailing lists) to be notified of new versions and security updates.
    3.  **Automate Updates Where Possible:** Use operating system package managers (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`) or configuration management tools (Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to automate ZeroTier client updates.
    4.  **Test Updates in Staging:** Before deploying updates to production, test them in a staging or testing environment to ensure compatibility and stability with your application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Patches known security vulnerabilities in the `zerotier-one` software, preventing attackers from exploiting them.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Manual updates are performed occasionally. No automated update system is in place. Monitoring of ZeroTier releases is inconsistent.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement automated update mechanisms for ZeroTier clients on all managed devices. Establish a formal process for monitoring ZeroTier releases and prioritizing security updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure ZeroTier API Key Management (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_zerotier_api_key_management__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Securely Manage ZeroTier API Keys (If Using the API)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Treat API Keys as Highly Sensitive:** API keys provide administrative access to your ZeroTier network via the API. Protect them rigorously.
    2.  **Use Secrets Management for API Keys:** Store API keys in a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Secret Manager).
    3.  **Avoid Hardcoding API Keys:** Never embed API keys directly in application code, configuration files, or version control systems.
    4.  **Restrict API Key Scope (If Possible):** If ZeroTier offers granular API key permissions in the future, utilize them to create API keys with the minimum necessary access level.
    5.  **API Key Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating API keys to limit the lifespan of a potentially compromised key.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized individuals or systems from using the ZeroTier API to manage your network configuration.
    *   **Administrative Account Compromise (High Severity):** Protects against the compromise of administrative control over your ZeroTier network.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Administrative Account Compromise:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. API keys are currently stored as environment variables, but not within a dedicated secrets management system. API key rotation is not implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Migrate API key storage to a dedicated secrets management solution. Implement API key rotation. Explore and implement granular API key permissions if and when available in ZeroTier.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Monitor ZeroTier Security Advisories](./mitigation_strategies/monitor_zerotier_security_advisories.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Proactive Monitoring of ZeroTier Security Advisories and Announcements
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to ZeroTier Security Channels:** Identify and subscribe to ZeroTier's official security communication channels. This might include their website, blog, security mailing lists, or GitHub security advisories.
    2.  **Establish a Monitoring Process:** Assign responsibility to a team or individual to regularly monitor these channels for new security advisories and announcements related to `zerotierone`.
    3.  **Assess Impact of Advisories:** When a security advisory is released, promptly evaluate its potential impact on your application and ZeroTier deployment. Determine if the vulnerability affects your version of ZeroTier or your usage patterns.
    4.  **Plan and Implement Remediation:** If an advisory is relevant, create a plan to implement the recommended remediation steps (e.g., updating ZeroTier clients, applying configuration changes) in a timely manner. Prioritize based on severity.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Newly Discovered Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Enables a rapid and informed response to newly disclosed vulnerabilities in `zerotierone`, reducing the window of opportunity for attackers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Newly Discovered Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. The team occasionally checks ZeroTier release notes, but there's no formal subscription to security-specific channels or a documented process for handling advisories.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish formal subscriptions to relevant ZeroTier security communication channels. Document a clear process for monitoring, assessing, and responding to security advisories. Integrate this process into the incident response plan.
