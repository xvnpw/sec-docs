# Attack Surface Analysis for zerotier/zerotierone

## Attack Surface: [1. Controller Compromise](./attack_surfaces/1__controller_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ZeroTier network controller (either ZeroTier's hosted service or a self-hosted instance). This remains the most critical attack vector *directly* related to ZeroTier.
*   **ZeroTier One Contribution:** ZeroTier's architecture fundamentally relies on centralized controllers for network management, membership, and rule enforcement. The controller is the central point of trust and control.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the controller's web interface or uses stolen administrator credentials to gain access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete control over the virtual network.
    *   Ability to eavesdrop on *all* network traffic (MITM).
    *   Ability to inject malicious traffic.
    *   Ability to add/remove devices and modify network rules (including bypassing security policies).
    *   Potential for complete network shutdown.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong, unique passwords and *mandatory* multi-factor authentication (MFA) for *all* controller access (both UI and API).
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the controller software (if self-hosted) meticulously up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Automated updates are strongly recommended.
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Restrict controller API access to *only* the absolutely necessary IP addresses using firewall rules.  Implement a "deny by default" policy.
    *   **Comprehensive Auditing:** Regularly audit controller logs (authentication attempts, configuration changes, etc.) for *any* suspicious activity.  Implement automated alerting for anomalies.
    *   **Self-Hosting Security (if applicable):** If self-hosting, treat the controller server as a *critical* asset.  Harden it with a robust firewall, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and regular, in-depth security audits.  Consider a dedicated, isolated network segment.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Grant *only* the absolutely necessary permissions to controller users and API keys.  Avoid using "administrator" accounts for routine tasks.

## Attack Surface: [2. Client Device Compromise (with `identity.secret` Theft)](./attack_surfaces/2__client_device_compromise__with__identity_secret__theft_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a device running the ZeroTier One client *and* successfully obtains the `identity.secret` file. This is a direct attack on a core ZeroTier component.
*   **ZeroTier One Contribution:** The `identity.secret` file is the *fundamental* cryptographic identity of a ZeroTier node. Its compromise allows for complete and undetectable impersonation of that node on the network.
*   **Example:** Malware on a user's device steals the `identity.secret` file, allowing the attacker to join the ZeroTier network with the same privileges as the compromised user.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Full, authenticated access to the ZeroTier network as the compromised device.
    *   Ability to eavesdrop on traffic, inject malicious traffic, and access all network resources accessible to the impersonated device.
    *   Potential to use the compromised device as a pivot point to attack other devices on the network (lateral movement).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Endpoint Security:** Implement and *maintain* robust endpoint security measures (antivirus, EDR, host-based firewalls, application whitelisting) on *all* devices running the ZeroTier client.
    *   **Strict File System Permissions:** Ensure that the `identity.secret` file has the *strictest possible* file system permissions, preventing unauthorized access by any user or process other than the ZeroTier client itself.
    *   **User Education:** Educate users about the critical importance of protecting their devices and the dangers of phishing, malware, and social engineering.
    *   **Immediate Device Deauthorization:** If a device is suspected of being compromised, *immediately* deauthorize it from the ZeroTier controller.  This is a crucial incident response step.
    *   **Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** For high-security environments (e.g., critical infrastructure), strongly consider using HSMs to store the cryptographic keys.  This makes key theft significantly more difficult, even with physical access to the device.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of devices and user accounts, including checks for unauthorized software and configuration changes.

## Attack Surface: [3. ZeroTier One Client Vulnerability Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/3__zerotier_one_client_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the ZeroTier One client software itself to gain unauthorized access or control. This is a direct attack on the ZeroTier software.
*   **ZeroTier One Contribution:** The ZeroTier One client is a complex piece of software, and like all software, it may contain vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A remotely exploitable buffer overflow vulnerability in the client's network packet handling code could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Highly variable, depending on the specific vulnerability.  Could range from denial of service to complete remote code execution (RCE) and full device compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the vulnerability; assume high until proven otherwise)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Automatic Updates:** Enforce automatic updates for the ZeroTier One client.  Do *not* allow users to disable updates.  This is the single most important mitigation.
    *   **Proactive Vulnerability Monitoring:** Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE) for ZeroTier-related issues.  Have a process in place to rapidly assess and respond to new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sandboxing (where feasible):** If technically possible and practical, consider running the ZeroTier client in a sandboxed or containerized environment to limit the impact of potential exploits.  This adds a layer of defense.
    *   **System Hardening:** Apply general system hardening best practices to the device running the client.  This reduces the overall attack surface and can mitigate some classes of vulnerabilities.
