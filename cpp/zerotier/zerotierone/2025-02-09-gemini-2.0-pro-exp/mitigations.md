# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for zerotier/zerotierone

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege (Network Membership)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege__network_membership_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege (Network Membership)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Network Inventory:** Maintain an up-to-date inventory of all devices and users that require access to ZeroTier networks.  This directly impacts which `zerotierone` clients are joined to which networks.
        2.  **Needs Assessment:** For each device and user (and therefore, each `zerotierone` client), determine the specific ZeroTier networks they *need* to access.
        3.  **Restricted Membership:** Only join `zerotierone` clients to the ZeroTier networks they absolutely require.  Avoid joining them to networks unnecessarily.  This is done via the `zerotier-cli join <networkID>` command.
        4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review network membership (e.g., every quarter) and remove any `zerotierone` clients that no longer require access using `zerotier-cli leave <networkID>`.
        5.  **Automated Deprovisioning:** Ideally, integrate ZeroTier network joining/leaving (using `zerotier-cli`) with your existing user and device management systems to automate the deprovisioning process.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Network Access (High Severity):** Limits the impact of a compromised `zerotierone` client by restricting its access.
        *   **Lateral Movement (High Severity):** Reduces the ability of an attacker to move laterally after compromising a client.
        *   **Data Exfiltration (Medium Severity):** Limits the data accessible from a compromised client.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Network Access:** Significantly reduces the impact.
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Significantly reduces the risk.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Moderately reduces the risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Network Inventory: Partially implemented (informal list).
        *   Needs Assessment: Partially implemented (ad-hoc basis).
        *   Restricted Membership: Partially implemented (some restrictions).
        *   Regular Review: Not implemented.
        *   Automated Deprovisioning: Not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Network Inventory: Formal, up-to-date inventory.
        *   Needs Assessment: Formalized process.
        *   Restricted Membership: Strict enforcement.
        *   Regular Review: Scheduled reviews.
        *   Automated Deprovisioning: Integration with management systems.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Segmentation (Within ZeroTier) using Flow Rules](./mitigation_strategies/network_segmentation__within_zerotier__using_flow_rules.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Network Segmentation (Within ZeroTier) using Flow Rules

    *   **Description:** This strategy primarily involves configuring flow rules *on the controller*, but the *enforcement* of those rules happens within the `zerotierone` client on each device.  Therefore, it's directly relevant.
        1.  **Identify Network Segments:** Define logical segments.
        2.  **Default Deny Policy:**  (Controller-side configuration) Start with a "default deny" policy.
        3.  **Explicit Allow Rules:** (Controller-side configuration) Create "allow" rules.
        4.  **Use Tags and Capabilities:** (Controller-side configuration) Use tags and capabilities.
        5.  **Testing:**  Use tools like `nmap` *from devices running `zerotierone`* to verify that the flow rules enforced by the client are working as expected.  This is a crucial client-side testing step.
        6.  **Documentation:** Document the rules.
        7.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the rules.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Lateral Movement (High Severity):** The `zerotierone` client enforces the rules that prevent lateral movement.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Services (High Severity):** The client restricts access based on the rules.
        *   **Data Exfiltration (Medium Severity):** The client limits data access.
        *   **Compromised Node Impact (High Severity):** The client limits the damage a compromised node can do.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Significantly reduces the risk.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Services:** Significantly reduces the risk.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Moderately reduces the risk.
        *   **Compromised Node Impact:** Significantly reduces the impact.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Identify Network Segments: Partially implemented.
        *   Default Deny Policy: Not implemented.
        *   Explicit Allow Rules: Partially implemented.
        *   Use Tags and Capabilities: Not implemented.
        *   Testing: Partially implemented (basic testing from client devices).
        *   Documentation: Not implemented.
        *   Regular Review: Not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Default Deny Policy: Implement on the controller.
        *   Explicit Allow Rules: Refine rules.
        *   Use Tags and Capabilities: Implement on the controller.
        *   Testing: More rigorous testing *from client devices*.
        *   Documentation: Create documentation.
        *   Regular Review: Schedule reviews.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Client Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_client_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Client Updates

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Enable Automatic Updates:**  Configure the `zerotierone` client to automatically update itself.  The exact method depends on the operating system and installation method (e.g., package manager, installer).
        2.  **Manual Updates (If Necessary):** If automatic updates are not possible, establish a process for regularly checking for and installing updates to the `zerotierone` client manually. This might involve running `zerotier-cli` commands or using OS-specific update mechanisms.
        3.  **Monitor Release Notes:** Monitor ZeroTier's release notes.
        4.  **Centralized Management (If Possible):** Use a centralized system to manage `zerotierone` client updates across multiple devices.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Client Vulnerability Exploitation (High Severity):** Directly addresses vulnerabilities in the `zerotierone` client.
        *   **Zero-Day Exploits (High Severity):** Helps mitigate zero-days by ensuring rapid patching.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Client Vulnerability Exploitation:** Significantly reduces the risk.
        *   **Zero-Day Exploits:** Moderately reduces the risk.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Enable Automatic Updates: Partially implemented.
        *   Manual Updates (If Necessary): Not implemented.
        *   Monitor Release Notes: Not implemented.
        *   Centralized Management (If Possible): Not implemented.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Enable Automatic Updates: Enable on all devices where possible.
        *   Manual Updates (If Necessary): Establish a process.
        *   Monitor Release Notes: Implement monitoring.
        *   Centralized Management (If Possible): Explore options.
