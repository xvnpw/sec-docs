## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access/Disrupt Application via ZeroTier](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_accessdisrupt_application_via_zerotier.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching goal of the attacker â€“ to either gain unauthorized access to application resources/data or to disrupt the application's services by targeting the ZeroTier One integration.
    *   **Likelihood:** N/A (This is the goal, not an attack step)
    *   **Impact:** Very High
    *   **Effort:** N/A
    *   **Skill Level:** N/A
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** N/A

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise ZeroTier Network](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_zerotier_network.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to gain control over the ZeroTier network itself, allowing them to manipulate network membership, configuration, or routing.
    *   **Likelihood:** Variable (Depends on specific sub-attacks)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control over network communication)
    *   **Effort:** Variable
    *   **Skill Level:** Variable
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable

## Attack Tree Path: [Join Network Illegitimately](./attack_tree_paths/join_network_illegitimately.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the ZeroTier network without proper authorization.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized network access)
    *   **Effort:** Variable
    *   **Skill Level:** Variable
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker uses social engineering techniques (phishing, impersonation, etc.) to trick a legitimate user into revealing network credentials (Network ID, join token).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Join API](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_join_api.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application's implementation of the ZeroTier join process. This could involve insecure exposure of the Network ID, a lack of proper validation, or an injection vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on application design)
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Controller](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_controller.md)

* **Description:** Attacker gains control over network controller.
      * **Likelihood:** Variable
      * **Impact:** Very High
      * **Effort:** Variable
      * **Skill Level:** Variable
      * **Detection Difficulty:** Variable

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Central](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_central.md)

* **Description:** Attacker gains control over ZeroTier Central.
        * **Likelihood:** Very Low
        * **Impact:** Very High
        * **Effort:** Very High
        * **Skill Level:** Expert
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Moon](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_moon.md)

* **Description:** Attacker gains control over custom Moon server.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        * **Impact:** Medium to High
        * **Effort:** Medium to High
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Network Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_network_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains the ability to modify the ZeroTier network's configuration, potentially altering routing, access rules, or other settings.
    *   **Likelihood:** Variable (Depends on specific sub-attacks)
    *   **Impact:** High (Can disrupt or redirect network traffic)
    *   **Effort:** Variable
    *   **Skill Level:** Variable
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the network controller (ZeroTier Central or a self-hosted controller) by exploiting weak authentication mechanisms, such as default passwords, easily guessable credentials, or a lack of multi-factor authentication.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
