# Threat Model Analysis for zerotier/zerotierone

## Threat: [Unauthorized Network Access](./threats/unauthorized_network_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the ZeroTier network without proper authorization.  While the *authorization* is handled by the controller, the `zerotierone` service on the compromised or impersonated node is what *allows* the unauthorized network connection. The attacker might have obtained a valid, but stolen or illegitimately acquired, API key, and `zerotierone` accepts this key.
*   **Impact:** The attacker can access network traffic, potentially intercepting sensitive data, and may be able to access application services exposed on the ZeroTier network. This could lead to data breaches and unauthorized access.
*   **Affected Component:** `zerotierone` service (network joining process, authentication handling). Specifically, the `Join()` function and related network authentication mechanisms are directly involved.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:** Use strong, unique, and randomly generated API keys. Never hardcode keys. Use secure storage mechanisms.
    *   **Client-Side Validation:** Implement application-level checks *within your application* to verify the identity of other nodes, even if they are "authorized" by ZeroTier. This could involve cryptographic signatures or other mutual authentication. This adds a layer of defense *beyond* ZeroTier's authentication.
    *   **Regular Auditing:** (While primarily a controller-side mitigation, it's relevant because it impacts `zerotierone`'s operation). Regularly review authorized members.

## Threat: [Traffic Eavesdropping (Passive) - *via Compromised Controller interaction*](./threats/traffic_eavesdropping__passive__-_via_compromised_controller_interaction.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker passively monitors network traffic. While ZeroTier encrypts traffic, a *compromised controller* with access to root keys can potentially decrypt this traffic. The `zerotierone` service is the component *sending and receiving* this encrypted traffic, making it the direct target of the eavesdropping, even though the vulnerability lies in the controller's compromise.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over the ZeroTier network.
*   **Affected Component:** `zerotierone` service (network traffic handling, encryption/decryption modules). The core networking stack and cryptographic functions are directly involved.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **End-to-End Encryption (Application Layer):** Implement end-to-end encryption *within* the application, independent of ZeroTier's encryption. Use TLS/HTTPS *even within* the ZeroTier network. This is the *primary* mitigation, as it protects data even if the controller is compromised.

## Threat: [Traffic Manipulation (Active) - *via Compromised Controller interaction*](./threats/traffic_manipulation__active__-_via_compromised_controller_interaction.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker actively modifies network traffic.  Similar to eavesdropping, a compromised controller could potentially inject or modify packets. The `zerotierone` service is the component *processing* these packets, making it the direct target of the manipulation.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, execution of malicious code, impersonation, and potential compromise of connected devices.
*   **Affected Component:** `zerotierone` service (network traffic handling, packet processing). The core networking stack and packet parsing functions are directly involved.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **End-to-End Encryption (Application Layer):**  Crucial for preventing modification, as with passive eavesdropping.
    *   **Data Integrity Checks:** Implement data integrity checks (e.g., cryptographic signatures) *within the application* to detect any unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [`zerotierone` Service Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/_zerotierone__service_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *directly within* the `zerotierone` service itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, code injection flaw) to gain unauthorized access or control of the host system. This is a direct attack on the `zerotierone` code.
*   **Impact:** Potential compromise of the *entire host system*, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code, steal data, and potentially pivot to other systems.
*   **Affected Component:** `zerotierone` service (potentially any module, depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the `zerotierone` service up-to-date with the latest security patches. This is the *most important* mitigation. Subscribe to ZeroTier security advisories.
    *   **Least Privilege (System Level):** Run the `zerotierone` service with the minimum necessary system privileges. Avoid running as root if possible.
    *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Run the `zerotierone` service in a sandboxed environment or container to limit the impact of a compromise.
    *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention:** Use intrusion detection/prevention systems to monitor for and block exploitation attempts.
