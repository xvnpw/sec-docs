# Threat Model Analysis for zerotier/zerotierone

## Threat: [ZeroTier Central Controller Account Takeover](./threats/zerotier_central_controller_account_takeover.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ZeroTier account that manages the network used by the application. This could be achieved through credential stuffing, phishing, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the account management system. The attacker could then modify network configurations, add or remove members, and potentially intercept traffic.

**Impact:** Complete control over the virtual network, leading to potential data breaches, denial of service for legitimate users, and the ability to inject malicious traffic.

**Affected Component:** ZeroTier Central Controller (Account Management)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) on the ZeroTier account.
* Use strong, unique passwords for the ZeroTier account.
* Regularly review account activity for suspicious logins.
* Monitor for and respond to security alerts from ZeroTier.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Network Membership](./threats/unauthorized_network_membership.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ZeroTier network without proper authorization. This could happen if the network ID is leaked, if the network is not set to private and requires manual approval, or if an authorized member's device is compromised and used to join other networks. Once inside, the attacker can access resources intended only for authorized members.

**Impact:** Access to internal application resources, potential data exfiltration, and the ability to disrupt network operations.

**Affected Component:** ZeroTier Central Controller (Network Membership Management), ZeroTier Client (Network Joining Process)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the ZeroTier network private and require manual member approval.
* Regularly review the list of authorized members and revoke access for inactive or suspicious devices.
* Educate users on the importance of keeping their devices secure.
* Implement network segmentation within the ZeroTier network if necessary.

## Threat: [Denial of Service against ZeroTier Network](./threats/denial_of_service_against_zerotier_network.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the ZeroTier network with malicious traffic or exploits vulnerabilities in the ZeroTier protocol to disrupt network connectivity for legitimate users. This could prevent the application from communicating with its components or users.

**Impact:** Application downtime, inability for legitimate users to connect, and potential disruption of business operations.

**Affected Component:** ZeroTier Network Infrastructure, ZeroTier Client (Network Communication)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* While direct mitigation against ZeroTier infrastructure attacks is limited, monitor network connectivity and have a fallback plan in case of ZeroTier outages.
* Implement rate limiting and traffic filtering at the application level to mitigate potential internal DoS attacks.
* Stay informed about known vulnerabilities in ZeroTier and update the client software promptly.

## Threat: [ZeroTier Client Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/zerotier_client_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability in the ZeroTier client software running on the application server or user devices. This could allow for remote code execution, privilege escalation, or other malicious activities on the affected machine.

**Impact:** Compromise of the application server or user devices, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, and further attacks.

**Affected Component:** ZeroTier Client (zerotier-one daemon/service)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the ZeroTier client software updated to the latest version with security patches.
* Implement standard security practices on the systems running the ZeroTier client, such as strong passwords, firewalls, and regular security scans.
* Monitor the ZeroTier client logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Leaked ZeroTier API Keys or Secrets](./threats/leaked_zerotier_api_keys_or_secrets.md)

**Description:** ZeroTier API keys or secrets used by the application for programmatic interaction with the ZeroTier service are accidentally exposed (e.g., in code repositories, configuration files, or logs). An attacker could use these keys to manage the ZeroTier network, add/remove members, and potentially disrupt operations.

**Impact:** Ability for attackers to manage the ZeroTier network, potentially leading to unauthorized access, denial of service, and data breaches.

**Affected Component:** ZeroTier API, Application Code (Integration with ZeroTier)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Store ZeroTier API keys securely using secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
* Avoid hardcoding API keys in the application code.
* Implement proper access controls for accessing and managing API keys.
* Regularly rotate API keys.
