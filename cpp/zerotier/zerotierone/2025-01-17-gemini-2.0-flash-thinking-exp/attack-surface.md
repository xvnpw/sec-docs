# Attack Surface Analysis for zerotier/zerotierone

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of the Local ZeroTier Client Process](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_the_local_zerotier_client_process.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the ZeroTier client process running on the application's host.

**How ZeroTierone Contributes:** ZeroTierone introduces a persistent process that manages network connections and stores sensitive information (network keys). Its compromise grants access to the ZeroTier network.

**Example:** Exploiting a vulnerability in the ZeroTier client software or using social engineering to gain access to the host and manipulate the client process.

**Impact:** Joining unauthorized ZeroTier networks, exfiltrating network keys, manipulating network configuration, using the host as a pivot point for further attacks within the ZeroTier network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the ZeroTier client software updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Implement strong access controls on the host system to prevent unauthorized access and process manipulation.
* Use endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions to monitor for suspicious activity related to the ZeroTier client process.
* Regularly audit the host system for signs of compromise.

## Attack Surface: [Exfiltration of ZeroTier Network Keys](./attack_surfaces/exfiltration_of_zerotier_network_keys.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains the cryptographic keys used to authenticate the application's node on the ZeroTier network.

**How ZeroTierone Contributes:** ZeroTierone stores these keys locally on the host. If the storage is not adequately protected, the keys can be stolen.

**Example:** Accessing the ZeroTier configuration files on the host system where keys might be stored, either through local access or by exploiting a vulnerability allowing file access.

**Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the application's node on the ZeroTier network from any location, potentially intercepting or manipulating communication intended for the application or accessing resources it has access to.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the ZeroTier configuration files and key storage are protected with appropriate file system permissions, limiting access to only the necessary user accounts.
* Consider using hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves for storing sensitive keys if the application's security requirements are very high.
* Implement robust access control mechanisms on the host system.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Joining of the ZeroTier Network](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_joining_of_the_zerotier_network.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's ZeroTier network without proper authorization.

**How ZeroTierone Contributes:** ZeroTierone facilitates joining networks using network IDs and potentially join tokens or invitations. If these are leaked or improperly managed, unauthorized access is possible.

**Example:** A developer accidentally commits the network join token to a public code repository, or an attacker gains access to internal communication channels where the token is shared.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to services and resources exposed on the ZeroTier network, potential for malicious activity within the network, and eavesdropping on communication.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Securely manage and distribute ZeroTier network join tokens or invitations through private channels.
* Implement network authorization controls within the ZeroTier Central management interface to approve new members.
* Regularly review the list of authorized members on the ZeroTier network and revoke access for any unknown or suspicious nodes.
* Avoid embedding network join tokens directly in application code or configuration files that might be easily accessible.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Internal Services via ZeroTier](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_internal_services_via_zerotier.md)

**Description:** Services running on the application's host, intended for internal use, become accessible to other members of the ZeroTier network.

**How ZeroTierone Contributes:** ZeroTierone creates a virtual network interface, potentially routing traffic to services that were previously only accessible on the local network.

**Example:** An internal database server is running on the application's host, and the firewall is not properly configured to restrict access over the ZeroTier interface, making it accessible to other nodes on the virtual network.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive internal services, potential data breaches, and exploitation of vulnerabilities in those services.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict firewall rules on the application's host to control traffic entering and leaving the ZeroTier interface, allowing only necessary connections.
* Ensure that services exposed over the ZeroTier network have their own robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring network access.

## Attack Surface: [Compromise of the ZeroTier Central Account](./attack_surfaces/compromise_of_the_zerotier_central_account.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the account used to manage the ZeroTier network on the ZeroTier Central platform.

**How ZeroTierone Contributes:** ZeroTierone relies on the configuration and management provided by ZeroTier Central. Compromising this account allows manipulation of the network affecting the zerotierone client's connectivity and configuration.

**Example:** Weak password, lack of multi-factor authentication (MFA), or phishing attacks targeting the account owner.

**Impact:** Revoking access for legitimate nodes (impacting zerotierone client's ability to connect), adding malicious nodes to the network, modifying network configurations, and potentially disrupting the application's connectivity.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce strong, unique passwords for the ZeroTier Central account.
* Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for the ZeroTier Central account.
* Regularly review the account's activity logs for any suspicious behavior.
* Limit the number of users with administrative access to the ZeroTier Central account.
