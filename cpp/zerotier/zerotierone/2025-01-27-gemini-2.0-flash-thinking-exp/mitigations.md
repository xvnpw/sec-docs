# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for zerotier/zerotierone

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement ZeroTier Access Control Lists (ACLs)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_zerotier_access_control_lists__acls_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Access ZeroTier Central:** Log in to your ZeroTier Central account (if using ZeroTier Central).
    2.  **Navigate to Network:** Select the specific ZeroTier network you want to secure.
    3.  **Access Flow Rules:** Go to the "Flow Rules" section for the selected network.
    4.  **Define ACL Rules:** Create rules using ZeroTier's flow rule language to specify allowed traffic based on:
        *   **Source and Destination Members:** Use member IDs or tags to control access between specific devices or groups.
        *   **IP Addresses and Networks:** Restrict access based on source and destination IP addresses or CIDR ranges within the ZeroTier network.
        *   **Ports and Protocols:**  Specify allowed ports (e.g., 80, 443, 22) and protocols (e.g., TCP, UDP, ICMP).
        *   **Example Rule (Allow SSH from Dev Team to Production Servers):** `accept ip protocol tcp and destination port 22 and source tag dev_team and destination tag production_servers;`
    5.  **Test and Deploy Rules:** Thoroughly test your ACL rules in a staging environment before deploying them to production. Monitor rule effectiveness and adjust as needed.
    6.  **Regularly Review and Update:** Schedule periodic reviews of ACL rules to ensure they remain aligned with application requirements and security policies.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Network Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized devices or users from connecting to the ZeroTier network and accessing resources.
        *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of an attacker who has compromised one device to move laterally within the ZeroTier network to other systems.
        *   **Data Exfiltration (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data exfiltration by restricting network access to authorized parties and services.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Network Access:** High Reduction
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium Reduction
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic network access control is in place using ZeroTier Central, but granular ACLs based on application roles and services are not fully defined.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed ACL rules need to be developed and implemented for each ZeroTier network, specifically segmenting development, staging, and production environments and controlling access to individual application components. Rules should be integrated into infrastructure-as-code for automated deployment and management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Network Segmentation within ZeroTier](./mitigation_strategies/network_segmentation_within_zerotier.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create Separate ZeroTier Networks:**  Establish distinct ZeroTier networks for different environments (e.g., `zerotier-dev`, `zerotier-staging`, `zerotier-prod`).
    2.  **Assign Members to Networks:**  Carefully assign ZeroTier members (devices) to the appropriate network based on their function and environment. Development machines to `zerotier-dev`, staging servers to `zerotier-staging`, and production servers to `zerotier-prod`.
    3.  **Configure Network Routes (If Needed):** If cross-environment communication is required (e.g., from staging to production for data migration), configure specific and limited routing rules between networks using ZeroTier's routing capabilities or dedicated gateway devices. Avoid broad network peering.
    4.  **Apply Environment-Specific ACLs:** Implement different ACL policies for each ZeroTier network, reflecting the security requirements of each environment. Production networks should have the most restrictive ACLs.
    5.  **Isolate Sensitive Data:** Ensure sensitive data and critical services are deployed within the most secure and isolated ZeroTier network (e.g., production network).
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Breach Propagation (High Severity):** Limits the impact of a security breach in one environment from spreading to other environments.
        *   **Accidental Exposure (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of accidentally exposing development or staging systems to production traffic or vice versa.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for an attacker who gains access to a less secure environment (e.g., development) to escalate privileges and reach production systems.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Breach Propagation:** High Reduction
        *   **Accidental Exposure:** Medium Reduction
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We currently use a single ZeroTier network for all environments.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  We need to create separate ZeroTier networks for development, staging, and production.  Migration of existing members to segmented networks is required.  Routing rules for necessary cross-environment communication need to be defined and implemented securely.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update ZeroTier Client Software](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_zerotier_client_software.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Update Policy:** Define a policy for regularly updating ZeroTier client software on all systems. Aim for updates within a reasonable timeframe after new stable releases are available (e.g., within one week).
    2.  **Monitor ZeroTier Releases:** Subscribe to ZeroTier's release announcements (e.g., GitHub releases, mailing lists) to be notified of new versions and security advisories.
    3.  **Automate Updates (Recommended):** Implement automated update mechanisms using system package managers (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `brew`) or configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to ensure timely and consistent updates across all endpoints.
    4.  **Test Updates:** Before widespread deployment, test ZeroTier client updates in a staging or testing environment to verify compatibility and functionality with your application.
    5.  **Fallback Plan:** Have a rollback plan in case an update introduces unforeseen issues. This might involve keeping older client versions readily available for temporary downgrade if necessary.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Patches known security vulnerabilities in the ZeroTier client software, preventing attackers from exploiting them.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Addresses potential DoS vulnerabilities in older client versions that could be exploited to disrupt network connectivity.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** High Reduction
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We manually update ZeroTier clients on servers when notified of new releases, but this process is not automated and can be delayed. Developer workstations are updated less consistently.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated update mechanisms for ZeroTier clients need to be implemented across all servers and developer workstations.  A centralized update management system or integration with existing configuration management tools is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Passwords and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for ZeroTier Central Accounts](./mitigation_strategies/strong_passwords_and_multi-factor_authentication__mfa__for_zerotier_central_accounts.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enforce Strong Passwords:** Implement a strong password policy for all ZeroTier Central user accounts. This includes:
        *   Minimum password length (e.g., 12+ characters).
        *   Complexity requirements (e.g., mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
        *   Password history to prevent reuse.
        *   Regular password rotation reminders.
    2.  **Mandate Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable and enforce MFA for all ZeroTier Central user accounts, especially administrator accounts.
        *   **Choose MFA Method:** Select a suitable MFA method (e.g., authenticator app, hardware security key, SMS-based OTP - prioritize more secure methods over SMS).
        *   **User Enrollment:** Guide users through the MFA enrollment process and provide support.
        *   **Recovery Procedures:** Establish secure recovery procedures for users who lose access to their MFA devices.
    3.  **Account Lockout Policy:** Implement an account lockout policy to prevent brute-force password attacks against ZeroTier Central accounts.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to ZeroTier Central (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized individuals from gaining access to ZeroTier Central and managing the network.
        *   **Account Takeover (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of account takeover through password guessing, phishing, or credential stuffing attacks.
        *   **Malicious Network Configuration Changes (High Severity):** Protects against unauthorized modifications to ZeroTier network configurations that could compromise security.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to ZeroTier Central:** High Reduction
        *   **Account Takeover:** High Reduction
        *   **Malicious Network Configuration Changes:** High Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Strong password policies are encouraged but not strictly enforced. MFA is available but not mandated for all users, especially administrator accounts.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Enforce strong password policies for all ZeroTier Central accounts. Mandate MFA for all users, particularly administrators. Implement account lockout policies. Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for ZeroTier Central User Roles](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_zerotier_central_user_roles.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review User Roles:** Examine the available user roles in ZeroTier Central (e.g., Owner, Admin, Member, Billing).
    2.  **Define Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Map user roles to specific responsibilities and access requirements within ZeroTier Central.
    3.  **Assign Least Privilege Roles:** Assign users the least privileged role necessary for them to perform their tasks. Avoid granting broad administrative privileges unless absolutely required.
    4.  **Regularly Review User Permissions:** Periodically review user roles and permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with current responsibilities. Revoke access when users change roles or leave the organization.
    5.  **Audit User Activity:** Monitor ZeroTier Central audit logs to track user actions and identify any potential unauthorized or inappropriate access.
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Reduces the potential for malicious actions or accidental errors by internal users with overly broad permissions.
        *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact of accidental misconfigurations by users with limited privileges.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for an attacker who compromises a user account with limited privileges to escalate privileges and gain broader control.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Insider Threats:** Medium Reduction
        *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Medium Reduction
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have different user roles in ZeroTier Central, but a formal RBAC policy and regular review process are not fully established.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Develop and document a formal RBAC policy for ZeroTier Central.  Implement a process for regularly reviewing user roles and permissions.  Conduct an audit of current user assignments and adjust roles to adhere to the principle of least privilege.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Application Binding to ZeroTier Interface](./mitigation_strategies/application_binding_to_zerotier_interface.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify ZeroTier Interface:** Determine the name of the ZeroTier network interface on your application servers (e.g., `zt0`, `eth1` if renamed).
    2.  **Configure Application Binding:** Modify your application's configuration to explicitly bind network services to the ZeroTier interface IP address or interface name.
        *   **Configuration Files:**  Edit application configuration files (e.g., web server configs, database configs) to specify the binding address.
        *   **Command-Line Arguments:** If applicable, use command-line arguments to specify the binding interface or address when starting the application.
        *   **Code-Level Binding:** In application code, ensure network listeners are created to bind to the ZeroTier interface.
    3.  **Verify Binding:** After configuration, verify that the application is indeed listening only on the ZeroTier interface and not on public interfaces (e.g., using `netstat`, `ss`, or application-specific monitoring tools).
    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Accidental Public Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents application services intended for internal ZeroTier network access from being accidentally exposed to the public internet.
        *   **Direct Internet Attacks (High Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by limiting the application's exposure to direct attacks from the public internet.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Accidental Public Exposure:** High Reduction
        *   **Direct Internet Attacks:** High Reduction
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Some applications are configured to bind to specific interfaces, but this is not consistently enforced across all applications using ZeroTier.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Standardize application binding to the ZeroTier interface across all applications.  Develop configuration templates and deployment scripts that automatically enforce binding to the ZeroTier interface.  Regularly audit application configurations to ensure correct binding.
