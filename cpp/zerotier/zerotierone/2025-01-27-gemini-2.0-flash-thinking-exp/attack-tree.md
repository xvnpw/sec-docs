## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit ZeroTier Software Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_zerotier_software_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) in zerotier-one:**
        *   Exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities in `zerotier-one` client through crafted network packets or API calls.
        *   Exploiting input validation flaws in `zerotier-one` client to inject and execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Privilege Escalation in zerotier-one:**
        *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in `zerotier-one` client to gain elevated privileges on the host system.
        *   Leveraging vulnerabilities in setuid binaries or service configurations of `zerotier-one`.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit ZeroTier Network Controller Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_zerotier_network_controller_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to ZeroTier Network Controller:**
        *   **Exploit authentication/authorization flaws:** Bypassing authentication mechanisms or exploiting authorization vulnerabilities in the Network Controller web interface or API.
        *   **Compromise administrator credentials:** Phishing, brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, or exploiting password reset vulnerabilities to gain administrator access.
        *   **Exploit vulnerabilities in Network Controller software (RCE, etc.):** Exploiting web application vulnerabilities (like SQL injection, cross-site scripting, command injection) or software vulnerabilities in the Network Controller itself to gain remote code execution.
    *   **Manipulate ZeroTier Network Configuration via Controller Compromise:**
        *   Once the Network Controller is compromised, attackers can modify network settings to:
            *   Add malicious nodes to the network.
            *   Alter routing rules to intercept traffic.
            *   Disable security features like access controls.
            *   Create backdoors for persistent access.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit ZeroTier Network Misconfiguration [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_zerotier_network_misconfiguration__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Weak or Default Network Configuration:**
        *   **Overly permissive access controls:** ZeroTier network configured with broad access rules, allowing unauthorized nodes to connect to sensitive services.
    *   **Unauthorized Node Joining ZeroTier Network:**
        *   **Network ID is leaked or discovered:** Network ID is unintentionally exposed (e.g., in public code repositories, documentation, or through social engineering), allowing attackers to discover and attempt to join the network.
        *   **Network access control is not properly enforced:** Membership authorization is disabled or easily bypassed, allowing any node with the Network ID to join without approval.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack within ZeroTier Network (via compromised node):**
        *   **Compromise a node within the ZeroTier network:** Attackers compromise any device already connected to the ZeroTier network through various endpoint compromise methods (malware, exploits, social engineering).
        *   **Use compromised node for MitM:** The compromised node is then used to intercept and potentially manipulate traffic within the ZeroTier network, targeting communications destined for the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Data Exfiltration via ZeroTier Network [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__data_exfiltration_via_zerotier_network__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Use ZeroTier as a covert channel:** After gaining access to the application or a node within the ZeroTier network, attackers utilize the established ZeroTier connection as an encrypted tunnel to exfiltrate sensitive data, bypassing traditional network perimeter security.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Lateral Movement within ZeroTier Network [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__lateral_movement_within_zerotier_network__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Pivot from compromised node:** Attackers compromise one less-secured node within the ZeroTier network (e.g., a user's workstation or a less critical server).
    *   **Lateral movement using ZeroTier connectivity:** Leveraging the ZeroTier network connectivity from the compromised node, attackers pivot to attack other more valuable targets within the same ZeroTier network, such as the application server itself or other sensitive systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Social Engineering & External Attacks Leveraging ZeroTier [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__social_engineering_&_external_attacks_leveraging_zerotier__high_risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    *   **Phishing/Social Engineering to Obtain ZeroTier Credentials:**
        *   Targeting application users or administrators with phishing emails, malicious links, or social engineering tactics to trick them into revealing ZeroTier Network IDs, API keys, or other credentials required to access the ZeroTier network.
    *   **Compromise Endpoints Connected to ZeroTier Network:**
        *   **Compromise user devices:** Attackers compromise user laptops, desktops, or mobile devices that are connected to the ZeroTier network through traditional endpoint compromise methods (malware, drive-by downloads, exploits).
        *   **Leverage compromised endpoint's ZeroTier connection:** Once an endpoint is compromised, attackers use its existing ZeroTier connection to gain access to the ZeroTier network and subsequently target the application or other resources within that network.
