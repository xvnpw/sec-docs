# Threat Model Analysis for zerotier/zerotierone

## Threat: [ZeroTier Network Key Compromise](./threats/zerotier_network_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the private network key for the ZeroTier network. This could be through social engineering, insider threat, or security vulnerabilities in key storage or distribution mechanisms. With the key, the attacker can join the ZeroTier network as an unauthorized device.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the ZeroTier network. Potential for eavesdropping, data manipulation, and denial of service attacks from within the network.
*   **ZeroTier One Component Affected:** ZeroTier Network Controller (my.zerotier.com or self-hosted), Key Management System (external to ZeroTier but crucial for its security).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure key management practices: use strong access controls, encryption at rest for keys, and secure key distribution methods.
    *   Regularly rotate network keys.
    *   Monitor network membership for unauthorized devices joining the network.
    *   Consider using ZeroTier's managed routes and access control lists to further restrict access even if unauthorized devices join.

## Threat: [Network Controller Compromise (my.zerotier.com or Self-Hosted)](./threats/network_controller_compromise__my_zerotier_com_or_self-hosted_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the ZeroTier network controller (either the hosted my.zerotier.com service or a self-hosted controller instance). This could be through vulnerabilities in the controller software, compromised credentials, or insider threats. A compromised controller allows the attacker to manipulate network configurations, routing rules, and access controls for the entire ZeroTier network.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the ZeroTier network. Potential for unauthorized access, data redirection, denial of service, and network partitioning.  Severe disruption to applications relying on the network.
*   **ZeroTier One Component Affected:** ZeroTier Network Controller (control plane, management interface, routing engine, access control modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   For self-hosted controllers: Harden the controller infrastructure, keep software updated, implement strong access controls, and regularly audit security configurations.
    *   For my.zerotier.com: Rely on ZeroTier's security practices, use strong account credentials, enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for controller access.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity on the controller.
    *   Regularly back up controller configurations to facilitate recovery in case of compromise.

## Threat: [ZeroTier Client Compromise - Network Traffic Exposure](./threats/zerotier_client_compromise_-_network_traffic_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a device running a ZeroTier client (e.g., through malware, exploit). The attacker can then intercept and potentially decrypt network traffic passing through the compromised client within the ZeroTier network. This could involve passively monitoring traffic or actively capturing and analyzing it.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach of sensitive data transmitted over the ZeroTier network. Potential exposure of application secrets, user data, or business-critical information.
*   **ZeroTier One Component Affected:** ZeroTier Client application, specifically the network interface and encryption/decryption modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong endpoint security measures on devices running ZeroTier clients (antivirus, EDR, firewalls, regular patching).
    *   Employ application-level encryption in addition to ZeroTier's encryption for highly sensitive data (defense in depth).
    *   Regularly monitor ZeroTier client devices for suspicious activity.
    *   Implement network segmentation within the ZeroTier network to limit the impact of a single client compromise.

## Threat: [ZeroTier Client Compromise - Data Manipulation](./threats/zerotier_client_compromise_-_data_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a ZeroTier client.  Beyond eavesdropping, the attacker can actively inject malicious packets or modify data in transit within the ZeroTier network originating from or destined to the compromised client. This could involve packet injection, modification of packet payloads, or replay attacks.
*   **Impact:** Integrity compromise of data transmitted over the ZeroTier network. Potential for data corruption, application malfunction, or malicious code injection into other systems within the network.
*   **ZeroTier One Component Affected:** ZeroTier Client application, specifically the network interface, packet processing, and encryption/decryption modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong endpoint security measures on ZeroTier client devices.
    *   Use cryptographic signatures or message authentication codes (MACs) at the application level to verify data integrity end-to-end, independent of ZeroTier's encryption.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization within the application to mitigate the impact of potentially manipulated data.
    *   Network intrusion detection systems (NIDS) within the ZeroTier network could help detect malicious traffic patterns.

## Threat: [DoS Attacks Against ZeroTier Network Controller](./threats/dos_attacks_against_zerotier_network_controller.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets the ZeroTier network controller with a DoS attack. This could involve overwhelming the controller with management requests, exploiting vulnerabilities to cause crashes, or resource exhaustion attacks.
*   **Impact:** Disruption of network management functions, potentially leading to network instability, inability to manage network configurations, and potentially network unavailability for all connected clients.
*   **ZeroTier One Component Affected:** ZeroTier Network Controller (control plane, management interface, request processing modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   For self-hosted controllers: Implement robust infrastructure security measures, rate limiting, and traffic filtering. Use a CDN or DDoS protection service if the controller is publicly accessible.
    *   For my.zerotier.com: Rely on ZeroTier's infrastructure resilience and DDoS protection measures.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for controller performance and availability.

## Threat: [Stolen or Compromised ZeroTier Identities/Keys](./threats/stolen_or_compromised_zerotier_identitieskeys.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker steals or compromises ZeroTier device identities or authentication keys. This could be through phishing, social engineering, insider threats, or vulnerabilities in key storage. With compromised identities, unauthorized devices can join the ZeroTier network.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized devices gaining access to the ZeroTier network. Potential for eavesdropping, data manipulation, and unauthorized access to application resources.
*   **ZeroTier One Component Affected:** ZeroTier Client application, Identity Management (external key storage and distribution).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure device identity and key management practices.
    *   Use strong authentication mechanisms for device enrollment and network access.
    *   Regularly review and revoke unused or compromised device identities.
    *   Implement device attestation or health checks to verify device integrity before granting network access.
