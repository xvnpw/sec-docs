# Threat Model Analysis for sqlcipher/sqlcipher

## Threat: [Weak Key Derivation Function (KDF)](./threats/weak_key_derivation_function__kdf_.md)

*   **Description:** If using a passphrase to derive the encryption key, a weak KDF within SQLCipher (e.g., using the default without explicit configuration) makes the key susceptible to brute-force or dictionary attacks. An attacker can try numerous passphrase combinations offline to derive the correct encryption key.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of database confidentiality if the passphrase is weak or easily guessed.
    *   **Affected Component:** KDF implementation within SQLCipher (e.g., when using `PRAGMA key = 'your_password'` without further configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Explicitly configure SQLCipher to use strong KDF algorithms like PBKDF2 or scrypt with a high number of iterations and a unique, randomly generated salt using `PRAGMA kdf_iter` and `PRAGMA cipher_salt`.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in SQLCipher Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_sqlcipher_library.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities might exist within the SQLCipher library itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to bypass encryption or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially complete compromise of database confidentiality and integrity.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any part of the SQLCipher library code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the SQLCipher library updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to SQLCipher and apply patches promptly.

## Threat: [Side-Channel Attacks (Timing Attacks)](./threats/side-channel_attacks__timing_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might try to infer information about the encryption key or the database contents by analyzing the time it takes for certain SQLCipher operations to complete. Variations in execution time due to cryptographic operations could leak subtle information.
    *   **Impact:** Potential partial disclosure of information about the key or data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core encryption algorithms within SQLCipher.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   This is difficult to fully mitigate at the application level. Be aware of this potential vulnerability and consider its relevance in your specific threat model. Employ constant-time algorithms where feasible within the application logic interacting with SQLCipher.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of Decrypted Data in Memory (Directly related to SQLCipher)](./threats/improper_handling_of_decrypted_data_in_memory__directly_related_to_sqlcipher_.md)

*   **Description:** After SQLCipher decrypts data, this decrypted data resides in memory. If SQLCipher's internal memory management or the application's handling of data retrieved from SQLCipher is flawed, an attacker gaining access to the application's memory could potentially read the decrypted sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Memory management within SQLCipher and the application's interaction with SQLCipher's API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the time decrypted data is held in memory after retrieval from SQLCipher.
        *   Overwrite sensitive data in memory when it is no longer needed. Utilize secure memory allocation and deallocation practices.
