## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application Data Protected by SQLCipher](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_data_protected_by_sqlcipher.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to or modifying the sensitive data stored within the SQLCipher encrypted database.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Key Management Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_key_management_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on compromising the encryption key itself. If the attacker can obtain the key, they can decrypt the database regardless of SQLCipher's encryption strength. This is a critical area as the key is the primary protection mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Recover Encryption Key](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__recover_encryption_key.md)

This node represents the successful acquisition of the encryption key by the attacker. Achieving this bypasses the need to break the encryption algorithm itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Recover from Storage](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__recover_from_storage.md)

Attackers target locations where the encryption key might be stored persistently.
        * This includes configuration files, environment variables, or even the file system itself.
        * If the key is stored without adequate protection (e.g., in plaintext or weakly encrypted), it becomes a high-risk path for compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Recover from User Input [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__recover_from_user_input__critical_node_.md)

If the encryption key is derived from user input (like a passphrase), this becomes a significant attack vector.
        * Weak passphrase policies or vulnerabilities in how the passphrase is handled make this a high-risk path.
        * This node is critical because it's the point where the attacker attempts to obtain the key directly from the user or their actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Keylogging](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__keylogging.md)

Attackers install malware or use hardware devices to record keystrokes, aiming to capture the passphrase used to derive the encryption key.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Social Engineering](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__social_engineering.md)

Attackers manipulate users into revealing their passphrase through deception or trickery.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Brute-force/Dictionary](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__brute-forcedictionary.md)

Attackers attempt to guess the passphrase by trying a large number of possibilities, either systematically (brute-force) or by using a list of common passwords (dictionary attack).

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit SQLCipher Implementation Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_sqlcipher_implementation_weaknesses.md)

This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities or flaws in how SQLCipher is implemented or used.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_known_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Attackers research and exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of SQLCipher being used by the application.
    * This node is critical because a successful exploit can directly bypass the encryption or grant unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Improper Usage](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_improper_usage.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application developers have integrated and used SQLCipher.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] SQL Injection on Key Data](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__sql_injection_on_key_data.md)

If user-supplied data is used in the process of deriving the encryption key without proper sanitization, attackers might inject malicious SQL code.
    * This could potentially influence the derived key or even expose it.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Expose Unencrypted Data](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__expose_unencrypted_data.md)

Even with an encrypted database, applications might inadvertently store or transmit sensitive data in an unencrypted form in other locations.
    * This could include backups, logs, temporary files, or network traffic. While not directly breaking SQLCipher, it exposes sensitive information.
