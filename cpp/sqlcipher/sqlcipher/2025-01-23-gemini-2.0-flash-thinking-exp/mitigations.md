# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sqlcipher/sqlcipher

## Mitigation Strategy: [`PRAGMA key` Usage Immediately After Connection](./mitigation_strategies/_pragma_key__usage_immediately_after_connection.md)

**Description:**
1.  When opening a connection to a SQLCipher database, the very first operation *must* be executing the `PRAGMA key = 'your_key';` statement.
2.  This statement provides the encryption key to SQLCipher and enables encryption/decryption for all subsequent database operations within that connection.
3.  Developers should ensure this `PRAGMA key` statement is placed right after the database connection is established in their code.
4.  Code reviews and testing should specifically verify that this practice is consistently followed across all database access points in the application.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unencrypted Database Operations (High Severity):** If the `PRAGMA key` statement is omitted or executed after other database operations, those initial operations will be performed on an unencrypted database. This can lead to sensitive data being written to disk in plain text.
*   **Data Leakage due to Unencrypted Data (High Severity):**  Storing unencrypted data, even unintentionally, defeats the purpose of using SQLCipher and creates a significant vulnerability for data leakage if the storage medium is compromised.

**Impact:**
*   **Significant Risk Reduction:**  Ensuring immediate `PRAGMA key` usage guarantees that SQLCipher encryption is active from the very beginning of the database session, preventing accidental storage of unencrypted data and protecting data at rest as intended.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **Yes:** Codebase generally follows the practice of setting the `PRAGMA key` immediately after connection in database access modules.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **Automated Checks:**  While generally followed, there are no automated checks (like linting or static analysis rules) specifically to verify that `PRAGMA key` is *always* the first operation after opening a SQLCipher connection. Implementing such checks would further strengthen this mitigation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize `PRAGMA cipher_page_size = size;` Appropriately](./mitigation_strategies/utilize__pragma_cipher_page_size_=_size;__appropriately.md)

**Description:**
1.  SQLCipher allows configuring the database page size using `PRAGMA cipher_page_size = size;`.
2.  While the default page size is often suitable, developers should understand the implications of page size on performance and potentially security (though security impact is usually minimal and more performance-related).
3.  If performance testing indicates benefits from adjusting the page size, consider using `PRAGMA cipher_page_size` to optimize.
4.  Document the chosen page size and the rationale behind it.
5.  *Note:* Changing the page size of an *existing* encrypted database is complex and generally not recommended. Page size is typically set when the database is *created*.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Performance Bottlenecks due to Default Page Size (Low to Medium Severity - Indirect Security Impact):** In specific scenarios, the default page size might lead to performance bottlenecks. While not a direct security threat, poor performance can indirectly lead developers to bypass security measures in favor of speed.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Performance Related (Low to Medium Severity - Indirect Security Impact):**  Extreme performance issues due to suboptimal page size could potentially be exploited to cause a denial of service.

**Impact:**
*   **Minor Risk Reduction (Indirect):**  Optimizing page size can improve performance, indirectly reducing the temptation to compromise security for speed. It primarily addresses performance and stability.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **No:** The application currently uses the default SQLCipher page size.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **Performance Profiling and Tuning:**  Conduct performance profiling of database operations under realistic load to determine if adjusting `cipher_page_size` would offer significant performance improvements. If so, implement and document the change.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize `PRAGMA kdf_iter = iterations;` for Stronger Key Derivation](./mitigation_strategies/utilize__pragma_kdf_iter_=_iterations;__for_stronger_key_derivation.md)

**Description:**
1.  SQLCipher uses a Key Derivation Function (KDF) to derive the encryption key from the provided passphrase (if a passphrase is used instead of a raw key).
2.  The `PRAGMA kdf_iter = iterations;` command allows increasing the number of iterations used in the KDF.
3.  Increasing the iteration count makes brute-force attacks against passphrase-protected databases significantly slower, as each password guess takes longer to verify.
4.  Developers should consider increasing the `kdf_iter` value to enhance security, especially if passphrases are used and performance impact is acceptable.
5.  Balance the iteration count with performance considerations, as higher iterations increase CPU usage during database opening.
6.  Set `PRAGMA kdf_iter` *before* setting the `PRAGMA key` when creating or re-keying a database.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Brute-Force Attacks Against Passphrase (Medium to High Severity):**  If a weak passphrase is used or if an attacker obtains a copy of the SQLCipher database, a brute-force attack to guess the passphrase becomes a viable threat. Increasing KDF iterations significantly increases the cost of such attacks.
*   **Dictionary Attacks Against Passphrase (Medium to High Severity):** Similar to brute-force, dictionary attacks become less effective with higher KDF iterations as each dictionary word takes longer to test.

**Impact:**
*   **Moderate to Significant Risk Reduction (for passphrase-based keys):** Increasing `kdf_iter` provides a significant security boost against brute-force and dictionary attacks targeting passphrases, making it much harder for attackers to derive the encryption key from a compromised database file and a guessed passphrase.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **No:** The application currently uses the default SQLCipher KDF iteration count.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **KDF Iteration Tuning:**  Evaluate the performance impact of increasing `kdf_iter` to a higher value (e.g., 64000 or more, as recommended in some security guidelines). If performance is acceptable, implement setting `PRAGMA kdf_iter` to a stronger value when creating or re-keying SQLCipher databases. Document the chosen iteration count and the rationale.
