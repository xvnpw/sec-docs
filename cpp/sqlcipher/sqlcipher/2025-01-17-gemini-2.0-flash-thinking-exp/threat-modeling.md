# Threat Model Analysis for sqlcipher/sqlcipher

## Threat: [Weak Master Key/Password](./threats/weak_master_keypassword.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might use brute-force techniques or dictionary attacks against a weak master password to recover the encryption key used by SQLCipher. They could then use this key to directly decrypt the database file.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database confidentiality. Sensitive data stored within the SQLCipher database is exposed, potentially leading to significant financial loss, reputational damage, legal repercussions, and privacy violations.
*   **Affected Component:** SQLCipher's key derivation function (e.g., the implementation of `PRAGMA key` and the underlying cryptographic primitives).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies for the SQLCipher master key, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and discouraging the use of common words or patterns.
    *   Utilize a strong Key Derivation Function (KDF) with a high iteration count. Configure SQLCipher using `PRAGMA kdf_iter = <number>` with a sufficiently large number (tens or hundreds of thousands).

## Threat: [Insufficient Key Derivation Function (KDF)](./threats/insufficient_key_derivation_function__kdf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might exploit weaknesses in the Key Derivation Function (KDF) used by SQLCipher, or if the KDF is configured with a low iteration count, to perform pre-computation attacks or rainbow table attacks. This significantly reduces the time required to crack the master password.
*   **Impact:** Increased vulnerability to brute-force attacks against the SQLCipher master password. While not an immediate compromise, it makes it significantly easier for attackers to recover the key and decrypt the database.
*   **Affected Component:** SQLCipher's key derivation implementation and configuration (`PRAGMA kdf_iter`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure SQLCipher is configured to use a strong and well-vetted KDF (SQLCipher uses PBKDF2 by default, which is generally strong).
    *   Set a sufficiently high iteration count for the KDF using `PRAGMA kdf_iter`. The recommended value depends on the available computing resources but should be in the tens or hundreds of thousands.

## Threat: [Implementation Flaws in SQLCipher](./threats/implementation_flaws_in_sqlcipher.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered vulnerabilities or bugs within the SQLCipher library itself could potentially be exploited to bypass the encryption mechanisms or leak data directly from the encrypted database.
*   **Impact:** Potential complete compromise of database confidentiality or integrity, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. This could allow attackers to decrypt the database without knowing the key or manipulate the encrypted data.
*   **Affected Component:** The core SQLCipher library code, including its encryption and decryption routines.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be critical if a major flaw is found)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with the latest stable releases of SQLCipher to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to SQLCipher.
    *   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools on the SQLCipher library itself (though this is generally the responsibility of the SQLCipher developers).

## Threat: [Downgrade Attacks](./threats/downgrade_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to manipulate the application or the SQLCipher library (if the application bundles it) to force the use of a weaker encryption algorithm or cipher mode supported by SQLCipher that is known to be vulnerable or easier to break.
*   **Impact:** Reduced security of the database, making it more susceptible to decryption attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** SQLCipher's encryption algorithm negotiation or configuration (though SQLCipher has limited algorithm choices, vulnerabilities could exist in how these are handled).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the application explicitly configures SQLCipher to use the strongest available and recommended encryption settings.
    *   Regularly update the SQLCipher library to benefit from security patches and the latest recommended configurations that might address downgrade attack vectors.
    *   Implement integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications to the SQLCipher library files if they are bundled with the application.
