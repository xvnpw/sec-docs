# Attack Surface Analysis for sqlcipher/sqlcipher

## Attack Surface: [Weak Password/Key Derivation](./attack_surfaces/weak_passwordkey_derivation.md)

*   **Description**: The application uses a weak or easily guessable password to encrypt the database, or the key derivation function is insufficient, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.
*   **How SQLCipher Contributes**: SQLCipher's security relies heavily on the strength of the provided password. A weak password directly undermines the encryption.
*   **Example**: An application uses the password "password123" to encrypt the database. An attacker can easily crack this password using common password lists or brute-force tools.
*   **Impact**: Complete compromise of the database contents, leading to unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data.
*   **Risk Severity**: Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Enforce strong password policies for users or require the application to generate strong, random keys.
    *   Use a robust key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2, scrypt, or Argon2 with a high number of iterations and a strong salt.
    *   Avoid using default or easily guessable passwords in examples or documentation.

## Attack Surface: [Hardcoded Passwords/Keys](./attack_surfaces/hardcoded_passwordskeys.md)

*   **Description**: The encryption password or key is directly embedded within the application's source code or configuration files.
*   **How SQLCipher Contributes**: SQLCipher requires a password to operate. Hardcoding this password makes it readily available to anyone who can access the application's codebase.
*   **Example**: The SQLCipher password is defined as a string literal in the application's source code: `NSString *dbPassword = @"MySecretPassword";`. An attacker who decompiles or reverse engineers the application can easily find this password.
*   **Impact**: Complete compromise of the database contents.
*   **Risk Severity**: Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Never hardcode passwords or keys directly in the code.
    *   Utilize secure configuration management techniques, environment variables, or dedicated secrets management solutions to store and retrieve encryption keys.
    *   Encrypt configuration files containing sensitive information.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Password Storage (for Key Derivation)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_password_storage__for_key_derivation_.md)

*   **Description**: If the application prompts the user for a password to encrypt the database, and stores this password insecurely (e.g., in plain text or with weak hashing), attackers can retrieve it and use it to decrypt the database.
*   **How SQLCipher Contributes**: While SQLCipher encrypts the database, the security is tied to the user-provided password. Insecure storage of this password bypasses the database encryption.
*   **Example**: An application stores the user's database password in a simple text file. An attacker gaining access to the file system can read the password and decrypt the database.
*   **Impact**: Complete compromise of the database contents.
*   **Risk Severity**: Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Avoid storing the user's encryption password if possible.
    *   If the password must be stored, use strong, salted hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2) with a high work factor.
    *   Consider using key derivation from user credentials without storing the raw password.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Cryptographic Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_cryptographic_libraries.md)

*   **Description**: SQLCipher relies on underlying cryptographic libraries like OpenSSL. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can directly impact the security of SQLCipher-encrypted databases.
*   **How SQLCipher Contributes**: SQLCipher's encryption algorithms are implemented by these external libraries. Any flaws in these libraries directly affect SQLCipher's security.
*   **Example**: A critical vulnerability is discovered in the version of OpenSSL used by SQLCipher. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to bypass the encryption and access the database.
*   **Impact**: Potential compromise of the database contents, depending on the nature of the underlying vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity**: High
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Regularly update SQLCipher and its underlying cryptographic libraries to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories for the cryptographic libraries used by SQLCipher.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Temporary File Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_temporary_file_handling.md)

*   **Description**: SQLCipher might create temporary files during operations. If these files are not handled securely (e.g., not deleted properly, stored with weak permissions), they could potentially expose sensitive data.
*   **How SQLCipher Contributes**: SQLCipher's internal operations might involve temporary storage of decrypted or intermediate data. Insecure handling of these files can leak information.
*   **Example**: SQLCipher creates a temporary file containing decrypted data during a complex query. This file is not securely deleted and remains accessible on the file system.
*   **Impact**: Potential exposure of sensitive data if temporary files are compromised.
*   **Risk Severity**: High
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Ensure that temporary files created by SQLCipher are securely handled and deleted promptly after use.
    *   Configure the operating system to securely manage temporary files.
    *   Review SQLCipher's documentation for any specific recommendations on temporary file handling.
