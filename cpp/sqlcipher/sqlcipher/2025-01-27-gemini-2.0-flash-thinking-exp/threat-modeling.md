# Threat Model Analysis for sqlcipher/sqlcipher

## Threat: [Weak Key Generation](./threats/weak_key_generation.md)

An attacker could attempt to brute-force or cryptanalyze a database encrypted with a weakly generated key. This could involve using dictionary attacks, rainbow tables, or other cryptanalytic techniques if the key lacks sufficient entropy or is predictable.

## Threat: [Insecure Key Storage](./threats/insecure_key_storage.md)

An attacker who gains access to the system (e.g., through malware, physical access, or network intrusion) could easily retrieve the encryption key if it is stored in plaintext or in an easily accessible location. This could include files on disk, within application code, or in easily decrypted configuration files.

## Threat: [Key Transportation Vulnerabilities](./threats/key_transportation_vulnerabilities.md)

If the encryption key needs to be transmitted across a network or between systems, an attacker could intercept the key if insecure channels are used. This could happen during initial key setup or key rotation processes.

## Threat: [Accidental Unencrypted Database Fallback](./threats/accidental_unencrypted_database_fallback.md)

Due to configuration errors or deployment issues, the application might inadvertently connect to and use an unencrypted SQLite database instead of the intended SQLCipher encrypted database. This is especially a risk if development and production environments are not carefully managed.
