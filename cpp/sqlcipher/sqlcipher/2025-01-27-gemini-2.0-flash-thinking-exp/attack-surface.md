# Attack Surface Analysis for sqlcipher/sqlcipher

## Attack Surface: [Weak Key Derivation](./attack_surfaces/weak_key_derivation.md)

*   **Description:**  Using weak or improperly configured key derivation functions makes it easier for attackers to brute-force the encryption key if they obtain the encrypted database file.
*   **SQLCipher Contribution:** SQLCipher relies on key derivation functions (like PBKDF2) to generate the encryption key. Weak configuration directly undermines SQLCipher's security.
*   **Example:** An application uses SQLCipher with default PBKDF2 settings (low iteration count) and a weak user password. An attacker obtains the encrypted database file and performs an offline brute-force attack on the password, successfully recovering the encryption key and decrypting the database.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database confidentiality. All encrypted data becomes accessible to the attacker.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use strong key derivation functions like PBKDF2, Argon2, or scrypt.
    *   Significantly increase the iteration count for key derivation functions.
    *   Use strong, randomly generated salts unique for each database.
    *   Enforce strong password policies if password-based encryption is used.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Key Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_key_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Storing the encryption key (or password used to derive it) insecurely makes it easily accessible to attackers, bypassing the encryption entirely.
*   **SQLCipher Contribution:** SQLCipher's security is entirely dependent on the secrecy of the encryption key. Insecure storage directly negates SQLCipher's protection.
*   **Example:** An application hardcodes the SQLCipher encryption password directly into the source code or stores it in a plaintext configuration file. An attacker decompiles the application or gains access to the configuration file and retrieves the password, decrypting the database.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of database confidentiality. Trivial access to all encrypted data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never hardcode keys or passwords in application code.
    *   Utilize secure key storage mechanisms provided by the OS/platform (Keychain, Credential Manager, Android Keystore).
    *   Encrypt configuration files if they must store sensitive information.
    *   Use environment variables or secure configuration management to inject keys at runtime.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (OpenSSL or Underlying Crypto Library)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__openssl_or_underlying_crypto_library_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying cryptographic library used by SQLCipher (typically OpenSSL) can directly compromise SQLCipher's security.
*   **SQLCipher Contribution:** SQLCipher relies on external libraries for core cryptographic functions. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact SQLCipher applications.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in the OpenSSL version used by an SQLCipher application. An attacker exploits this OpenSSL vulnerability to bypass encryption or gain access to sensitive data, potentially including decrypted database content.
*   **Impact:** Potential compromise of database confidentiality, integrity, and availability, depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update SQLCipher and its underlying cryptographic libraries to the latest versions.
    *   Implement dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Use supported and maintained versions of SQLCipher and dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect SQLCipher Integration and Misuse](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_sqlcipher_integration_and_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Developers may incorrectly integrate SQLCipher, leading to weakened or ineffective encryption, or bypassing it due to coding errors.
*   **SQLCipher Contribution:** SQLCipher provides APIs that must be used correctly for effective encryption. Misuse directly leads to security vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A developer initializes SQLCipher but forgets to set an encryption key, resulting in an unencrypted database file despite intending to use encryption. Or, application code inadvertently logs decrypted data in plaintext.
*   **Impact:** Potential compromise of database confidentiality due to ineffective or bypassed encryption. Data leaks through application errors.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review SQLCipher documentation and API specifications.
    *   Conduct code reviews to identify integration errors and misuse of SQLCipher APIs.
    *   Perform security testing to verify correct and effective encryption implementation.
    *   Follow best practices and utilize example code from SQLCipher documentation.
    *   Implement unit and integration tests focused on verifying encryption functionality.
