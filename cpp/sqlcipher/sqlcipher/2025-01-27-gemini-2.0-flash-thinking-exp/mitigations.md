# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sqlcipher/sqlcipher

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Key Management for SQLCipher](./mitigation_strategies/robust_key_management_for_sqlcipher.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strong Key Generation for SQLCipher:** Utilize a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) to generate a robust encryption key specifically for SQLCipher.  Ensure the key is of sufficient length (e.g., 256-bit for AES-256) as recommended for SQLCipher.
    2.  **Secure Key Storage for SQLCipher Key:** Choose a secure method to store the SQLCipher encryption key. Options include:
        *   **Key Derivation for SQLCipher:** Derive the SQLCipher key from a user-provided password using a strong Key Derivation Function (KDF) like Argon2id, PBKDF2, or scrypt. Use a unique, randomly generated salt per database for SQLCipher.
        *   **OS Keychains/Keystores for SQLCipher Key:**  Store the generated SQLCipher key in platform-specific secure storage like Keychain (macOS/iOS), Credential Manager (Windows), or KeyStore (Android).
        *   **HSM/Secure Enclave for SQLCipher Key (Advanced):** For highly sensitive data, consider using HSMs or Secure Enclaves to manage and protect the SQLCipher encryption key.
    3.  **SQLCipher Key Handling in Code:** When using the SQLCipher API, ensure the encryption key is passed securely and handled correctly within your application code. Avoid exposing the key in logs or insecure transmissions.
    4.  **Avoid Hardcoding SQLCipher Key:** Never hardcode the SQLCipher encryption key directly in the application source code or configuration files.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Database Compromise due to Stolen Database File (Severity: High) - If the SQLCipher database file is stolen, a weak or easily compromised key allows attackers to decrypt and access sensitive data.
        *   **Threat:** Key Discovery through Code Analysis (Severity: High) - Hardcoded SQLCipher keys are easily discovered by reverse engineering or static analysis of the application code.
        *   **Threat:** Key Compromise due to Insecure Storage (Severity: High) - Storing the SQLCipher key in plain text or easily accessible locations makes it vulnerable to unauthorized access.

    *   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of SQLCipher database compromise by making it computationally infeasible to decrypt the database without the securely managed SQLCipher key.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, Password-Based Key Derivation using PBKDF2 is currently implemented for SQLCipher key generation in the user authentication module. The salt is stored alongside the encrypted database metadata.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Consider migrating to Argon2id for password-based SQLCipher key derivation for improved security. Explore integration with the operating system's KeyStore/Keychain for enhanced SQLCipher key storage security, especially on mobile platforms. HSM/Secure Enclave integration for SQLCipher key management is not currently considered but should be evaluated for future high-security requirements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Password Handling for SQLCipher Key Derivation (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_password_handling_for_sqlcipher_key_derivation__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Strong KDF for SQLCipher Key:** If deriving the SQLCipher key from a password, use a modern and strong Key Derivation Function (KDF) like Argon2id to derive the SQLCipher encryption key. If Argon2id is not feasible, use PBKDF2 or scrypt with appropriate parameters for SQLCipher key derivation.
    2.  **Salt Generation for SQLCipher Key Derivation:** Generate a unique, cryptographically random salt for each SQLCipher database when using password-based key derivation.
    3.  **Salt Storage for SQLCipher Key Derivation:** Store the salt securely alongside the encrypted SQLCipher database metadata.
    4.  **Iteration Count/Memory Cost/Parallelism Tuning for SQLCipher KDF:** Configure the KDF with appropriate parameters (iteration count for PBKDF2, memory cost and parallelism for Argon2id/scrypt) specifically for SQLCipher key derivation. These parameters should be set high enough to make brute-force attacks on the password (to derive the SQLCipher key) computationally expensive.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Threat:** Brute-Force Password Cracking to Obtain SQLCipher Key (Severity: High) - Weak KDFs or low iteration counts make password cracking attacks feasible, allowing attackers to derive the SQLCipher key from a compromised password.
        *   **Threat:** Rainbow Table Attacks on Passwords used for SQLCipher Key Derivation (Severity: Medium) - Using a unique salt for each SQLCipher database prevents the effectiveness of pre-computed rainbow tables for cracking passwords used to derive the SQLCipher key.

    *   **Impact:** Moderately to Significantly reduces the risk of successful password-based key derivation attacks to obtain the SQLCipher key, making it harder for attackers to decrypt the SQLCipher database even if they compromise user passwords.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, PBKDF2 with a randomly generated salt and a configurable iteration count is implemented for SQLCipher key derivation in the user authentication module.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Migrate from PBKDF2 to Argon2id for SQLCipher key derivation for improved resistance against modern attacks. Implement adaptive iteration count adjustment based on server load to maintain performance while maximizing security of SQLCipher key derivation.
