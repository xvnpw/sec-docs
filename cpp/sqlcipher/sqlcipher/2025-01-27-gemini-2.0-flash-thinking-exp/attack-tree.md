## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Data via SQLCipher Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_data_via_sqlcipher_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's ultimate goal is to access or manipulate sensitive data protected by SQLCipher.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Bypassing SQLCipher encryption mechanisms.
    *   Exploiting flaws in the application's implementation and usage of SQLCipher.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass SQLCipher Encryption [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_sqlcipher_encryption__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Circumventing the encryption layer without directly breaking the cryptographic algorithms.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Key Extraction (Insecure Storage) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** Obtaining the encryption key because it is stored insecurely.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Code Review [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Description:**  Analyzing the application's source code to find hardcoded keys or insecure key handling practices.
                *   **Attack Steps:** Examining code repositories, application binaries, and configuration files for exposed keys.
            *   **Memory Dump [CRITICAL]:**
                *   **Description:**  Extracting the key from the application's memory if it is temporarily stored there in plaintext.
                *   **Attack Steps:**  Gaining process access and using memory dumping tools to capture application memory.
    *   **Default/Weak Key Usage [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:** The application uses a default or easily guessable encryption key or passphrase.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Guessing Default Keys:** Trying common default keys documented in application guides or online resources.
            *   **Trying Weak Passphrases:** Attempting common passwords or predictable patterns if a passphrase is used for key derivation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQLCipher Implementation Flaws [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sqlcipher_implementation_flaws__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application uses SQLCipher, rather than breaking SQLCipher itself.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Application Level) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's SQL query construction to bypass application logic and potentially access data within the SQLCipher database.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Crafting Malicious SQL Payloads:** Injecting SQL code into application inputs that are not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in SQLCipher queries.
            *   **Data Exfiltration via SQL Injection:** Using SQL injection techniques to extract data directly from the database, even if it is encrypted at rest.
