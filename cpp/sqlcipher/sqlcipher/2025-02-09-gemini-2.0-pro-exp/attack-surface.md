# Attack Surface Analysis for sqlcipher/sqlcipher

## Attack Surface: [1. Weak Key Derivation](./attack_surfaces/1__weak_key_derivation.md)

**Description:** The process of generating the encryption key from a user-provided password or other secret is vulnerable to attacks if weak parameters or methods are used.
    
    **How SQLCipher Contributes:** SQLCipher *relies* on a key derived from a passphrase (typically via PBKDF2).  The security of the *entire database* depends directly on the strength of this derivation.  SQLCipher provides the mechanism (PBKDF2), but the application controls the parameters (password, salt, iterations).
    
    **Example:** An application uses a short password and a low iteration count (e.g., 1000) for PBKDF2.  An attacker can use a dictionary or brute-force attack to quickly find the password and derive the key.
    
    **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database; all encrypted data is accessible.
    
    **Risk Severity:** Critical
    
    **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
        *   Use a *high* iteration count for PBKDF2 (e.g., 64,000+, balancing security and performance).
        *   Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG) for salts.
        *   Consider a separate, securely stored salt.
        *   Educate users about strong passwords.

## Attack Surface: [2. Insecure Key Storage](./attack_surfaces/2__insecure_key_storage.md)

**Description:** The encryption key is stored in a location or manner accessible to an attacker.
    
    **How SQLCipher Contributes:** SQLCipher *requires* the key to decrypt the database. The application is *entirely responsible* for securely storing this key. SQLCipher itself doesn't dictate *how* the key is stored, only that it *must* be provided.
    
    **Example:** The key is hardcoded in the source code, stored in a plain text file, or saved in a world-readable location.
    
    **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database; all encrypted data is accessible.
    
    **Risk Severity:** Critical
    
    **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never** hardcode the key.
        *   Use platform-specific secure storage:
            *   **Android:** Android Keystore System (hardware-backed if possible).
            *   **iOS:** Keychain Services (with appropriate access controls).
            *   **Windows:** DPAPI or Credential Manager.
            *   **macOS:** Keychain Services.
            *   **Linux:** Secure enclave (if available) or a well-protected secrets manager.
        *   Consider HSMs or secure enclaves.

## Attack Surface: [3. Key Exposure in Memory](./attack_surfaces/3__key_exposure_in_memory.md)

**Description:** The encryption key is vulnerable while in the application's memory.
    
    **How SQLCipher Contributes:** SQLCipher *must* load the key into memory to perform encryption/decryption.  The application's handling of the key in memory is crucial. SQLCipher's operations *necessitate* this in-memory presence.
    
    **Example:** The key remains in memory long after use, or is allocated in a way that allows swapping to disk. A memory dump or exploit could expose it.
    
    **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database.
    
    **Risk Severity:** High
    
    **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Minimize the key's time in memory.
        *   "Zeroize" memory immediately after use.
        *   Use secure memory allocation (if available).
        *   Consider languages/runtimes with strong memory safety.

## Attack Surface: [4. SQLCipher Implementation Bugs](./attack_surfaces/4__sqlcipher_implementation_bugs.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within the SQLCipher library itself.
    
    **How SQLCipher Contributes:** This is *directly* related to SQLCipher; any vulnerability is within the library's code.
    
    **Example:** A buffer overflow in SQLCipher's decryption routine allows arbitrary code execution.
    
    **Impact:** Varies; could range from DoS to complete system compromise.
    
    **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
    
    **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep SQLCipher up-to-date.
        *   Monitor security advisories.
        *   Perform security audits and penetration testing.
        *   Consider fuzz testing SQLCipher.

## Attack Surface: [5. Incorrect SQLCipher API Usage](./attack_surfaces/5__incorrect_sqlcipher_api_usage.md)

**Description:** The application misuses the SQLCipher API, creating security weaknesses.
    
    **How SQLCipher Contributes:** The API is the *sole interface* to SQLCipher; incorrect usage directly impacts security.  This is a direct interaction with SQLCipher's provided functionality.
    
    **Example:** Failure to initialize properly, using deprecated functions, or ignoring error codes related to encryption.
    
    **Impact:** Varies; could range from data corruption to complete compromise.
    
    **Risk Severity:** High
    
    **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly understand the SQLCipher API.
        *   Follow secure coding best practices.
        *   Use static analysis tools.
        *   Conduct code reviews focused on SQLCipher integration.
