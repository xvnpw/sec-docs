## Attack Tree Path: [1. Obtain Encrypted Database File](./attack_tree_paths/1__obtain_encrypted_database_file.md)

*   **1.1 Physical Access:**
    *   **1.1.1 Steal Device (HIGH):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker physically steals the device containing the encrypted database.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *  **1.1.2 Copy from Backup:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker gains access to a backup of the database file, potentially less secured than the primary device.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

*   **1.2 Network Sniffing:**
    *   **1.2.1 Unencrypted Backup/Sync (HIGH):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker intercepts the database file during an unencrypted backup or synchronization process over a network.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (if best practices are followed), High (if not)
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Encryption Key (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_encryption_key__critical_.md)

*    **2.1 Weak Key:**
    *   **2.1.2 Short Key Length:**
        *   **Description:** The encryption key is too short, making it vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

*   **2.2 Key Leakage:**
    *   **2.2.1 Hardcoded Key (CRITICAL, HIGH):**
        *   **Description:** The encryption key is directly embedded within the application's source code or configuration files.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (with good practices), but surprisingly common
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
    *   **2.2.2 Key in Memory (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker extracts the encryption key from the device's memory while the application is running or from a memory dump.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **2.2.6 Key Compromised via Other Vulnerability (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** A vulnerability in another part of the application (e.g., a web server vulnerability, a library vulnerability) is exploited to gain access to the encryption key.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **2.4 Brute-Force Attacks:**
    *   **2.4.1 Dictionary Attack (HIGH):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker uses a list of common passwords or phrases to try and guess the key (if the key is derived from a user-provided password).
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if weak passwords are used)
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Attack SQLCipher Configuration/Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/4__attack_sqlcipher_configurationimplementation.md)

*   **4.1 Incorrect KDF Iterations (CRITICAL, HIGH):**
    *   **Description:** The key derivation function (KDF) is configured with too few iterations, making it easier to brute-force the key.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

    *   **4.1.1 Default/Low Iterations (CRITICAL, HIGH):**
        *   **Description:** Specifically, the application uses the default (potentially low) number of KDF iterations or a value that is too small for adequate security.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
