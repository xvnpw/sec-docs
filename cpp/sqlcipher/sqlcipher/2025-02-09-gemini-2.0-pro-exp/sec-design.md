# BUSINESS POSTURE

SQLCipher is an open-source extension to SQLite that provides transparent 256-bit AES encryption of database files. It's used to protect sensitive data stored in SQLite databases, particularly in mobile applications and embedded systems.

Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide robust, transparent database encryption.
*   Maintain compatibility with standard SQLite API.
*   Minimize performance overhead.
*   Ensure cross-platform compatibility.
*   Maintain a strong open-source community.
*   Provide commercial support and licensing options.

Business Risks:

*   Compromise of encryption keys: If the encryption keys are compromised, the entire database is vulnerable.
*   Vulnerabilities in the encryption implementation: Bugs or weaknesses in the cryptographic algorithms or their implementation could allow attackers to bypass the encryption.
*   Performance bottlenecks: Poorly optimized encryption can significantly slow down database operations, impacting application performance.
*   Compatibility issues: Changes to SQLite or the underlying operating system could break compatibility, requiring significant maintenance effort.
*   Supply chain attacks: Compromise of the build process or dependencies could introduce malicious code into SQLCipher.
*   Lack of adoption: If developers don't trust or adopt SQLCipher, its impact and sustainability are limited.
*   Legal and compliance issues: Failure to comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) when using SQLCipher could lead to legal penalties.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: 256-bit AES encryption: SQLCipher uses 256-bit AES in CBC mode for database encryption. (Implemented in the core encryption module)
*   security control: PBKDF2 key derivation: Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2) is used to derive encryption keys from user-provided passwords. (Implemented in the key derivation module)
*   security control: HMAC for integrity: Hashed Message Authentication Code (HMAC) is used to ensure data integrity and prevent tampering. (Implemented in the integrity check module)
*   security control: Random number generation: Secure random number generators are used for key generation and initialization vectors. (Implemented using platform-specific APIs)
*   security control: Code reviews: The project likely undergoes code reviews to identify and fix potential security vulnerabilities. (Mentioned in community guidelines and contribution process)
*   security control: Community scrutiny: Being open-source, SQLCipher benefits from scrutiny by the security community, helping to identify and address vulnerabilities. (Implicit in the open-source nature of the project)
*   security control: Fuzz testing: SQLCipher uses fuzz testing to improve security. (Described in test/fuzz directory)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Side-channel attacks: SQLCipher may be vulnerable to side-channel attacks (e.g., timing attacks, power analysis) that could leak information about the encryption keys or data. Mitigation is complex and may impact performance.
*   accepted risk: Key management: Secure key management is ultimately the responsibility of the application using SQLCipher. SQLCipher itself does not provide a key management solution.
*   accepted risk: Brute-force attacks: If a weak password is used, the database may be vulnerable to brute-force or dictionary attacks.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement countermeasures against side-channel attacks where feasible, prioritizing those with minimal performance impact.
*   security control: Provide comprehensive documentation and guidance on secure key management best practices for developers using SQLCipher.
*   security control: Integrate with hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves where available to enhance key protection.
*   security control: Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing by independent experts.
*   security control: Implement a robust vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   security control: Explore the use of authenticated encryption modes (e.g., AES-GCM) to provide both confidentiality and integrity with improved performance.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   SQLCipher relies on a passphrase provided by the application to unlock the database. There is no built-in user authentication mechanism beyond this.
    *   Requirement: The application using SQLCipher must securely manage the passphrase, preventing unauthorized access.

*   Authorization:
    *   SQLCipher itself does not implement authorization mechanisms. Authorization is handled by the application logic using standard SQLite permissions or custom access control mechanisms.
    *   Requirement: The application must implement appropriate authorization controls to restrict access to sensitive data within the database.

*   Input Validation:
    *   SQLCipher does not perform input validation beyond what is inherent in SQLite. SQL injection vulnerabilities are possible if the application does not properly sanitize user inputs.
    *   Requirement: The application using SQLCipher must implement robust input validation and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks.

*   Cryptography:
    *   SQLCipher uses 256-bit AES encryption in CBC mode with PBKDF2 for key derivation and HMAC for integrity checks.
    *   Requirement: The cryptographic algorithms and parameters must be kept up-to-date with industry best practices.
    *   Requirement: The implementation must be regularly reviewed for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Requirement: Random number generation must use cryptographically secure sources.

## DEPLOYMENT

SQLCipher is a library, and its deployment is tied to the application that uses it. There are several deployment scenarios:

1.  **Mobile Application (iOS/Android):** The SQLCipher library is typically statically linked into the application binary. The application is then distributed through the respective app stores.
2.  **Desktop Application (Windows, macOS, Linux):** SQLCipher can be statically linked or dynamically linked (as a DLL or shared object). The application, along with any required SQLCipher libraries, is packaged and distributed to users.
3.  **Embedded Systems:** SQLCipher is often cross-compiled and statically linked into the embedded application. The entire firmware image is then deployed to the device.
4.  **Server-side Applications:** While less common, SQLCipher can be used in server-side applications.  It would be linked (statically or dynamically) with the server application and deployed to the server environment.

We'll describe the Mobile Application (iOS/Android) scenario in detail:

## BUILD

The build process for SQLCipher varies depending on the target platform and build system. A common approach involves using a combination of autotools, makefiles, and platform-specific build tools (e.g., Xcode for iOS, Android NDK for Android).

    Compiler[("Compiler\n(GCC, Clang, etc.)")]
    Linker[("Linker")]
    SQLCipherLibraryBuild[("SQLCipher Library\n(Static/Dynamic)")]
    Tests[("Tests")]
    TestResults[("Test Results")]
    FuzzTests[("Fuzz Tests")]

```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   security control: Dependency Management: SQLCipher relies on external dependencies (e.g., OpenSSL for cryptography). The build process should ensure that these dependencies are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities. Using a package manager and verifying checksums/signatures is crucial.
*   security control: Secure Build Environment: The build environment (whether a developer's machine or a CI/CD server) should be secured to prevent unauthorized access or modification of the build process.
*   security control: Compiler Warnings and Errors: The build process should be configured to treat warnings as errors, ensuring that potential code quality issues are addressed.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Static analysis tools (e.g., linters, SAST scanners) should be integrated into the build process to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Dynamic Analysis: Dynamic analysis tools (e.g., fuzzers) are used to test SQLCipher for vulnerabilities by providing unexpected inputs.
*   security control: Code Signing: The compiled SQLCipher library (especially for distribution) should be code-signed to ensure its authenticity and integrity.
*   security control: Reproducible Builds: Aim for reproducible builds, where the same source code and build environment consistently produce the same binary output. This helps verify that the build process has not been tampered with.
*   security control: Supply Chain Security: Use Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all components and dependencies.

# RISK ASSESSMENT
