# Threat Model Analysis for sqlcipher/sqlcipher

## Threat: [Weak Passphrase Brute-Force (Directly Impacting KDF)](./threats/weak_passphrase_brute-force__directly_impacting_kdf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains the encrypted database and uses automated tools to guess the passphrase.  While the application *chooses* the KDF parameters, the *effectiveness* of those parameters is a direct property of SQLCipher's KDF implementation. A weak KDF, even if *chosen* by the application, is a SQLCipher-related weakness.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise; attacker gains full access.
    *   **SQLCipher Component Affected:** Key Derivation Function (KDF) implementation (e.g., PBKDF2, Argon2, scrypt).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   SQLCipher should be configured to use a strong KDF (Argon2id is generally recommended) with a high work factor. The *application* must choose these parameters, but SQLCipher must *provide* robust options.
        *   Regularly review and update the recommended KDF and parameters based on current cryptographic best practices.

## Threat: [Side-Channel Attack (Timing Analysis)](./threats/side-channel_attack__timing_analysis_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker monitors the timing of SQLCipher's cryptographic operations to extract information about the key or data. This is a direct attack on SQLCipher's implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Partial or complete key recovery, leading to database decryption.
    *   **SQLCipher Component Affected:** Core cryptographic functions (AES, HMAC, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   SQLCipher developers must continuously improve the resistance of core cryptographic functions to timing attacks by using constant-time algorithms and other countermeasures.
        *   Users should keep SQLCipher updated to benefit from these improvements.

## Threat: [SQLCipher Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/sqlcipher_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a discovered vulnerability within SQLCipher itself (e.g., a buffer overflow, logic error, or cryptographic flaw) to bypass security mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but could include complete database compromise, arbitrary code execution, or denial of service.
    *   **SQLCipher Component Affected:** Any part of SQLCipher, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a remote code execution or decryption vulnerability exists), High (for other vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   SQLCipher developers must conduct thorough security audits and testing.
        *   Users must promptly apply security updates released by the SQLCipher project.
        *   Implement a robust vulnerability disclosure and patching process.

## Threat: [Incorrect Cipher or KDF Configuration (Weakening Built-in Security)](./threats/incorrect_cipher_or_kdf_configuration__weakening_built-in_security_.md)

*   **Description:** While the *application* sets the configuration, SQLCipher *allows* for insecure configurations.  This threat focuses on SQLCipher *providing* options that weaken its inherent security. For example, allowing a deprecated cipher or an extremely low KDF iteration count.
    *   **Impact:** Weakened security, making the database vulnerable to attacks.
    *   **SQLCipher Component Affected:** Configuration options and their enforcement (PRAGMA statements).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   SQLCipher should deprecate and eventually remove support for weak ciphers and KDFs.
        *   SQLCipher should enforce minimum security requirements for KDF parameters (e.g., a minimum iteration count).
        *   Provide clear warnings and documentation about the security implications of different configuration choices.
        *   Consider a "secure by default" configuration that requires explicit action to weaken security.

## Threat: [Database Corruption (without Tampering Detection) - *If HMAC Fails*](./threats/database_corruption__without_tampering_detection__-_if_hmac_fails.md)

*   **Description:** The database becomes corrupted, and SQLCipher's *own* integrity checks (HMAC) fail to detect the corruption. This highlights a failure in SQLCipher's core functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, application malfunction.
    *   **SQLCipher Component Affected:** Integrity checking mechanisms (HMAC implementation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
      *   SQLCipher developers must ensure the HMAC implementation is robust and resistant to subtle corruption that could bypass detection.
      *   Regularly test the integrity check functionality with various corruption scenarios.
