# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dragonflydb/dragonfly

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Snapshotting and Persistence Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_snapshotting_and_persistence_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Snapshot Interval:** Use the `--snapshot_interval <seconds>` flag when starting Dragonfly.  Choose a value based on your data change rate and acceptable data loss.  For example, `--snapshot_interval 60` would create a snapshot every 60 seconds.  Start with a shorter interval (e.g., 60 seconds) and monitor performance.  Increase it if I/O overhead is too high, but be aware of the increased data loss risk.
    2.  **Secure Snapshot Directory:** Use the `--dir <path>` flag to specify a dedicated directory for snapshots.  Ensure this directory is *only* accessible by the user running Dragonfly (e.g., `chown dragonfly:dragonfly /path/to/snapshots`).  Use `chmod 700 /path/to/snapshots` to restrict access.  *This is crucial for preventing unauthorized access to snapshot files.*
    3.  **Consider AOF (if needed):** If data loss is unacceptable, enable AOF with `--aof_enabled=true`.  Also, configure `--aof_rewrite_incremental_fsync` and `--aof_fsync` for balancing performance and durability.  Monitor the AOF file size and implement a compaction strategy (manual or automated).
    4.  **Snapshot Encryption (if sensitive data):** If snapshots contain sensitive data, encrypt them *before* writing to disk. This is a crucial step if sensitive data is stored. This would likely involve a custom script integrated with Dragonfly's snapshotting process, as it's not a built-in feature.
    5.  **Monitor Snapshotting:** Implement monitoring (e.g., using Prometheus, Grafana, or custom scripts) to track snapshot success/failure, duration, and file size. Set up alerts for any errors or significant delays. *While the monitoring itself might be external, the data being monitored is directly from Dragonfly.*

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss (High Severity):** Improper snapshot configuration can lead to significant data loss.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Unsecured snapshot files can expose sensitive data.
    *   **Data Corruption (Medium Severity):** Issues during snapshot creation or restoration.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss:** Risk significantly reduced by proper snapshot interval, and monitoring. AOF further minimizes data loss.
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced by securing the snapshot directory and encrypting snapshot files.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced by monitoring and proper snapshot management.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Snapshot interval configured (`--snapshot_interval 300`).
    *   Dedicated snapshot directory with restricted permissions (`/var/lib/dragonfly/snapshots`, owned by `dragonfly` user).
    *   Basic monitoring of snapshot success/failure via system logs.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Snapshot encryption is not implemented.
    *   AOF mode is not enabled.
    *   Advanced monitoring with alerting (e.g., Prometheus integration) is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Network Exposure and Implement Access Control (Dragonfly-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_network_exposure_and_implement_access_control__dragonfly-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Bind to Specific Interface:** Use the `--bind <ip_address>` flag when starting Dragonfly.  *Never* use `0.0.0.0` in production.  For local-only access, use `--bind 127.0.0.1`.  For access from a specific private network, use the appropriate private IP address (e.g., `--bind 192.168.1.10`). This is *the* primary Dragonfly-specific control for network access.
    2.  **Disable Dangerous Commands:** Use the `--protected-commands "FLUSHALL,FLUSHDB,CONFIG,DEBUG,SHUTDOWN"` flag to disable commands that could be abused.  Customize this list based on your application's needs. This directly controls which commands Dragonfly will accept.
    3.  **Implement Authentication (when available):** When Dragonfly supports authentication, enable it using the appropriate configuration flags (these flags are hypothetical, as Dragonfly doesn't currently support authentication). Use strong, unique passwords.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Exposing Dragonfly to untrusted networks.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Unauthorized access can lead to data exfiltration.
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Attackers could execute arbitrary commands if combined with application vulnerabilities.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk dramatically reduced by binding to a specific interface.
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk significantly reduced by preventing unauthorized access.
    *   **Command Injection:** Risk partially mitigated by disabling dangerous commands.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Dragonfly is bound to the local interface (`--bind 127.0.0.1`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dangerous commands are not explicitly disabled.
    *   Authentication is not implemented (pending Dragonfly support).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prevent Resource Exhaustion (DoS/DDoS) - Dragonfly Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/prevent_resource_exhaustion__dosddos__-_dragonfly_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Set Memory Limit:** Use the `--maxmemory <bytes>` flag to set a maximum memory limit for Dragonfly.  For example, `--maxmemory 1gb` limits Dragonfly to 1GB of RAM.
    2.  **Configure Eviction Policy:** Use the `--maxmemory-policy <policy>` flag to define how Dragonfly handles reaching the memory limit.  Common policies: `allkeys-lru`, `volatile-lru`, `noeviction`.
    3.  **Limit Concurrent Connections:** Use the `--maxclients <number>` flag to limit the maximum number of simultaneous client connections.  For example, `--maxclients 1000`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High Severity):** Attackers can flood the server, consuming memory or CPU.
    *   **System Instability (Medium Severity):** Excessive memory usage can lead to crashes.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced by setting memory limits and connection limits.
    *   **System Instability:** Risk reduced by setting memory limits.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Memory limit is set (`--maxmemory 512mb`).
    *   Eviction policy is set to `allkeys-lru` (`--maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Connection limits are not explicitly set.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dragonfly-Specific Monitoring and Logging](./mitigation_strategies/dragonfly-specific_monitoring_and_logging.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Logging:** Use `--loglevel verbose` (for development/debugging) or `--loglevel notice` (for production) to enable detailed logging. This controls Dragonfly's internal logging.
    2.  **Slow Query Logging:** Use `--slowlog-log-slower-than <microseconds>` to log queries that exceed a specified execution time. This is a built-in Dragonfly feature. For example, `--slowlog-log-slower-than 10000`.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undetected Attacks (High Severity):** Without logs, attacks may go unnoticed.
    *   **Difficult Incident Response (High Severity):** Lack of logs hinders investigation.
    *   **Performance Issues (Medium Severity):** Slow queries can impact performance.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Undetected Attacks:** Risk reduced by providing visibility.
    *   **Difficult Incident Response:** Improved incident response.
    *   **Performance Issues:** Helps identify performance problems.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic logging is enabled (`--loglevel notice`).

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Slow query logging is not configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Cluster Mode (If Applicable) - Dragonfly Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_cluster_mode__if_applicable__-_dragonfly_configuration.md)

* **Description:** (Assuming Dragonfly has a cluster mode)
    1.  **Enable TLS for Inter-Node Communication:** If Dragonfly supports TLS for communication between cluster nodes, enable it using the appropriate configuration flags (these are hypothetical, depending on Dragonfly's implementation).
    2.  **Authentication for Cluster Management:** If Dragonfly provides authentication for cluster management, enable it using the appropriate configuration flags.
    3. **Authorization for Cluster Management:** If Dragonfly provides authorization, use it.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity):** Interception of communication between nodes.
    *   **Unauthorized Cluster Modification (High Severity):** Malicious nodes joining the cluster.
    *   **Data Breach (High Severity):** Eavesdropping on inter-node communication.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk eliminated by using TLS.
    *   **Unauthorized Cluster Modification:** Risk significantly reduced by authentication and authorization.
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk reduced by encrypting communication.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not applicable (not using Dragonfly in a clustered configuration).

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   All aspects of cluster mode security are missing.
