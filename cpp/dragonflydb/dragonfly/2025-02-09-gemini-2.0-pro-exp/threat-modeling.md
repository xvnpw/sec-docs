# Threat Model Analysis for dragonflydb/dragonfly

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access](./threats/unauthenticated_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker connects to the Dragonfly instance without providing any credentials.  They can then issue *any* command, including reading, writing, and deleting all data. This occurs if authentication is disabled or a weak/default password is in use.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data compromise (read, write, delete), potential for application disruption, session hijacking, and data corruption.  Full control over the data store.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core Dragonfly server, authentication mechanism (`AUTH` command handling, password validation logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory:** Enable strong password authentication using `--requirepass` with a complex, randomly generated, and frequently rotated password.  *Never* use a default or easily guessable password.
        *   Consider using ACLs (if supported by the Dragonfly version) to further restrict access based on user roles, even after authentication.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Unauthorized Connection](./threats/data_tampering_via_unauthorized_connection.md)

*   **Description:**  Following successful unauthenticated access, an attacker modifies data stored in Dragonfly. They can use commands like `SET`, `HSET`, `LPUSH`, etc., to alter existing data or inject malicious data, bypassing any application-level controls.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, application malfunction, incorrect business logic execution, potential for session hijacking if session data is modified.  The integrity of the data store is compromised.
    *   **Affected Component:** All data storage and manipulation commands (e.g., `SET`, `GET`, `HSET`, `HGET`, `LPUSH`, `LPOP`, and all other write commands).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Crucially:** Implement strong authentication and authorization (as described above). This is the primary defense.
        *   *Secondary:* Application-level data validation is a good practice but *cannot* prevent this threat if Dragonfly itself is compromised.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion DoS (Targeting Dragonfly)](./threats/memory_exhaustion_dos__targeting_dragonfly_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests specifically designed to consume Dragonfly's memory, or stores excessively large values, causing Dragonfly to become unresponsive or crash. This is a direct attack on Dragonfly's in-memory nature.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service specifically targeting Dragonfly, application unavailability, potential data loss if persistence is not configured or fails.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dragonfly's memory management, data storage allocation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Essential:** Set a memory limit using `--maxmemory`. This is Dragonfly's built-in defense.
        *   **Essential:** Configure an appropriate eviction policy using `--maxmemory-policy` (e.g., `allkeys-lru`, `volatile-lru`, `allkeys-random`). Choose a policy that suits your application's data access patterns.
        *   Monitor Dragonfly's memory usage and set up alerts for high memory consumption *specifically within Dragonfly*.

## Threat: [Snapshot Exposure (Direct Dragonfly Data)](./threats/snapshot_exposure__direct_dragonfly_data_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to Dragonfly's snapshot files (RDB or AOF). These files contain a *direct copy* of the data stored in Dragonfly.  Exposure leads to a complete data breach of the Dragonfly data store.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of *all* sensitive information stored in Dragonfly.
    *   **Affected Component:** Snapshotting mechanism (RDB and AOF file generation and storage, file system permissions where these files are stored).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store snapshot files in a secure location with *strictly* restricted access permissions (file system level).
        *   Encrypt snapshot files at rest. This is crucial.
        *   Regularly rotate snapshot files and securely delete old ones.
        *   *Never* store snapshots on publicly accessible locations or locations accessible to untrusted users/processes.

## Threat: [Dragonfly Code Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dragonfly_code_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the *Dragonfly codebase itself* (e.g., a buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, or a logic error in a command handler) to gain arbitrary code execution or elevate privileges *within the context of the Dragonfly process*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise (potentially beyond just Dragonfly), data breach, denial of service.  This is the most severe type of threat.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially *any* part of the Dragonfly codebase, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Paramount:** Keep Dragonfly *absolutely up to date* with the latest security patches. Subscribe to security advisories for Dragonfly and apply updates *immediately* when released.
        *   Run Dragonfly as a non-root user with *strictly* limited privileges. This limits the damage if a vulnerability is exploited.
        *   Use a containerization technology (e.g., Docker) to isolate Dragonfly and further limit the impact of a potential compromise. The container should have minimal privileges.
        *   Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting the Dragonfly instance.

## Threat: [Module Loading Vulnerability (Dragonfly-Specific)](./threats/module_loading_vulnerability__dragonfly-specific_.md)

* **Description:** If Dragonfly is configured to load external modules (using `--loadmodule`), an attacker could trick Dragonfly into loading a *malicious module* that grants them unauthorized access or control over the Dragonfly instance *itself*.
    * **Impact:** System compromise (of the Dragonfly process and potentially the host), data breach, denial of service. This is a direct attack on Dragonfly's extensibility.
    * **Affected Component:** Module loading mechanism (`--loadmodule`, module loading and execution logic).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Only* load modules from trusted sources.  This is critical.
        *   Verify the integrity of modules before loading them (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures, and verifying the source).
        *   Run Dragonfly with limited privileges (as above) to minimize the impact of a compromised module.
        *   *Avoid* using modules unless *absolutely necessary*.  If you don't need modules, don't enable them.
        *   If using modules, ensure they are kept up-to-date with security patches, just like Dragonfly itself.
