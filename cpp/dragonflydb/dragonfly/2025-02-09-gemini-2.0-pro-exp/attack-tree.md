    *   **1.1 Snapshot Exploitation**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Predictable Snapshot Filenames [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_predictable_snapshot_filenames__critical_.md)

        *   **1.1.1 Predictable Snapshot Filenames [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker guesses the names of snapshot files (e.g., `snapshot.dfly`, `backup1.dfly`) and attempts to download them directly from the server. This is possible if the server exposes the snapshot directory via a web server or if file permissions are misconfigured.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Full data compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if file access or web server logs are monitored)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Use cryptographically secure random filenames for snapshots.
                *   Implement strict access control on the snapshot directory.
                *   Regularly audit file permissions and web server configurations.

    *   **1.2 Bypass Authentication/Authorization**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Weak/Default Credentials [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_weakdefault_credentials__critical_.md)

        *   **1.2.1 Weak/Default Credentials [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses default or easily guessable credentials to access the Dragonfly instance. This is possible if the administrator has not changed the default credentials or has chosen a weak password.
            *   **Likelihood:** High
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete control over the data)
            *   **Effort:** Very Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (through login logs)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Always change default credentials immediately after installation.
                *   Enforce strong password policies.
                *   Implement multi-factor authentication (if supported).

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Memory Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_memory_exhaustion.md)

        *   **2.1.2 Memory Exhaustion**
            *   **Description:** The attacker sends a large number of requests or requests with large values to consume all available memory on the Dragonfly server, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.
            *   **Likelihood:** High
            *   **Impact:** High (Service disruption, potential data loss if persistence is not configured)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (through monitoring memory usage)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Configure memory limits for the Dragonfly instance.
                *   Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from sending too many requests.
                *   Monitor memory usage and set up alerts for high memory consumption.
                *   Use a robust persistence mechanism to prevent data loss on crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Exploit Snapshotting Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_exploit_snapshotting_vulnerability.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Predictable Snapshot Filenames (leading to RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_predictable_snapshot_filenames__leading_to_rce___critical_.md)

        *   **3.1.1 Predictable Snapshot Filenames (leading to RCE) [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker combines predictable snapshot filenames with a vulnerability in the snapshot restoration process. They craft a malicious snapshot file, upload it to the server (potentially by exploiting another vulnerability), and then trigger a restart or snapshot load. If the restoration process is vulnerable, the malicious code in the snapshot will be executed.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (requires multiple vulnerabilities)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete server compromise)
            *   **Effort:** High
            *   **Skill Level:** Expert
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   All mitigations for 1.1.1 (Predictable Snapshot Filenames).
                *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize snapshot data before restoration.
                *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization in the snapshot loading process.
                *   Regularly audit the snapshot restoration code for vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

    *   **3.2 Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities**

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Misconfigured Security Rules [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_misconfigured_security_rules__critical_.md)

        *   **3.2.1 Misconfigured Security Rules [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker exploits overly permissive security rules (e.g., allowing remote access without authentication) to connect to the Dragonfly instance and execute commands.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete server compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low (if the misconfiguration is obvious)
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (through auditing security configurations)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring security rules.
                *   Require strong authentication for all remote access.
                *   Regularly review and audit security configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.2 Exposed Management Interface [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_2_exposed_management_interface__critical_.md)

        *   **3.2.2 Exposed Management Interface [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the Dragonfly management interface (if it exists) because it is exposed to the internet without proper authentication or with weak credentials.
            *   **Likelihood:** Low (developers should avoid this)
            *   **Impact:** Very High (Complete server compromise)
            *   **Effort:** Low (if exposed and unprotected)
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (through network scans)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Never expose the management interface to the public internet.
                *   Use a firewall to restrict access to the management interface.
                *   Require strong authentication and authorization for access.
                *   Consider using a VPN or SSH tunnel for remote management.
