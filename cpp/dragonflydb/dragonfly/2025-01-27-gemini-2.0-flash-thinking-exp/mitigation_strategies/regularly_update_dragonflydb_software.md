#### 4.2. Threats Mitigated Analysis

*   **Exploitation of Known DragonflyDB Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**
    *   **Analysis:**  Regular updates are highly effective in mitigating this threat. Patching known vulnerabilities directly removes the attack vector.
    *   **Impact:** High reduction in risk. This is the primary and most significant benefit of this mitigation strategy.
    *   **Justification:** Known vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed and actively exploited. Patching is the most direct and effective way to address them.

*   **Zero-Day Exploits (Low Severity):**
    *   **Analysis:**  Updates cannot prevent zero-day exploits directly, as patches are not available at the time of exploitation. However, staying up-to-date indirectly reduces the risk by minimizing the attack surface and potentially making it harder for attackers to find exploitable vulnerabilities.  Also, vendors often release patches quickly after zero-day exploits are discovered, so being prepared to update rapidly is beneficial.
    *   **Impact:** Low reduction in risk (indirect benefit).
    *   **Justification:** Zero-day exploits are by definition unknown. Updates are a reactive measure after a vulnerability is discovered and patched. The benefit is primarily in reducing the overall vulnerability window and demonstrating a commitment to security, potentially deterring less sophisticated attackers.

*   **Data Breach due to DragonflyDB Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Analysis:**  Vulnerabilities in DragonflyDB could potentially lead to data breaches. Regular updates reduce the likelihood of such breaches by patching vulnerabilities that could be exploited for data exfiltration or unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Moderate reduction in risk.
    *   **Justification:** Data breaches are a significant concern. While updates are not a guarantee against all breaches, they significantly reduce the risk associated with known DragonflyDB vulnerabilities. The severity is medium because other factors (application security, access controls) also contribute to data breach risk.
