# Threat Model Analysis for dragonflydb/dragonfly

## Threat: [Data Injection through Command Injection Vulnerability](./threats/data_injection_through_command_injection_vulnerability.md)

Description: An attacker might exploit a command injection vulnerability in DragonflyDB's command processing logic. By crafting malicious commands, the attacker could inject arbitrary commands that are executed by DragonflyDB, potentially leading to data manipulation, information disclosure, or denial of service. This vulnerability would reside within DragonflyDB's parsing or command execution modules.
Impact: Data integrity compromise (unauthorized data modification or deletion), confidentiality breach (unauthorized data access), availability disruption (denial of service by crashing DragonflyDB or overloading resources), potential for arbitrary code execution on the DragonflyDB server (if vulnerability allows).
Affected Dragonfly Component: Command Processing Module, Parsing Engine.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all commands processed by DragonflyDB. This is primarily a responsibility of DragonflyDB developers.
    * Follow secure coding practices to prevent command injection vulnerabilities in DragonflyDB's codebase. Again, developer responsibility.
    * Regularly audit and penetration test DragonflyDB to identify and fix potential command injection vulnerabilities.  This should be done by DragonflyDB developers and security researchers.
    * Keep DragonflyDB updated to the latest version with security patches provided by the DragonflyDB team. Users should apply updates promptly.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Memory)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__memory_.md)

Description: An attacker might send a large number of requests or commands that consume excessive memory within DragonflyDB, leading to memory exhaustion and a denial of service. This is inherent to in-memory databases if not properly managed.  Attackers could exploit inefficient memory handling within DragonflyDB itself or simply overwhelm it with legitimate-looking but resource-intensive requests.
Impact: Availability disruption (DragonflyDB becomes unresponsive or crashes, application outage).
Affected Dragonfly Component: Memory Management, Data Storage Engine.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement resource limits within DragonflyDB configuration (if available, e.g., memory limits). DragonflyDB developers should provide configuration options for resource control. Users should configure these limits appropriately.
    * Monitor DragonflyDB memory usage and set up alerts for high memory consumption. Users should implement monitoring.
    * Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the application side to control the volume of requests sent to DragonflyDB. Application developers should implement this.
    * Design application data structures and usage patterns to minimize memory footprint in DragonflyDB. Application developers should consider this during design.
    * Right-size the DragonflyDB instance with sufficient memory resources for expected workload. Users should provision adequate resources.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_vulnerability.md)

Description: An attacker with limited access to DragonflyDB (if access control is implemented in future versions) might exploit a privilege escalation vulnerability within DragonflyDB's authorization or access control mechanisms. This could allow them to gain higher privileges, potentially becoming an administrator or gaining full control over the DragonflyDB instance. This vulnerability would be within DragonflyDB's privilege management code.
Impact: Confidentiality breach (unrestricted data access), data integrity compromise (unrestricted data modification), availability disruption (unrestricted control over DragonflyDB), potential for complete system compromise.
Affected Dragonfly Component: Access Control Module (if implemented), Authentication Module (if implemented), Authorization Logic.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring DragonflyDB access controls (if implemented). Users should configure access controls properly.
    * Keep DragonflyDB updated to the latest version with security patches, especially for privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Users should apply updates. DragonflyDB developers should promptly patch such vulnerabilities.
    * Regularly audit and review DragonflyDB access configurations. Users should perform audits.
    * Implement security monitoring and alerting for suspicious activity that might indicate privilege escalation attempts. Users should implement monitoring.
