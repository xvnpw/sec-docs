# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dragonflydb/dragonfly

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Access Control Lists (ACLs)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_access_control_lists__acls_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Access Requirements:** Determine which users, applications, or services need to interact with DragonflyDB and what level of access they require (e.g., read-only, read-write, administrative).
    2.  **Define Granular ACL Rules:** Create specific ACL rules within DragonflyDB to restrict access based on user roles or application components. These rules should limit access to specific commands and key patterns. For example, a user might only be granted access to `GET` and `SET` commands on keys prefixed with `cache:`.
    3.  **Configure DragonflyDB ACLs:** Use DragonflyDB's ACL configuration mechanisms (configuration file or command-line interface) to define users and their associated ACL rules. Ensure default users have minimal privileges and create specific users for different application needs.
    4.  **Test and Validate ACLs:** Thoroughly test the configured ACLs to ensure they function as intended. Verify that users can only execute authorized commands and access permitted keyspaces, and that unauthorized access is denied.
    5.  **Regularly Review and Update ACLs:** Periodically review and update ACL configurations to reflect changes in user roles, application requirements, and security policies. Remove unnecessary permissions and add new ones as needed.
