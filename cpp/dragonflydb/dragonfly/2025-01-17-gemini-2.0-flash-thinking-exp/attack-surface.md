# Attack Surface Analysis for dragonflydb/dragonfly

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Network Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_network_access.md)

*   **Description:** DragonflyDB, by default, does not require authentication. If the port is accessible, anyone can connect and execute commands.
    *   **How Dragonfly Contributes:** Dragonfly's default configuration lacks mandatory authentication.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network or with access to the DragonflyDB port can connect using a client and execute commands like `FLUSHALL` to delete all data or `CONFIG SET requirepass <password>` to set a password and lock out legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data loss, data manipulation, denial of service, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication using the `requirepass` configuration option in `dragonfly.conf`.
        *   Use strong, randomly generated passwords for authentication.
        *   Restrict network access to the DragonflyDB port using firewalls or network segmentation, allowing only trusted application servers to connect.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Network Communication (Lack of TLS)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_network_communication__lack_of_tls_.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and DragonflyDB might not be encrypted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.
    *   **How Dragonfly Contributes:** While Dragonfly supports TLS, it's not enabled by default.
    *   **Example:** An attacker eavesdropping on network traffic can intercept sensitive data being exchanged between the application and DragonflyDB, including potentially user credentials or application data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, including application secrets and user information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for DragonflyDB connections by configuring the `tls-port`, `tls-cert-file`, and `tls-key-file` options in `dragonfly.conf`.
        *   Ensure the application is configured to connect to DragonflyDB using the TLS-enabled port.
        *   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication between the application and DragonflyDB.

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Application Logic](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_application_logic.md)

*   **Description:** If the application constructs DragonflyDB commands based on unsanitized user input, attackers can inject malicious commands.
    *   **How Dragonfly Contributes:** Dragonfly's command-based interface allows for powerful operations that can be abused if not handled carefully.
    *   **Example:** An application stores user preferences in DragonflyDB using a key derived from the username. If the username is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject commands into the username, leading to the execution of arbitrary DragonflyDB commands. For instance, a username like `user; FLUSHALL` could potentially execute `FLUSHALL`.
    *   **Impact:** Data manipulation, data deletion, potential for arbitrary code execution within the DragonflyDB context (though less direct than in some other systems).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat all user input as untrusted.
        *   Avoid constructing DragonflyDB commands by directly concatenating user input.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements if the DragonflyDB client library supports them (though direct parameterization is less common with Redis-like commands).
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.
        *   Adopt a principle of least privilege when designing the application's interaction with DragonflyDB, limiting the commands the application needs to execute.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Dragonfly Modules (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_dragonfly_modules__if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application utilizes DragonflyDB modules, vulnerabilities within those specific modules could be exploited.
    *   **How Dragonfly Contributes:** Dragonfly's modular architecture allows for extending its functionality, but these modules can introduce new attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable module might have a command that allows for arbitrary file access or code execution on the DragonflyDB server.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the module vulnerability, this could range from data breaches to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the module)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully evaluate the security of any DragonflyDB modules before using them.
        *   Keep modules up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring module permissions.
