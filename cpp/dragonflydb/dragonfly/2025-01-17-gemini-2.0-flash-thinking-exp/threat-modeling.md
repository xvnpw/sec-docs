# Threat Model Analysis for dragonflydb/dragonfly

## Threat: [Memory Exposure](./threats/memory_exposure.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits a memory leak within Dragonfly to gain access to the server's RAM. They could then read sensitive data directly from memory where Dragonfly stores it.
- **Impact:** Confidential data stored in Dragonfly is exposed, potentially leading to data breaches, identity theft, or other security incidents.
- **Affected Component:** Dragonfly Core (memory management)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Regularly update Dragonfly to the latest version to patch known memory leak vulnerabilities.
  - Implement robust memory management practices within Dragonfly's codebase.

## Threat: [Data Structure Exploits](./threats/data_structure_exploits.md)

- **Description:** An attacker crafts specific inputs or commands that exploit vulnerabilities within the implementation of Dragonfly's data structures (e.g., lists, sets, sorted sets). This could lead to reading data outside of intended boundaries, causing crashes, or potentially executing arbitrary code if a severe vulnerability exists within Dragonfly's data structure handling.
- **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service, potential for remote code execution within the Dragonfly process.
- **Affected Component:** Specific Data Structure Implementations (e.g., list module, set module)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Keep Dragonfly updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
  - Monitor Dragonfly logs for unusual command patterns that might indicate exploitation attempts.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Controls](./threats/insufficient_access_controls.md)

- **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in Dragonfly's built-in authentication and authorization mechanisms (if enabled) or bypasses them due to vulnerabilities within Dragonfly's access control logic. This allows unauthorized access to data or the ability to execute administrative commands within Dragonfly.
- **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification or deletion, potential for complete database compromise.
- **Affected Component:** Dragonfly Authentication and Authorization Module
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Configure strong authentication mechanisms in Dragonfly if available.
  - Implement the principle of least privilege when granting access to Dragonfly users.
  - Regularly review and audit user permissions within Dragonfly.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion Attacks](./threats/memory_exhaustion_attacks.md)

- **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or specific commands designed to consume excessive memory within Dragonfly. Due to its in-memory nature, this can quickly lead to denial of service as the server runs out of memory.
- **Impact:** Denial of service, application downtime.
- **Affected Component:** Dragonfly Core (memory management)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Monitor Dragonfly's memory usage and set up alerts for abnormal spikes.
  - Configure appropriate memory limits for Dragonfly if available.

## Threat: [Crashing Bugs](./threats/crashing_bugs.md)

- **Description:** Vulnerabilities within Dragonfly's code could lead to unexpected crashes when specific commands or inputs are processed. This can cause service interruptions.
- **Impact:** Denial of service, application downtime.
- **Affected Component:** Various Dragonfly Modules
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Keep Dragonfly updated to benefit from bug fixes.
  - Consider using a stable and well-tested version of Dragonfly.

## Threat: [Replication Issues Leading to Data Inconsistency](./threats/replication_issues_leading_to_data_inconsistency.md)

- **Description:** If using Dragonfly's replication features, vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within Dragonfly's replication logic could lead to data inconsistencies between the primary and replica instances.
- **Impact:** Data corruption, unreliable data, potential for application errors due to inconsistent data.
- **Affected Component:** Dragonfly Replication Module
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Carefully configure and monitor the replication setup within Dragonfly.
  - Regularly test the replication process and failover mechanisms.
  - Keep Dragonfly updated to patch any known replication-related bugs.

## Threat: [Novel Vulnerabilities](./threats/novel_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** As a relatively newer database, Dragonfly might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities specific to its unique architecture and implementation.
- **Impact:** Unpredictable, could range from minor issues to critical security breaches.
- **Affected Component:** Various Dragonfly Modules
- **Risk Severity:** Varies, potentially High if a critical vulnerability is found.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Stay informed about the latest security advisories and updates for Dragonfly.
  - Conduct regular security testing and penetration testing of the application's interaction with Dragonfly.
  - Monitor Dragonfly's behavior for any unusual activity.
