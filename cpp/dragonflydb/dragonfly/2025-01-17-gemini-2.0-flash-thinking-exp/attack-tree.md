## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via DragonflyDB [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_dragonflydb__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal and represents the overall objective of the attacker. Success at any of the child nodes contributes to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit DragonflyDB Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dragonflydb_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* This represents a category of attacks that directly target weaknesses in the DragonflyDB codebase or its dependencies. Successful exploitation can lead to significant compromise.
    * Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]:
        * Attack Vector: Exploit vulnerabilities in libraries used by DragonflyDB.
        * Description: DragonflyDB relies on external libraries. Known vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Medium
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit vulnerabilities in libraries used by DragonflyDB.
    * Description: DragonflyDB relies on external libraries. Known vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Medium
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse DragonflyDB Features/Functionality [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_dragonflydb_featuresfunctionality__critical_node_.md)

* This category involves using DragonflyDB's intended features in a malicious way to harm the application.
    * Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:
        * Attack Vector: Application fails to sanitize input before passing it to DragonflyDB commands.
        * Description: If the application constructs DragonflyDB commands by concatenating user-provided input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands. This can lead to data deletion (e.g., `FLUSHALL`), configuration changes (e.g., `CONFIG SET`), or other harmful actions.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low
        * Detection Difficulty: Low
    * Resource Exhaustion:
        * Attack Vector: Overwhelming DragonflyDB with requests to consume excessive resources.
        * Description: Attackers can send a large number of requests to exhaust DragonflyDB's resources, leading to denial of service or performance degradation. This can be achieved through:
            * Memory Exhaustion: Sending numerous requests to store large amounts of data.
            * Connection Exhaustion: Opening a large number of connections to DragonflyDB.
            * CPU Exhaustion: Sending computationally intensive commands repeatedly.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Medium
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low
        * Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (depending on the type of exhaustion)

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion.md)

* Attack Vector: Overwhelming DragonflyDB with requests to consume excessive resources.
    * Description: Attackers can send a large number of requests to exhaust DragonflyDB's resources, leading to denial of service or performance degradation. This can be achieved through:
        * Memory Exhaustion: Sending numerous requests to store large amounts of data.
        * Connection Exhaustion: Opening a large number of connections to DragonflyDB.
        * CPU Exhaustion: Sending computationally intensive commands repeatedly.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (depending on the type of exhaustion)

## Attack Tree Path: [Interfere with DragonflyDB Operation](./attack_tree_paths/interfere_with_dragonflydb_operation.md)

* This category focuses on disrupting the normal functioning of DragonflyDB.
    * Denial of Service (DoS):
        * Attack Vector: Making DragonflyDB unavailable to legitimate users.
        * Description: Attackers can flood the DragonflyDB server with traffic or requests, making it unavailable to the application. This can be achieved through:
            * Network-Level DoS: Flooding the DragonflyDB server with network traffic.
            * Application-Level DoS: Sending a large number of valid but resource-intensive requests.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Low
        * Detection Difficulty: Low
