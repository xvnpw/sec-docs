# Threat Model Analysis for dragonflydb/dragonfly

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access due to Weak or Missing Authentication](./threats/unauthorized_access_due_to_weak_or_missing_authentication.md)

**Description:** An attacker with network access to the DragonflyDB instance could connect and execute arbitrary commands if authentication is weak (e.g., default credentials) or disabled entirely. This allows them to read, modify, or delete any data stored in DragonflyDB.

**Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation or deletion, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Authentication module, configuration settings.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always enable authentication for DragonflyDB.
*   Use strong, unique passwords for authentication.
*   Regularly rotate authentication credentials.
*   Restrict network access to the DragonflyDB port using firewalls and access control lists.

## Threat: [Data Injection through Command Construction](./threats/data_injection_through_command_construction.md)

**Description:** If the application constructs DragonflyDB commands by directly embedding user-supplied data without proper sanitization or parameterization, an attacker could inject malicious commands. This could allow them to bypass intended logic, read unauthorized data, modify existing data, or even execute administrative commands within the DragonflyDB context.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential for remote command execution within the DragonflyDB context.

**Affected Component:** Client libraries, application code interacting with DragonflyDB command processing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the DragonflyDB client library (if available and applicable).
*   Sanitize and validate all user inputs before incorporating them into DragonflyDB commands.
*   Implement input validation on the application side to restrict the types and formats of data accepted.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Implementation-Specific Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_implementation-specific_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** As a relatively new project, DragonflyDB might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities in its code. Attackers could identify and exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or compromise data. This includes potential memory safety issues, logic errors, or race conditions within DragonflyDB's core.

**Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts, including data breach, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution on the server hosting DragonflyDB (depending on the vulnerability).

**Affected Component:** Various components within DragonflyDB depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., core data structures, storage engine, command processing logic).

**Risk Severity:** Can range from low to critical depending on the specific vulnerability, but newly discovered critical vulnerabilities pose a **high** risk.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay informed about security advisories and known vulnerabilities related to DragonflyDB.
*   Keep DragonflyDB updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Follow security best practices for deploying and managing DragonflyDB instances.
*   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in DragonflyDB itself if possible.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** DragonflyDB relies on external libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect DragonflyDB's security. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities within the context of DragonflyDB's operation.

**Impact:** Similar to implementation-specific vulnerabilities, the impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other security compromises within DragonflyDB.

**Affected Component:** External dependencies used by DragonflyDB.

**Risk Severity:** Can range from low to critical depending on the vulnerability, but vulnerabilities in key dependencies pose a **high** risk.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly audit and update DragonflyDB's dependencies to their latest secure versions.
*   Use dependency management tools that can identify and report known vulnerabilities in DragonflyDB's dependencies.
