## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dragonfly Vulnerability [HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dragonfly_vulnerability__high_risk_path_start_.md)

This high-risk path encompasses attacks that directly exploit weaknesses within the DragonflyDB implementation itself. Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences like arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

*   **Trigger Memory Corruption [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This critical node represents the goal of corrupting Dragonfly's memory, which can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or even the ability to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Send Malicious Command:**
        *   **Identify Command Parsing Weakness [CRITICAL NODE]:** This involves discovering flaws in how Dragonfly interprets commands, potentially allowing for the crafting of commands that cause memory errors.
        *   **Craft Command to Overwrite Memory [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Once a parsing weakness is found, a carefully crafted command can be sent to overwrite specific memory locations, potentially hijacking control flow.
    *   **Exploit Data Structure Handling Bug:**
        *   **Identify Vulnerable Data Structure Operation (e.g., list, set) [CRITICAL NODE]:** This involves finding bugs in how Dragonfly manages its internal data structures, leading to out-of-bounds access or other memory errors.
        *   **Craft Operation to Cause Out-of-Bounds Access [CRITICAL NODE]:** By exploiting these bugs, an attacker can craft operations that read or write memory outside the intended boundaries of the data structure.

*   **Cause Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK PATH START]:**
    *   This high-risk path aims to disrupt the application's functionality by making the DragonflyDB instance unavailable.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   This critical node focuses on overwhelming Dragonfly's resources (CPU, memory, network).
        *   **Send Large Number of Requests [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Flooding Dragonfly with a high volume of requests can exhaust its processing capacity, leading to slowdowns or crashes.
        *   **Utilize Resource-Intensive Commands [HIGH RISK PATH]:**  Sending commands that consume significant resources (e.g., very large data operations) can also lead to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Trigger Infinite Loop or Hang [CRITICAL NODE]:** This involves exploiting logic flaws in Dragonfly that cause it to enter an unrecoverable state, effectively freezing the service.

*   **Bypass Authentication/Authorization (if implemented in Dragonfly layer) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This critical node represents the ability to gain unauthorized access to Dragonfly's data and commands.
    *   **Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]:** Discovering and exploiting flaws in Dragonfly's authentication mechanism would allow an attacker to bypass login procedures.

*   **Exploit Logic Error in Command Processing [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   This critical node involves finding and exploiting unintended behaviors resulting from specific command combinations or sequences, potentially leading to data corruption or other unexpected outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Dragonfly Features for Malicious Purposes [HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_dragonfly_features_for_malicious_purposes__high_risk_path_start_.md)

This high-risk path focuses on using legitimate Dragonfly features in unintended and harmful ways.

*   **Data Exfiltration via Pub/Sub (if application uses it) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   This path allows attackers to eavesdrop on sensitive data if the application uses Dragonfly's publish/subscribe functionality without proper access controls.
    *   **Subscribe to Sensitive Channels [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker gains access to the data stream by subscribing to channels containing sensitive information.

*   **Data Manipulation via Insecure Scripting (if implemented and enabled) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   If Dragonfly supports server-side scripting (like Lua in Redis) and it's not properly secured, attackers can inject and execute malicious scripts.
    *   **Inject Malicious Lua Script (or similar) [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker injects code that can perform arbitrary actions within the Dragonfly context.
    *   **Execute Script to Modify Data or Run Arbitrary Commands [CRITICAL NODE]:** The injected script is then executed, potentially allowing for data modification, deletion, or even execution of system commands.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Communication Channel Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH START]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_communication_channel_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_start_.md)

This high-risk path targets the communication channel between the application and DragonflyDB.

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Dragonfly Connection [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   This path involves intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between the application and Dragonfly.
    *   **Intercept Communication Between Application and Dragonfly [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker positions themselves on the network to intercept traffic between the application and the database.
    *   **Modify Commands or Responses [CRITICAL NODE]:** Once the communication is intercepted, the attacker can alter commands sent by the application or responses from Dragonfly, leading to data manipulation or unauthorized actions.
