# Attack Surface Analysis for dragonflydb/dragonfly

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_access.md)

- **Description:**  The Dragonfly instance is accessible without any authentication mechanism.
- **How Dragonfly Contributes:** Dragonfly, if not configured with authentication (`requirepass`), allows any network-accessible client to connect and execute commands.
- **Example:** An attacker on the same network (or exposed network) connects to the Dragonfly port and executes commands like `KEYS *` to view all keys or `FLUSHALL` to delete all data.
- **Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Enable Authentication:**  Configure the `requirepass` option in Dragonfly's configuration file with a strong, unique password.
    - **Network Segmentation:** Ensure the Dragonfly instance is only accessible from trusted networks or specific IP addresses. Use firewalls to restrict access.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Internal Communication](./attack_surfaces/insecure_internal_communication.md)

- **Description:** Communication between our application and the Dragonfly instance is not encrypted.
- **How Dragonfly Contributes:** Dragonfly, by default, does not enforce TLS encryption for internal communication.
- **Example:** An attacker eavesdropping on the network traffic between our application server and the Dragonfly server can intercept sensitive data being read from or written to the database.
- **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application data.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Enable TLS Encryption:** Configure Dragonfly to use TLS for client connections. This usually involves generating certificates and configuring Dragonfly and the client library to use them.
    - **Secure Network Infrastructure:** Ensure the network connecting the application and Dragonfly is itself secured and trusted.

## Attack Surface: [Dragonfly Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/dragonfly_command_injection.md)

- **Description:**  Our application constructs Dragonfly commands using unsanitized user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious commands.
- **How Dragonfly Contributes:** Dragonfly interprets and executes commands sent to it. If these commands are dynamically built without proper escaping, it becomes vulnerable.
- **Example:** Our application takes a user-provided key name and uses it directly in a `GET` command. A malicious user inputs a key like `mykey ; FLUSHALL`. The resulting command sent to Dragonfly becomes `GET mykey ; FLUSHALL`, which would delete all data.
- **Impact:** Data deletion, unauthorized data access, potential for arbitrary command execution depending on Dragonfly's internal capabilities.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before incorporating it into Dragonfly commands.
    - **Use Parameterized Queries/Commands (If Available in Client Library):**  Some client libraries might offer mechanisms to parameterize commands, which can prevent injection.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure the application user connecting to Dragonfly has the minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Dragonfly Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_dragonfly_configuration.md)

- **Description:** Dragonfly's configuration files contain sensitive information (like passwords) and are exposed to unauthorized access.
- **How Dragonfly Contributes:** Dragonfly's configuration file stores sensitive settings.
- **Example:** The `dragonfly.conf` file, containing the `requirepass`, is accessible through a misconfigured web server or insecure file permissions.
- **Impact:** Compromise of authentication credentials, potential for complete control over the Dragonfly instance.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure Dragonfly's configuration files have appropriate file permissions, restricting access to only the necessary users.
    - **Configuration Management:** Use secure configuration management practices and avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files where possible (consider environment variables or secrets management).
