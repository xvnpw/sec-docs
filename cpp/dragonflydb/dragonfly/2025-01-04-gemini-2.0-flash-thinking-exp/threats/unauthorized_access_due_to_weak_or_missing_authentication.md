# Placeholder for potential code examples related to DragonflyDB authentication
# (DragonflyDB doesn't have a complex authentication system like a relational database)

# Example of how to set a password in DragonflyDB (command-line or config file)
# dragonfly --requirepass "your_strong_password"

# Example of connecting to DragonflyDB with a password using a client (e.g., redis-cli)
# redis-cli -h <dragonfly_host> -p <dragonfly_port> -a "your_strong_password"

# Note: DragonflyDB's authentication is relatively simple compared to more mature databases.
# The focus is primarily on preventing unauthorized network access.
