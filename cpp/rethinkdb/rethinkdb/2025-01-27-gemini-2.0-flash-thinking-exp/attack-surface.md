# Attack Surface Analysis for rethinkdb/rethinkdb

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Client-Server Communication](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_client-server_communication.md)

**Description:** Data transmitted between the application client and RethinkDB server is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping.

**RethinkDB Contribution:** By default, RethinkDB client connections do not enforce TLS/SSL encryption.

**Example:** An attacker on the network intercepts sensitive user data (e.g., usernames, passwords, personal information) being sent from the application to RethinkDB in a query or response.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data theft, compliance violations.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for RethinkDB server and client drivers.
*   Utilize secure network infrastructure as a supplementary security measure.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed RethinkDB Ports](./attack_surfaces/exposed_rethinkdb_ports.md)

**Description:** RethinkDB ports (e.g., 28015, 29015, 8080) are directly accessible from untrusted networks, including the public internet.

**RethinkDB Contribution:** RethinkDB, by default, listens on these ports and can be accessed if network configurations permit.

**Example:** An attacker scans the internet, finds an open RethinkDB port (28015), and attempts to connect directly to the database server to exploit vulnerabilities or gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, denial of service, potential server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to RethinkDB ports, allowing connections only from trusted sources.
*   Isolate RethinkDB servers within a private network segment, inaccessible from the public internet.
*   Use VPNs or bastion hosts for secure remote administration instead of direct port exposure.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_authentication.md)

**Description:** RethinkDB authentication is either disabled, uses default credentials, or employs weak passwords, allowing unauthorized access.

**RethinkDB Contribution:** RethinkDB supports authentication, but it requires explicit configuration and strong credentials.

**Example:** An administrator sets a weak password for the RethinkDB `admin` user, or uses a default password. An attacker guesses or cracks this password and gains full administrative access to the database.

**Impact:** Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, server takeover.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always enable RethinkDB authentication.
*   Enforce the use of strong, unique passwords for all RethinkDB users, including administrative accounts.
*   Implement regular password rotation policies, especially for administrative accounts.
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning user permissions.

## Attack Surface: [ReQL Injection](./attack_surfaces/reql_injection.md)

**Description:** Application code constructs ReQL queries dynamically using unsanitized user input, enabling attackers to inject malicious ReQL code.

**RethinkDB Contribution:** RethinkDB's ReQL language, while flexible, can be vulnerable to injection if queries are not constructed securely by the application.

**Example:** An application uses user input to filter database results. If this input is directly concatenated into a ReQL query string without sanitization, an attacker could inject ReQL commands to bypass filters, access unauthorized data, or potentially cause server-side issues.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, potential denial of service, in rare cases, potential for limited server-side command execution.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize parameterized queries or the ReQL API to construct queries with user input, preventing direct ReQL code injection.
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input before incorporating it into ReQL queries.
*   Apply the principle of least privilege to database permissions for application users.

## Attack Surface: [Web UI Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/web_ui_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The RethinkDB web UI contains security vulnerabilities such as XSS, CSRF, or authentication bypass, potentially leading to compromise of the UI and the database server.

**RethinkDB Contribution:** RethinkDB provides a web UI for administration, which, like any web application, can be vulnerable if not properly secured and maintained by RethinkDB developers.

**Example:** The RethinkDB web UI is vulnerable to XSS. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a UI field. When an administrator views this field, the JavaScript executes, potentially stealing administrator credentials or performing actions on behalf of the administrator.

**Impact:** Web UI compromise, potential database server compromise, unauthorized administrative actions, data breach.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep RethinkDB updated to benefit from patches for known web UI vulnerabilities.
*   Restrict access to the web UI to trusted networks or users, and ideally disable or restrict access in production environments.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers for the web UI to mitigate XSS risks.
*   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the RethinkDB web UI.

## Attack Surface: [Software Vulnerabilities in RethinkDB Core](./attack_surfaces/software_vulnerabilities_in_rethinkdb_core.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the RethinkDB server software itself (e.g., buffer overflows, remote code execution flaws).

**RethinkDB Contribution:** As with any software, RethinkDB's codebase may contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited.

**Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the RethinkDB server code. An attacker crafts a malicious ReQL query or network packet that triggers this overflow, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the RethinkDB server.

**Impact:** Full database server compromise, remote code execution, data breach, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep RethinkDB updated by promptly applying security patches and updates released by the RethinkDB project.
*   Implement security monitoring and intrusion detection systems to detect and respond to potential exploits.
*   Apply server hardening best practices to minimize the attack surface of the underlying operating system and server environment.
