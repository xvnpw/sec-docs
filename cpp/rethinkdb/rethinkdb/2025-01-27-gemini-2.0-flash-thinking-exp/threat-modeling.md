# Threat Model Analysis for rethinkdb/rethinkdb

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to RethinkDB by using default or easily guessable usernames and passwords for administrative or application database users. They might brute-force default credentials or find them in publicly available documentation or default configurations.
**Impact:** Full control over the RethinkDB cluster, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and complete system compromise.
**RethinkDB Component Affected:** Authentication Module, User Management
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation).
*   Change default administrative credentials immediately after installation.
*   Regularly audit and rotate passwords for all RethinkDB users.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Control](./threats/insufficient_access_control.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits overly permissive access rights granted to database users or applications within RethinkDB's permission system. They might leverage compromised application components or insider access to perform unauthorized actions like data modification, deletion, or exfiltration.
**Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, deletion, or access. Potential data breaches and integrity compromise.
**RethinkDB Component Affected:** Authorization Module, Permission System
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement the principle of least privilege: grant only necessary permissions within RethinkDB.
*   Define granular user roles and permissions based on application needs using RethinkDB's permission system.
*   Regularly audit and review user permissions within RethinkDB.
*   Utilize RethinkDB's permission system to restrict access to specific databases, tables, or even documents.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits a vulnerability in RethinkDB's authentication mechanisms to bypass login procedures and gain unauthorized access without valid credentials. This could involve exploiting bugs in the authentication protocol or implementation within RethinkDB itself.
**Impact:** Complete unauthorized access to the RethinkDB cluster and all data.
**RethinkDB Component Affected:** Authentication Module, Network Protocol
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep RethinkDB server updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
*   Monitor RethinkDB security advisories and apply patches promptly.

## Threat: [ReQL Injection Attacks](./threats/reql_injection_attacks.md)

**Description:** Attacker injects malicious ReQL code by manipulating user input that is directly incorporated into ReQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. They can craft ReQL queries to bypass application logic, access unauthorized data, modify data, or potentially execute arbitrary commands if vulnerabilities exist in ReQL parsing or execution. This is a threat specific to how applications interact with RethinkDB using ReQL.
**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, data deletion, potential remote code execution (less likely but possible).
**RethinkDB Component Affected:** ReQL Query Parser, ReQL Execution Engine
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Parameterize ReQL queries:** Use RethinkDB's parameterization features to separate code from data when constructing ReQL queries.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in ReQL queries.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit database user permissions to minimize the impact of injection attacks.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Queries](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_queries.md)

**Description:** Attacker crafts computationally expensive or resource-intensive ReQL queries designed to overload the RethinkDB server. They might send a large volume of complex queries or queries that trigger inefficient operations within RethinkDB, leading to CPU, memory, or disk I/O exhaustion.
**Impact:** Denial of service, application downtime, degraded performance for legitimate users.
**RethinkDB Component Affected:** ReQL Query Execution Engine, Resource Management
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Query Optimization:** Design efficient ReQL queries and optimize database schema for RethinkDB.
*   **Query Limits and Throttling:** Implement mechanisms to limit query complexity or execution time within the application interacting with RethinkDB.
*   **Rate Limiting at Application Level:** Limit the number of requests from specific users or IP addresses to prevent overwhelming RethinkDB.
*   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor RethinkDB server resources and set up alerts for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Exploiting RethinkDB Server Vulnerabilities for DoS](./threats/exploiting_rethinkdb_server_vulnerabilities_for_dos.md)

**Description:** Attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the RethinkDB server software itself to crash the service or make it unavailable. This could involve sending specially crafted network packets or triggering specific code paths within RethinkDB that lead to server failure.
**Impact:** Service outage and application downtime.
**RethinkDB Component Affected:** RethinkDB Server Core, Network Protocol
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep RethinkDB server updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
*   Monitor RethinkDB security advisories and apply patches promptly.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Backups](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_backups.md)

**Description:** Attacker gains unauthorized access to RethinkDB backups stored in insecure locations or with insufficient access controls. While backup security is a general concern, the *content* of RethinkDB backups is specific to RethinkDB and its data. Exploiting these backups leads to exposure of RethinkDB data.
**Impact:** Data breach and exposure of confidential information contained in RethinkDB backups.
**RethinkDB Component Affected:** Backup/Restore Module, Backup Storage (indirectly related to RethinkDB, but the *data* is RethinkDB data)
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt backups at rest and in transit.
*   Store backups in secure locations with restricted access.
*   Implement strong access controls for backup storage.

## Threat: [Data Loss due to Backup Corruption or Failure](./threats/data_loss_due_to_backup_corruption_or_failure.md)

**Description:** Critical data within RethinkDB is lost because backups are corrupted, incomplete, or fail to restore properly during a disaster or system failure. This directly impacts the availability and integrity of RethinkDB data.
**Impact:** Loss of critical data and potential business disruption, inability to recover RethinkDB data from disasters.
**RethinkDB Component Affected:** Backup/Restore Module, Backup Storage (indirectly related to RethinkDB, but the *process* is for RethinkDB data)
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly test backup and recovery procedures to ensure they are working correctly for RethinkDB.
*   Implement backup verification mechanisms to detect and prevent backup corruption of RethinkDB backups.
*   Maintain multiple backup copies in different locations for redundancy.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Modification or Deletion of Backups](./threats/unauthorized_modification_or_deletion_of_backups.md)

**Description:** Attacker intentionally or accidentally modifies or deletes backups of RethinkDB data, making data recovery impossible or compromising data integrity. This directly impacts the recoverability of RethinkDB data.
**Impact:** Data loss, inability to recover from disasters, potential data integrity compromise of RethinkDB data.
**RethinkDB Component Affected:** Backup Storage, Access Control for Backups (indirectly related to RethinkDB, but the *target* is RethinkDB backups)
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong access controls for backup storage.
*   Use write-once-read-many (WORM) storage for backups to prevent modification or deletion.
*   Monitor backup storage for unauthorized access or modifications.
