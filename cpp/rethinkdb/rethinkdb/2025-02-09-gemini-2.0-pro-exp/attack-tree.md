## Attack Tree Path: [[**Attacker's Goal: Compromise RethinkDB Data/Availability**]](./attack_tree_paths/_attacker's_goal_compromise_rethinkdb_dataavailability_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to gain unauthorized access to, modify, or delete data within the RethinkDB database, or to disrupt the availability of the RethinkDB service, ultimately compromising the application relying on it.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Complete compromise of the application's data and/or availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [[**1. Unauthorized Data Access/Modification**]](./attack_tree_paths/_1__unauthorized_data_accessmodification_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to read, write, or delete data they shouldn't have access to. This is a direct compromise of data confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Impact:** Very High - Loss of sensitive data, unauthorized data modification, potential for data corruption or deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [[**1.1 Weak Authentication/Authorization**]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_weak_authenticationauthorization_.md)

*   **Description:** This represents vulnerabilities related to how users are authenticated (verified identity) and authorized (granted permissions) to access RethinkDB. Weaknesses here provide a direct entry point for attackers.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High - Allows attackers to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [[**1.1.1 Default Credentials**]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_1_default_credentials_.md)

*   **Description:** RethinkDB, if not properly configured after installation, might have default administrative credentials (e.g., a blank admin password or a well-known default). Attackers will try these first.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (High if not changed, Very Low if changed)
*   **Impact:** Very High - Grants full administrative access to the database.
*   **Effort:** Very Low - Simply trying known default credentials.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Failed login attempts might be logged, but successful logins with default credentials would appear normal without specific auditing.
*   **Mitigation:** *Immediately* change the default administrator password after installation.  Use a strong, unique password.

## Attack Tree Path: [[**1.1.2 Weak Passwords**]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_2_weak_passwords_.md)

*   **Description:** Users (including administrative users) might choose passwords that are easily guessable, found in common password lists, or susceptible to brute-force attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on password policies and user awareness.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High - Depends on the compromised user's privileges; could range from limited data access to full administrative control.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium - Brute-forcing or using dictionary attacks.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Failed login attempts might be logged; successful brute-force might be noticeable due to multiple attempts, but sophisticated attacks might use slow, distributed attempts.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity requirements, disallow common passwords). Consider multi-factor authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [[**1.2 Injection Attacks**]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2_injection_attacks_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles user-supplied data to inject malicious ReQL (RethinkDB Query Language) code. This is analogous to SQL injection in traditional databases.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High - Allows attackers to execute arbitrary ReQL commands, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting any data in the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [[**1.2.1 ReQL Injection**]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2_1_reql_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application constructs ReQL queries by directly concatenating user input without proper sanitization or parameterization, an attacker can inject arbitrary ReQL code.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the quality of the application's code and input validation practices.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High - Could allow complete control over the database, including data exfiltration, modification, and deletion.
*   **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding ReQL and finding an injection point in the application.
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard - Might be detectable through input validation logs or database query logs, but requires careful analysis and potentially specialized intrusion detection rules.
*   **Mitigation:** *Always* use parameterized queries provided by the RethinkDB driver.  *Never* construct ReQL queries by directly concatenating user-supplied strings.  Implement strict input validation and sanitization as a defense-in-depth measure.
