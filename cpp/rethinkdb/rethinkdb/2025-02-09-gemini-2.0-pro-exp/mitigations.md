# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rethinkdb/rethinkdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable or Secure RethinkDB Web UI (RethinkDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_or_secure_rethinkdb_web_ui__rethinkdb_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Configuration File:** Find the RethinkDB configuration file (typically `rethinkdb.conf`, or a file specified with the `--config-file` option when starting RethinkDB).
    2.  **Disable Web UI (Recommended for Production):**  Edit the configuration file.  Locate the `http-port` setting.  Set its value to `none`.  Alternatively, comment out the entire line.
    3.  **Alternative (Less Secure - Only if Web UI is *absolutely* required):** If the Web UI *must* remain enabled, change the `http-port` to a non-standard port and, *crucially*, bind it to a specific, internal IP address using the `http-bind` setting.  This prevents it from being accessible from all network interfaces.  *This is still less secure than disabling it.*
    4.  **Restart RethinkDB:** After making changes to the configuration file, restart the RethinkDB service for the changes to take effect.  Use the appropriate command for your operating system (e.g., `systemctl restart rethinkdb`, or similar).
    5. **Verification:** After restarting, attempt to access the web UI using the configured port and IP address (or lack thereof). Verify that it is only accessible as intended.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional Data Exposure via Web UI (Severity: Critical):** Directly prevents unauthorized access through the built-in web interface.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Web UI (Severity: High):** Reduces the attack surface by disabling or restricting a potential target for DoS attacks.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks against Web UI (Severity: High):** Makes brute-forcing the web UI authentication (if enabled) impossible or significantly harder.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional Data Exposure:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low (if disabled) or Medium (if restricted to a specific IP).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Low (if disabled) or Medium (if restricted).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Web UI is disabled in the production environment by setting `http-port = none` in `rethinkdb.conf`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   None, as the preferred method (disabling the Web UI) is implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure RethinkDB Resource Limits](./mitigation_strategies/configure_rethinkdb_resource_limits.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Configuration File:** Find the RethinkDB configuration file (`rethinkdb.conf` or similar).
    2.  **Set Resource Limits:** Edit the configuration file and set appropriate values for the following parameters (and others as needed):
        *   `cache-size`:  Limits the amount of RAM RethinkDB uses for caching data.  Set this to a reasonable value based on your available RAM and workload.  Example: `cache-size = 2G` (for 2GB).
        *   `max-connections`: Limits the maximum number of concurrent client connections to the database.  Set this based on your expected application load and server resources. Example: `max-connections = 100`.
        *   `hard-durability`: If write performance is less critical than data durability, set this to `true` to ensure that all writes are immediately flushed to disk. (This impacts performance but increases data safety).
        *   `io-threads`: Adjust the number of I/O threads. This may require experimentation to find the optimal value for your hardware and workload.
    3.  **Restart RethinkDB:** Restart the RethinkDB service for the changes to take effect.
    4. **Monitoring:** After restarting, monitor RethinkDB's resource usage to ensure the limits are effective and not causing performance issues.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Prevents a single client or query from consuming all available server resources (memory, connections).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic RethinkDB resource limits (`cache-size`, `max-connections`) are configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More fine-grained resource limits could be explored and tuned based on ongoing monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce RethinkDB Authentication and Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_rethinkdb_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication (if not already enabled):**
        *   If authentication is *not* already enabled, you'll need to set an administrator password.  This is typically done when RethinkDB is first started, or via the command-line tools.  Consult the RethinkDB documentation for the specific command for your version.
    2.  **Create Users and Roles:** Use the RethinkDB data explorer (if accessible) or the command-line tools to create users and assign them appropriate permissions.
        *   Use the `r.db('rethinkdb').table('users').insert(...)` ReQL command (or equivalent driver methods) to create new users.
        *   Use the `r.db('rethinkdb').table('permissions').insert(...)` ReQL command (or equivalent driver methods) to define permissions for users and tables. Grant only the minimum necessary privileges (read, write, config) to each user on specific databases and tables.
    3.  **Regularly Review Permissions:** Periodically review the configured users and permissions to ensure they are still appropriate and that no unnecessary privileges have been granted.
    4. **Example (creating a read-only user for a specific table):**
        ```reql
        r.db('rethinkdb').table('users').insert({id: 'readonly_user', password: 'strong_password'})
        r.db('rethinkdb').table('permissions').insert({
            user: 'readonly_user',
            database: 'my_database',
            table: 'my_table',
            read: true,
            write: false,
            config: false
        })
        ```

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents access to the database without valid credentials.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Limits the actions a compromised user account can perform.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Authentication is enabled in RethinkDB.
    *   Least privilege principle is partially implemented (separate users for different application components).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More granular permissions could be defined within RethinkDB, further restricting access at the table and even document level if necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure RethinkDB Changefeed Access (Permissions)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_rethinkdb_changefeed_access__permissions_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use RethinkDB's Permission System:** Leverage the same permission system used for regular database access to control access to changefeeds.
    2.  **Grant Read Permissions:** When creating users, explicitly grant or deny `read` access to the specific tables for which changefeeds will be used.  A user *without* read access to a table will *not* be able to subscribe to its changefeed.
    3.  **Example (restricting changefeed access):** The example in the previous strategy (creating a `readonly_user`) already demonstrates how to restrict changefeed access.  By granting `read: true` only to the `my_table` table within the `my_database` database, the `readonly_user` can only subscribe to changefeeds for that specific table.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Changefeeds (Severity: High):** Prevents unauthorized clients from subscribing to changefeeds and receiving data they shouldn't have access to.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Changefeed clients are authenticated.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Authorization for specific changefeeds is *not* explicitly implemented using RethinkDB's permission system.  Currently, any authenticated user can access any changefeed if they have read access to the underlying table. More granular control is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Review RethinkDB Audit Logs](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_review_rethinkdb_audit_logs.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logging:**
        *   Find the RethinkDB configuration file (`rethinkdb.conf`).
        *   Locate or add the `log-file` setting.  Specify a path to a file where audit logs will be written. Example: `log-file = /var/log/rethinkdb/audit.log`.
        *   You may also be able to configure the log level and rotation settings.
    2.  **Restart RethinkDB:** Restart the RethinkDB service for the changes to take effect.
    3.  **Regularly Review Logs:** Establish a process for regularly reviewing the audit logs.  Look for any suspicious activity, such as:
        *   Failed login attempts.
        *   Unauthorized access attempts to databases or tables.
        *   Unusual query patterns.
        *   Connections from unexpected IP addresses.
    4. **Automated Log Analysis (Optional):** Consider using log analysis tools or SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems to automate the process of reviewing and analyzing the audit logs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Helps detect and investigate unauthorized access attempts.
    *   **Data Breaches (Severity: Critical):** Provides an audit trail that can be used to investigate data breaches and identify compromised accounts.
    *   **Insider Threats (Severity: High):** Helps detect malicious or negligent actions by authorized users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access/Data Breaches/Insider Threats:** While audit logs don't *prevent* these threats, they significantly improve detection and response capabilities, reducing the overall impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Audit logging is enabled.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Logs are not regularly reviewed. This is a critical gap.
    *   Automated log analysis is not implemented.
