# Threat Model Analysis for rethinkdb/rethinkdb

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Misconfigured Permissions](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_misconfigured_permissions.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Access via Misconfigured Permissions

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to data they should not be able to see or modify by exploiting weaknesses in RethinkDB's permission system. This could involve using weak or default credentials, or leveraging overly permissive user roles configured *within RethinkDB itself*. The attacker would likely use the RethinkDB driver or the data explorer (if exposed) to directly interact with the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, data deletion, violation of privacy regulations, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** RethinkDB permission system (`grant`, `revoke` commands, user accounts, roles), ReQL query execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege: Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions on specific databases and tables *within RethinkDB*.
        *   Avoid using the default `admin` account for application access. Create dedicated user accounts with restricted permissions *within RethinkDB*.
        *   Regularly audit RethinkDB user accounts and permissions.
        *   Validate user roles and permissions within the application logic before constructing ReQL queries, but *rely primarily on RethinkDB's built-in permissions*.

## Threat: [ReQL Injection](./threats/reql_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** ReQL Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious ReQL code into a query. While this often originates from application-level vulnerabilities, the *impact* and the *affected component* are directly within RethinkDB. The attacker's injected code is executed by the RethinkDB server, potentially leading to data manipulation or deletion.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, data exfiltration, complete database compromise, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** ReQL query parsing and execution *within RethinkDB*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use parameterized queries (e.g., `r.args` in the official drivers) to pass user input as separate arguments. This is the *primary* defense, preventing the input from being interpreted as ReQL code by the RethinkDB server.
        *   Validate and sanitize all user input *at the application level* as a secondary defense, but do not rely solely on this.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Changefeed Overload](./threats/denial_of_service_via_changefeed_overload.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Changefeed Overload

    *   **Description:** An attacker creates a large number of changefeeds, or changefeeds on very large tables, directly impacting RethinkDB's internal resource management. This is a RethinkDB-specific vulnerability because it exploits the changefeed mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Database unavailability, application downtime, degraded performance.
    *   **Affected Component:** RethinkDB changefeed mechanism, server resource management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Limit the number of changefeeds a single user or application can create *within RethinkDB's configuration*.
        *   Implement rate limiting on changefeed creation requests *within RethinkDB, if possible, or via a proxy*.
        *   Monitor changefeed resource usage and set alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Use filters in changefeed queries to reduce the amount of data returned. This is a query-design mitigation, but directly impacts RethinkDB's changefeed processing.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource-Intensive Queries](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource-intensive_queries.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource-Intensive Queries

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts complex ReQL queries that consume excessive server resources. This directly impacts RethinkDB's query processing and resource management.
    *   **Impact:** Database unavailability, application downtime, degraded performance.
    *   **Affected Component:** ReQL query optimizer and execution engine, server resource management *within RethinkDB*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query timeouts *within RethinkDB*.
        *   Use RethinkDB's query profiler to identify and optimize slow queries. This is a proactive measure directly related to RethinkDB's query engine.
        *   Create appropriate indexes to speed up query execution. Indexing is a core RethinkDB feature.
        *   Implement rate limiting on database queries *at the RethinkDB level, if possible, or via a proxy*.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data in Transit](./threats/unencrypted_data_in_transit.md)

*   **Threat:** Unencrypted Data in Transit

    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and RethinkDB, or between RethinkDB cluster nodes. This is a direct threat to RethinkDB's communication if encryption is not configured.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, loss of confidentiality.
    *   **Affected Component:** RethinkDB driver communication, inter-node communication within the cluster.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure RethinkDB to use TLS/SSL encryption for *all* client connections (driver connections). This is a RethinkDB configuration setting.
        *   Configure RethinkDB to use TLS/SSL for inter-node communication (cluster connections). This is a RethinkDB configuration setting.

## Threat: [Exposure of RethinkDB Admin Interface](./threats/exposure_of_rethinkdb_admin_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of RethinkDB Admin Interface

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the RethinkDB web admin interface. This is a direct threat to the exposed RethinkDB component.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, data loss, data exfiltration, data modification.
    *   **Affected Component:** RethinkDB web admin interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable the web admin interface in production environments.
        *   If required, restrict access using network-level controls (firewall rules, security groups) to allow access *only* from trusted IP addresses.
        *   Bind the admin interface to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) and use SSH tunneling or a reverse proxy. *Never* expose it directly.
        *   Change the default admin interface port. These are all RethinkDB configuration changes.

## Threat: [Running RethinkDB with Excessive Privileges](./threats/running_rethinkdb_with_excessive_privileges.md)

* **Threat:** Running RethinkDB with Excessive Privileges

    * **Description:** The RethinkDB *server process* is run with unnecessary system privileges (e.g., as `root`). This amplifies the impact of any RethinkDB vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Increased impact of a successful compromise; potential for system-wide compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** RethinkDB server process.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Create a dedicated, unprivileged user account for running the RethinkDB process. This is a system-level configuration change directly related to how RethinkDB is run.
        * Grant this user only the necessary file system permissions.

## Threat: [Use of Default Credentials](./threats/use_of_default_credentials.md)

* **Threat:** Use of Default Credentials

    * **Description:** The RethinkDB instance is deployed with the default `admin` password unchanged, allowing direct access to RethinkDB.
    * **Impact:** Complete database compromise.
    * **Affected Component:** RethinkDB authentication system.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Change the default `admin` password immediately after installation. This is a direct configuration change within RethinkDB.
