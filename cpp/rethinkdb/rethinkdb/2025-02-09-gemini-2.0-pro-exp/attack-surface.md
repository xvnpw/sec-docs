# Attack Surface Analysis for rethinkdb/rethinkdb

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure and Unauthorized Access](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure_and_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** Direct, unauthorized access to RethinkDB ports from untrusted networks.
*   **RethinkDB Contribution:** RethinkDB exposes ports for client connections, cluster communication, and the web UI.
*   **Example:** An attacker scans for open port 28015 (default client port) and connects directly to the database without authentication.
*   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, data theft, data modification, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Firewall:** Use a firewall (e.g., `iptables`, cloud provider security groups) to restrict access to RethinkDB ports to only trusted IP addresses/networks (application servers, administrative machines).
    *   **Network Interface Binding:** Configure RethinkDB to bind only to specific network interfaces (e.g., `localhost` or a private network) instead of all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).
    *   **Disable Web UI:** If the web UI is not strictly necessary, disable it entirely. If it *is* needed, restrict access via firewall rules and strong authentication.
    *   **VPN/SSH Tunneling:** For administrative access, use a VPN or SSH tunnel to securely connect to the RethinkDB server, avoiding direct exposure of the ports.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** Use of default or easily guessable credentials for RethinkDB user accounts.
*   **RethinkDB Contribution:** RethinkDB supports user accounts and permissions, but may have default accounts (e.g., `admin` with no password) if not configured properly.
*   **Example:** An attacker connects to the database using the `admin` account with a blank password (or a common default password).
*   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, data theft, data modification, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Passwords:** *Immediately* change the default `admin` password to a strong, unique password. Enforce a strong password policy for all RethinkDB users.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Accounts:** Remove or disable any default accounts that are not actively used.
    *   **Regular Password Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular password changes.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization (Privilege Escalation)](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization__privilege_escalation_.md)

*   **Description:** Application users or compromised accounts having more database privileges than necessary.
*   **RethinkDB Contribution:** RethinkDB's permission system allows granular control, but misconfiguration can lead to excessive privileges.
*   **Example:** An application user account, intended only for reading data from a specific table, has write access to all tables or even administrative privileges.
*   **Impact:** Data modification, data deletion, potential for further privilege escalation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Create dedicated user accounts for the application with *only* the minimum required permissions (read, write, specific tables/databases).  Never use the `admin` account for application connections.
    *   **Regular Permission Audits:** Periodically review and audit user permissions to ensure they are still appropriate and haven't drifted over time.
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define roles with specific sets of permissions and assign users to those roles, rather than managing permissions individually. (RethinkDB's permission system supports this conceptually, though it doesn't have explicit "roles").

## Attack Surface: [ReQL Injection (Limited but Possible)](./attack_surfaces/reql_injection__limited_but_possible_.md)

*   **Description:**  Unsanitized user input being directly incorporated into ReQL queries, leading to unintended query execution.
*   **RethinkDB Contribution:** While ReQL is less prone to injection than SQL, vulnerabilities *can* exist, especially when using `r.js` or `r.expr` with untrusted input.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides input that, when concatenated into an `r.js` call, allows them to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the server.  Or, they manipulate input used in `r.expr` to alter the query's logic.
*   **Impact:** Data modification, data deletion, potential for code execution on the server, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Direct Input Concatenation:** Never directly embed user-supplied data into ReQL query strings.
    *   **Use ReQL Query Builder:** Construct queries using the ReQL query builder functions (e.g., `r.table('users').filter(...)`). This inherently provides some protection.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  *Always* validate and sanitize *all* user input before it interacts with the database, even if it's not directly part of a ReQL string.  Use whitelisting where possible.
    *   **Disable `r.js` if Possible:** If server-side JavaScript execution is not required, disable it entirely. If it *is* required, severely restrict its capabilities (see point 7).

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelming the RethinkDB server with requests, leading to resource exhaustion and unavailability.
*   **RethinkDB Contribution:** Like any database, RethinkDB is susceptible to resource exhaustion if not properly configured and protected.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a large number of complex, resource-intensive queries, or inserts a massive amount of data in a short period.
*   **Impact:** Database unavailability, application downtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (e.g., memory, connections) within RethinkDB to prevent a single user or query from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the application or network level to restrict the number of requests from a single client.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Use a load balancer in front of RethinkDB to distribute traffic across multiple instances.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and set up alerts for unusual activity.
    * **Query Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for queries to prevent long-running queries from blocking other operations.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Server-Side JavaScript Execution (`r.js`)](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_server-side_javascript_execution___r_js__.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of the `r.js` feature to execute arbitrary JavaScript code on the server.
*   **RethinkDB Contribution:** RethinkDB allows server-side JavaScript execution via `r.js`, which can be a significant security risk if not properly configured.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses ReQL injection (or a compromised account) to execute malicious JavaScript code via `r.js`, potentially gaining access to the underlying operating system.
*   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise, data theft, data modification, denial of service, potential for lateral movement within the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable `r.js`:**  The best mitigation is to disable `r.js` entirely if it's not absolutely required. This is the recommended approach for most deployments.
    *   **Strict Whitelisting (If `r.js` is Essential):** If `r.js` *must* be used, implement a very strict whitelist of allowed JavaScript functions and objects.  *Never* allow arbitrary JavaScript code to be executed.  Carefully review and audit any code that uses `r.js`.
    * **Sandboxing (If Possible):** Explore options for sandboxing the Javascript execution environment to limit its access to system resources. This is complex and may not be fully supported by RethinkDB.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Data in Transit](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_data_in_transit.md)

*   **Description:**  Data transmitted between clients and the RethinkDB server, or between cluster nodes, is not encrypted.
*   **RethinkDB Contribution:** RethinkDB does not encrypt communication by default.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network uses a packet sniffer to capture unencrypted data transmitted between the application and the RethinkDB server.
*   **Impact:**  Data exposure, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable TLS/SSL:** Configure RethinkDB to use TLS/SSL encryption for both client-server and inter-cluster communication.  Follow RethinkDB's documentation for setting up TLS.
    *   **Strong Cipher Suites:** Use strong cipher suites and ensure certificates are properly managed and validated.
    *   **Certificate Pinning (Optional):** Consider certificate pinning in client applications for added security, though this can make certificate rotation more complex.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Data at Rest](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_data_at_rest.md)

*   **Description:** Data stored on disk by RethinkDB is not encrypted.
*   **RethinkDB Contribution:** RethinkDB does not provide built-in encryption at rest.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains physical access to the server or steals a backup of the database files and can read the data directly.
*   **Impact:** Data exposure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Full-Disk Encryption:** Use full-disk encryption (e.g., LUKS on Linux, BitLocker on Windows) on the server hosting RethinkDB.
    *   **Filesystem-Level Encryption:** If full-disk encryption is not feasible, use filesystem-level encryption to protect the RethinkDB data directory.

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  The RethinkDB server or client drivers are running with known security vulnerabilities.
*   **RethinkDB Contribution:** Like all software, RethinkDB may have vulnerabilities that are discovered and patched over time.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of RethinkDB to gain unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from data exposure to complete server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Regularly check for and apply security updates for both the RethinkDB server and client drivers.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner to identify potential vulnerabilities in your RethinkDB deployment.
    *   **Patch Management Process:**  Establish a well-defined process for testing and deploying security updates.
