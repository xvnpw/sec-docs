# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rethinkdb/rethinkdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong RethinkDB Authentication and Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_rethinkdb_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong RethinkDB Authentication and Authorization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Authentication in RethinkDB:**  Configure RethinkDB to require authentication for all client connections. This is typically done by setting up an administrative user and ensuring the `auth-key` or similar configuration option is properly set and used by clients.
    2.  **Utilize RethinkDB User Roles and Permissions:** Leverage RethinkDB's built-in user and permission system. Create specific users for different application components or services that interact with RethinkDB.
    3.  **Grant Granular Permissions:** For each RethinkDB user, define precise permissions. Restrict access to only the necessary databases, tables, and operations (e.g., `read`, `write`, `connect`). Follow the principle of least privilege. Use RethinkDB's permission commands (e.g., `grant`, `revoke`) to manage these permissions.
    4.  **Securely Manage RethinkDB User Credentials:**  If using password-based authentication for RethinkDB users (beyond the initial admin key), enforce strong password policies and secure storage of these credentials within your application or configuration management system. Consider using API keys or certificate-based authentication where appropriate for automated processes.
    5.  **Regularly Audit RethinkDB Permissions:** Periodically review the configured RethinkDB users and their assigned permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with the principle of least privilege. Use RethinkDB's permission listing commands to audit current settings.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to RethinkDB (High Severity):** Prevents attackers or malicious insiders from gaining unauthorized access to the RethinkDB database and its data by bypassing authentication.
    *   **Data Breaches via Privilege Escalation within RethinkDB (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by limiting the scope of access for each user, preventing privilege escalation within the database itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to RethinkDB:** High reduction. Enforcing authentication is a fundamental control to prevent unauthorized database access.
    *   **Data Breaches via Privilege Escalation within RethinkDB:** High reduction. Granular permissions significantly limit the potential damage from compromised accounts.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   RethinkDB authentication is enabled on the production cluster using an `auth-key`.
    *   Dedicated RethinkDB user accounts are created for the primary backend API service.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular permissions are not fully implemented for all backend services. Some services might be using users with overly broad permissions.
    *   Regular audits of RethinkDB user permissions are not yet a formalized process.
    *   API keys or certificate-based authentication for internal RethinkDB service communication are not yet implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterize ReQL Queries to Prevent NoSQL Injection](./mitigation_strategies/parameterize_reql_queries_to_prevent_nosql_injection.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Parameterize ReQL Queries to Prevent NoSQL Injection
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Input in ReQL Queries:**  Pinpoint all locations in your application code where user-supplied input is incorporated into ReQL queries.
    2.  **Utilize RethinkDB Driver Parameterization:**  Use the parameterization features provided by your specific RethinkDB driver (e.g., `r.args()` in Python, placeholders in JavaScript drivers).
    3.  **Construct ReQL Queries with Placeholders:**  Modify your ReQL query construction to use placeholders or parameter markers where user input is needed instead of directly embedding the input string.
    4.  **Pass User Input as Parameters to ReQL:** When executing the ReQL query, pass the user-supplied input values as separate parameters to the query execution function. The RethinkDB driver will handle proper escaping and sanitization of these parameters before sending the query to the RethinkDB server.
    5.  **Avoid String Concatenation of User Input in ReQL:**  Strictly avoid directly concatenating user input into ReQL query strings. This is the primary vulnerability for NoSQL injection in RethinkDB.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **ReQL NoSQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious ReQL code through user input, potentially leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion within RethinkDB.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **ReQL NoSQL Injection:** High reduction. Parameterization is the most effective method to prevent ReQL NoSQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Parameterization is used in newer modules of the application, particularly for user authentication and core data access logic.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Not consistently implemented across all application modules, especially in legacy code sections.
    *   A comprehensive code review specifically focused on ReQL query parameterization is needed.
    *   Automated static analysis tools to detect potential ReQL injection points are not yet in use.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement RethinkDB Query Timeouts and Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rethinkdb_query_timeouts_and_limits.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement RethinkDB Query Timeouts and Limits
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Query Timeouts in Application Code:** Set appropriate timeouts for ReQL queries within your application code using the timeout features provided by your RethinkDB driver. This ensures that long-running or stalled queries are automatically terminated by the client driver.
    2.  **Implement Result Set Size Limits in ReQL Queries:**  Use RethinkDB's `limit()` function in ReQL queries, especially for queries triggered by user actions or external requests, to restrict the maximum number of documents returned. This prevents queries from retrieving excessively large datasets.
    3.  **Monitor RethinkDB Query Performance:** Utilize RethinkDB's built-in monitoring tools or external monitoring solutions to track query execution times and identify slow or resource-intensive queries.
    4.  **Optimize or Limit Complex ReQL Queries:** Review and optimize complex ReQL queries that are identified as performance bottlenecks. If optimization is not sufficient, consider limiting the complexity or frequency of these queries, especially those exposed to external users.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **RethinkDB Denial of Service (DoS) via Query Overload (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from causing a DoS by triggering resource-intensive ReQL queries that can overload the RethinkDB server.
    *   **Performance Degradation of RethinkDB due to Runaway Queries (Medium Severity):** Protects against accidental or intentional slow queries that can degrade the overall performance and responsiveness of the RethinkDB database and the application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **RethinkDB Denial of Service (DoS) via Query Overload:** Medium reduction. Timeouts and limits mitigate the impact of query-based DoS, but might not fully prevent all DoS scenarios.
    *   **Performance Degradation of RethinkDB due to Runaway Queries:** High reduction. Effectively prevents individual slow queries from causing widespread performance issues.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Query timeouts are generally configured in the backend API service using the RethinkDB driver's timeout settings.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Result set size limits are not consistently applied across all ReQL queries, particularly in API endpoints that could potentially return large datasets.
    *   Detailed RethinkDB query performance monitoring and analysis are not yet fully implemented to proactively identify and address slow queries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Harden RethinkDB Server Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/harden_rethinkdb_server_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Harden RethinkDB Server Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Default RethinkDB Configuration:** Examine the default RethinkDB configuration file (or command-line parameters) and identify settings that might have security implications.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary RethinkDB Features:** Disable any RethinkDB features or functionalities that are not required by your application to reduce the attack surface. This might include disabling specific API endpoints or administrative interfaces if they are not needed for your deployment scenario.
    3.  **Adjust Default RethinkDB Ports (Consider Security Trade-offs):** While changing default ports offers minimal security by obscurity, consider changing default RethinkDB ports (28015, 29015) if it aligns with your network security policies and doesn't hinder legitimate access. Ensure any port changes are part of a broader security strategy and not relied upon as a primary security measure.
    4.  **Review and Adjust RethinkDB Resource Limits:** Review default resource limits within RethinkDB configuration (e.g., connection limits, memory usage limits) and adjust them based on your application's expected load and security requirements. Setting appropriate limits can help prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
    5.  **Keep RethinkDB Updated with Security Patches:**  Establish a process for regularly updating your RethinkDB installation to the latest stable version, including applying any security patches or updates released by the RethinkDB community or maintainers. Subscribe to security advisories to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of RethinkDB Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Keeping RethinkDB updated mitigates known vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access or disrupt service.
    *   **RethinkDB Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Properly configured resource limits can help prevent DoS attacks that attempt to exhaust RethinkDB server resources.
    *   **Information Disclosure due to Insecure Defaults (Low Severity):** Hardening default configurations reduces the risk of unintentional information disclosure due to overly permissive default settings.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of RethinkDB Vulnerabilities:** High reduction. Patching vulnerabilities is critical for preventing exploitation.
    *   **RethinkDB Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion:** Medium reduction. Resource limits provide a degree of protection against resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Information Disclosure due to Insecure Defaults:** Low reduction. Primarily addresses minor configuration-related information disclosure risks.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   RethinkDB instances are generally kept updated with relatively recent versions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal process for regularly reviewing and hardening RethinkDB server configurations is not yet in place.
    *   Specific unnecessary RethinkDB features have not been systematically identified and disabled.
    *   Resource limits within RethinkDB configuration have not been explicitly reviewed and adjusted beyond defaults.
    *   Subscription to RethinkDB security advisories is not yet formalized.
