# Threat Model Analysis for rethinkdb/rethinkdb

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to the Admin Interface](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_the_admin_interface.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to access the RethinkDB web administration interface without providing valid credentials. This could be done through brute-force attacks, exploiting default credentials (if not changed), or exploiting potential vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Successful access could allow the attacker to view database schema, data, server status, and potentially execute administrative commands, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `http` (the built-in web server serving the admin interface), `auth` (the authentication system).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and enforce strong authentication for the admin interface.
        *   Change default administrator credentials immediately after installation.
        *   Restrict network access to the admin interface to trusted IP addresses or networks.
        *   Consider disabling the admin interface in production environments if it's not actively required.
        *   Regularly audit access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Data Manipulation via Unsecured Client Connections](./threats/data_manipulation_via_unsecured_client_connections.md)

*   **Description:** If client applications connect to RethinkDB without using TLS encryption, an attacker could intercept network traffic and potentially modify data being transmitted between the application and the database. This could involve tools like man-in-the-middle proxies.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity is compromised, leading to incorrect or malicious data being stored in the database. This can have significant consequences depending on the application's functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** `net` (the networking layer handling client connections), `protocol` (the RethinkDB wire protocol).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enforce TLS encryption for all client connections to RethinkDB.
        *   Configure RethinkDB to only accept encrypted connections.
        *   Ensure client drivers are configured to use TLS.

## Threat: [ReQL Injection](./threats/reql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious ReQL (RethinkDB Query Language) commands into application queries if user input is not properly sanitized or parameterized. This could be done through input fields, API parameters, or other data sources used to construct ReQL queries.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker could bypass intended application logic, access unauthorized data, modify or delete data, or potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server (depending on the application's permissions).
    *   **Affected Component:** `ql2` (the query language processing engine), client drivers (if they don't provide proper parameterization).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the RethinkDB driver.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before incorporating them into ReQL queries.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when granting database permissions to application users or roles.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access due to Weak Permissions](./threats/unauthorized_access_due_to_weak_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** If RethinkDB permissions are not configured granularly, an attacker who gains unauthorized access to the database (e.g., through compromised application credentials) might be able to access or manipulate data they should not have access to.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion, and potential compromise of application functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** `permissions` (the permission management system), `auth` (the authentication system).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement fine-grained role-based access control within RethinkDB.
        *   Grant only the necessary permissions to each application component or user.
        *   Regularly review and audit database permissions.
        *   Avoid using overly permissive default permissions.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Backups](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_backups.md)

*   **Description:** If RethinkDB backups are not properly secured (e.g., unencrypted, stored in publicly accessible locations), an attacker who gains access to these backups could potentially access sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, loss of confidentiality.
    *   **Affected Component:** `backup` (the backup functionality), `filesystem` (where backups are stored).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt RethinkDB backups using strong encryption algorithms.
        *   Store backups in secure locations with restricted access.
        *   Implement secure backup transfer mechanisms.
        *   Regularly test backup restoration procedures.
