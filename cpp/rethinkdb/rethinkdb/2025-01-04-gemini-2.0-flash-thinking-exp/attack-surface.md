# Attack Surface Analysis for rethinkdb/rethinkdb

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected RethinkDB Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_rethinkdb_admin_interface.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Unprotected RethinkDB Admin Interface
    *   **Description:** RethinkDB provides a web-based administration interface accessible by default. Without proper security measures, this interface allows anyone who can reach it to manage the database.
    *   **How RethinkDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** RethinkDB enables this interface by default on port `8080`. Initial installations often lack strong authentication on this interface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker finds an exposed RethinkDB instance on the internet, accesses the admin interface without authentication, and deletes all databases.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the RethinkDB instance, including data loss, modification, and potential denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the admin interface to trusted networks or specific IP addresses using firewalls.
        *   Enable authentication on the admin interface and use strong, unique credentials.
        *   Consider disabling the admin interface entirely if not needed or if alternative management methods are preferred.

## Attack Surface: [Direct Database Access Without Proper Authentication/Authorization](./attack_surfaces/direct_database_access_without_proper_authenticationauthorization.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Direct Database Access Without Proper Authentication/Authorization
    *   **Description:** Applications connect to RethinkDB directly via its protocol. If this port is exposed and lacks strong authentication and authorization, unauthorized parties can connect and interact with the database.
    *   **How RethinkDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** RethinkDB listens for client connections on a specific port (default `28015`). The security of these connections depends on the application's configuration and usage of RethinkDB's authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Example:** An attacker connects to the exposed RethinkDB port and, without proper authentication, issues ReQL queries to extract sensitive user data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification, or deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure strong authentication is enabled and enforced for all database connections.
        *   Implement granular authorization rules to restrict access based on roles and permissions.
        *   Avoid exposing the RethinkDB port directly to the public internet. Use network segmentation and firewalls.
        *   Use secure connection protocols (like TLS) for client connections if sensitive data is transmitted.

## Attack Surface: [ReQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/reql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** ReQL Injection Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** If application code dynamically constructs ReQL queries based on user input without proper sanitization or parameterization, attackers can inject malicious ReQL commands.
    *   **How RethinkDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** RethinkDB's query language (ReQL) allows for powerful data manipulation. If not used carefully, this power can be exploited through injection.
    *   **Example:** An e-commerce site uses user-provided product names to search the database. An attacker inputs a malicious string that, when used in a ReQL query, bypasses intended filtering and retrieves all user data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, or even denial of service depending on the injected ReQL.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always parameterize ReQL queries:** Use the driver's built-in mechanisms for parameter binding to prevent direct injection of user input into queries.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the application side before using data in ReQL queries.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting database permissions to application users.

## Attack Surface: [Default Administrator Credentials](./attack_surfaces/default_administrator_credentials.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Default Administrator Credentials
    *   **Description:** RethinkDB, upon initial installation, might have a default administrator account without a password or with a well-known default password.
    *   **How RethinkDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The initial setup of RethinkDB might not force the immediate setting of a strong administrator password.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a newly deployed RethinkDB instance with the default administrator credentials and gains full control.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the RethinkDB instance, including data loss, modification, and potential denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if left unaddressed)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediately change the default administrator password upon installation.**
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all RethinkDB user accounts.
