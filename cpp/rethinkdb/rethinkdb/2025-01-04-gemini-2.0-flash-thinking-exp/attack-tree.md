```
* Compromise Application Using RethinkDB [CRITICAL]
    * *** Exploit Data Access (High-Risk Path)
        * *** Unauthorized Data Read (High-Risk Path)

```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using RethinkDB [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_rethinkdb__critical_.md)

This is the root goal. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through its RethinkDB dependency. This could involve data breaches, service disruption, or gaining unauthorized control.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exploit Data Access (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_access__high-risk_path_.md)

This path represents attacks focused on accessing sensitive data stored within RethinkDB without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Unauthorized Data Read (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_data_read__high-risk_path_.md)

The attacker's goal is to read data they are not supposed to access.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exploit ReQL Injection [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reql_injection__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious ReQL queries by manipulating user input that is not properly sanitized before being used in database queries.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive information)
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires careful analysis of database queries and application logs)

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Unauthorized Data Modification (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/unauthorized_data_modification__high-risk_path_.md)

The attacker's goal is to alter or delete data without proper authorization, potentially compromising data integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exploit ReQL Injection [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_reql_injection__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious ReQL queries to modify or delete data, bypassing application logic and authorization controls.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High (Data integrity compromise, corruption of critical information, potential application malfunction)
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring database modifications and anomaly detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Gain Unauthorized Access (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on gaining unauthorized access to the RethinkDB instance itself, which can then be leveraged for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Compromise RethinkDB Instance [CRITICAL] (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_rethinkdb_instance__critical___high-risk_path_.md)

The attacker aims to gain administrative or privileged access to the RethinkDB server.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

This involves bypassing or subverting the mechanisms designed to control access to the RethinkDB instance.
    * **3.1.1.1 Brute-force default credentials (if not changed):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attempting to log in using common default usernames and passwords that might not have been changed after installation.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium (If default credentials are in use)
        * **Impact:** High (Full access to the database)
        * **Effort:** Low
        * **Skill Level:** Low
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Multiple failed login attempts can be detected)
    * **3.1.1.2 Exploit vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Leveraging known or zero-day vulnerabilities in RethinkDB's authentication process to bypass login requirements.
        * **Likelihood:** Low (Depends on the existence of exploitable vulnerabilities)
        * **Impact:** High (Full access to the database)
        * **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires exploit development or usage)
        * **Skill Level:** High
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High (May require deep security analysis)
    * **3.1.1.3 Leverage leaked credentials:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Using compromised usernames and passwords obtained from other breaches or sources.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on overall security posture and credential management)
        * **Impact:** High (Full access to the database)
        * **Effort:** Low (If credentials are readily available)
        * **Skill Level:** Low
        * **Detection Difficulty:** High (Difficult to distinguish from legitimate access without anomaly detection)
