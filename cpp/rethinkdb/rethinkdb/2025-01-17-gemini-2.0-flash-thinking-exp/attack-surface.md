# Attack Surface Analysis for rethinkdb/rethinkdb

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Client Connections](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_client_connections.md)

*   **Description:** Data exchanged between the application and the RethinkDB database is transmitted without encryption.
    *   **How RethinkDB Contributes:** RethinkDB, by default, allows unencrypted client connections. It requires explicit configuration to enforce TLS encryption.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the network uses a packet sniffer to capture usernames, passwords, or sensitive data being sent to or from the database.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application data and potentially user credentials.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for all client connections by configuring the `tls` option in the RethinkDB client driver and server configuration.
        *   Ensure that the RethinkDB server is configured to only accept encrypted connections.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** RethinkDB instances are configured with weak or default credentials for user accounts, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **How RethinkDB Contributes:** RethinkDB relies on username/password authentication. If default credentials are not changed or weak passwords are used, it becomes a significant entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses default credentials (if not changed) or brute-force techniques to gain access to the RethinkDB database, potentially accessing or modifying all data.
    *   **Impact:** Full database compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change default administrator credentials upon installation.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all RethinkDB user accounts.
        *   Regularly review and update user credentials.
        *   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication if supported by the client driver or through a proxy.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Admin Interface (Web UI)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_admin_interface__web_ui_.md)

*   **Description:** The RethinkDB admin interface is accessible without proper authentication or is vulnerable to common web attacks.
    *   **How RethinkDB Contributes:** RethinkDB provides a web-based admin interface for managing the database. If not properly secured, it can be a direct entry point for attackers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker accesses the admin interface using default credentials (if not changed) or exploits a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability to execute malicious scripts in an administrator's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the RethinkDB instance, data manipulation, configuration changes, potential server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure strong authentication is required to access the admin interface.
        *   Keep RethinkDB updated to patch known vulnerabilities in the admin interface.
        *   Restrict access to the admin interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.
        *   Consider disabling the admin interface if it's not actively used.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Backups](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_backups.md)

*   **Description:** RethinkDB backups are stored in insecure locations without proper access controls or encryption.
    *   **How RethinkDB Contributes:** RethinkDB's backup functionality creates snapshots of the database. If these backups are not secured, they become a target.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a directory where RethinkDB backups are stored and can download the backup files, potentially accessing all the data within the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of historical data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store RethinkDB backups in secure locations with restricted access.
        *   Encrypt backups at rest using strong encryption algorithms.
        *   Regularly test the backup and restore process to ensure its integrity and security.
