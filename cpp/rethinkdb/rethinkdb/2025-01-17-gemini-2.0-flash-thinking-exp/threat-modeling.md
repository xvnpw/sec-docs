# Threat Model Analysis for rethinkdb/rethinkdb

## Threat: [Unencrypted Client-Server Communication](./threats/unencrypted_client-server_communication.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker on the network could eavesdrop on the communication between the application and the RethinkDB server. They might use tools like Wireshark to capture network packets and analyze the data being transmitted, including sensitive information within queries and responses.
*   **Impact:** Confidential data leakage, potentially exposing user credentials, personal information, or business-critical data. An attacker could also intercept and modify data in transit, leading to data corruption or manipulation.
*   **Affected Component:** Network communication layer, specifically the connection between the RethinkDB client driver and the RethinkDB server process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all client connections to the RethinkDB server.
    *   Configure RethinkDB server to require secure connections.
    *   Ensure the RethinkDB client driver used by the application supports and is configured to use TLS/SSL.

## Threat: [Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the RethinkDB administrative interface or application-specific database users using default credentials (e.g., "admin"/"") or easily guessable passwords. They might use brute-force attacks or rely on publicly known default credentials.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data, create or drop tables, and potentially compromise the entire server.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication module, user management system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies requiring complex and unique passwords.
    *   Change default administrative credentials immediately upon installation.
    *   Implement account lockout policies to prevent brute-force attacks.
    *   Regularly review and update user credentials.

## Threat: [Bypassing Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/bypassing_authentication_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the application's authentication logic or in the RethinkDB driver to bypass the intended authentication process and gain unauthorized access to the database without providing valid credentials.
*   **Impact:** Similar to weak credentials, full control over the database is possible, allowing for data breaches, manipulation, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** RethinkDB client driver, application's authentication logic interacting with the driver.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly test authentication logic for vulnerabilities.
    *   Use secure and up-to-date RethinkDB drivers.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication where appropriate for sensitive operations.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when interacting with the RethinkDB driver.

## Threat: [ReQL Injection](./threats/reql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious ReQL commands into queries if user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or parameterized before being used in ReQL queries. This could be done through input fields in web forms or other user-controlled data sources.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches by executing unauthorized queries, data manipulation by inserting or updating malicious data, or denial of service by executing resource-intensive queries.
*   **Affected Component:** ReQL query parser and execution engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize user input before incorporating it into ReQL queries.
    *   Utilize parameterized queries or the RethinkDB driver's built-in mechanisms to prevent injection.
    *   Implement input validation to restrict the types and formats of user-provided data.

## Threat: [Insecure Access to the RethinkDB Web UI](./threats/insecure_access_to_the_rethinkdb_web_ui.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to access the RethinkDB web UI if it is exposed without proper authentication or over an unencrypted connection. This could be done by directly accessing the UI's URL.
*   **Impact:** Full administrative control over the database, allowing the attacker to perform any action, including data manipulation, deletion, and server configuration changes.
*   **Affected Component:** RethinkDB web administration interface.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to the RethinkDB web UI to authorized users and networks (e.g., using firewall rules).
    *   Enforce HTTPS for the web UI.
    *   Disable the web UI in production environments if it is not strictly necessary.
    *   Implement strong authentication for the web UI.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Underlying Data Files](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_underlying_data_files.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to the server's file system could potentially bypass RethinkDB's access control mechanisms and directly access or manipulate the underlying data files if file system permissions are not properly configured.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, and potential for denial of service by manipulating or deleting data files.
*   **Affected Component:** File system storage of data files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure strict file system permissions for RethinkDB's data directory, limiting access to the RethinkDB user and necessary system processes.
    *   Consider using file system encryption to protect data at rest.

## Threat: [Compromise of a Single Node in a Cluster](./threats/compromise_of_a_single_node_in_a_cluster.md)

*   **Description:** If one node in a RethinkDB cluster is compromised (e.g., through a software vulnerability or weak credentials), an attacker might be able to leverage that access to gain control over other nodes in the cluster or manipulate replicated data.
*   **Impact:** Widespread data breaches, data corruption across the cluster, and potential for complete cluster takeover, leading to significant service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Cluster communication and replication mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the size and criticality of the cluster)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure each node in the cluster individually following all the previously mentioned mitigation strategies.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for inter-node communication within the cluster.
    *   Monitor cluster health and activity for suspicious behavior.
    *   Keep all nodes in the cluster updated with the latest security patches.
