*   **Potential Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific misuse, from information disclosure to code execution and Denial of Service.
*   **Why Critical:** This is often the *most likely* category of attack, as it relies on common developer errors and misconfigurations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Thorough code reviews focusing on Boost API usage.
