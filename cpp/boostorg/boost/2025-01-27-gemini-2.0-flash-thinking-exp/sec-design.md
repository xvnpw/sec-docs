**Target Audience:** This document is intended for security professionals, software developers, system architects, and anyone involved in threat modeling, security audits, or risk assessments of systems that depend on Boost C++ Libraries.

## 3. Architecture Overview

Boost's architecture is characterized by its distributed and modular nature. It's not a single application but a collection of independent libraries developed and maintained largely independently.  We can analyze the architecture from different perspectives relevant to security:

*   **Decentralized Development Architecture:** Libraries are developed by individual authors and contributors, operating with a degree of autonomy within the Boost community guidelines. This decentralized model relies heavily on peer review and community consensus.
*   **Review and Integration Process:** Contributions undergo a peer-review process by the Boost community before integration into the main repository. This review aims to ensure code quality, correctness, and adherence to Boost standards.
*   **Distribution and Release Architecture:** Libraries are packaged and released through the official Boost website and various package managers. This distribution is managed by release managers and relies on secure infrastructure.
*   **User Integration and Usage Architecture:** Users integrate Boost libraries into their projects by including headers and linking against compiled libraries. This integration is highly flexible and depends on the user's specific project requirements and build system.

Considering the security lifecycle, we can break down the architecture into these key stages:

1.  **Development and Contribution:** Individual developers or teams create and contribute code, primarily using Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration.
2.  **Peer Review and Integration:** Submitted code undergoes rigorous peer review by experienced Boost community members. Successful reviews lead to integration into the main Boost repository.
3.  **Automated Build and Testing:**  Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) systems automatically build and test Boost libraries across various platforms and configurations upon code changes.
