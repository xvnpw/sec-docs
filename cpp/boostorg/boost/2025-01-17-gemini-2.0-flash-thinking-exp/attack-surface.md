# Attack Surface Analysis for boostorg/boost

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

**Description:**  An application deserializes data from an untrusted source (e.g., network, file) without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data that can be executed upon deserialization.
*   **How Boost Contributes:** `Boost.Serialization` provides the functionality to serialize and deserialize C++ objects. If used to deserialize data from untrusted sources without careful consideration, it becomes a direct enabler of this attack.
*   **Example:** An application uses `Boost.Serialization` to receive configuration data from a remote server. An attacker intercepts the communication and replaces the legitimate serialized data with a malicious payload that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the application's server.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only Deserialize from Trusted Sources.
    *   Implement Digital Signatures/Integrity Checks.
    *   Strict Input Validation.
    *   Consider Alternative Serialization Methods.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

**Description:**  An application uses regular expressions from `Boost.Regex` to process user-provided input. A carefully crafted input string can cause the regex engine to enter a catastrophic backtracking state, consuming excessive CPU resources and leading to a denial of service.
*   **How Boost Contributes:** `Boost.Regex` provides the regular expression engine. Vulnerable regex patterns combined with malicious input can exploit the backtracking behavior of this engine.
*   **Example:** An online form uses a regular expression from `Boost.Regex` to validate email addresses. An attacker submits a specially crafted email address that causes the regex engine to take an extremely long time to process, effectively blocking the thread and potentially impacting the entire application.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (DoS), application slowdown, resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Careful Regex Design.
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization.
    *   Timeouts for Regex Execution.
    *   Consider Alternative Parsing Techniques.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflows in Networking (Boost.Asio)](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflows_in_networking__boost_asio_.md)

**Description:**  An application using `Boost.Asio` receives network data without proper bounds checking, allowing an attacker to send more data than the allocated buffer can hold, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to crashes or arbitrary code execution.
*   **How Boost Contributes:** `Boost.Asio` handles network communication. If the application doesn't implement sufficient checks on the size of incoming data when using Asio's read operations, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A server application using `Boost.Asio` to handle incoming connections has a fixed-size buffer for receiving client messages. An attacker sends a message larger than this buffer, overwriting memory and potentially injecting malicious code.
*   **Impact:**  Crash, Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Dynamic Buffers.
    *   Implement Length Checks.
    *   Use Asio's Asynchronous Operations with Care.
    *   Consider Safe String Handling.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Boost.Filesystem](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_boost_filesystem.md)

**Description:**  An application uses user-provided input to construct file paths using `Boost.Filesystem` without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to access or manipulate files outside the intended directory.
*   **How Boost Contributes:** `Boost.Filesystem` provides functions for interacting with the file system. If user input is directly incorporated into file paths without validation, it creates an opportunity for path traversal attacks.
*   **Example:** A web application allows users to download files based on a filename provided in the URL. If the application directly uses this filename with `Boost.Filesystem::path`, an attacker could provide a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` to access sensitive system files.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized file access, data leakage, potential modification or deletion of critical files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Sanitization.
    *   Use Whitelisting.
    *   Restrict Access to Specific Directories.
    *   Avoid Direct User Input in File Paths.
