## Mitigation Strategy: [Use `boost::safe_numerics` for Integer Arithmetic](./mitigation_strategies/use__boostsafe_numerics__for_integer_arithmetic.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Use `boost::safe_numerics` for Integer Arithmetic**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Code:** Identify areas in your code where integer arithmetic is performed, especially on data that might originate from external sources or user input. This includes calculations involving sizes, lengths, indices, or any other integer values.
    2.  **Replace Integer Types:** Replace standard integer types (e.g., `int`, `long`, `size_t`) with the corresponding safe integer types from `boost::safe_numerics` (e.g., `boost::safe_numerics::safe<int>`, `boost::safe_numerics::safe<size_t>`).
    3.  **Handle Exceptions (or Policies):** `boost::safe_numerics` can be configured to throw exceptions on overflow/underflow, or to use custom error handling policies. Choose the approach that best suits your application's needs. If using exceptions, ensure that they are caught and handled appropriately. If using policies, implement the policy to handle the error conditions (e.g., logging, returning an error code).
    4.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the code that uses `boost::safe_numerics` to ensure that it behaves correctly under various input conditions, including edge cases that might trigger overflow/underflow.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow (High Severity):** Prevents integer overflows and underflows, which can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially exploitable vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** Eliminates the risk of integer overflow/underflow vulnerabilities in the code where `boost::safe_numerics` is used.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* Not implemented. We currently rely on standard integer types.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:*  We need to identify critical code sections and replace standard integer types with `boost::safe_numerics` types.  Exception handling or custom error policies need to be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Asio Strands Correctly (for Boost.Asio)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_asio_strands_correctly__for_boost_asio_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Implement Asio Strands Correctly (for Boost.Asio)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Asio's Concurrency Model:** Thoroughly understand Boost.Asio's concurrency model, including the concepts of I/O objects, handlers, and strands.
    2.  **Identify Shared Resources:** Identify any resources (e.g., data structures, sockets) that are accessed by multiple asynchronous handlers.
    3.  **Use Strands for Synchronization:** For each group of handlers that access a shared resource, create a `boost::asio::strand` object.
    4.  **Wrap Handlers:** Wrap each handler that accesses the shared resource using `boost::asio::bind_executor` or `boost::asio::post` with the strand. This ensures that the handlers are executed sequentially, even if they are invoked from different threads.  `bind_executor` is generally preferred.
    5.  **Avoid Blocking Operations in Handlers:** Ensure that handlers do *not* perform long-running or blocking operations.  If blocking operations are necessary, offload them to a separate thread pool.
    6. **Avoid data races by design:** If possible, design your asynchronous operations to minimize or eliminate shared mutable state. This can often simplify concurrency management.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Races (High Severity):** Prevents data races that can occur when multiple asynchronous handlers access shared resources concurrently without proper synchronization.
    *   **Deadlocks (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of deadlocks that can occur due to incorrect synchronization.
    *   **Undefined Behavior (High Severity):** Avoids undefined behavior that can result from data races or other concurrency-related errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Races:** Eliminates data races related to shared resources accessed by Asio handlers protected by the same strand.
    *   **Deadlocks:** Reduces the risk of deadlocks.
    *   **Undefined Behavior:** Reduces the risk of undefined behavior.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* Partially implemented.  Some parts of the code use strands, but not consistently.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:*  A comprehensive review of all Asio-based code is needed to ensure that strands are used correctly and consistently for all shared resources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlled Assertion Levels using Boost Preprocessor Macros](./mitigation_strategies/controlled_assertion_levels_using_boost_preprocessor_macros.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Controlled Assertion Levels using Boost Preprocessor Macros**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Boost Assertion Macros:** Familiarize yourself with the various assertion macros provided by Boost (e.g., `BOOST_ASSERT`, `BOOST_ASSERT_MSG`, `BOOST_VERIFY`).
    2.  **Define Configuration Macros:** Use preprocessor definitions (e.g., `-DNDEBUG`, `-DBOOST_ENABLE_ASSERT_HANDLER`) to control the behavior of Boost assertions.
        *   `NDEBUG`: Typically disables assertions in release builds (standard C++ behavior).
        *   `BOOST_ENABLE_ASSERT_HANDLER`: Enables a custom assertion handler.
        *   `BOOST_DISABLE_ASSERTS`: Disables Boost assertions entirely.
    3.  **Create Build Configurations:** Define different build configurations (e.g., "Debug", "Release", "Debug-Release") with different levels of assertion enabling.
        *   **Debug:** Enable all assertions.
        *   **Release:** Disable most assertions (using `NDEBUG`).
        *   **Debug-Release:** Enable a subset of assertions (e.g., using a custom assertion handler or a specific preprocessor define).
    4.  **Custom Assertion Handler (Optional):** If you define `BOOST_ENABLE_ASSERT_HANDLER`, you must provide a custom assertion handler function (e.g., `void boost::assertion_failed(char const * expr, char const * function, char const * file, long line)`). This handler can log the assertion failure, throw an exception, or take other appropriate actions.
    5. **Use `BOOST_VERIFY` Sparingly:** `BOOST_VERIFY` is like `BOOST_ASSERT`, but the expression is *always* evaluated, even in release builds. Use this only when the expression has side effects that are required for correct program operation, even in release mode.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Masked Errors (Medium Severity):** Prevents critical errors from being masked in release builds due to disabled assertions.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):** Helps to detect and diagnose unexpected behavior during development and testing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Masked Errors:** Reduces the risk of masked errors by allowing for controlled assertion levels in different build configurations.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Improves the ability to detect and diagnose unexpected behavior.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example:* Partially implemented. We use `NDEBUG` for release builds, but we don't have a "Debug-Release" configuration or a custom assertion handler.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example:*  We need to define a "Debug-Release" build configuration with a suitable level of assertions.  A custom assertion handler might be beneficial for logging assertion failures.
