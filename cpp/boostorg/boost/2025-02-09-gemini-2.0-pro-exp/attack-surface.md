# Attack Surface Analysis for boostorg/boost

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data (boost::serialization)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data__boostserialization_.md)

*   **Description:**  Deserializing data from untrusted sources (e.g., network input, user-supplied files) without proper validation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Boost Contribution:**  `boost::serialization` provides powerful serialization/deserialization capabilities, but it's designed for trusted data exchange and doesn't inherently protect against malicious input. Its flexibility can be abused.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted serialized object that, upon deserialization using `boost::serialization`, instantiates a class with a manipulated virtual function table pointer (vtable), redirecting execution to attacker-controlled code.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, arbitrary code execution, data theft, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  *Never* deserialize data from untrusted sources without rigorous validation. Implement a whitelist of allowed types and verify the structure and content of the data *before* deserialization.
    *   **Alternative Serialization Formats:** For external data, prefer safer formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers. Reserve `boost::serialization` for internal, trusted communication.
    *   **Sandboxing:** If `boost::serialization` *must* be used with potentially untrusted data, perform deserialization in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Type Whitelisting:** Explicitly define which types are allowed to be deserialized using Boost.Serialization's features.
    *   **Version Control:** Ensure consistent Boost versions and class definitions.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (boost::regex)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos___boostregex_.md)

*   **Description:**  Specially crafted regular expressions or input strings can cause the regex engine to consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to a denial-of-service.
*   **Boost Contribution:**  `boost::regex` is a powerful regex engine, but like many, it's susceptible to ReDoS due to "catastrophic backtracking."
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a regex like `(a+)+$` and a long input string of "a" characters, causing exponential backtracking.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service, application unresponsiveness, resource exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regex Auditing:** Carefully review and test all regular expressions for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities. Use specialized tools.
    *   **Input Length Limits:** Restrict the length of input strings processed by regular expressions.
    *   **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for regex operations.
    *   **Alternative Regex Engines:** Consider engines with built-in ReDoS protection (though Boost.Regex has limited protection).
    *   **Avoid Nested Quantifiers:** Minimize or avoid nested quantifiers (e.g., `(a*)*`).
    *   **Atomic Grouping:** Use atomic grouping `(?>...)` to prevent backtracking.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Management Errors (Networking) (boost::asio)](./attack_surfaces/buffer_management_errors__networking___boostasio_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect handling of buffer sizes and data lengths in network operations can lead to buffer overflows or underflows.
*   **Boost Contribution:** `boost::asio` provides asynchronous networking, but incorrect usage can still lead to buffer-related vulnerabilities.  It relies on the developer to correctly manage buffers.
*   **Example:** An asynchronous read handler in `boost::asio` doesn't correctly check the number of bytes read and attempts to write past the end of a buffer.
*   **Impact:** Memory corruption, arbitrary code execution, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Buffer Management:** Always verify the number of bytes read or written. Use `boost::asio::buffer` correctly.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all data received from the network *within* the asynchronous handlers.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to detect potential buffer overflows/underflows.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review code that handles network buffers.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (Filesystem) (boost::filesystem)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__filesystem___boostfilesystem_.md)

*   **Description:** Allowing user-controlled input to directly influence file paths can enable attackers to access files outside the intended directory.
*   **Boost Contribution:** `boost::filesystem` provides file/directory manipulation, but doesn't inherently prevent path traversal if used insecurely. It provides the *tools*, but the developer is responsible for using them safely.
*   **Example:** An application uses `boost::filesystem::path` to construct a file path based on unsanitized user input like "../../etc/passwd".
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized file access, data leakage, potential system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided file paths *before* using them.
    *   **Whitelist Approach:** Use a whitelist of allowed characters and paths.
    *   **Avoid Direct Construction:** Avoid constructing file paths directly from user input.
    *   **Canonicalization:** Use `boost::filesystem::canonical` to resolve paths to their absolute form *before* security checks.
