# Attack Surface Analysis for boostorg/boost

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting the process of converting serialized data back into objects. If untrusted data is deserialized, malicious payloads can be injected, leading to arbitrary code execution or other harmful actions.

**How Boost Contributes:** Boost.Serialization provides the functionality to serialize and deserialize C++ objects. If used to deserialize data from untrusted sources (e.g., network, files), it can become an entry point for exploits.

**Example:** An application receives serialized data from a remote server using Boost.Serialization. A malicious actor crafts a serialized object that, upon deserialization, executes arbitrary commands on the application's host.

**Impact:** Critical

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid deserializing untrusted data:** The most effective mitigation is to avoid deserializing data from sources that cannot be fully trusted.
* **Implement strict input validation:** If deserialization from untrusted sources is necessary, implement rigorous validation of the serialized data structure and content *before* deserialization.
* **Use secure serialization alternatives:** Consider using alternative serialization formats (e.g., JSON, Protocol Buffers) with robust security features and less inherent risk of code execution during deserialization.
* **Restrict deserialization privileges:** If possible, run the deserialization process with minimal privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
* **Code auditing:** Regularly audit code that uses Boost.Serialization to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

**Description:** Crafting malicious regular expressions that cause the regex engine to consume excessive CPU time and memory, leading to a denial of service.

**How Boost Contributes:** Boost.Regex provides a powerful regular expression engine. Poorly written or overly complex regular expressions, especially when processing user-supplied patterns or input, can be vulnerable to ReDoS.

**Example:** An application uses Boost.Regex to validate user input. An attacker provides a specially crafted regular expression that takes an extremely long time to process, tying up server resources and potentially crashing the application.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Carefully design regular expressions:** Avoid overly complex or nested patterns that can lead to excessive backtracking.
* **Set timeouts for regex matching:** Implement timeouts for regex operations to prevent them from running indefinitely.
* **Input validation and sanitization:** Sanitize user-provided regex patterns or input strings to remove potentially malicious constructs.
* **Use simpler regex if possible:** If the matching task is simple, consider using simpler string searching algorithms instead of complex regular expressions.
* **Regular expression analysis tools:** Utilize tools that can analyze regular expressions for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflows/Underruns in Network Operations](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflowsunderruns_in_network_operations.md)

**Description:** Writing data beyond the allocated buffer in memory (overflow) or reading data before it's available (underrun) during network communication.

**How Boost Contributes:** Boost.Asio is used for network programming. Incorrectly handling buffer sizes or data lengths when receiving or sending data using `boost::asio::buffer` or similar mechanisms can lead to these vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An application using Boost.Asio receives network data into a fixed-size buffer without properly checking the incoming data length. If the received data exceeds the buffer size, it can overwrite adjacent memory locations.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use dynamic buffers:** Employ dynamic buffers that automatically resize as needed to accommodate incoming data.
* **Strict bounds checking:** Always perform thorough bounds checking on data being read or written to buffers.
* **Use safe I/O functions:** Utilize Boost.Asio's mechanisms for safe data handling and avoid direct memory manipulation where possible.
* **Limit buffer sizes:** Impose reasonable limits on the size of network buffers to prevent excessive memory allocation.
* **Code reviews and testing:** Carefully review network-related code and perform thorough testing, including sending large or malformed data packets.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Exploiting insufficient validation of file paths provided by users or external sources to access files or directories outside the intended scope.

**How Boost Contributes:** Boost.Filesystem provides functionalities for manipulating files and directories. If user-provided paths are not properly sanitized before being used with Boost.Filesystem functions, attackers can potentially access sensitive files.

**Example:** An application uses Boost.Filesystem to read a file specified by a user. An attacker provides a path like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` which, if not validated, could allow them to read sensitive system files.

**Impact:** High

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict input validation and sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided file paths. Reject paths containing `..` or absolute paths if they are not expected.
* **Use canonical paths:** Convert user-provided paths to their canonical form to resolve symbolic links and eliminate relative path components.
* **Restrict file access permissions:** Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary file system permissions.
* **Chroot environments:** Consider using chroot environments to isolate the application's file system access.
