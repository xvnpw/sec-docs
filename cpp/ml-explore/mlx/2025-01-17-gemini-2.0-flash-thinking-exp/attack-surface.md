# Attack Surface Analysis for ml-explore/mlx

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Model Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_model_loading.md)

**Description:** The application loads a model file that has been intentionally crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in MLX's model parsing or deserialization logic.
* **How MLX Contributes:** MLX provides the functionality to load and interpret model files. If this process is not robust against malicious input, it creates an attack vector.
* **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted `.safetensors` or other supported model format file containing malicious data that, when parsed by MLX, triggers a buffer overflow or allows for arbitrary code execution.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or client running the application, denial of service, or information disclosure.
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Model Source Validation:**  Only load models from trusted and verified sources. Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of model files (e.g., using cryptographic signatures).
    * **Input Sanitization (Model Files):**  While difficult, explore if any pre-processing or validation can be done on the model file structure before passing it to MLX.
    * **Sandboxing:** Run the model loading process in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to contain potential damage.
    * **Regular MLX Updates:** Keep MLX updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal during Model Loading](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_during_model_loading.md)

**Description:** The application constructs the path to the model file based on user input without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to access or overwrite arbitrary files on the system.
* **How MLX Contributes:** MLX's model loading functions often take a file path as input. If the application doesn't properly sanitize this path, it becomes vulnerable.
* **Example:** A user provides an input like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` as the model file path, and the application directly passes this to MLX's loading function, potentially exposing sensitive system files.
* **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive files), potential for arbitrary file overwrite leading to system compromise.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any user-provided input that influences file paths.
    * **Path Allowlisting:**  Only allow loading models from a predefined set of safe directories.
    * **Avoid User-Controlled Paths:** If possible, avoid allowing users to directly specify file paths. Use identifiers or predefined options instead.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Operations (If Used)](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_operations__if_used_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes custom operations or extensions within MLX, vulnerabilities in the implementation of these custom components can be exploited.
* **How MLX Contributes:** MLX provides the framework for defining and integrating custom operations. If these operations are not implemented securely, they introduce risk.
* **Example:** A custom operation written in C++ has a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by specific input data passed through MLX.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Secure Coding Practices for Custom Operations:**  Follow secure coding practices when developing custom operations, including thorough input validation, bounds checking, and memory management.
    * **Code Reviews and Security Audits:**  Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits of custom operation implementations.
    * **Sandboxing for Custom Operations:** If possible, run custom operations in a sandboxed environment.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in MLX Bindings (Python or C++)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_mlx_bindings__python_or_c++_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist in the Python or C++ bindings provided by MLX, allowing attackers to interact with the underlying MLX engine in unintended ways.
* **How MLX Contributes:** MLX provides these bindings as the primary interface for interacting with the library.
* **Example:** A vulnerability in the Python API allows an attacker to bypass security checks or directly access internal MLX structures.
* **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
* **Risk Severity:** **High**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Regular MLX Updates:** Keep MLX updated to benefit from security patches in the bindings.
    * **Follow Secure Coding Practices When Using Bindings:**  Avoid potentially unsafe operations or patterns when interacting with the MLX bindings.
