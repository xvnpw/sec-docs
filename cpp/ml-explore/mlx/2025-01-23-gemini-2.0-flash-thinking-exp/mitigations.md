## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for MLX Operations](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_mlx_operations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Validation and Sanitization for MLX Operations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify MLX Input Points:**  Locate all points in your code where external data is directly fed into MLX functions (e.g., `mlx.array()`, model inference calls, data loading for MLX arrays).
    2.  **Define Expected MLX Data Types and Shapes:** Determine the precise data types and array shapes expected by MLX functions for each input point. Refer to MLX documentation for expected input formats.
    3.  **Validate Data Before MLX Conversion:** Before converting external data to MLX arrays or using it in MLX operations, implement validation checks.
        *   **Type Checks:** Ensure data is of the correct numerical type (e.g., `float32`, `int64`) expected by MLX.
        *   **Shape Checks:** Verify that array shapes match the expected dimensions for MLX operations and model inputs.
        *   **Range Checks:** For numerical inputs, validate that values are within acceptable ranges to prevent overflows or unexpected behavior in MLX computations.
    4.  **Sanitize String Inputs for MLX File Paths:** If MLX is used to load models or data from file paths derived from user input, sanitize these paths to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. Ensure paths are within expected directories and free of malicious characters before being used in MLX file loading functions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow in MLX Computations (High Severity):** Malicious inputs can cause overflows/underflows during MLX numerical operations, leading to crashes or incorrect results.
    *   **Path Traversal via MLX File Loading (High Severity):** Unsanitized file paths used with MLX can allow attackers to access arbitrary files.
    *   **Denial of Service due to Invalid MLX Input (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect data types or shapes can cause MLX to crash or consume excessive resources.
    *   **Model Corruption/Unexpected Behavior due to Malformed MLX Input (Medium Severity):**  Invalid inputs to MLX models can lead to unpredictable model outputs or internal errors.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces risks associated with malformed input data interacting with MLX, preventing crashes, exploits, and unexpected behavior.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic type checks might exist, but comprehensive validation specifically for MLX input requirements is likely missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Detailed validation of data types, array shapes, and ranges *specifically* for all points where external data interfaces with MLX functions. String sanitization for file paths used in MLX model/data loading.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Model Security and Provenance for MLX Loading](./mitigation_strategies/model_security_and_provenance_for_mlx_loading.md)
