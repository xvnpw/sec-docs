# Threat Model Analysis for simdjson/simdjson

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Large JSON Payloads](./threats/denial_of_service_through_large_json_payloads.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large JSON payload to the application. `simdjson` attempts to parse this large payload, consuming excessive memory and CPU resources. This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.

**Impact:** Application becomes unavailable to users. Potential data loss if the application crashes during a transaction. Negative impact on user experience and reputation.

**Affected Component:** Parser Core (specifically the memory allocation and processing logic)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement maximum size limits for incoming JSON payloads. Monitor resource usage (CPU and memory) during JSON parsing. Implement timeouts for parsing operations.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Deeply Nested JSON](./threats/denial_of_service_through_deeply_nested_json.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends JSON with an excessive level of nesting. When `simdjson` attempts to parse this deeply nested structure, it can lead to stack overflow errors, causing the application to crash.

**Impact:** Application crash and unavailability. Potential data loss if the crash occurs during a transaction.

**Affected Component:** Parser Core (specifically the recursive parsing logic or stack usage)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement limits on the maximum depth of nested JSON structures allowed. Consider iterative parsing approaches if feasible (though `simdjson` is primarily a DOM parser).

## Threat: [Exploitation of Parsing Vulnerabilities in Malformed JSON](./threats/exploitation_of_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_malformed_json.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts intentionally malformed JSON input that exploits a vulnerability within `simdjson`'s parsing logic. This could lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or potentially even remote code execution if a severe vulnerability exists in `simdjson`.

**Impact:** Application crash, data corruption, potential for remote code execution leading to full system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Parser Core (various parsing stages depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for crashes and memory corruption)

**Mitigation Strategies:** Keep `simdjson` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. Implement robust error handling around the parsing process to gracefully handle parsing failures. Consider using fuzzing techniques on `simdjson` with various malformed JSON inputs to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Memory Exhaustion due to Parsing Inefficiencies or Bugs](./threats/memory_exhaustion_due_to_parsing_inefficiencies_or_bugs.md)

**Description:**  Due to bugs or inefficiencies within `simdjson`, parsing certain valid or even slightly malformed JSON inputs could lead to excessive memory allocation that is not properly released. Repeatedly sending such inputs could exhaust the application's available memory, leading to crashes.

**Impact:** Application crash due to out-of-memory errors.

**Affected Component:** Memory Management within `simdjson`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Monitor memory usage during JSON parsing. Keep `simdjson` updated to benefit from potential memory leak fixes. Consider using memory profiling tools to analyze memory usage during parsing.

## Threat: [Bugs in SIMD Implementation Leading to Incorrect Parsing](./threats/bugs_in_simd_implementation_leading_to_incorrect_parsing.md)

**Description:** `simdjson` relies heavily on SIMD instructions for performance. Bugs within the SIMD implementation for specific CPU architectures or instruction sets could lead to incorrect parsing of valid JSON data, resulting in data corruption or unexpected application behavior.

**Impact:** Data corruption, incorrect application logic execution based on faulty parsed data, potential security vulnerabilities if the incorrect parsing leads to bypasses.

**Affected Component:** SIMD Implementation Modules (architecture-specific code)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Rely on the maintainers of `simdjson` to identify and fix such bugs through rigorous testing and community feedback. Stay updated with the latest versions. Consider the maturity and testing practices of the `simdjson` project.

## Threat: [Integer Overflows or Underflows in Internal Calculations](./threats/integer_overflows_or_underflows_in_internal_calculations.md)

**Description:** Bugs within `simdjson`'s internal calculations, such as when handling string lengths or array sizes, could lead to integer overflows or underflows. This could cause unexpected behavior, memory corruption, or potentially exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, application crash, potential for exploitation if the overflow can be controlled by the attacker.

**Affected Component:** Internal Calculation Logic within various parsing stages

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Rely on the maintainers of `simdjson` to address such issues through secure coding practices and testing. Static analysis tools used by the `simdjson` developers can help mitigate this.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption Bugs in `simdjson`](./threats/memory_corruption_bugs_in__simdjson_.md)

**Description:** Bugs within `simdjson`'s memory management (e.g., incorrect allocation, deallocation, or buffer overflows) could lead to memory corruption. This can cause crashes, unpredictable behavior, and potentially create opportunities for attackers to inject malicious code.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential for remote code execution if memory corruption can be exploited.

**Affected Component:** Memory Management within `simdjson`

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if exploitable for RCE), High (for crashes and unpredictable behavior)

**Mitigation Strategies:** Rely on the maintainers of `simdjson` to address such issues through careful memory management practices and testing. Memory safety tools and techniques used during `simdjson` development are crucial.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attacks Targeting `simdjson`](./threats/dependency_confusionsupply_chain_attacks_targeting__simdjson_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially introduce a malicious version of the `simdjson` library or one of its dependencies into the application's build process. This malicious library could contain backdoors or vulnerabilities that compromise the application's security.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** The `simdjson` library itself or its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Use dependency management tools with integrity checks (e.g., verifying checksums or using lock files). Pin specific versions of `simdjson` and its dependencies. Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities and ensure they are obtained from trusted sources.
