# Attack Surface Analysis for simdjson/simdjson

## Attack Surface: [Large Input Size Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/large_input_size_vulnerability.md)

**Description:**  An attacker provides an extremely large JSON payload to the application.

**How simdjson Contributes to Attack Surface:** While designed for performance, `simdjson` still needs to allocate memory to parse the input. Unbounded input size can lead to excessive memory consumption within `simdjson`.

**Example:** An attacker sends a multi-gigabyte JSON file to an API endpoint that uses `simdjson` to parse it.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting server memory, making the application unresponsive due to `simdjson`'s memory usage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement maximum request size limits *before* passing the data to `simdjson`.
* Consider streaming or chunked processing of large JSON payloads if the application architecture allows, to avoid loading the entire input into `simdjson` at once.

## Attack Surface: [Deeply Nested Objects/Arrays Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/deeply_nested_objectsarrays_vulnerability.md)

**Description:**  An attacker crafts a JSON payload with an excessive number of nested objects or arrays.

**How simdjson Contributes to Attack Surface:** Parsing deeply nested structures can lead to increased stack usage or excessive recursion *within the `simdjson` parser itself*, potentially leading to stack overflow errors in `simdjson`.

**Example:** A JSON payload like `{"a": {"b": {"c": ... } } }` with thousands of nested levels that overwhelms `simdjson`'s parsing stack.

**Impact:** Application crash due to a stack overflow within `simdjson`, potentially leading to DoS.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum depth of JSON structures allowed by the application *before* parsing with `simdjson`.
* Review `simdjson`'s documentation for any configuration options related to nesting limits (if available).
