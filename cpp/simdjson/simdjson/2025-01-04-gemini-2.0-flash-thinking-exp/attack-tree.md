## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application via simdjson [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_via_simdjson__critical_.md)

This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. All subsequent nodes and paths aim to achieve this objective. Mitigation at lower levels aims to prevent reaching this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit simdjson Parsing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_simdjson_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

This node represents the primary attack surface related to `simdjson`. Exploiting parsing vulnerabilities is a common and often effective way to compromise applications that process external data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Parser Crash/Error [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_parser_crasherror__critical_.md)

Successfully causing the `simdjson` parser to crash or throw an error can lead to denial of service if the application doesn't handle these situations gracefully. This can disrupt the application's functionality and availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Send Malformed JSON (High-Risk Path) ***](./attack_tree_paths/send_malformed_json__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Inject Invalid Characters
    * **Description:** The attacker sends JSON data containing characters that are not allowed according to the JSON specification.
    * **Likelihood:** High - It is easy for an attacker to introduce invalid characters.
    * **Impact:** Low (if handled), Medium (if crashes) - If the application has proper error handling, the impact might be minimal. However, if the parsing error leads to an unhandled exception or crash, it can cause a denial of service.
    * **Effort:** Low - Requires minimal effort to craft such payloads.
    * **Skill Level:** Novice - Requires basic understanding of JSON syntax.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected through input validation or by monitoring error logs for parsing failures.
* **Attack Vector:** Violate JSON Structure (e.g., unmatched brackets)
    * **Description:** The attacker sends JSON data with structural errors, such as missing closing brackets or incorrect nesting.
    * **Likelihood:** High -  Easy to introduce structural errors.
    * **Impact:** Low (if handled), Medium (if crashes) - Similar to invalid characters, proper error handling is key.
    * **Effort:** Low - Simple to create malformed structures.
    * **Skill Level:** Novice - Requires basic understanding of JSON structure.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detectable through input validation or parsing error logs.
* **Attack Vector:** Send Incomplete JSON
    * **Description:** The attacker sends a JSON payload that is truncated or missing required parts.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Can occur due to transmission errors or intentional manipulation.
    * **Impact:** Low (if handled), Medium (if crashes) - Depends on the application's robustness in handling incomplete data.
    * **Effort:** Low - Easy to truncate or partially send data.
    * **Skill Level:** Novice - Requires basic understanding of data transmission.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detectable through timeout errors or parsing failures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Resource Exhaustion during Parsing [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_resource_exhaustion_during_parsing__critical_.md)

This node represents a denial-of-service attack vector where the attacker aims to overload the application by forcing it to consume excessive resources during JSON parsing.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** Trigger Resource Exhaustion during Parsing (High-Risk Path) ***](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_resource_exhaustion_during_parsing__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Send Extremely Large JSON Payload
    * **Description:** The attacker sends a JSON payload that is excessively large in size.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Attackers can easily generate large files.
    * **Impact:** High (DoS) - Processing extremely large JSON can consume excessive memory and CPU, leading to application slowdown or complete unavailability.
    * **Effort:** Low - Simple to generate large text files.
    * **Skill Level:** Novice - Requires basic understanding of file sizes.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detectable by monitoring memory and CPU usage or by implementing size limits on incoming requests.
* **Attack Vector:** Send JSON with Highly Redundant Data
    * **Description:** The attacker sends a JSON payload with a large amount of repetitive or redundant data, forcing the parser to perform unnecessary operations.
    * **Likelihood:** Low - Requires more deliberate crafting of the payload.
    * **Impact:** Low (performance degradation), Medium (potential for amplified DoS) - Can lead to performance degradation and, in some cases, contribute to a denial of service if the redundancy is extreme.
    * **Effort:** Medium - Requires some effort to create redundant structures.
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate - Requires a slightly better understanding of JSON structure and parsing.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - More difficult to detect than simply large payloads, but analysis of request content could reveal redundancy.
