## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_.md)

*   **1.1. CPU Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **1.1.1. Crafted JSON Input causing excessive backtracking/recursion (OR)**
        *   **1.1.1.1. Deeply nested JSON objects/arrays exceeding implementation limits. [HIGH-RISK] [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker sends a JSON document with a very large number of nested objects (`{}`) or arrays (`[]`).  This can exhaust stack space or cause excessive recursion within the parser, leading to a denial of service.  simdjson *does* have checks for nesting depth, but an attacker might try to find edge cases or bypass these checks.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (DoS)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (high CPU usage, slow responses, potentially crashes)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Strictly enforce a maximum nesting depth limit *before* passing the JSON to simdjson.  This limit should be significantly lower than any internal limits within simdjson itself, providing a safety margin.
                *   Fuzz testing with deeply nested structures.
                *   Monitor CPU usage and response times.

    *   **1.1.2. Triggering excessive memory allocation (OR) [HIGH-RISK]**
        *   **1.1.2.1. Extremely large JSON document exceeding available memory. [HIGH-RISK] [CRITICAL]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker sends a JSON document that is simply too large to fit in the available memory.  This can lead to out-of-memory errors, crashes, and a denial of service.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (DoS, potential crash)
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Novice
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (memory usage monitoring, application crashes)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Strictly enforce a maximum document size limit *before* passing the JSON to simdjson.  This is the primary defense.
                *   Implement system-level memory limits (e.g., using `ulimit` or `setrlimit` on Linux).
                *   Monitor memory usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Information Leak](./attack_tree_paths/2__information_leak.md)

*    **3.2. Leaking Internal State**
    *   **3.2.1. Exploiting error messages or debugging information (if exposed) to reveal internal data structures or memory layouts. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** If simdjson's error messages are directly exposed to the user (e.g., in an API response), they might reveal information about the internal workings of the parser, memory addresses, or even parts of the parsed JSON document.  This information could be used by an attacker to craft more sophisticated attacks.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Low to Medium (depends on the information leaked)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (if verbose error messages are exposed; harder if only subtle hints are leaked)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Never expose raw error messages from simdjson to the user.**  Always sanitize error messages and provide generic responses to the client.
            *   Log detailed error messages internally for debugging purposes.
            *   Ensure that debugging information is not enabled in production builds.
