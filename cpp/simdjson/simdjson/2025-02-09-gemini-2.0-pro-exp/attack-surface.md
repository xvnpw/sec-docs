# Attack Surface Analysis for simdjson/simdjson

## Attack Surface: [Critical: Input Validation and Sanitization](./attack_surfaces/critical_input_validation_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**  simdjson relies on well-formed JSON input.  Maliciously crafted, deeply nested, or excessively large JSON documents can cause excessive memory allocation, potentially leading to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or even crashes due to out-of-memory conditions.  This is especially true if the application doesn't properly validate the size and structure of the JSON before parsing.
*   **How simdjson contributes:** simdjson's performance optimizations rely on assumptions about the structure of the JSON.  Unexpected or malicious input can trigger edge cases that lead to excessive resource consumption or undefined behavior.
*   **Example:**  A deeply nested JSON object with millions of nested arrays or objects, or a JSON document with extremely long strings, could cause excessive memory allocation.  A JSON document with invalid UTF-8 encoding could also cause problems.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution (in extreme, unvalidated cases).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation *before* passing data to simdjson.  This includes checking the overall size of the JSON document, maximum nesting depth, maximum string lengths, and ensuring valid UTF-8 encoding.  Reject any input that exceeds predefined limits.
    *   **Resource Limits:**  Set reasonable limits on memory allocation for JSON parsing.  Consider using a streaming parser if dealing with very large JSON documents to avoid loading the entire document into memory at once.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to test the parser with a wide variety of malformed and edge-case JSON inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Memory Safety:** Consider using a memory-safe language (like Rust) for the parsing component if feasible, to mitigate memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [High: Integer Overflow/Underflow](./attack_surfaces/high_integer_overflowunderflow.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect handling of large integer values within the JSON document can lead to integer overflows or underflows, potentially causing unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
*   **How simdjson contributes:** While simdjson itself handles large numbers, the application code *using* the parsed values must correctly handle potential overflows/underflows when converting to native integer types.
*   **Example:**  A JSON document containing a number larger than the maximum value representable by the target integer type (e.g., `int64_t`) could lead to an overflow.
*   **Impact:**  Incorrect calculations, data corruption, potential security vulnerabilities if the overflowed value is used in security-critical operations.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Range Checks:**  Always validate that parsed numeric values are within the expected range for the target data type before using them.
    *   **Use Larger Types:** Consider using larger integer types (e.g., `int64_t` instead of `int32_t`) if there's a possibility of encountering large numbers.
    *   **Arbitrary-Precision Arithmetic:** For extremely large numbers, consider using a library that supports arbitrary-precision arithmetic.

## Attack Surface: [High: String Handling Issues](./attack_surfaces/high_string_handling_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper handling of escaped characters, Unicode, or very long strings within the JSON can lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **How simdjson contributes:** While simdjson handles UTF-8, incorrect assumptions about string lengths or improper handling of escaped characters in the application code can lead to issues.
*   **Example:**  A JSON string containing a large number of escaped characters could potentially lead to excessive memory allocation or buffer overflows in the application code if not handled correctly. Malformed UTF-8 sequences could also cause problems.
*   **Impact:**  Buffer overflows, denial-of-service, potential for code injection (depending on how the string data is used).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful String Handling:**  Use appropriate string handling functions that are aware of UTF-8 encoding and potential escape sequences.
    *   **Length Limits:**  Enforce reasonable limits on the length of strings within the JSON.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate that strings conform to expected formats and character sets.

## Attack Surface: [High: Error Handling](./attack_surfaces/high_error_handling.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper handling of errors returned by simdjson can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.
*   **How simdjson contributes:** simdjson uses error codes to indicate parsing failures. If these errors are not checked and handled correctly, the application may continue to operate on invalid data.
*   **Example:**  Attempting to access a value from a JSON object that failed to parse, without checking the error code, could lead to a crash or undefined behavior.
*   **Impact:**  Application crashes, unpredictable behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if error handling is bypassed.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Error Checking:**  Always check the return values of simdjson functions and handle errors appropriately.
    *   **Graceful Degradation:**  Design the application to gracefully handle parsing failures, such as by logging the error, returning an error response, or falling back to a default behavior.

## Attack Surface: [High: Performance Degradation (DoS Vector)](./attack_surfaces/high_performance_degradation__dos_vector_.md)

*   **Description:**  Specially crafted JSON input, even if valid, can sometimes trigger worst-case performance scenarios in simdjson, leading to excessive CPU usage and denial of service.
*   **How simdjson contributes:** While simdjson is generally very fast, certain input patterns (e.g., deeply nested objects or arrays with specific characteristics) can cause performance degradation.
*   **Example:**  A JSON document with a very large number of small, nested objects might cause excessive recursion or other performance bottlenecks.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of service, reduced application responsiveness.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Limit the complexity of the JSON structure (e.g., maximum nesting depth, maximum number of elements in an array).
    *   **Timeouts:**  Implement timeouts for JSON parsing operations to prevent the application from hanging indefinitely.
    *   **Profiling:**  Profile the application with realistic and potentially malicious JSON data to identify performance bottlenecks.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Limit the amount of CPU and memory that can be consumed by the JSON parsing process.
