# Threat Model Analysis for simdjson/simdjson

## Threat: [Deeply Nested JSON DoS](./threats/deeply_nested_json_dos.md)

*   **Threat:** Deeply Nested JSON DoS

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with excessively deep nesting (e.g., `[[[[[[[[...]]]]]]]]]`).  Extreme depths *might* trigger resource exhaustion (stack overflow, excessive memory allocation) or performance degradation within `simdjson`'s parsing logic, even with its optimized design.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) – the application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to `simdjson`'s failure.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `dom::parser`, specifically the recursive descent parsing logic and internal stack management. The `document` and `element` classes might also be affected due to the deep object hierarchy.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pre-Parsing Input Validation (Limit Depth):** Implement a limit on the maximum nesting depth *before* passing the input to `simdjson`. This is the most effective mitigation.
        *   **Resource Limits (OS/Runtime):** Configure the operating system or application runtime to enforce limits on stack size and memory allocation, providing a secondary layer of defense.

## Threat: [Extremely Long String DoS](./threats/extremely_long_string_dos.md)

*   **Threat:** Extremely Long String DoS

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload containing extremely long strings.  This could overwhelm `simdjson`'s string handling routines, leading to excessive memory allocation or CPU consumption during parsing and UTF-8 validation *within simdjson*.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) – the application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to `simdjson`'s resource exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `dom::parser`, specifically the string parsing and UTF-8 validation routines (`simdjson::validate_utf8`). Internal string representations are also relevant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Pre-Parsing Input Validation (Limit Length):** Implement a limit on the maximum string length *before* passing the input to `simdjson`. This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Memory Limits (OS/Runtime):** Configure the operating system or application runtime to enforce limits on memory allocation.

## Threat: [Incorrect Error Handling (leading to simdjson misuse)](./threats/incorrect_error_handling__leading_to_simdjson_misuse_.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect Error Handling (leading to simdjson misuse)

    *   **Description:** While the core issue is application-level, *if* `simdjson` has subtle error-handling edge cases that are not clearly documented, or *if* its error codes are ambiguous, this could *directly* lead to the application misusing `simdjson` and causing a vulnerability. This is a subtle but important distinction – the threat originates from a potential deficiency in `simdjson`'s error reporting or documentation.
    *   **Impact:** Undefined behavior, potentially leading to crashes, incorrect results, or security vulnerabilities, *because* the application incorrectly believes `simdjson` succeeded.
    *   **Affected Component:** All `simdjson` API functions that return an `error_code`. The clarity and completeness of `simdjson`'s documentation are also crucial.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **simdjson-side:** Improve error code clarity and documentation. Provide comprehensive examples of correct error handling.
        *   **Application-side (as a workaround):** Extremely defensive programming when using `simdjson`. Assume *any* non-success error code could indicate a serious problem. Log extensively. Consider redundant parsing with a different library if feasible and the data is critical.
        * **Fuzz Testing:** Thoroughly fuzz test the application's `simdjson` integration with a wide range of invalid inputs, specifically focusing on edge cases that might trigger subtle error conditions.
