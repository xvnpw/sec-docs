# Attack Tree Analysis for simdjson/simdjson

Objective: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Compromise Application Using simdjson (CRITICAL NODE)
    *   Exploit Parsing Logic Errors in simdjson (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
        *   Trigger Integer Overflow in Size Calculations (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            *   Cause buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    *   Exploit Memory Management Issues in simdjson (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
        *   Trigger Heap Overflow (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            *   Overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to code execution (HIGH-RISK PATH)
        *   Trigger Use-After-Free Vulnerability (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            *   Access freed memory, potentially leading to crashes or code execution (HIGH-RISK PATH)
    *   Exploit Application's Use of Parsed Data (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)
        *   Inject Malicious Data into Application Logic (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            *   If the application trusts the parsed data without validation, attackers can inject malicious data to manipulate application behavior. (HIGH-RISK PATH)
        *   Trigger Secondary Vulnerabilities Based on Parsed Data (HIGH-RISK PATH)
            *   If the parsed data is used in further operations (e.g., database queries, system calls), vulnerabilities in those operations can be triggered. (HIGH-RISK PATH)
