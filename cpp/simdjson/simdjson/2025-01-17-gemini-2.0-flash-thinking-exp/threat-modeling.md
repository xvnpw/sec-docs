# Threat Model Analysis for simdjson/simdjson

## Threat: [Excessive Memory Consumption due to Large JSON Payload](./threats/excessive_memory_consumption_due_to_large_json_payload.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends an intentionally large JSON payload to the application's endpoint that uses `simdjson` for parsing. This payload is designed to exceed available memory or processing capacity *within `simdjson`'s parsing process*.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, leading to denial of service for legitimate users. The server hosting the application might crash or become unstable due to `simdjson` consuming excessive resources.

**Affected Component:** `simdjson`'s parsing logic, specifically the memory allocation routines *within the library*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement size limits on incoming JSON payloads at the application level *before* passing it to `simdjson`.
* Monitor resource usage (memory, CPU) of the application and set up alerts for unusual spikes, particularly during JSON parsing.

## Threat: [Stack Overflow due to Deeply Nested JSON Objects](./threats/stack_overflow_due_to_deeply_nested_json_objects.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with an extremely deep level of nesting. When `simdjson` attempts to parse this deeply nested structure, it could exhaust the call stack *within `simdjson`*, leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact:** Application crashes, leading to denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `simdjson`'s parsing logic, potentially recursive or iterative functions handling object and array traversal *within the library*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum nesting depth allowed for incoming JSON payloads at the application level.
* Test the application's resilience against deeply nested JSON structures in a staging environment.

## Threat: [Exploiting Bugs in SIMD Instruction Handling](./threats/exploiting_bugs_in_simd_instruction_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a specific JSON payload that triggers a bug or vulnerability in `simdjson`'s SIMD instruction handling. This could lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption *within `simdjson`'s memory space*, or potentially even arbitrary code execution (though less likely with a parsing library).

**Impact:** Application crash, potential data corruption, or in a worst-case scenario, remote code execution *within the application's process due to a flaw in `simdjson`*.

**Affected Component:** `simdjson`'s core parsing engine, specifically the code sections utilizing SIMD instructions for performance optimization.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible), High (for crashes and memory corruption)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest `simdjson` releases and security advisories. Apply patches promptly.
* Consider using fuzzing tools against the application's JSON parsing endpoints to identify potential vulnerabilities in `simdjson`'s handling of various inputs.
