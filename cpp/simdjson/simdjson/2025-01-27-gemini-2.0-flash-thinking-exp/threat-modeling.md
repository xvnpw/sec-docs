# Threat Model Analysis for simdjson/simdjson

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow during Parsing](./threats/buffer_overflow_during_parsing.md)

Description: An attacker crafts a malicious JSON document designed to exploit vulnerabilities in `simdjson`'s memory management. By sending this crafted JSON to an application using `simdjson`, the attacker can trigger a buffer overflow. This could involve overflowing buffers used for string storage, object/array element storage, or internal parsing structures. The attacker aims to overwrite adjacent memory regions.
*   Impact: Memory corruption, application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can precisely control the overflow to overwrite critical code or data.
*   Affected Component: Core parsing logic, specifically memory allocation and handling within SIMD-optimized parsing functions (e.g., string parsing, object/array parsing).
*   Risk Severity: High to Critical
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Keep `simdjson` updated: Regularly update to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Memory Safety Tools: Utilize memory safety tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) during development and testing to detect buffer overflows.
    *   Fuzzing: Employ fuzzing techniques to test `simdjson` integration with a wide range of inputs, including potentially malicious ones.
    *   Input Size Limits: Implement limits on the maximum size of JSON documents processed by the application to reduce the attack surface.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Size Calculations](./threats/integer_overflow_in_size_calculations.md)

Description: An attacker provides a JSON document that causes integer overflows in `simdjson`'s internal calculations related to JSON structure sizes (e.g., string lengths, array/object sizes). This could be achieved by providing extremely large values for string lengths or nesting levels within the JSON. The attacker aims to cause incorrect memory allocation or parsing logic due to the overflowed integer values.
*   Impact: Incorrect parsing of JSON, memory corruption, application crash, potential for unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities due to flawed data interpretation.
*   Affected Component:  Size calculation logic within parsing functions, potentially affecting functions handling string lengths, array/object sizes, and memory allocation.
*   Risk Severity: High
*   Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Keep `simdjson` updated: Update to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes.
    *   Input Validation: Implement input validation to reject JSON documents with excessively large size parameters or nesting levels before parsing with `simdjson`.
    *   Resource Limits: Set resource limits (e.g., memory limits) for the application to mitigate the impact of potential memory exhaustion caused by integer overflows leading to large allocations.
