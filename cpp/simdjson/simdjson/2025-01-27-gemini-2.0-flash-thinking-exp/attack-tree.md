## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via simdjson Exploitation [ROOT NODE - CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_simdjson_exploitation__root_node_-_critical_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's overarching objective is to compromise the application utilizing the `simdjson` library. This is the root goal from which all attack paths originate.
*   **Why Critical:** Success at this level means the attacker has achieved their objective, potentially gaining unauthorized access, disrupting services, or manipulating application data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities in simdjson [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_simdjson__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target weaknesses in `simdjson`'s JSON parsing process itself to compromise the application.
*   **Why Critical:**  Parsing is the core function of `simdjson`. Vulnerabilities here directly impact the library's security and can be exploited by manipulating JSON input.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Trigger Memory Corruption [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__trigger_memory_corruption__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to induce memory corruption within the application by exploiting parsing flaws in `simdjson`.
*   **Why Critical & High Risk:** Memory corruption vulnerabilities are highly severe. They can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to gain full control of the application and potentially the underlying system. Even with a medium likelihood, the critical impact makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__buffer_overflow__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to write data beyond the allocated buffer size during `simdjson` parsing, overwriting adjacent memory regions.
*   **Why Critical & High Risk:** Buffer overflows are a classic memory corruption vulnerability. They are relatively well-understood and can be exploited to inject and execute malicious code. The combination of medium likelihood and critical impact makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Provide Oversized JSON Input [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__provide_oversized_json_input__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's method to trigger a buffer overflow is to supply JSON input that is larger than what `simdjson`'s buffers are designed to handle.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Crafting oversized JSON input is straightforward for an attacker.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Successful buffer overflow can lead to code execution and system compromise.
    *   **Effort:** Medium - Requires basic understanding of buffer overflows and JSON structure.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium - Basic exploit development skills are needed.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Crashes or memory errors might be logged, but subtle exploits can be harder to detect.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input validation and sanitization of parsed JSON data.
        *   Regular updates of `simdjson`.
        *   Fuzz testing focusing on buffer overflow conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Cause Denial of Service (DoS) via Parsing [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/6__cause_denial_of_service__dos__via_parsing__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers aim to disrupt application availability by making `simdjson` consume excessive resources during parsing, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Why High Risk:** DoS attacks can significantly impact application availability and business operations. While the impact is medium (service disruption), the medium likelihood makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. CPU Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/7__cpu_exhaustion__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's method to cause DoS is to make `simdjson` consume excessive CPU cycles during parsing, slowing down or crashing the application.
*   **Why High Risk:** CPU exhaustion can render the application unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Provide Complex/Nested JSON [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/8__provide_complexnested_json__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's method to trigger CPU exhaustion is to provide highly complex or deeply nested JSON structures that increase parsing time significantly.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Generating complex JSON is relatively easy.
    *   **Impact:** Medium - Service disruption, application slowdown.
    *   **Effort:** Low - Simple JSON crafting.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic understanding of JSON structure.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - High CPU usage, slow response times are easily observable.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Resource limits on JSON parsing (e.g., maximum nesting depth).
        *   Timeouts for parsing operations.
        *   Monitoring CPU usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Memory Exhaustion [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/9__memory_exhaustion__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's method to cause DoS is to force `simdjson` to allocate excessive memory during parsing, leading to memory exhaustion and application crash.
*   **Why High Risk:** Memory exhaustion can lead to application crashes and service unavailability.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Provide Extremely Large JSON Input [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/10__provide_extremely_large_json_input__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's method to trigger memory exhaustion is to send very large JSON documents (in terms of size and number of elements).
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium - Easy to generate large JSON files or stream large JSON data.
    *   **Impact:** Medium - Service disruption, application crash due to Out-Of-Memory (OOM) errors.
    *   **Effort:** Low - Simple file generation or scripting.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low - Basic scripting skills.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy - High memory usage, OOM errors are readily detectable.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Resource limits on JSON parsing (e.g., maximum JSON size).
        *   Monitoring memory usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Exploit Integer Overflows/Underflows [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/11__exploit_integer_overflowsunderflows__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers aim to trigger integer overflows or underflows in `simdjson`'s internal calculations, potentially leading to memory corruption or DoS.
*   **Why Critical:** Integer overflows, while potentially less likely in modern systems, can still lead to critical memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Trigger Integer Overflow in Size Calculations [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/12__trigger_integer_overflow_in_size_calculations__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's method is to cause an integer overflow in calculations related to JSON element sizes, string lengths, or buffer sizes within `simdjson`.
*   **Why Critical:** Integer overflows in size calculations can directly lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [13. Provide JSON Designed to Cause Overflow in Length/Size Variables [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/13__provide_json_designed_to_cause_overflow_in_lengthsize_variables__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts JSON with extremely long strings, very large arrays, or deeply nested structures specifically designed to cause integer overflows when `simdjson` calculates sizes or lengths internally.
*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Low - Integer overflows are less common in modern C++ due to compiler mitigations, but still possible.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Memory corruption, potential code execution.
    *   **Effort:** High - Requires deep understanding of integer limits and size calculations within `simdjson`.
    *   **Skill Level:** High - Security Expert, Reverse Engineer.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Overflows can be subtle and might lead to delayed or indirect errors.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Careful code review of size and length calculations in `simdjson` (if possible, as a user of the library).
        *   Using safe integer operations in application logic when handling sizes from parsed JSON.
        *   Fuzz testing focusing on edge cases and large values that could trigger overflows.
