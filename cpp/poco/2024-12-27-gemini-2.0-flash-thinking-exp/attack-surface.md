*   **Attack Surface:** Buffer Overflow in Network Protocol Parsing
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arise when parsing network protocols (e.g., HTTP headers) where the size of the incoming data is not properly validated, leading to a buffer overflow.
    *   **How Poco Contributes:** Poco's networking components, such as `Poco::Net::HTTPServer` or `Poco::Net::Socket`, handle the reception and parsing of network data. If the application uses these components without careful size checks, it can be vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with an excessively long header that exceeds the buffer allocated by the application using Poco's HTTP server classes.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or application crash.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate and sanitize all data received from network sources *before* processing it with Poco's networking classes.
        *   Use Poco's classes and methods that provide built-in size limitations or safe buffer handling.
        *   Regularly review and audit the code that handles network input using Poco.

*   **Attack Surface:** XML External Entity (XXE) Injection
    *   **Description:**  Occurs when an XML parser processes external entities defined within an XML document. If external entity processing is not disabled, attackers can potentially access local files, internal network resources, or cause denial of service.
    *   **How Poco Contributes:** Poco provides XML parsing capabilities through classes like `Poco::XML::DOMParser`. If the application uses this parser without explicitly disabling external entity resolution, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends an XML payload to the application that includes a malicious external entity definition pointing to a local file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) or an internal network resource.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service, server-side request forgery (SSRF).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable external entity resolution in Poco's XML parser. This can typically be done by setting specific parser features or options.
        *   Sanitize or validate XML input to remove or neutralize potentially malicious external entity declarations.
        *   Use alternative data formats like JSON if XML processing is not strictly necessary.
