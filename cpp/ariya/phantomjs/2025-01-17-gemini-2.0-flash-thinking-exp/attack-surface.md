# Attack Surface Analysis for ariya/phantomjs

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `page.open()`](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via__page_open___.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the URL provided to PhantomJS's `page.open()` function to make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
    *   **How PhantomJS Contributes:** PhantomJS's core functionality of fetching and rendering web pages based on a provided URL is the direct mechanism exploited in SSRF.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a URL from user input to generate a website screenshot using PhantomJS. An attacker provides a URL like `http://internal-server/admin` forcing PhantomJS to make a request to the internal admin panel.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further exploitation of internal services, denial of service against internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize URLs passed to `page.open()`. Use allow-lists of permitted domains or protocols *before* passing to PhantomJS.
        *   Implement network segmentation to limit the reach of PhantomJS's network access.
        *   Avoid directly using user-provided input for URLs without thorough validation *before* passing to PhantomJS.
        *   Consider using a proxy server for PhantomJS's outbound requests to control destinations.

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript Injection via Unsafe `page.evaluate()` Arguments](./attack_surfaces/javascript_injection_via_unsafe__page_evaluate____arguments.md)

*   **Description:** If arguments passed to PhantomJS's `page.evaluate()` function are derived from user input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code to be executed within the PhantomJS environment.
    *   **How PhantomJS Contributes:** `page.evaluate()` allows executing JavaScript code within the context of the rendered page. Unsanitized input *directly* passed to this function allows for code injection within PhantomJS.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `page.evaluate()` to extract data based on user-provided selectors. An attacker provides a malicious selector like `'; require('fs').writeFileSync('pwned.txt', 'You are hacked!');'` which could lead to arbitrary code execution within the PhantomJS process.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the PhantomJS environment, potentially leading to file system access, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using user-provided input directly as arguments to `page.evaluate()`.
        *   If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize input *before* passing it to `page.evaluate()`.
        *   Consider alternative methods for data extraction that don't involve executing arbitrary JavaScript within PhantomJS.

## Attack Surface: [Local File Inclusion (LFI) via Manipulated URLs in `page.open()`](./attack_surfaces/local_file_inclusion__lfi__via_manipulated_urls_in__page_open___.md)

*   **Description:** Depending on the application's configuration and PhantomJS's access rights, an attacker might be able to manipulate the URL passed to `page.open()` to access local files on the server.
    *   **How PhantomJS Contributes:** PhantomJS interprets the provided URL and attempts to access the resource. If not properly restricted, this can include local files *directly accessed by PhantomJS*.
    *   **Example:** An application uses PhantomJS to render a template based on a user-provided file path. An attacker provides a path like `file:///etc/passwd` to `page.open()`, potentially exposing sensitive system files *through PhantomJS*.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive files, potential for further exploitation if exposed files contain credentials or configuration details.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never directly use user-provided input as file paths for `page.open()`.
        *   Implement strict allow-lists for permitted protocols and file paths *that PhantomJS is allowed to access*.
        *   Ensure PhantomJS runs with the least necessary privileges.
