## Attack Tree Path: [1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__remote_code_execution__rce___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  The most severe threat, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.
*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Exploit Known PhantomJS Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in PhantomJS.  Since PhantomJS is unmaintained, these vulnerabilities will not be patched.
        *   **Specific Example:** CVE-XXXX (e.g., Buffer Overflow) [HIGH RISK] - Represents a specific, known vulnerability.
        *   **Enabling Factor:** Public Exploit Code [HIGH RISK] - The existence of readily available exploit code significantly increases the risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Data Exfiltration (Leakage)](./attack_tree_paths/2__data_exfiltration__leakage_.md)

*   **Description:**  Stealing sensitive data processed by PhantomJS.
*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Abuse Page Evaluation/Injection [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Exploiting PhantomJS's `page.evaluate()` function and its ability to inject JavaScript into rendered pages.  This is a common attack vector if input sanitization is inadequate.
        *   **Specific Example:** Manipulate DOM to Extract Data [HIGH RISK] - Crafting JavaScript to traverse the Document Object Model (DOM) and extract sensitive information (e.g., session tokens, user data).
        *   **Enabling Factor:** Craft Malicious JS [HIGH RISK] - The attacker creates JavaScript code specifically designed to exfiltrate data.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/3__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  Making the application unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming PhantomJS or causing it to crash.
*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Resource Exhaustion [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Crafting input that causes PhantomJS to consume excessive CPU or memory, leading to performance degradation or crashes.
        *   **Specific Example:** CPU/Memory Loops [HIGH RISK] - Creating JavaScript code with infinite loops or recursive functions that consume excessive resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Configuration Exploits](./attack_tree_paths/4__configuration_exploits.md)

*   **Description:**  Taking advantage of misconfigurations or the use of outdated versions of PhantomJS.
*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Outdated Version of PhantomJS [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK]:**
        *   **Description:**  Using an old version of PhantomJS that contains known, unpatched vulnerabilities. This is a critical vulnerability due to the lack of maintenance.
        *   **Specific Example:** Use Old Version with Known Vulns [CRITICAL] [HIGH RISK] - This emphasizes the direct link between using an outdated version and being vulnerable to known exploits.
