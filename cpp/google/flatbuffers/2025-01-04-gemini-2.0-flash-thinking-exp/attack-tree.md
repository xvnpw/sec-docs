## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via FlatBuffers Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_flatbuffers_exploitation.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control or causing significant harm to the application through vulnerabilities related to its FlatBuffers usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Schema Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_schema_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers target the schema definition itself. If successful, they can manipulate how data is interpreted, potentially leading to widespread vulnerabilities.
        *   **Schema Poisoning:** Modifying the schema definition before or during its use by the application. This can involve introducing malicious field types, creating circular dependencies, or causing parsing errors.
        *   **Schema Injection:** Introducing entirely new, malicious elements into the schema during the loading process. This could involve injecting code within comments or overwriting existing definitions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Maliciously Crafted FlatBuffers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_maliciously_crafted_flatbuffers.md)

Attackers create specially crafted FlatBuffers designed to trigger vulnerabilities in the application's parsing or processing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Out-of-Bounds Access](./attack_tree_paths/out-of-bounds_access.md)

A direct consequence of FlatBuffers' direct memory access approach. Attackers manipulate offset values within the buffer to force the application to read or write data outside the allocated buffer boundaries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implementation Weaknesses in Application's FlatBuffers Usage](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_weaknesses_in_application's_flatbuffers_usage.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application *uses* the FlatBuffers library, rather than flaws within the library itself.
        *   **Lack of Input Validation on FlatBuffer Content:** The application fails to validate the data received within a FlatBuffer, allowing attackers to inject malicious payloads.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Maliciously Crafted FlatBuffers -> Out-of-Bounds Access -> Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_maliciously_crafted_flatbuffers_-_out-of-bounds_access_-_information_disclosure.md)

Attackers craft a FlatBuffer with manipulated offsets that cause the application to read data from memory locations outside the intended buffer. This can expose sensitive information that the attacker is not authorized to access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Maliciously Crafted FlatBuffers -> Out-of-Bounds Access -> Memory Corruption](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_maliciously_crafted_flatbuffers_-_out-of-bounds_access_-_memory_corruption.md)

Attackers craft a FlatBuffer with manipulated offsets that cause the application to *write* data to memory locations outside the intended buffer. This can corrupt critical data structures, leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or even the ability to execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implementation Weaknesses in Application's FlatBuffers Usage -> Lack of Input Validation on FlatBuffer Content -> Process Untrusted Data Without Sanitization -> Inject Malicious Payloads within Data Fields -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if data is used in web context](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_weaknesses_in_application's_flatbuffers_usage_-_lack_of_input_validation_on_f_5419f4fd.md)

The application receives a FlatBuffer containing malicious JavaScript code within a data field, and because the input is not properly validated or sanitized, this script is executed in a user's browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implementation Weaknesses in Application's FlatBuffers Usage -> Lack of Input Validation on FlatBuffer Content -> Process Untrusted Data Without Sanitization -> Inject Malicious Payloads within Data Fields -> SQL Injection if data is used in database queries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_weaknesses_in_application's_flatbuffers_usage_-_lack_of_input_validation_on_f_4b65d522.md)

The application receives a FlatBuffer containing malicious SQL code within a data field. Due to the lack of input validation, this code is executed against the database, potentially allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implementation Weaknesses in Application's FlatBuffers Usage -> Lack of Input Validation on FlatBuffer Content -> Process Untrusted Data Without Sanitization -> Inject Malicious Payloads within Data Fields -> Command Injection if data is used in system commands](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_weaknesses_in_application's_flatbuffers_usage_-_lack_of_input_validation_on_f_c1b1efbf.md)

The application receives a FlatBuffer containing malicious operating system commands within a data field. If the application uses this unsanitized data to execute system commands, the attacker can gain control of the server or perform other unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implementation Weaknesses in Application's FlatBuffers Usage -> Incorrect Offset or Size Handling in Application Logic -> Application Logic Makes Incorrect Assumptions About Buffer Structure -> Read or Write Data at Incorrect Memory Locations -> Memory Corruption](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_weaknesses_in_application's_flatbuffers_usage_-_incorrect_offset_or_size_hand_f529aea5.md)

The application's own code contains errors in how it calculates or uses offsets and sizes within the FlatBuffer. This leads to the application reading or writing data to the wrong memory locations, potentially corrupting critical data structures and causing crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implementation Weaknesses in Application's FlatBuffers Usage -> Incorrect Offset or Size Handling in Application Logic -> Application Logic Makes Incorrect Assumptions About Buffer Structure -> Read or Write Data at Incorrect Memory Locations -> Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_weaknesses_in_application's_flatbuffers_usage_-_incorrect_offset_or_size_hand_1f8e04cd.md)

Similar to the memory corruption scenario, but in this case, the incorrect offset or size handling leads to the application reading data from unintended memory locations, potentially exposing sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Implementation Weaknesses in Application's FlatBuffers Usage -> Reusing FlatBuffers Across Different Security Contexts -> Data Intended for Lower Security Context Used in Higher Context -> Privilege Escalation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_implementation_weaknesses_in_application's_flatbuffers_usage_-_reusing_flatbuffers_across_di_90c8986e.md)

A FlatBuffer containing data meant for a less privileged part of the application is inadvertently used in a more privileged context without proper sanitization or validation. This can allow an attacker to bypass security checks and gain elevated privileges within the application.
