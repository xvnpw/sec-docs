# Threat Model Analysis for google/flatbuffers

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Schema](./threats/maliciously_crafted_schema.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted FlatBuffers schema file (.fbs) to the application. The application attempts to parse this malicious schema. This schema could contain deeply nested structures, excessively long names, or other constructs designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the schema parsing logic *within the FlatBuffers library*.
*   **Impact:**  Parsing the malicious schema could lead to excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory), causing a denial-of-service (DoS). In more severe cases, vulnerabilities in the schema parser *of the FlatBuffers library* could potentially be exploited for remote code execution (RCE).
*   **Affected FlatBuffers Component:** FlatBuffers Schema Parser (specifically the code responsible for reading and interpreting `.fbs` files).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never directly parse schemas received from untrusted sources.
    *   If dynamic schema loading is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of the schema content *before* passing it to the FlatBuffers parser.
    *   Use the latest stable version of the FlatBuffers library, as it includes bug fixes and security patches for the schema parser.

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted FlatBuffers Buffer (Out-of-Bounds Read)](./threats/maliciously_crafted_flatbuffers_buffer__out-of-bounds_read_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a FlatBuffers binary buffer where offsets or indices within the buffer point outside the allocated memory region for a particular field or object. When the *FlatBuffers library's deserialization logic* attempts to access this out-of-bounds memory, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact:**  Could cause application crashes, information disclosure (reading data from unrelated memory regions), or potentially be leveraged for further exploitation if memory layout is predictable.
*   **Affected FlatBuffers Component:** FlatBuffers Deserialization Logic (specifically the functions responsible for accessing data based on offsets within the binary buffer).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize the built-in FlatBuffers verification functions (e.g., `VerifyBuffer`) to check the integrity and validity of the buffer *before* attempting to access its contents using FlatBuffers accessors.
    *   Implement robust error handling during deserialization to catch and handle potential out-of-bounds access attempts *within the application's interaction with the FlatBuffers library*.
    *   Consider using memory-safe language bindings where available and appropriate.

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted FlatBuffers Buffer (Integer Overflow)](./threats/maliciously_crafted_flatbuffers_buffer__integer_overflow_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a FlatBuffers binary buffer where the values of offsets or sizes are maliciously large, leading to integer overflows during calculations *within the FlatBuffers deserialization process*. This could cause incorrect memory access or other unexpected behavior *within the library*.
*   **Impact:**  Can lead to application crashes, incorrect data processing *by the FlatBuffers library*, or potentially exploitable memory corruption vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected FlatBuffers Component:** FlatBuffers Deserialization Logic (specifically the arithmetic operations performed on offsets and sizes within the binary buffer).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize the built-in FlatBuffers verification functions to check for potential integer overflow conditions *before accessing data*.
    *   Be mindful of potential integer overflow issues when working with offsets and sizes programmatically *when interacting directly with the FlatBuffers API*.
    *   Use language features or libraries that provide protection against integer overflows.
