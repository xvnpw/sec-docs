## Attack Tree Path: [1. Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__remote_code_execution__rce___cn_.md)

*   **Critical Node:** RCE represents the most severe outcome, granting the attacker complete control over the compromised system.

## Attack Tree Path: [1a. Buffer Overflow [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1a__buffer_overflow__hr_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** Exploiting buffer overflows is a common and high-impact attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [1a1. Oversized Scalar in a Table [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1a1__oversized_scalar_in_a_table__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a scalar value (integer, float) larger than the allocated buffer space within a FlatBuffer table. If the application doesn't validate the size before writing, this can overwrite adjacent memory.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1a2. Oversized String/Vector [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1a2__oversized_stringvector__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1a1, but the attacker provides an oversized string or vector.  Lack of length validation before writing to the FlatBuffer can lead to a buffer overflow.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1a3. Incorrect Offset Manipulation [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1a3__incorrect_offset_manipulation__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application *manually* manipulates FlatBuffers offsets (which it generally shouldn't), an error could lead to writing data outside the allocated buffer. This is a low-level error.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [1b. Type Confusion](./attack_tree_paths/1b__type_confusion.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1b1. Schema Mismatch [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1b1__schema_mismatch__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The server and client use different, incompatible versions of the FlatBuffers schema.  This can cause the deserializer to misinterpret data, potentially leading to exploitable behavior.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Potentially RCE)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1b2. Union Misinterpretation [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1b2__union_misinterpretation__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The application doesn't correctly check the `_type` field of a FlatBuffers union before accessing its value. This can lead to misinterpreting the data type and potentially exploitable behavior.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Potentially RCE)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Medium
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1b3. Table/Struct Confusion [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1b3__tablestruct_confusion__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The deserializer is tricked into treating a `table` as a `struct` (or vice-versa), leading to out-of-bounds reads or writes due to different layout and size expectations.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** High
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2a. Resource Exhaustion [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2a__resource_exhaustion__hr_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:**  Relatively easy to achieve by sending maliciously crafted FlatBuffers.

## Attack Tree Path: [2a1. Deeply Nested Objects [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2a1__deeply_nested_objects__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a FlatBuffer with excessively deep nesting of tables or vectors, causing the deserializer to consume excessive memory or CPU.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2a2. Large Vectors/Strings [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2a2__large_vectorsstrings__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a FlatBuffer containing extremely large vectors or strings, consuming a large amount of memory during deserialization.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (DoS)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Low
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
