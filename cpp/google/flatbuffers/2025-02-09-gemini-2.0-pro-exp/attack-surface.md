# Attack Surface Analysis for google/flatbuffers

## Attack Surface: [1. Buffer Overflows/Underflows during Deserialization](./attack_surfaces/1__buffer_overflowsunderflows_during_deserialization.md)

*Description:* Attempts to read data outside the allocated buffer boundaries during the deserialization of a FlatBuffer. This is a *direct* consequence of how FlatBuffers handles data.
*How FlatBuffers Contributes:* FlatBuffers' reliance on offsets for data access, while efficient, creates a potential for errors if the schema and data don't perfectly align, or if there are bugs in the library or generated code. This is inherent to the FlatBuffers design.
*Example:* A schema defines a field as a `ubyte` (offset), but a malicious FlatBuffer provides a value that, when used as an offset, points outside the buffer.
*Impact:* Can lead to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or application crashes.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Schema Validation:** Rigorously validate the FlatBuffer data against the schema *before* any data access. *Always* use the FlatBuffers `Verifier` class. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Perform extensive fuzz testing with malformed FlatBuffers to identify potential overflow/underflow vulnerabilities.
    *   **Memory-Safe Languages:** Consider using memory-safe languages (e.g., Rust) to mitigate the consequences of memory errors.
    *   **Latest Version:** Always use the latest version of the FlatBuffers library and compiler.
    *   **Memory Error Detection:** Employ memory error detection tools (e.g., AddressSanitizer) during development and testing.

## Attack Surface: [2. Offset Manipulation Leading to Arbitrary Memory Access](./attack_surfaces/2__offset_manipulation_leading_to_arbitrary_memory_access.md)

*Description:* An attacker manipulates offsets within the serialized FlatBuffer data to access unintended memory locations. This is a *direct* attack on FlatBuffers' core mechanism.
*How FlatBuffers Contributes:* FlatBuffers' core mechanism relies on offsets to locate data within the buffer. This makes it inherently vulnerable to attacks that can modify these offsets.
*Example:* An attacker modifies an offset within a table to point to a different object within the buffer, potentially leaking sensitive information.
*Impact:* Can lead to information disclosure, arbitrary code execution, or application crashes.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Schema Adherence:** Enforce strict adherence to the schema.
    *   **FlatBuffers Verifier:** *Always* use the FlatBuffers `Verifier` class to validate the integrity of the FlatBuffer *before* accessing any data. This is crucial.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate the FlatBuffer data against the schema before any access.
    *   **Read-Only Buffers:** If possible, treat the received FlatBuffer data as read-only.

## Attack Surface: [3. Bugs in Generated Code or FlatBuffers Library](./attack_surfaces/3__bugs_in_generated_code_or_flatbuffers_library.md)

*Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities present in the code generated by the FlatBuffers compiler or within the FlatBuffers library itself. This is a *direct* vulnerability in the FlatBuffers project's code.
*How FlatBuffers Contributes:* The attack surface is directly related to the code provided by the FlatBuffers project.
*Example:* A bug in the generated C++ code for handling a specific data type might lead to a buffer overflow.
*Impact:* Varies depending on the specific bug, but could range from application crashes to arbitrary code execution.
*Risk Severity:* High (Potentially Critical, depending on the bug)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Use Latest Version:** Always use the latest stable version of the FlatBuffers compiler and library. This is crucial for receiving security patches.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Perform fuzz testing specifically targeting the generated code and the FlatBuffers library.
    *   **Code Review (Generated Code):** If feasible, review the generated code (though this can be challenging).
    *   **Report Bugs:** If you discover a bug, report it responsibly to the FlatBuffers maintainers.

## Attack Surface: [4. Improper API Usage (Leading to Bypass of Verifier)](./attack_surfaces/4__improper_api_usage__leading_to_bypass_of_verifier_.md)

*Description:*  Vulnerabilities introduced by the application developer misusing the FlatBuffers API in a way that bypasses the built-in security checks, *specifically* the `Verifier`. This is a direct result of incorrect interaction with the FlatBuffers library.
*How FlatBuffers Contributes:* While not a direct vulnerability *in* FlatBuffers, incorrect usage can *disable* its safety mechanisms, making the application vulnerable to attacks that FlatBuffers is designed to prevent.
*Example:* The developer forgets to call the `Verifier` before accessing data, allowing a malformed FlatBuffer to be processed, leading to a buffer overflow.
*Impact:*  Can lead to any of the vulnerabilities that the `Verifier` is designed to prevent, including arbitrary code execution and information disclosure.
*Risk Severity:* High (Potentially Critical, depending on the misuse and the malformed data)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Thorough Documentation Review:** Developers should thoroughly understand the FlatBuffers API and best practices, *especially* the importance of the `Verifier`.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews, paying close attention to how FlatBuffers data is handled and ensuring the `Verifier` is *always* used correctly.
    *   **Follow Examples:** Adhere closely to the official FlatBuffers examples and tutorials, which demonstrate proper `Verifier` usage.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential misuses of the API, particularly missing `Verifier` calls.
