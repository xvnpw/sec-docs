# Threat Model Analysis for google/flatbuffers

## Threat: [Schema Poisoning/Injection](./threats/schema_poisoninginjection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might manipulate or provide a malicious FlatBuffers schema to the application. This could happen by intercepting schema updates or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the FlatBuffers library's schema loading mechanism is used.
*   **Impact:** A poisoned schema can cause the FlatBuffers library to misinterpret data, leading to incorrect processing, application crashes, or the injection of malicious data that the application trusts.
*   **Affected Component:** FlatBuffers Schema Parser, Schema Loading Mechanism
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store schemas in secure locations with restricted access.
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., hashing, digital signatures) for schema files before they are used by FlatBuffers.
    *   Avoid loading schemas from untrusted sources or over insecure channels when using FlatBuffers' schema loading features.

## Threat: [Out-of-Bounds Read during Deserialization](./threats/out-of-bounds_read_during_deserialization.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malformed FlatBuffers buffer where offsets or vector lengths point outside the allocated buffer. When the FlatBuffers library's generated code or internal access logic attempts to read data based on these invalid pointers, it reads from unintended memory locations.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to information disclosure (reading sensitive data from other parts of memory), application crashes due to segmentation faults or access violations, or potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities for more severe exploits.
*   **Affected Component:** FlatBuffers Generated Code (accessors), Buffer Access Logic within FlatBuffers
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize FlatBuffers' built-in verification mechanisms to validate buffer integrity against the schema *before* accessing data through generated accessors.
    *   Implement robust input validation on the raw buffer before passing it to FlatBuffers for deserialization.
    *   Be cautious when accessing optional fields or fields with variable sizes, ensuring checks for their presence and validity as recommended by FlatBuffers usage patterns.
    *   Consider using language bindings with strong bounds checking provided by the FlatBuffers implementation.

## Threat: [Out-of-Bounds Write during Deserialization (related to FlatBuffers' design limitations or custom logic)](./threats/out-of-bounds_write_during_deserialization__related_to_flatbuffers'_design_limitations_or_custom_log_8178c16e.md)

*   **Description:** While less direct due to FlatBuffers' generally read-only nature after creation, vulnerabilities in custom parsing logic that interacts directly with the underlying FlatBuffers buffer, or potential bugs within the FlatBuffers library itself, could allow an attacker to craft a buffer that, when processed, leads to writing data outside the intended buffer boundaries.
*   **Impact:** This can cause memory corruption within the application's memory space, potentially leading to application crashes, unexpected behavior, or even arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom Parsing Logic interacting with FlatBuffers buffers, Potential vulnerabilities within FlatBuffers library itself
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test any custom parsing logic that directly manipulates FlatBuffers buffers for potential buffer overflows or out-of-bounds writes.
    *   Avoid direct manipulation of the underlying buffer after deserialization unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    *   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in the FlatBuffers library's handling of buffer writes to the project maintainers.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Offset Calculations](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_in_offset_calculations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a FlatBuffers buffer with extremely large or negative offsets that, when used in calculations *within the FlatBuffers library* to determine memory addresses, result in integer overflows or underflows.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to incorrect memory access by the FlatBuffers library, potentially causing out-of-bounds reads/writes, application crashes, or exploitable memory corruption.
*   **Affected Component:** FlatBuffers Offset Calculation Logic, Generated Code
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Be aware of potential integer overflow/underflow issues when working with offsets, especially in custom parsing logic that interacts with FlatBuffers internals.
    *   Utilize language bindings that provide safeguards against integer overflows or offer mechanisms to detect them within the FlatBuffers implementation.
    *   Carefully review generated code for potential arithmetic vulnerabilities related to offset calculations.
