## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Schema Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_schema_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to compromise the application by injecting a malicious FlatBuffers schema or exploiting flaws in the schema design. The critical node here is the ability of the application to load and use this malicious schema.

* **Breakdown:**
    * **Malicious Schema Injection:**
        * **Application Loads Malicious Schema [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the crucial step where the application, knowingly or unknowingly, loads a schema that has been tampered with or designed with malicious intent.
            * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Application Doesn't Validate Schema Integrity (e.g., checksum):** If the application fails to verify the integrity of the loaded schema (e.g., by checking a checksum or signature), it becomes vulnerable to using a modified schema.
    * **Potential Impacts:**
        * **Incorrect Data Interpretation:** The application might misinterpret data based on the altered schema, leading to logical errors or security vulnerabilities.
        * **Memory Corruption:** A maliciously crafted schema could lead to out-of-bounds memory access during parsing or data access.
        * **Denial of Service:** A schema with excessive recursion or a large number of fields can cause resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Serialized Data Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_serialized_data_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious FlatBuffers payloads to exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes the serialized data. The critical node here is the broad category of vulnerabilities related to the serialized data itself.

* **Breakdown:**
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Buffer Overflow/Over-read:**
        * **Craft Malicious FlatBuffer Payload:** Attackers create payloads with incorrect offset calculations, exceeding vector or string bounds, or manipulating vtable offsets.
        * **Application Accesses Out-of-Bounds Memory:**  Due to the zero-copy nature of FlatBuffers, these crafted payloads can cause the application to read or write memory outside of the allocated buffer.
    * **Potential Impacts:**
        * **Memory Corruption:** Overwriting critical data or code in memory.
        * **Arbitrary Code Execution (RCE):** In severe cases, attackers can gain control of the application by injecting and executing malicious code.
        * **Crashes and Denial of Service:**  Causing the application to terminate unexpectedly.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Application Integration with FlatBuffers [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_application_integration_with_flatbuffers__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the application integrates and uses FlatBuffers, even if FlatBuffers itself is functioning as intended. The critical node here is the overall security of the application's integration logic.

* **Breakdown:**
    * **[HIGH-RISK NODE] Lack of Input Validation After Deserialization:**
        * **Send Malicious FlatBuffer Payload:** Attackers send payloads containing data that, while valid according to the schema, is malicious in the context of the application's logic.
        * **Application Logic Doesn't Validate Deserialized Data:** The application fails to validate the deserialized data against expected values, ranges, or business rules.
    * **Potential Impacts:**
        * **Logical Errors:** The application might perform incorrect actions based on the unvalidated data.
        * **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify data in unintended ways.
        * **Security Breaches:**  Circumventing security checks or gaining unauthorized access.
