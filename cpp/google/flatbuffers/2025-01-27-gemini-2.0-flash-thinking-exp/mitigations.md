# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for google/flatbuffers

## Mitigation Strategy: [Schema Validation and Review](./mitigation_strategies/schema_validation_and_review.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Schema Validation Process:** Integrate schema validation into your development workflow, specifically for FlatBuffers schemas.
    2.  **Automated Schema Checks:** Use the FlatBuffers schema compiler (`flatc`) with validation flags (`--schema-validation-only`) during schema development and in CI/CD to automatically check for FlatBuffers schema errors.
    3.  **Linting Rules:** Implement or adopt schema linting rules specific to FlatBuffers schemas to enforce best practices and catch potential issues related to FlatBuffers schema design.
    4.  **Manual Peer Reviews:**  Require peer reviews of all FlatBuffers schema changes by developers knowledgeable in FlatBuffers and security implications of schema design.
    5.  **Document Schema Changes:**  Maintain a record of changes to FlatBuffers schemas, including security considerations.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Logical Vulnerabilities (Schema-Based):** Severity: Medium to High. Poorly designed FlatBuffers schemas can introduce logical flaws exploitable through crafted FlatBuffers messages.
        *   **Parsing Errors/Unexpected Behavior (Schema Issues):** Severity: Low to Medium. Invalid or inconsistent FlatBuffers schemas can cause parsing errors or unexpected behavior when processing FlatBuffers data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Logical Vulnerabilities (Schema-Based): Medium to High reduction. Proactive FlatBuffers schema validation and review significantly reduce schema-related vulnerabilities.
        *   Parsing Errors/Unexpected Behavior (Schema Issues): High reduction. Ensures FlatBuffers schemas are well-formed, minimizing parsing errors due to schema problems.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Automated schema checks using `flatc --schema-validation-only` are in CI/CD. Basic naming conventions are informally followed for FlatBuffers schemas.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Formal linting rules for FlatBuffers schemas are not defined. Manual peer reviews are inconsistent for FlatBuffers schema changes. Formal documentation of FlatBuffers schema changes is missing.
