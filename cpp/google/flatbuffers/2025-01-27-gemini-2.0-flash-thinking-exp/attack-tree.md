## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using FlatBuffers (Critical Node - Root Goal):](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_flatbuffers__critical_node_-_root_goal_.md)

*   This is the ultimate attacker objective. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing significant damage to the application.
*   It is the starting point for all attack paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit FlatBuffers Parsing Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flatbuffers_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path focuses on directly attacking the FlatBuffers parsing process itself.
*   Success here can lead to severe consequences like code execution or denial of service.
*   It is a critical node because successful exploitation bypasses application logic and directly targets the underlying data handling mechanism.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow/Out-of-Bounds Read (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflowout-of-bounds_read__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malformed Buffer Construction (Invalid Offset Values, Incorrect Table/Vector Sizes)
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Code Execution, Denial of Service)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Description:** Attackers craft malformed FlatBuffers buffers with incorrect offsets or sizes. When the application parses these buffers, it can lead to reading or writing memory outside the intended buffer boundaries.
*   **Impact:** This can result in:
    *   **Code Execution:** Overwriting critical memory regions to inject and execute malicious code.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Causing crashes or unpredictable behavior due to memory corruption.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Reading sensitive data from unintended memory locations.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use memory-safe languages or employ memory safety techniques.
    *   Implement robust fuzzing to detect buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential memory safety issues.
    *   Keep FlatBuffers library updated to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Schema Injection/Substitution (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/schema_injectionsubstitution__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Supply malicious schema during schema loading process (if application allows external schema loading)
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If application design allows external schema loading)
    *   **Impact:** High (Data manipulation, Logic bypass, potentially Code Execution)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Description:** If the application allows loading FlatBuffers schemas from external sources (e.g., via API, configuration), an attacker might be able to supply a malicious schema.
*   **Impact:** Using a malicious schema can lead to:
    *   **Data Misinterpretation:** The application misinterprets the FlatBuffers data according to the attacker's schema, leading to logic errors and unexpected behavior.
    *   **Logic Bypass:** Attackers can manipulate data structures and types to bypass business logic or access controls.
    *   **Potential Code Execution:** In some scenarios, schema manipulation combined with application logic flaws could potentially lead to code execution.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strictly control schema loading processes.
    *   Validate schemas before loading them to ensure they are expected and trusted.
    *   Use secure channels for schema delivery if loaded externally.
    *   Implement schema integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Bugs in Application Code Handling FlatBuffers Data (Critical Node & High-Risk Path Start):](./attack_tree_paths/logic_bugs_in_application_code_handling_flatbuffers_data__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application *uses* the correctly parsed FlatBuffers data.
*   Even if FlatBuffers parsing is secure, flaws in application logic can be exploited.
*   It is a critical node because it highlights the importance of secure application development practices *after* FlatBuffers parsing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Validation Failures (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/data_validation_failures__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   This is a major category of logic bugs and a critical node because it encompasses common and impactful vulnerabilities.
*   Failure to validate data deserialized from FlatBuffers is a primary source of application-level vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Range/Boundary Violations (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/rangeboundary_violations__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Application assumes data within certain ranges, but FlatBuffers data violates these ranges.
    *   **Likelihood:** High
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Logic errors, data corruption, unexpected behavior, potentially security bypass)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Description:** The application makes assumptions about the valid ranges or boundaries of data fields deserialized from FlatBuffers. Attackers can craft FlatBuffers messages that violate these assumptions.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to:
    *   **Logic Errors:** Incorrect application behavior due to out-of-range values.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Writing invalid data to databases or internal application state.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior:** Application crashes or malfunctions due to unhandled boundary conditions.
    *   **Security Bypass:** In some cases, out-of-range values can be used to bypass access controls or business logic checks.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement thorough range and boundary checks for all relevant data fields deserialized from FlatBuffers.
    *   Define clear data validation rules based on application requirements.
    *   Use assertions or exception handling to gracefully handle out-of-range values.

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing Input Sanitization (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/missing_input_sanitization__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Application uses FlatBuffers data directly in sensitive operations without sanitization.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Injection vulnerabilities - SQLi, Command Injection, etc.)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Description:** The application directly uses data from FlatBuffers in sensitive operations (e.g., database queries, system commands, URL construction) without proper sanitization or encoding.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to classic injection vulnerabilities:
    *   **SQL Injection:** If FlatBuffers data is used in SQL queries without sanitization.
    *   **Command Injection:** If FlatBuffers data is used in system commands without sanitization.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If FlatBuffers data is used in web page output without proper encoding.
    *   **Other Injection Attacks:** Depending on the context, other types of injection attacks might be possible.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Always sanitize and encode data** before using it in sensitive operations.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Use safe APIs and libraries for system commands and URL construction.
    *   Implement output encoding to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege and avoid running sensitive operations with excessive permissions.
