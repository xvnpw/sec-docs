## Attack Tree Path: [1. Direct File Access [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__direct_file_access__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This category encompasses all attack vectors where the attacker gains direct access to the LevelDB database files on the filesystem, bypassing any application-level security controls. This is a critical node because it represents a complete circumvention of the application's intended security mechanisms.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **1.1 Insufficient Filesystem Permissions [CN] [HR]**
        *   **Description:** The LevelDB database files (e.g., `.ldb` files) have overly permissive read and/or write permissions, allowing unauthorized users or processes on the system to directly access and modify the data. This is a high-risk path due to its common occurrence, high impact, and low effort/skill requirements.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Complete data compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Ensure that the LevelDB database files are owned by the application's user.
            *   Set the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., `chmod 600` or `700` on Linux/Unix).
            *   Regularly audit file permissions.
            *   Consider filesystem encryption.
    *   **1.2 Bypassing Application Level Access [HR]**
        *   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities *within the application itself* (e.g., path traversal, directory listing, arbitrary file upload/download) to gain access to the LevelDB database files. This is a high-risk path, although its likelihood depends on the presence of other application vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low (depends on other application vulnerabilities)
        *   **Impact:** High (Complete data compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Thoroughly address general web application vulnerabilities, especially those related to file access and path manipulation.
            *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization.
            *   Use secure coding practices to prevent file-related vulnerabilities.
            *   Employ Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) and Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploiting LevelDB API [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploiting_leveldb_api__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This category covers attacks that leverage the intended interface (API) of LevelDB, but in a malicious way. This is a critical node because it focuses on how the application *uses* LevelDB, which is often a source of vulnerabilities.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   **2.1 Input Validation (Key/Value) [CN]**
        *   **Description:** This node highlights the critical importance of input validation when interacting with LevelDB. LevelDB itself does not enforce any schema or data validation; it's entirely the application's responsibility.
        *   **Sub-Vectors:**
            *   **2.1.1 Crafted Keys to Access Unauthorized Data [CN] [HR]**
                *   **Description:** The attacker manipulates the input used to generate LevelDB keys to access data they are not authorized to see or modify. This is a high-risk path because it's a common attack vector if the application doesn't properly sanitize and authorize keys.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium
                *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized data access/modification)
                *   **Effort:** Low
                *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* data used to construct LevelDB keys.
                    *   Never directly use user-provided input as a key without thorough validation.
                    *   Implement strong authorization checks to ensure the user is allowed to access the data associated with the generated key.
                    *   Consider using a secure, non-predictable key generation scheme (e.g., UUIDs, cryptographic hashes of authorized data).
