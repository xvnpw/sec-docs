# Attack Surface Analysis for google/leveldb

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Key/Value Input (Data Corruption/Logic Errors)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_keyvalue_input__data_corruptionlogic_errors_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject crafted keys or values that, while valid for LevelDB, are semantically incorrect for the application, leading to data corruption or unexpected behavior.

**How LevelDB Contributes:** LevelDB stores data as raw byte arrays; it doesn't enforce any application-level schema or data validation.  This is the *core* of the risk: LevelDB accepts *anything*.

**Example:** An application uses LevelDB to store user permissions. An attacker, through a vulnerability *elsewhere*, writes an invalid permission level (e.g., a string instead of an integer) for their user ID, gaining elevated privileges. LevelDB accepts this invalid data without complaint.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, application malfunction.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement *rigorous* input validation and sanitization *before* data is written to LevelDB. This is the *primary* defense and is absolutely crucial because LevelDB provides *no* inherent protection here.
        *   Define and enforce a strict schema for keys and values.  Use a serialization format (e.g., Protocol Buffers) if necessary.
        *   Consider cryptographic hashes/signatures to verify data integrity *after* retrieval from LevelDB (detecting corruption that might have occurred).

## Attack Surface: [Direct Filesystem Access (Data Breach/Corruption)](./attack_surfaces/direct_filesystem_access__data_breachcorruption_.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the LevelDB data files on the filesystem.

**How LevelDB Contributes:** LevelDB stores data in files (SSTables, MANIFEST, LOG) on the local filesystem.  This is its fundamental storage mechanism.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a server vulnerability to gain shell access and then reads or modifies the LevelDB data files directly, bypassing all application-level security.

**Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality loss), data corruption, data loss.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Ensure the application runs with the *least privileged* user account.
        *   Configure *strict* filesystem permissions on the LevelDB data directory, allowing access *only* to the application's user. This is a direct mitigation against this specific attack.
    *   **Users/System Administrators:**
        *   Use filesystem encryption (e.g., dm-crypt, BitLocker) to protect the data at rest. This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
        *   Implement intrusion detection systems (IDS) and file integrity monitoring (FIM).

## Attack Surface: [Compromised LevelDB Build/Dependency (Supply Chain Attack)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_leveldb_builddependency__supply_chain_attack_.md)

**Description:** A malicious version of the LevelDB library itself is used.

**How LevelDB Contributes:** The application's security is directly tied to the integrity of the LevelDB library it uses. If the library is compromised, the entire application is vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker compromises a third-party mirror hosting LevelDB binaries and replaces the legitimate library with a backdoored version. The application unknowingly uses this compromised library.

**Impact:** Complete system compromise; arbitrary code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Download LevelDB *only* from official sources (the Google GitHub repository).
        *   *Verify* the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums (SHA-256) or digital signatures. This is essential.
        *   Build LevelDB from source in a secure, isolated environment, if feasible.
        *   Use dependency management tools that support integrity checking (e.g., `go mod` with checksum verification).
        *   Regularly update LevelDB.
