# Threat Model Analysis for google/leveldb

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Uncontrolled Shutdown](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_uncontrolled_shutdown.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might intentionally trigger a system crash (e.g., power failure, kernel panic) or exploit another vulnerability to force an unclean shutdown while the application is writing to LevelDB. LevelDB uses a write-ahead log (WAL) and memtables, but incomplete writes during a crash can lead to inconsistencies.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of recently written data; potential corruption of the database, requiring recovery or leading to application malfunction. Inconsistent data may lead to incorrect application behavior.
    *   **Affected LevelDB Component:** WAL (Write-Ahead Log), Memtable, SSTables (Sorted String Tables). The core data storage and recovery mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Application-Level Checksums:** Calculate and store checksums (e.g., CRC32, SHA-256) of data *before* writing to LevelDB and verify them *after* reading. This detects corruption.
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Thoroughly check `leveldb::Status` return values for all LevelDB operations (Put, Get, Delete, Iterator operations). Handle errors gracefully, logging them and potentially attempting recovery.
        *   **Filesystem Integrity:** Use a journaling filesystem (e.g., ext4, XFS, NTFS) to reduce the risk of filesystem-level corruption.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Implement a robust backup strategy to allow restoration of data in case of corruption.
        *   **Application-Level Transactions (if needed):** If atomic multi-key updates are *critical*, consider implementing a transaction layer *above* LevelDB (since LevelDB itself only provides atomic single-key operations and batch writes). This might involve a separate WAL at the application level.
        *   **Graceful Shutdown Handling:** Implement signal handlers (e.g., SIGTERM, SIGINT) to gracefully shut down the application, ensuring LevelDB has a chance to flush data to disk.

## Threat: [Data Leakage via File Permissions](./threats/data_leakage_via_file_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with local access to the system (or through a separate vulnerability) might attempt to read the LevelDB data files directly if the file permissions are too permissive.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored in the database, potentially leading to privacy breaches or further attacks.
    *   **Affected LevelDB Component:** SSTables (Sorted String Tables), Manifest files, Log files â€“ the files on disk that store the database data and metadata.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is stored unencrypted)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict File Permissions:** Ensure the LevelDB data directory and all files within it have the *most restrictive* permissions possible. Only the user account running the application should have read/write access. Use `chmod` (on Linux/macOS) or equivalent tools to set appropriate permissions.
        *   **Data Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data *before* storing it in LevelDB. Use a strong encryption algorithm (e.g., AES-256) and securely manage the encryption keys. This is the *most important* mitigation.
        *   **Directory Traversal Prevention:** Validate all user inputs that might be used to construct file paths, preventing attackers from accessing files outside the intended directory.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Direct File Modification](./threats/data_tampering_via_direct_file_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with local access (or through a separate vulnerability) could directly modify the LevelDB data files (SSTables, etc.), bypassing application-level controls.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity violation. The application may behave incorrectly due to the tampered data, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or data corruption.
    *   **Affected LevelDB Component:** SSTables (Sorted String Tables), Manifest files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Encryption at Rest:** Encrypting the data *before* storing it in LevelDB makes it much harder for an attacker to modify the data meaningfully.
        *   **Application-Level Integrity Checks:** Calculate and store cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256) or digital signatures of data *before* writing to LevelDB. Verify these hashes/signatures *after* reading from LevelDB to detect tampering.
        *   **Strict File Permissions:** As with data leakage, ensure restrictive file permissions.

## Threat: [Concurrent Access Violation](./threats/concurrent_access_violation.md)

* **Description:** Multiple processes, or unsynchronized threads within the same process, attempt to access the same LevelDB database concurrently without proper locking. LevelDB provides internal locking for single process, multi-threaded access, but it does *not* handle inter-process concurrency.
    * **Impact:** Data corruption, unpredictable behavior, crashes.
    * **Affected LevelDB Component:** All components. The entire database is at risk.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Single Process Access:** Ideally, design the application so that only a *single* process accesses the LevelDB database at any given time.
        * **External Locking (if multiple processes are *required*):** If multiple processes *must* access the same LevelDB database, use a robust external locking mechanism, such as:
            * File locks (e.g., `flock` on Linux).
            * System-level semaphores.
            * A dedicated lock server.
        * **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test concurrent access scenarios to ensure the locking mechanism is working correctly.
        * **LevelDB's Built-in Locking (for threads within a single process):** Ensure that if multiple *threads* within the *same process* are accessing LevelDB, you are relying on LevelDB's internal locking and not introducing your own, potentially conflicting, locking mechanisms. LevelDB is thread-safe *within a single process*, provided you don't disable its internal locking.
