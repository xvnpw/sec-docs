# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for google/leveldb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Application-Level Checksumming](./mitigation_strategies/application-level_checksumming.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Checksum Algorithm:** Select a strong cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256, SHA-512).
    2.  **Implement Checksum Calculation (LevelDB Interaction):**  *Before* calling `leveldb::DB::Put()`:
        *   Concatenate the key and value (consider a consistent separator if needed).
        *   Calculate the checksum of the concatenated data.
        *   Store the checksum *along with* the key-value pair.  This can be done in a few ways:
            *   **Append to Value:**  Append the checksum to the value itself (e.g., `value + separator + checksum`).  This is the simplest approach but requires careful handling when reading.
            *   **Separate Key:** Store the checksum in a separate LevelDB entry with a derived key (e.g., `original_key + "_checksum"`). This keeps the original value clean but adds complexity.
            *   **Separate Database:** Use a *separate* LevelDB instance solely for storing checksums. This provides the cleanest separation but adds overhead.
    3.  **Implement Checksum Verification (LevelDB Interaction):** *After* calling `leveldb::DB::Get()`:
        *   Retrieve the stored checksum (using the same method as in step 2).
        *   Recalculate the checksum of the retrieved key-value pair.
        *   Compare the calculated checksum with the stored checksum.
        *   If they *do not* match, the data is considered corrupted.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Subtle Hardware Errors):** Severity: Medium. Undetected data corruption.
    *   **Data Corruption (Software Bugs in LevelDB):** Severity: Medium. Undetected data corruption.
    *   **Bit Rot (Data Degradation over Time):** Severity: Low. Slow data degradation on storage media.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Subtle Hardware Errors):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Data Corruption (Software Bugs in LevelDB):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Bit Rot:** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Entirely missing. Requires modification of all LevelDB `Put` and `Get` operations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Paranoid Checks (LevelDB Option)](./mitigation_strategies/paranoid_checks__leveldb_option_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate `leveldb::Options`:** Find the code where the `leveldb::Options` object is created (usually when opening the database with `leveldb::DB::Open`).
    2.  **Enable Paranoid Checks:** Set the `paranoid_checks` option to `true`:
        ```c++
        leveldb::Options options;
        options.paranoid_checks = true;
        leveldb::DB* db;
        leveldb::Status status = leveldb::DB::Open(options, "/path/to/db", &db);
        ```
    3.  **Handle Errors:** Ensure that your code properly handles any errors reported by LevelDB due to failed paranoid checks (see "Proper Error Handling" below).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Software Bugs in LevelDB):** Severity: Medium. Undetected data corruption.
    *   **Data Corruption (Hardware Issues):** Severity: Medium. Undetected data corruption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Software Bugs in LevelDB):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low/Medium (earlier detection, but performance impact).
    *   **Data Corruption (Hardware Issues):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low/Medium (earlier detection, but performance impact).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  The `options.paranoid_checks = true;` line needs to be added when opening the LevelDB database.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Compaction Tuning (LevelDB Options)](./mitigation_strategies/compaction_tuning__leveldb_options_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Compaction:** Familiarize yourself with LevelDB's compaction process (how it merges and reorganizes data). Read the LevelDB documentation.
    2.  **Monitor Compaction:** Use monitoring tools (if available) or add logging to your application to track LevelDB's compaction activity (number of compactions, duration, I/O).
    3.  **Adjust Options:** Modify the following `leveldb::Options` (when opening the database) based on your workload and monitoring:
        *   `options.max_background_compactions`:  Limits the number of concurrent background compaction threads.  Too many can overload the system; too few can lead to excessive SSTable files.
        *   `options.max_background_flushes`: Limits the number of concurrent background flushes (writing memtables to SSTables).
        *   `options.write_buffer_size`:  The size of the in-memory memtable.  Larger memtables can improve write performance but increase memory usage.
        *   `options.max_file_size`: The maximum size of an SSTable file. Smaller files can improve read performance for point lookups but increase the number of files.
        *   `options.level0_file_num_compaction_trigger`: The number of level-0 files that trigger a compaction.
        *   `options.level0_slowdown_writes_trigger`: The number of level-0 files that trigger write slowdowns.
        *   `options.level0_stop_writes_trigger`: The number of level-0 files that stop writes completely.
    4.  **Iterative Tuning:**  Adjust these options iteratively, monitoring the impact on performance and resource usage. There is no one-size-fits-all configuration; it depends heavily on the application's workload.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion):** Severity: Medium.  Poorly tuned compaction can lead to excessive resource usage.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Severity: Medium.  Inefficient compaction can slow down read and write operations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with proper tuning).
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with proper tuning).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. Default LevelDB options are used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Requires analysis of the application's workload and iterative tuning of the LevelDB options.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper Error Handling (LevelDB API)](./mitigation_strategies/proper_error_handling__leveldb_api_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify LevelDB Calls:** Locate all calls to LevelDB API functions (e.g., `Put`, `Get`, `Delete`, `Open`, iterators).
    2.  **Check `leveldb::Status`:** Immediately after *every* LevelDB API call, check the returned `leveldb::Status` object:
        ```c++
        leveldb::Status s = db->Put(leveldb::WriteOptions(), key, value);
        if (!s.ok()) {
            // Handle the error
            std::cerr << "LevelDB Put error: " << s.ToString() << std::endl;
            // ... take appropriate action ...
        }
        ```
    3.  **Handle Specific Errors:** Implement specific error handling for different status codes:
        *   `s.ok()`:  Success.
        *   `s.IsNotFound()`: Key not found (for `Get`).
        *   `s.IsCorruption()`: Data corruption detected.  This is *critical* to handle.
        *   `s.IsIOError()`:  I/O error.
        *   `s.IsNotSupportedError()`:  Operation not supported.
        *   `s.IsInvalidArgument()`: Invalid argument passed to the function.
    4.  **Logging:** Log *all* errors, including the output of `s.ToString()`.
    5.  **Recovery/Retry:** For transient errors (like some I/O errors), implement retry logic (with appropriate backoff).
    6.  **Graceful Degradation/Shutdown:**  For critical errors (like corruption), either attempt to recover (from a backup) or shut down the application gracefully to prevent further damage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Unhandled Errors):** Severity: Medium. Unhandled errors can lead to inconsistencies.
    *   **Application Crashes (Unhandled Exceptions):** Severity: Medium. Unhandled errors can crash the application.
    *   **Denial of Service (Resource Leaks):** Severity: Low. Unhandled errors can lead to resource leaks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption (Unhandled Errors):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Application Crashes (Unhandled Exceptions):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Denial of Service (Resource Leaks):** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Some LevelDB calls check the status, but not all. Error handling is inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent checking of `leveldb::Status` after *every* LevelDB API call.
    *   Comprehensive and specific error handling for all possible error codes.
    *   Consistent and informative error logging.
    *   Robust recovery/retry mechanisms where appropriate.
    *   Graceful shutdown on unrecoverable errors.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Synchronous Writes Appropriately (LevelDB Option)](./mitigation_strategies/use_synchronous_writes_appropriately__leveldb_option_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand `leveldb::WriteOptions::sync`:**  This option controls whether a write operation waits for the data to be written to the underlying storage device before returning.
        *   `sync = false` (default):  The write returns immediately after the data is written to the operating system's buffer cache.  This is faster but less durable (data can be lost on a power outage).
        *   `sync = true`: The write waits for the data to be flushed to the physical storage device. This is slower but provides stronger durability guarantees.
    2.  **Use Asynchronously (Default):**  Use asynchronous writes (`sync = false`) for most operations where eventual consistency is acceptable. This provides better performance.
    3.  **Use Synchronously (Sparingly):**  Use synchronous writes (`sync = true`) *only* when absolutely necessary for data durability, such as:
        *   Writing critical metadata.
        *   Writing transaction logs (if you're implementing transactions on top of LevelDB).
        *   Situations where data loss is unacceptable, even in the event of a power failure.
    4. **Set the option:**
        ```c++
        leveldb::WriteOptions write_options;
        write_options.sync = true; // Or false, as appropriate
        leveldb::Status s = db->Put(write_options, key, value);
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss (Power Outage/System Crash):** Severity: Medium/High (depending on the data). Data loss since the last successful *sync*.
    *   **Denial of Service (Excessive Sync Writes):** Severity: Medium.  Too many synchronous writes can significantly slow down the system.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss:** Risk reduced from Medium/High to Low (for data written with `sync = true`).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk *increased* if `sync = true` is used excessively.  Careful consideration is needed.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not explicitly managed. The default (`sync = false`) is likely being used in most cases.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A conscious decision about when to use `sync = true` needs to be made for each write operation.
    *   Code needs to be modified to explicitly set `write_options.sync` appropriately.
