# Attack Surface Analysis for google/leveldb

## Attack Surface: [Insecure default configurations or improper deployment practices can expose the underlying LevelDB data files to unauthorized access or modification.](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations_or_improper_deployment_practices_can_expose_the_underlying_leveldb_d_9106a3bc.md)

*   **How LevelDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** LevelDB relies on the file system for storage and lacks built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms. Security is primarily managed at the operating system level.
    *   **Example:** If the directory containing the LevelDB database files has overly permissive file system permissions, any user or process with access to the server could potentially read or modify the database directly, bypassing the application's intended access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, unauthorized modification of data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Provide clear documentation on secure deployment practices, emphasizing the importance of setting appropriate file system permissions for the LevelDB data directory.
        *   **Users:** Ensure that the LevelDB data directory has restricted permissions, allowing only the application's user account to access it. Avoid storing the database in publicly accessible locations.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure handling of LevelDB snapshots or backups can expose sensitive data.](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_leveldb_snapshots_or_backups_can_expose_sensitive_data.md)

*   **How LevelDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** LevelDB allows creating snapshots for backup purposes. If these snapshots are not stored and accessed securely, they become a potential attack vector.
    *   **Example:** If LevelDB backup files are stored in a publicly accessible location or without proper encryption, an attacker could gain access to historical data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Provide guidance on secure backup and restore procedures, emphasizing encryption and access control for backup files.
        *   **Users:** Ensure that LevelDB backup files are stored securely, with appropriate access controls and encryption.
