## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Write Operations leading to Data Manipulation and DoS](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_write_operations_leading_to_data_manipulation_and_dos.md)

* Exploit Write Operations: The attacker gains the ability to write data to the LevelDB instance used by the application. This could be due to vulnerabilities in the application's API, lack of authentication, or other access control issues.
* Inject Malicious Data: The attacker crafts specific data payloads and writes them to LevelDB. This data is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's logic when the data is later read and processed.
    * Attack Vector: Writing data that causes division by zero errors in the application.
    * Attack Vector: Injecting data that leads to infinite loops or excessive processing in the application.
    * Attack Vector: Writing data that causes incorrect state transitions or unexpected behavior in the application.
* Overwrite Critical Data: The attacker identifies the keys used to store sensitive application state, configuration settings, or user data and overwrites them with malicious values.
    * Attack Vector: Modifying user roles or permissions to gain unauthorized access.
    * Attack Vector: Altering application settings to disrupt functionality or introduce vulnerabilities.
* Write Excessive Data: The attacker repeatedly writes large amounts of data to LevelDB, filling up the available disk space.
    * Attack Vector: Sending numerous write requests with large value sizes.
    * Attack Vector: Writing a large number of unique keys to consume storage space.
    * Outcome: This leads to a denial of service as LevelDB can no longer write new data, and the application may crash or become unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Data Corruption on Disk via Direct File System Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_data_corruption_on_disk_via_direct_file_system_manipulation.md)

* Exploit Data Corruption on Disk: The attacker aims to directly manipulate the underlying data files of the LevelDB database.
* Direct File System Manipulation (Requires OS-level access): The attacker gains unauthorized access to the server's file system where LevelDB's data files (SSTables, MANIFEST, etc.) are stored.
    * Attack Vector: Directly modifying the content of SSTable files to corrupt data entries.
    * Attack Vector: Deleting or renaming critical LevelDB data files, causing the database to fail or lose data.
    * Attack Vector: Introducing inconsistencies between the MANIFEST file and the actual data files, leading to data loss or corruption upon restart.
    * Outcome: This can lead to severe data corruption, application crashes, and data loss. This path typically requires a separate vulnerability allowing OS-level access.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Degrade LevelDB Performance via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_degrade_leveldb_performance_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

* Degrade LevelDB Performance/Availability: The attacker aims to reduce the performance or availability of the application by overloading LevelDB.
* Resource Exhaustion: The attacker focuses on consuming critical resources used by LevelDB.
* Disk Space Exhaustion (Covered above in "Write Excessive Data"): (See details in High-Risk Path 1).
    * Outcome: LevelDB performance degrades significantly as it struggles with limited disk space, eventually leading to potential crashes or unresponsiveness.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Degrade LevelDB Performance/Availability via Denial of Service](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_degrade_leveldb_performanceavailability_via_denial_of_service.md)

* Degrade LevelDB Performance/Availability: The attacker aims to make the application unavailable by overwhelming LevelDB.
* Denial of Service (DoS): The attacker sends a flood of requests to the application, which in turn overwhelms LevelDB.
* Repeated Malicious Requests: The attacker sends a high volume of read or write requests to LevelDB.
    * Attack Vector: Sending a large number of requests for non-existent keys, forcing LevelDB to perform expensive lookups.
    * Attack Vector: Sending a high rate of write requests, overwhelming LevelDB's write pipeline.
    * Attack Vector: Sending requests that trigger expensive internal operations within LevelDB.
    * Outcome: LevelDB becomes overloaded and unable to process legitimate requests, leading to application unavailability.
