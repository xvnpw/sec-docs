# Attack Surface Analysis for google/leveldb

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure through File System Access](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_through_file_system_access.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to the underlying files where LevelDB stores its data allows reading of the database contents.
*   **How LevelDB Contributes:** LevelDB's design involves storing data in files on the file system. The security of these files directly impacts the confidentiality of the data stored within LevelDB.
*   **Example:** An application stores sensitive user data in LevelDB. If the database files have overly permissive file system permissions (e.g., world-readable), an attacker with local access can directly read the LevelDB files and extract the sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential compromise of application secrets or user information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict file system permissions on the LevelDB database directory and files to only the user and group that the application runs under.
    *   Ensure that the operating system and file system are configured securely.
    *   Consider encrypting the LevelDB data at rest using operating system-level encryption or application-level encryption before storing in LevelDB.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Administrative Functionality (if exposed)](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_administrative_functionality__if_exposed_.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized access to or misuse of LevelDB administrative functions exposed by the application leads to data loss or disruption.
*   **How LevelDB Contributes:** LevelDB provides functions like `DestroyDB()`. If the application exposes functionality that directly calls these methods without proper authorization controls, it creates a high-risk attack vector.
*   **Example:** An administrative interface within the application provides a "reset database" button that directly calls `leveldb::DestroyDB()` without requiring proper authentication or authorization. A malicious or accidental user with access to this interface can permanently delete all data in the LevelDB database.
*   **Impact:** Data loss, application malfunction, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls and authentication for any administrative functions that interact with LevelDB, especially destructive operations.
    *   Avoid exposing direct LevelDB administrative functions to untrusted users or interfaces.
    *   Implement confirmation steps or audit logging for destructive operations like database deletion.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Potential Implementation Bugs in LevelDB](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_potential_implementation_bugs_in_leveldb.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting undiscovered vulnerabilities within the LevelDB library itself (e.g., buffer overflows, memory corruption) can lead to severe consequences.
*   **How LevelDB Contributes:** As a C++ library, LevelDB's implementation might contain undiscovered bugs. If the application processes untrusted data that is then passed to LevelDB, these bugs could be triggered.
*   **Example:** A crafted key or value, when processed by LevelDB's internal mechanisms, triggers a buffer overflow, allowing an attacker to potentially execute arbitrary code on the server running the application.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption, complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical if a severe vulnerability exists)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the LevelDB library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to LevelDB.
    *   While difficult for the application developer to directly mitigate, robust input validation and sanitization *before* data reaches LevelDB can reduce the likelihood of triggering such bugs.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools or fuzzing techniques during development to identify potential issues in the application's interaction with LevelDB.
