# Threat Model Analysis for google/leveldb

## Threat: [Malicious Modification of LevelDB Data Files](./threats/malicious_modification_of_leveldb_data_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker with file system access modifies the LevelDB data files directly, corrupting the database or injecting malicious data. This bypasses LevelDB's internal mechanisms and directly alters its storage.

**Impact:** Data integrity is compromised. The application might behave unexpectedly, display incorrect information, or even crash due to the corrupted data within LevelDB. Malicious data injection could lead to further security vulnerabilities within the application logic if it processes the tampered data.

**Affected Component:** File system storage (SST files, log files, manifest files) as directly managed by LevelDB.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement strict file system permissions on the LevelDB data directory, restricting access to the application's user account only. This is the primary defense against direct file modification.
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums) at the application level for critical data stored in LevelDB. While this doesn't prevent modification, it can detect it.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion (Disk Space)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion__disk_space_.md)

**Description:** An attacker intentionally writes a large amount of data to LevelDB through the application's interface, filling up the available disk space on the server. This prevents LevelDB from functioning correctly and impacts the application's ability to write data.

**Impact:** Application availability is severely impacted as LevelDB can no longer write data. This can lead to application errors, crashes, or inability to process new information. Other services on the same server might also be affected if disk space is exhausted system-wide.

**Affected Component:** Write path within LevelDB, storage engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement size limits or quotas on the LevelDB database. This directly limits the amount of data LevelDB can store.
* Regularly monitor disk space usage and implement alerts for low disk space. This allows for proactive intervention.
* Implement mechanisms within the application to manage the data being written to LevelDB, preventing excessive or uncontrolled growth.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in LevelDB Library](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_leveldb_library.md)

**Description:** A previously unknown security vulnerability exists within the LevelDB library itself. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through crafted inputs or specific API calls to gain unauthorized access to data managed by LevelDB, cause a denial of service by crashing LevelDB, or compromise the integrity of the data stored within LevelDB.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from data breaches (unauthorized access to LevelDB data), application crashes or hangs due to LevelDB malfunction, to data corruption within the LevelDB store.

**Affected Component:** Any part of the LevelDB codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Stay updated with the latest stable version of LevelDB and monitor security advisories from the LevelDB project or related security communities.
* Have a plan for patching or upgrading LevelDB quickly if vulnerabilities are discovered and published.
* Consider using static analysis tools or fuzzing techniques on the application's interaction with the LevelDB API to potentially uncover vulnerabilities in how it's being used.
