## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Data Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__data_manipulation.md)

This is a critical area because successful attacks here can directly compromise the integrity and reliability of the application's data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Unauthorized Data Modification](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__unauthorized_data_modification.md)

This sub-node is critical as it directly leads to data corruption or malicious changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Modify Data via Injection](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__modify_data_via_injection.md)

This is a critical node as it represents a common and potentially high-impact attack vector if the application doesn't properly handle data from LevelDB.

This is a critical area because successful attacks here can expose sensitive data, leading to privacy breaches and security compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Leak Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__leak_sensitive_information.md)

This sub-node is critical as it directly results in the exposure of sensitive data.
