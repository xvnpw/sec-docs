## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Google Benchmark

This table outlines high and critical threats directly involving the Google Benchmark library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Benchmark Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Benchmark Code Injection** | An attacker with access to the codebase modifies benchmark functions (using `BENCHMARK` macro, setup/teardown) to execute arbitrary code *during benchmark runs*. This leverages the library's execution framework to perform malicious actions. | Data breach, system compromise, denial of service in the testing environment, misleading performance results. | Benchmark definition code (e.g., `BENCHMARK` macro, `State` object, setup/teardown functions). | **High** | Strict access control to the codebase and testing environment. Mandatory code reviews for benchmark definitions. Input validation for any parameters passed to benchmarks *within the benchmark code*. Use of isolated testing environments for running benchmarks. Consider static analysis tools to detect suspicious code patterns in benchmarks. |
| **Compromised Benchmark Library** | A hypothetical scenario where the Google Benchmark library itself is compromised, potentially through a supply chain attack. This would mean the *library's code* contains malicious elements or vulnerabilities that are then incorporated into the application. | Wide range of impacts depending on the nature of the compromise, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service *within the application or testing environment*. | Entire Google Benchmark library codebase and distribution mechanisms. | **Critical** | Regularly update the benchmark library to the latest stable version from trusted sources. Verify the integrity of the downloaded library (e.g., using checksums provided by the official repository). Consider using dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA). |
| **Insecure Benchmark Configurations (Execution Context)** | Running benchmarks with elevated privileges or in insecure environments allows malicious benchmark code (defined using the library) to leverage those privileges. The *benchmark library's execution* becomes a vector for exploiting the insecure context. | Potential for privilege escalation, unauthorized access to system resources, or broader system compromise *due to the execution context of the benchmark library*. | Benchmark execution environment and the way the benchmark library is invoked (e.g., command-line execution, integration with testing frameworks). | **High** | Follow security best practices for configuring the benchmark library and its execution environment. Adhere to the principle of least privilege for benchmark execution. Avoid running benchmarks with unnecessary elevated privileges. Isolate benchmark execution environments. |
