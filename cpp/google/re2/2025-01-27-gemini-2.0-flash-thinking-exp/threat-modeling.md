# Threat Model Analysis for google/re2

## Threat: [re2 Library Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/re2_library_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

Description:
        Attacker Action: An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability within the `re2` library itself.
        How: The attacker crafts specific inputs or triggers specific conditions that exploit a bug in `re2`'s code. This could be through specially crafted regular expressions or input strings designed to trigger the vulnerability.
    Impact:
        Application crash or unexpected behavior.
        Memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
        Information disclosure if the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive data in memory.
    re2 Component Affected:
        Potentially any component of `re2`, depending on the specific vulnerability. This could include the regex parsing module, compilation module, or the core matching engine.
    Risk Severity:
        High to Critical (depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability. Code execution vulnerabilities are Critical, while crashes or data leaks could be High).
    Mitigation Strategies:
        Keep `re2` Library Up-to-Date:
            Immediately update `re2` to the latest stable version as soon as security patches are released. This is the most critical mitigation.
        Dependency Management and Monitoring:
            Implement robust dependency management practices to track `re2` versions and receive notifications of security updates.
            Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to `re2`.
        Vulnerability Scanning in CI/CD Pipeline:
            Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools into your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to proactively detect known vulnerabilities in `re2` before deployment.
        Input Sanitization (Defense in Depth):
            While `re2` vulnerabilities are within the library itself, sanitizing inputs before passing them to `re2` can act as a defense-in-depth measure.  This might not prevent all exploits, but could potentially mitigate some input-dependent vulnerabilities.
        Security Audits and Penetration Testing:
            Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing that specifically include testing the application's use of `re2` and its resilience to known and potential `re2` vulnerabilities.
