# Attack Surface Analysis for google/re2

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Input Strings](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_input_strings.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an extremely long input string to be matched against a regular expression, potentially consuming excessive memory and processing time.

**How RE2 Contributes:** RE2, while preventing catastrophic backtracking, still needs to process each character of the input string. Extremely large inputs can lead to significant resource consumption by RE2 itself.

**Example:** An application uses RE2 to validate user input in a form field. An attacker submits a multi-megabyte string, causing the server to become unresponsive while RE2 attempts to process it.

**Impact:** Service disruption, resource exhaustion on the server, potential application crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement input size limits:** Restrict the maximum length of input strings processed by RE2.
* **Timeouts for RE2 operations:** Set timeouts for RE2 matching operations to prevent indefinite processing.

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Injection](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious regular expression patterns into the application, leading to unintended behavior when these patterns are used by RE2.

**How RE2 Contributes:** If the application constructs regular expressions dynamically using untrusted input, RE2 will execute these potentially malicious patterns.

**Example:** An application allows users to search logs using a regex. An attacker injects a regex like `.*` or `^.*$` which, while not causing backtracking, could match far more data than intended, potentially overwhelming the system or revealing sensitive information.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, unintended data modification or deletion (if used in replacement operations), potential circumvention of security controls.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict input validation and sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided input that will be used to construct regular expressions.
* **Avoid dynamic regex construction with untrusted input:** If possible, avoid constructing regular expressions dynamically using user-provided data. Use parameterized queries or predefined patterns instead.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in the RE2 Library Itself](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_the_re2_library_itself.md)

**Description:** Bugs or security flaws within the RE2 library could be exploited by providing specific input strings or regular expressions that trigger these vulnerabilities.

**How RE2 Contributes:** The application directly relies on the RE2 library for regex processing, making it susceptible to any vulnerabilities present within the library's code.

**Example:** A hypothetical buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a specific version of RE2. An attacker crafts a regex or input string that triggers this overflow, potentially leading to code execution.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, application crashes, denial of service, information disclosure depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regularly update the RE2 library:** Stay up-to-date with the latest stable version of RE2 to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Monitor for security advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or monitor relevant sources for announcements of vulnerabilities in RE2.
