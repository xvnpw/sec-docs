## Attack Tree Path: [Root: Compromise Application Using RE2 (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/root_compromise_application_using_re2__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful exploitation of the sub-nodes will lead to this compromise, potentially granting unauthorized access, causing denial of service, or manipulating application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Supply Crafted Malicious Regex (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__supply_crafted_malicious_regex__critical_node_.md)

The attacker crafts a regular expression specifically designed to be computationally expensive for the RE2 engine to process. While RE2 is designed to prevent catastrophic backtracking, certain complex patterns can still lead to significant CPU consumption, causing a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1.1. Via User Input Field (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1_1__via_user_input_field__high-risk_path_.md)

An attacker leverages a user-facing input field (e.g., search bar, filter) to inject a crafted malicious regex. When the application uses RE2 to process this user-provided regex against some data, it triggers the resource exhaustion, leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2.1. Via User Input Field (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2_1__via_user_input_field__high-risk_path_.md)

The application uses a predefined regular expression, but the attacker provides a carefully crafted input string through a user-facing field. This input string, when matched against the application's regex, causes RE2 to perform a significant amount of work, leading to high CPU usage and a potential denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Internal State Corruption (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__internal_state_corruption__critical_node_.md)

This refers to the possibility of exploiting a bug within the RE2 library itself. By providing a specific combination of input string and regular expression, an attacker could trigger a vulnerability that corrupts the internal state of the RE2 engine. This could lead to incorrect matching results, application crashes, or, in more severe cases, potentially exploitable conditions like memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.1. Trigger RE2 Bug Leading to Incorrect Matching or Crashes (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_1__trigger_re2_bug_leading_to_incorrect_matching_or_crashes__high-risk_path_.md)

This is the direct action of exploiting an internal state corruption vulnerability. The attacker provides the specific input and regex combination that triggers the bug, leading to the intended negative outcome (incorrect matching or a crash).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Application's Improper Usage of RE2 (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_application's_improper_usage_of_re2__critical_node_.md)

This highlights that vulnerabilities often arise not from the RE2 library itself, but from how the application integrates and utilizes it. This includes issues like insufficient input validation, insecure configuration, and poor error handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__lack_of_input_validationsanitization__critical_node_.md)

The application fails to adequately validate or sanitize user-provided input before using it in RE2 operations. This is a fundamental security flaw that can lead to various exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Pass Untrusted User Input Directly to RE2 (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__pass_untrusted_user_input_directly_to_re2__high-risk_path_.md)

The application directly uses user-provided input as the string to be matched against a regular expression without any prior checks or sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious strings or trigger unexpected behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.1. Without Length Limits (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_1__without_length_limits__high-risk_path_.md)

A specific case of passing untrusted input where the application does not limit the length of the input string. An attacker can provide extremely long strings, potentially leading to excessive memory consumption by the RE2 engine and causing a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1.2. Without Regex Complexity Limits (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_2__without_regex_complexity_limits__high-risk_path_.md)

Another specific case where the application uses a predefined regex but doesn't limit the complexity of the user-provided input string. Attackers can craft input strings that, when matched against the application's regex, lead to resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2. Use User-Provided Regex Without Validation (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2__use_user-provided_regex_without_validation__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This is a highly dangerous practice where the application allows users to define the regular expression itself. Without proper validation, attackers can provide arbitrarily complex or malicious regexes, leading to ReDoS attacks or other unintended consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2.1. Allow Arbitrary Regex Input (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_1__allow_arbitrary_regex_input__high-risk_path_.md)

The direct consequence of not validating user-provided regexes. Attackers have free rein to input any regex they choose, making ReDoS attacks trivial to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1.1. Not Setting Timeout Limits (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_1__not_setting_timeout_limits__high-risk_path_.md)

The application does not configure RE2 with a timeout limit for matching operations. If an attacker provides a malicious regex or input that causes a long-running match, the RE2 engine can consume resources indefinitely, leading to a denial of service.
