# Threat Model Analysis for google/re2

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Regular Expression](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_regular_expression.md)

**Description:**
* An attacker provides a specially crafted, computationally intensive regular expression to a function utilizing RE2.
* RE2, while designed to avoid catastrophic backtracking, can still experience significant CPU usage with extremely complex patterns due to its internal matching algorithms.

**Impact:**
* Excessive CPU consumption on the server hosting the application.
* Slow response times for legitimate user requests.
* Potential service unavailability or crashes due to resource exhaustion.

**Affected RE2 Component:**
* RE2's core matching engine.
* Specifically, the components responsible for handling complex patterns with many alternations, repetitions, or character classes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts for all regex matching operations using RE2.
* Analyze and potentially restrict the complexity of user-provided regular expressions (e.g., limit length, number of quantifiers).
* Monitor server resource usage (CPU) when processing regular expressions.
* Consider using static analysis tools to identify potentially expensive regex patterns.

## Threat: [Implementation Vulnerabilities in RE2](./threats/implementation_vulnerabilities_in_re2.md)

**Description:**
* An attacker exploits undiscovered security vulnerabilities within the RE2 library itself, such as buffer overflows, memory corruption issues, or other implementation flaws.
* This could be triggered by providing specially crafted regular expressions or input strings.

**Impact:**
* Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server.
* Application crashes or unexpected behavior.
* Data corruption or information disclosure.

**Affected RE2 Component:**
* Any part of the RE2 library implementation, depending on the specific vulnerability.
* Could affect parsing, matching, or memory management components.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the RE2 library updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to RE2.
* Consider using static analysis tools on the application code that integrates RE2 to identify potential misuse or vulnerabilities.
