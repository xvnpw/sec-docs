# Threat Model Analysis for google/re2

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via Complex Regex](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__via_complex_regex.md)

* **Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via Complex Regex
    * **Description:** An attacker provides an intentionally complex regular expression that, while not causing catastrophic backtracking due to `re2`'s design, still consumes excessive CPU resources during matching. This can lead to application slowdown or temporary unavailability. The attacker might submit this regex through an input field, API parameter, or any other mechanism where regex matching is performed.
    * **Impact:** Application performance degradation, increased server load, potential temporary service disruption, impacting availability for legitimate users.
    * **Affected Component:** The core matching engine within `re2` (`RE2::Match` or similar functions).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement timeouts for all regular expression matching operations.
        * Analyze the complexity of regular expressions used within the application and identify potentially problematic patterns.
        * If accepting user-provided regular expressions, implement strict validation and sanitization to limit complexity and potential for malicious patterns. Consider using a safe subset of regex syntax.
        * Monitor resource usage (CPU) during regular expression operations and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
        * Consider pre-compiling regular expressions where possible to reduce parsing overhead during runtime.

## Threat: [Unexpected Behavior or Bugs in `re2` Leading to Vulnerabilities](./threats/unexpected_behavior_or_bugs_in__re2__leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Threat:** Unexpected Behavior or Bugs in `re2` Leading to Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:** An attacker leverages undiscovered bugs or edge cases within the `re2` library itself. This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially exploitable conditions. The attacker might trigger these bugs by providing specific input strings or regular expressions that expose the flaw.
    * **Impact:** Unpredictable application behavior, potential security vulnerabilities if bugs allow for memory corruption, information disclosure, or other issues.
    * **Affected Component:** Any part of the `re2` library code, depending on the specific bug.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (can be higher depending on the nature of the bug)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay updated with the latest stable version of the `re2` library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Monitor for reported vulnerabilities and security advisories related to `re2`.
        * Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential issues in how `re2` is used within the application.
        * Implement robust error handling around `re2` operations to prevent crashes from propagating.
