## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Maliciously Crafted Regular Expression & Process Large Input String (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/provide_maliciously_crafted_regular_expression_&_process_large_input_string__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a regular expression that, while adhering to RE2's linear time complexity, is computationally expensive when processing a large input string. This can involve complex alternations, capturing groups, or other features that increase processing time.
*   **Impact (Critical Node: Denial of Service - Resource Exhaustion - CPU):**  The application's CPU resources are exhausted, leading to slow response times or complete unavailability for legitimate users.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement timeouts for regex execution, limit the maximum size of input strings processed by RE2, and implement rate limiting to prevent excessive requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Extremely Large Input String (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/provide_extremely_large_input_string__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides an exceptionally large input string to be processed by RE2. Even with an efficient regex, processing a massive amount of data can consume significant memory.
*   **Impact (Critical Node: Denial of Service - Resource Exhaustion - Memory):** The application's memory resources are exhausted, potentially leading to crashes or instability.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement strict limits on the size of input strings allowed for regex processing and implement memory usage monitoring with alerts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Input that Exploits This Edge Case (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_input_that_exploits_this_edge_case__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a subtle bug or edge case in RE2's matching algorithm. They then craft specific input that triggers this flaw, causing RE2 to produce an incorrect match or fail to match when it should.
*   **Impact (Critical Node: Bypass intended security checks, incorrect data processing):** This can lead to bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms, incorrect data validation, or other logical flaws in the application.
*   **Mitigation:** Keep the RE2 library updated to benefit from bug fixes. Implement thorough testing with a wide range of diverse and potentially malicious inputs. For critical logic, consider using alternative validation methods in addition to regex.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify a Known Vulnerability (e.g., Buffer Overflow, Integer Overflow) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_a_known_vulnerability__e_g___buffer_overflow__integer_overflow___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker discovers a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) in the RE2 library. These vulnerabilities can range from memory corruption issues to potential remote code execution flaws.
*   **Impact (Critical Node: Critical - RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure):** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server; denial of service, crashing the application; or information disclosure, exposing sensitive data.
*   **Mitigation:**  Maintain a rigorous patching schedule and keep the RE2 library updated to the latest stable version. Implement security scanning of dependencies to identify known vulnerabilities. Consider using sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Input that Triggers the Vulnerability (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/provide_input_that_triggers_the_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Once a vulnerability is identified, the attacker crafts specific input designed to trigger that vulnerability in the RE2 library.
*   **Impact (Critical Node: Critical - Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure):**  As above, successful exploitation can have severe consequences.
*   **Mitigation:**  The primary mitigation is to patch the vulnerability by updating the RE2 library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Regex that Alters Matching Behavior (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_regex_that_alters_matching_behavior__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The application dynamically constructs a regular expression using user-provided input without proper sanitization. An attacker injects malicious regex components into this input, altering the intended matching behavior of the regex. For example, injecting `.*` could bypass intended restrictions.
*   **Impact (Critical Node: Medium to High - Bypass intended security checks, incorrect data processing, potential for further exploitation):** This can allow attackers to bypass security controls, manipulate data in unintended ways, or gain access to resources they shouldn't.
*   **Mitigation:**  Never directly embed user input into regular expression patterns. Use parameterized regex patterns where user input is treated as a literal string to be matched. Implement strict input validation and sanitization to remove or escape potentially harmful regex metacharacters. Validate the final constructed regex against an allow-list of safe patterns.
