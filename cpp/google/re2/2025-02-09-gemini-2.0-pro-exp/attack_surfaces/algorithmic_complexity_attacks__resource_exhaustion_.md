# Deep Analysis: Algorithmic Complexity Attacks on re2

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand and mitigate the risk of algorithmic complexity attacks targeting applications that utilize the Google re2 regular expression library.  Specifically, we aim to:

*   Identify specific scenarios where re2, despite its linear-time guarantee, can be exploited to cause excessive resource consumption (CPU and memory).
*   Develop concrete, actionable recommendations for developers to prevent or mitigate these attacks.
*   Establish a testing methodology to validate the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.
*   Provide clear guidance on configuring re2 and the surrounding application to minimize vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the algorithmic complexity attack surface related to the re2 library.  It encompasses:

*   **re2's Internal Mechanisms:**  Understanding how re2 processes regular expressions and input strings, and identifying potential areas of high resource consumption.
*   **User-Supplied Input:**  Analyzing the risks associated with both user-provided regular expressions and input strings.
*   **Configuration Options:**  Examining re2's configuration parameters (e.g., `max_mem`) and their impact on resource usage.
*   **Integration with Application Logic:**  Considering how the application handles re2 results and manages resources.
*   **Server Environment:**  Acknowledging the role of server-side resource limits and monitoring.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other attack vectors unrelated to re2 (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
*   Vulnerabilities within the re2 library itself (assuming re2 is up-to-date).  We are focused on *misuse* of re2, not bugs in re2.
*   Network-level DDoS attacks.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Literature Review:**  Review existing research on regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), algorithmic complexity attacks, and re2's performance characteristics.
2.  **Code Review (re2):**  Examine relevant parts of the re2 source code (available on GitHub) to understand its internal workings, particularly the DFA/NFA construction and matching algorithms. This is to understand *why* certain inputs are expensive, not to find bugs.
3.  **Code Review (Application):**  Analyze how the target application uses re2, including input validation, regular expression handling, and resource management.
4.  **Fuzz Testing:**  Develop a fuzzing strategy to generate a wide range of input strings and regular expressions, including potentially malicious ones.  This will involve:
    *   **Grammar-Based Fuzzing:**  Generate regular expressions based on a grammar that defines the structure of regular expressions, allowing for controlled generation of complex patterns.
    *   **Mutation-Based Fuzzing:**  Start with known "good" and "bad" regular expressions and input strings, and apply mutations (e.g., adding characters, changing quantifiers, inserting alternations) to explore variations.
    *   **Coverage-Guided Fuzzing:** Use a coverage-guided fuzzer (like AFL++ or libFuzzer) to explore different code paths within re2. This is less critical than grammar/mutation-based fuzzing for this specific attack surface.
5.  **Performance Benchmarking:**  Measure the CPU and memory usage of re2 when processing various inputs, using tools like `perf`, `valgrind` (specifically, Massif), and custom benchmarking scripts.
6.  **Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (if available and suitable) to identify potentially problematic regular expressions or code patterns.
7.  **Threat Modeling:**  Develop a threat model to identify specific attack scenarios and their potential impact.
8.  **Mitigation Implementation and Testing:**  Implement the recommended mitigations and rigorously test their effectiveness using the fuzzing and benchmarking techniques described above.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1.  Understanding re2's Limitations

While re2 guarantees linear time complexity (O(n) where n is the input string length), the constant factor within that linear time can be significant.  This means that even though the execution time grows linearly with the input, the *actual* execution time can still be very high for certain inputs.  Key factors contributing to this include:

*   **DFA State Explosion:**  Certain regular expressions, particularly those with many alternations or nested quantifiers, can lead to a large number of states in the Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that re2 constructs.  Building and traversing this DFA consumes both CPU and memory.
*   **NFA Simulation:**  For regular expressions that cannot be fully converted to a DFA (e.g., those with backreferences), re2 uses a Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) simulation.  While still linear, this simulation can be slower than DFA execution.
*   **Character Class Handling:**  Large character classes (e.g., `[\x00-\xFF]`) or complex Unicode character properties can increase processing time.
*   **Long Input Strings:**  Even with a simple regular expression, a very long input string will naturally take longer to process.

### 4.2.  Specific Attack Scenarios

Here are some specific attack scenarios, building on the initial description:

*   **Scenario 1:  Alternation Overload:**
    *   **Regular Expression:** `(a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|j|k|l|m|n|o|p|q|r|s|t|u|v|w|x|y|z){100}`  (or even longer)
    *   **Input String:**  A relatively short string like "aaaaaaaaaa".
    *   **Explanation:**  The large number of alternations forces re2 to create a DFA with many states, consuming significant memory.  The `{100}` quantifier exacerbates this.
    *   **Mitigation:** Limit the number of alternations allowed in user-supplied regular expressions.

*   **Scenario 2:  Nested Quantifiers:**
    *   **Regular Expression:** `(a*)*` (although seemingly simple, this can be problematic) or `(a+){10,}`
    *   **Input String:**  A long string of "a" characters.
    *   **Explanation:**  Nested quantifiers, even if not causing catastrophic backtracking, can still lead to a large number of DFA states or NFA simulation steps.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Limit the nesting depth of quantifiers.

*   **Scenario 3:  Large Character Classes:**
    *   **Regular Expression:** `[\x00-\xFF]+` (matches any byte, one or more times)
    *   **Input String:**  A long string of arbitrary bytes.
    *   **Explanation:**  While re2 handles character classes efficiently, extremely large ones can still contribute to resource consumption.
    *   **Mitigation:**  If possible, restrict character classes to smaller, more specific ranges.

*   **Scenario 4:  Long Input String with Simple Regex:**
    *   **Regular Expression:** `a+`
    *   **Input String:**  A 10MB string of "a" characters.
    *   **Explanation:**  Even a simple regex can take a long time to process a very large input.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Strictly limit the maximum input string length.  This is the *most important* mitigation.

*   **Scenario 5:  Unicode Complexity:**
    *   **Regular Expression:** `\p{L}+` (matches one or more Unicode letters)
    *   **Input String:**  A long string containing complex Unicode characters (e.g., combining characters, characters from different scripts).
    *   **Explanation:**  Unicode processing can be more complex than simple ASCII processing.
    *   **Mitigation:**  If possible, restrict the allowed character set to a subset of Unicode.

### 4.3.  Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Here's a more detailed breakdown of the mitigation strategies, including specific recommendations and considerations:

1.  **Strict Input Length Limits (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Implement strict, *low* limits on both the input string length and the regular expression length (if user-supplied).  Start with conservative limits (e.g., 1KB for input strings, 256 bytes for regular expressions) and adjust based on performance testing and application requirements.  Err on the side of being too strict.
    *   **Implementation:**  Enforce these limits *before* passing the input to re2.  Use simple string length checks.
    *   **Rationale:**  This is the most effective and straightforward mitigation, as it directly limits the primary factor influencing execution time.

2.  **Regular Expression Complexity Limits (If User-Supplied):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  If regular expressions are user-supplied, implement a strict whitelist of allowed patterns or a parser that enforces limits on:
        *   **Number of Alternations:**  Limit the number of `|` operators.
        *   **Nesting Depth:**  Limit the nesting of parentheses and quantifiers.
        *   **Character Class Size:**  Restrict the use of large character classes (e.g., `.` or `[\x00-\xFF]`).
        *   **Lookarounds:**  Disallow or severely restrict lookarounds (positive or negative lookahead/lookbehind).
        *   **Backreferences:** Disallow backreferences.
    *   **Implementation:**  Use a regular expression parser (potentially a simplified one) to analyze the structure of the regular expression and reject those that exceed the defined limits.  Alternatively, use a whitelist of pre-approved regular expressions.
    *   **Rationale:**  Complex regular expressions are a major contributor to resource consumption.  Limiting their complexity directly reduces the attack surface.

3.  **re2 Memory Limits (`max_mem`):**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Set the `max_mem` option in re2's configuration to a reasonable value.  This provides a hard limit on the memory that re2 can allocate, preventing it from consuming all available memory.
    *   **Implementation:**  Use the `re2::RE2::Options` class to set `max_mem` when creating the `re2::RE2` object.  For example:
        ```c++
        re2::RE2::Options options;
        options.set_max_mem(1024 * 1024); // Limit to 1MB
        re2::RE2 re("pattern", options);
        ```
    *   **Rationale:**  This provides a crucial safety net, preventing a single regular expression operation from exhausting all available memory.

4.  **Resource Monitoring and Throttling:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Implement monitoring of CPU and memory usage for processes that use re2.  If resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds, terminate the re2 operation and return an error.
    *   **Implementation:**  Use system monitoring tools (e.g., `top`, `ps`, `systemd-cgtop`) or libraries (e.g., `libproc`) to track resource usage.  Implement a mechanism to interrupt the re2 operation (e.g., using a separate thread or signal handling).
    *   **Rationale:**  This provides a dynamic defense against resource exhaustion attacks, even if the other mitigations are not completely effective.

5.  **Profiling and Benchmarking:**
    *   **Recommendation:**  Regularly profile and benchmark the application with a variety of inputs, including both normal and potentially malicious ones.  Use profiling tools to identify performance bottlenecks and areas of high resource consumption.
    *   **Implementation:**  Use tools like `gprof`, `perf`, `valgrind` (Massif), and custom benchmarking scripts.
    *   **Rationale:**  This helps to identify performance issues early and to validate the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.

6. **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Recommendation:** Before passing data to re2, validate that it conforms to expected formats and character sets. Sanitize the input by removing or escaping potentially problematic characters *if and only if* it does not change the intended meaning of the input in the context of the application.
    * **Implementation:** Use appropriate validation functions based on the expected data type (e.g., email addresses, URLs, numeric values).
    * **Rationale:** Reduces the likelihood of unexpected or malicious input reaching re2.

7. **Rate Limiting:**
    * **Recommendation:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of regular expression operations that a single user or IP address can perform within a given time period.
    * **Implementation:** Use a rate-limiting library or implement a custom solution using a database or in-memory cache.
    * **Rationale:** Prevents attackers from flooding the application with requests that consume excessive resources.

8. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    * **Recommendation:** Consider using a WAF that has rules to detect and block common ReDoS patterns.
    * **Implementation:** Configure the WAF to inspect request parameters and headers for suspicious regular expressions.
    * **Rationale:** Provides an additional layer of defense against known ReDoS attacks. *However, do not rely solely on a WAF.*

### 4.4. Testing and Validation

Thorough testing is crucial to ensure the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.  The testing strategy should include:

*   **Unit Tests:**  Test individual components of the application that use re2, with a focus on input validation and regular expression handling.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the interaction between different components of the application, including re2.
*   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzzing techniques (as described in the Methodology section) to generate a wide range of inputs and regular expressions, including potentially malicious ones.
*   **Performance Benchmarking:**  Measure the CPU and memory usage of re2 under various load conditions, including both normal and attack scenarios.
*   **Regression Testing:**  Ensure that new features or changes do not introduce new vulnerabilities or regressions in existing mitigations.

## 5. Conclusion

Algorithmic complexity attacks against applications using re2 are a serious threat, even with re2's linear-time guarantee.  By understanding the limitations of re2 and implementing a combination of strict input limits, regular expression complexity restrictions, memory limits, resource monitoring, and thorough testing, developers can significantly reduce the risk of these attacks and build more robust and secure applications. The most important mitigation is strict input length limits.  All other mitigations are secondary to this.
