# Threat Model Analysis for protocolbuffers/protobuf

## Threat: [Compromised `protoc` Compiler](./threats/compromised__protoc__compiler.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised `protoc` Compiler
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the `protoc` compiler binary or the environment where it's executed. This could allow them to inject malicious code into the generated source code *by exploiting a vulnerability in the `protoc` compiler itself or by replacing the legitimate binary*. The injected code would then become part of the application when it's built.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application, including data exfiltration, remote code execution, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** `protoc` compiler binary, build environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Obtain `protoc` from trusted sources and verify its integrity (e.g., checksums). Use isolated and controlled build environments. Regularly update `protoc` to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches. Consider using containerized builds with known good versions.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Excessively Large Messages](./threats/deserialization_of_excessively_large_messages.md)

*   **Threat:** Deserialization of Excessively Large Messages
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a deliberately crafted protobuf message with extremely large fields or a very large number of repeated fields. When the application attempts to deserialize this message *using the `protobuf` library's deserialization functions*, it could consume excessive memory, leading to a denial-of-service. This is due to how the library allocates memory based on the message size.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to memory exhaustion. Potential for application crashes or instability.
    *   **Affected Component:** Deserialization functions in the generated code (e.g., `ParseFrom*` methods) within the `protobuf` library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement limits on the maximum size of incoming protobuf messages *before passing them to the `protobuf` deserialization functions*. Configure deserialization options within the `protobuf` library (if available in your language binding) to limit resource usage. Implement timeouts for deserialization operations.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Size Calculations](./threats/integer_overflow_in_size_calculations.md)

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow in Size Calculations
    *   **Description:** An attacker might craft a message with extremely large field sizes that, when multiplied or added during size calculation *within the `protobuf` library's deserialization process*, could lead to integer overflows. This could result in incorrect memory allocation or buffer overflows during deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for buffer overflows, memory corruption, and potentially code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Internal size calculation logic within the `protobuf` library's deserialization functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Keep the `protobuf` library updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address potential integer overflow issues. Be aware of potential limitations in handling extremely large values and consider validating message sizes before deserialization.

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted `.proto` Definitions](./threats/maliciously_crafted___proto__definitions.md)

*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted `.proto` Definitions
    *   **Description:** An attacker might compromise the source code repository or influence a developer to introduce a crafted `.proto` file. This file could define messages with excessively large fields (strings, bytes, repeated fields) or deeply nested structures. When the application uses the *generated code from this malicious `.proto` file with the `protobuf` library*, it could lead to excessive resource consumption during serialization or deserialization.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service due to resource exhaustion. Potential for logical errors or unexpected behavior if the application doesn't handle the crafted definitions correctly.
    *   **Affected Component:** `.proto` definition files, serialization/deserialization logic in generated code (which is part of the `protobuf` ecosystem).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Strict code review of `.proto` files, automated linting and validation of definitions, version control with access controls, secure development practices for managing `.proto` files.
