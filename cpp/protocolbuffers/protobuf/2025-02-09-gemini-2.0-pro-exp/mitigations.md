# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for protocolbuffers/protobuf

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Message Size and Depth Limits (Protobuf Parsing)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_message_size_and_depth_limits__protobuf_parsing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Maximums:** Determine reasonable maximums for message size (bytes) and nesting depth, based on legitimate use cases.
    2.  **Configure Protobuf Parser:** Use the *protobuf library's* configuration options to enforce these limits *during parsing*.  This is crucial; it's not sufficient to check the size *after* the message has been fully parsed. Examples:
        *   **C++:** `CodedInputStream::SetTotalBytesLimit()` and `CodedInputStream::SetRecursionLimit()`.
        *   **Java:** `CodedInputStream.setSizeLimit()` and similar methods.
        *   **Python:** `google.protobuf.message.SetRecursionLimit()`.
    3.  **Handle Limit Violations (Protobuf Error):** The protobuf parser will return a specific error (e.g., a `DecodeError` in Python, an exception in C++/Java) when a limit is exceeded.  Your code *must* catch this *protobuf-specific* error and handle it gracefully (reject, log, respond).
    4.  **Limit Repeated Fields (During Parsing):** Within your parsing loop, *while* processing a `repeated` field, check the number of elements against a predefined maximum.  This is done *in conjunction with* the overall message size limit.
    5. **Test with Protobuf:** Generate test messages (using protobuf) that are near, at, and above your limits to verify the parser's behavior.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Oversized Message DoS (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from sending huge messages that exhaust server resources *during protobuf parsing*.
    *   **Protobuf Bomb DoS (Severity: High):** Prevents deeply nested messages from causing stack overflows or excessive memory allocation *during protobuf parsing*.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion attacks specifically targeting the protobuf parsing stage.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Oversized Message DoS:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Protobuf Bomb DoS:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced (High to Medium/Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Example: Implemented in `ProtobufMessageHandler::parseMessage` using `CodedInputStream` limits. Limits are 1MB and 50 levels.* ] **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Example: Repeated field limits are not enforced during parsing in `src/legacy_parser.cc`.* ] **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Protobuf Libraries Updated and Fuzz Test (Protobuf Parser)](./mitigation_strategies/keep_protobuf_libraries_updated_and_fuzz_test__protobuf_parser_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Update Protobuf Components:** Regularly update *both* the protobuf compiler (`protoc`) *and* the runtime libraries used in your application (C++, Java, Python, etc.).  These are distinct components, and both need to be kept current.
    2.  **Protobuf Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories specifically for the *protobuf project* (e.g., the GitHub repository, mailing lists).
    3.  **Fuzz Protobuf Parser:** Integrate fuzz testing that specifically targets the *protobuf parsing* functionality.  The fuzzer should generate *binary* protobuf data (not text-based `.proto` files).
    4.  **Fuzz Target (Protobuf Input):** Your fuzz target should take a raw byte array as input and attempt to parse it as a protobuf message *using the protobuf library's parsing functions*.
    5.  **Continuous Fuzzing (Protobuf):** Ideally, use a platform like OSS-Fuzz for continuous fuzzing of the protobuf parser.
    6.  **Triage Protobuf Crashes:**  Prioritize and fix any crashes or errors reported by the fuzzer that occur *within the protobuf library itself*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Parser Vulnerabilities (Severity: High/Critical):** Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in the *protobuf parser implementation*.
    *   **Code Execution (Severity: Critical):** Helps prevent vulnerabilities in the *protobuf parser* that could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Medium/High):** Helps prevent vulnerabilities in the *protobuf parser* that could leak information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Parser Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced (High/Critical to Low/Medium).
    *   **Code Execution:** Risk significantly reduced (Critical to Low).
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (Medium/High to Low/Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Example: Protobuf library is updated monthly. Fuzz testing is implemented using `libprotobuf-mutator` and integrated into the CI pipeline.* ] **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Example: Continuous fuzzing with OSS-Fuzz is not yet set up. Fuzzing only covers a subset of message types.* ] **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Unknown Field Handling (Protobuf Schema)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_unknown_field_handling__protobuf_schema_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Protobuf Strategy:** Decide how your application will handle "unknown fields" (fields present in the serialized data but not defined in the *current* `.proto` schema):
        *   **Reject (Recommended):** Configure the protobuf parser to *reject* any message containing unknown fields. This is the most secure option.
        *   **Log:** Log the presence and content of unknown fields.
        *   **Ignore (with extreme caution):** Only if you are *absolutely certain* your code never interacts with unknown fields.
    2.  **Protobuf Parser Configuration:** Use the protobuf library's configuration options to enforce your chosen strategy.  This is a setting within the *protobuf parsing API*. Examples:
        *   **C++:** Use `FailoverInputStream` and `set_require_parse_success(true)` to reject.
        *   **Java:** Use `JsonFormat.Parser.ignoringUnknownFields()` (for JSON format) or similar options for binary format.
        *   **Python:**  The default behavior is to preserve unknown fields, but you can iterate over `_unknown_fields` and raise an exception.
    3.  **Schema Evolution (Protobuf):** Follow strict `.proto` schema evolution best practices:
        *   **Never Reuse Field Numbers:** This is a fundamental rule of protobuf schema evolution.
        *   **Use `reserved`:** When removing fields, mark their field numbers and names as `reserved` in the `.proto` file. This prevents accidental reuse.
    4. **Test with Protobuf:** Generate test messages (using protobuf) that include unknown fields to verify your parser's behavior.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Injection via Unknown Fields (Severity: Medium/High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious data into unknown fields that might be inadvertently processed. This is a *protobuf-specific* threat.
    *   **Logic Bugs (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of unexpected behavior caused by unknown fields interacting with application logic.
    *   **Compatibility Issues (Severity: Low/Medium):** Helps maintain compatibility between different versions of your application *using protobuf*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Injection:** Risk significantly reduced (Medium/High to Low, if rejecting).
    *   **Logic Bugs:** Risk reduced (Medium to Low).
    *   **Compatibility Issues:** Risk reduced (Low/Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Example: The application currently ignores unknown fields.  The `.proto` files use the `reserved` keyword correctly.* ] **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Example: The application should be configured to *reject* messages with unknown fields. This requires changes to the protobuf parsing logic.* ] **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Overflow Checks (Post-Protobuf Parsing)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_overflow_checks__post-protobuf_parsing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Post-Parsing Validation:** *After* successfully parsing a protobuf message using the protobuf library, implement additional validation logic. The `.proto` schema is *not* sufficient for full validation.
    2.  **Data Type Checks:** Verify that values are within the expected range for their protobuf data type (e.g., a `uint32` is actually non-negative).
    3.  **Overflow Checks (After Protobuf Decode):** For integer fields, perform explicit overflow checks *after* the protobuf library has decoded the value.  The variable-length encoding of protobuf integers can lead to subtle overflow issues if not handled carefully.
        ```c++
        // Example: Checking for overflow with a uint64_t from protobuf
        uint64_t value = my_message.some_uint64_field();
        if (value > MAX_ALLOWED_VALUE) { // MAX_ALLOWED_VALUE is your application-specific limit
            // Handle the overflow
        }
        ```
    4.  **Business Rules:** Enforce application-specific business rules that go beyond the basic data types defined in the `.proto` file.
    5. **Test with Valid and Invalid Protobuf:** Test your validation logic with both valid and *invalid* protobuf messages (generated using protobuf) to ensure it catches all expected errors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Integer Overflow (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from exploiting integer overflow vulnerabilities *after* protobuf decoding.
    *   **Logic Bugs (Severity: Medium/High):** Reduces the risk of unexpected behavior caused by invalid data that is structurally valid according to the `.proto` schema.
    *   **Data Corruption (Severity: Medium/High):** Prevents invalid data from being stored or processed after it has been parsed by the protobuf library.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Integer Overflow:** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low).
    *   **Logic Bugs:** Risk reduced (Medium/High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced (Medium/High to Low/Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:** [ *Example: Basic range checks are performed on some integer fields after protobuf parsing, but not all. Overflow checks are inconsistent.* ] **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**

*   **Missing Implementation:** [ *Example: Comprehensive input validation and overflow checks need to be implemented for all message fields after protobuf parsing, especially in the financial transaction module.* ] **<-- YOU FILL THIS IN**
