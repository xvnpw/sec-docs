# Threat Model Analysis for protocolbuffers/protobuf

## Threat: [Maliciously Crafted Large Message](./threats/maliciously_crafted_large_message.md)

*   **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted Large Message

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large protobuf message, exceeding expected size limits. The attacker crafts a message with many fields, large string values, or large repeated fields, specifically targeting the protobuf deserialization process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory allocation on the server during protobuf deserialization, potentially crashing the application or the entire server.
    *   **Protobuf Component Affected:** Deserialization process (e.g., `ParseFromString` in C++, `parseFrom` in Java, `decode` in Python). The core parsing logic is directly affected.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict message size limits on both the client and server. Reject messages exceeding this limit *before* attempting protobuf parsing.
        *   Use streaming APIs (if available and appropriate) to process the protobuf message in chunks, avoiding loading the entire message into memory at once.

## Threat: [Deeply Nested Message Attack](./threats/deeply_nested_message_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** Deeply Nested Message Attack

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a protobuf message with excessive nesting depth, exploiting the recursive nature of protobuf message handling. The attacker crafts a message with many nested message types, potentially exploiting recursive definitions within the `.proto` file.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU consumption and potential stack overflow during protobuf deserialization, potentially crashing the application.
    *   **Protobuf Component Affected:** Deserialization process, specifically the recursive handling of nested message types within the protobuf parsing library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Limit the maximum nesting depth allowed during protobuf deserialization. Reject messages exceeding this limit *before* deep parsing occurs.
        *   Avoid recursive message definitions in your `.proto` files whenever possible. If recursion is necessary, implement strict validation within your application logic to prevent infinite loops, *in addition to* the protobuf library's depth limit.

## Threat: [Repeated Field Overflow](./threats/repeated_field_overflow.md)

*   **Threat:** Repeated Field Overflow

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a protobuf message with an excessively large number of elements in a repeated field, directly targeting the memory allocation behavior of the protobuf deserialization process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive memory allocation and CPU consumption during protobuf deserialization of the repeated field.
    *   **Protobuf Component Affected:** Deserialization of repeated fields (handling of the `repeated` keyword in the `.proto` definition and the corresponding parsing logic within the protobuf library).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce limits on the maximum number of elements allowed in repeated fields *within the protobuf deserialization process*. This may require configuration options specific to your chosen protobuf library.
        *   Consider using alternative data structures (e.g., maps) if the number of elements is potentially unbounded and can be controlled by an attacker.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Protobuf Library or Extensions](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_protobuf_library_or_extensions.md)

*  **Threat:**  Vulnerabilities in Protobuf Library or Extensions

    *   **Description:**  A security vulnerability is discovered in the core protobuf library itself (e.g., a buffer overflow in the parsing logic) or in a custom protobuf extension that you are using. This is a direct vulnerability *within* the protobuf code.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. This could lead to complete system compromise.
    *   **Protobuf Component Affected:**  The specific vulnerable component within the protobuf library or extension (e.g., a specific parsing function, a particular extension module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the protobuf library and all related dependencies (including any extensions) updated to the latest versions.  Prioritize security updates.
        *   Monitor security advisories for the protobuf library and any extensions you use. Subscribe to relevant mailing lists or security feeds.
        *   Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track vulnerabilities in your dependencies, including the protobuf library.
        *   If using custom extensions, conduct thorough security reviews and fuzz testing of the extension code.
