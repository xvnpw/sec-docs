## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This node represents a broad category of attacks that target the process of converting the binary protobuf data back into application objects.
    *   Weaknesses in deserialization logic can be exploited to cause various security issues.
    *   This is a critical entry point because successful exploitation here can lead to severe consequences like code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Buffer Overflow -> Send Maliciously Crafted Message with Oversized Fields](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_-_trigger_buffer_overflow_-_send_maliciously__80515a84.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting buffer overflow vulnerabilities during the deserialization process.
    *   **Mechanism:** Protocol Buffers use length prefixes to indicate the size of fields, particularly strings and byte arrays. If an attacker can manipulate these length prefixes to indicate a size larger than the allocated buffer, writing the field's data can overwrite adjacent memory.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the application or the underlying system.
    *   **Mitigation:** Strict validation of length prefixes and the use of safe memory handling practices during deserialization are crucial to prevent this attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Trigger Buffer Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_buffer_overflow.md)

*   This node represents the point where the buffer overflow actually occurs.
    *   It is critical because a successful buffer overflow is a direct path to code execution, a highly severe security vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Send Maliciously Crafted Message with Oversized Fields](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_send_maliciously_crafted_message_with_oversized_fields.md)

*   This node represents the specific action the attacker takes to trigger the buffer overflow.
    *   It involves crafting a protobuf message where the length prefix of a string or byte field is intentionally set to a value exceeding the buffer's capacity.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities -> Trigger Resource Exhaustion (DoS) -> Send Extremely Large Messages](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_-_trigger_resource_exhaustion__dos__-_send_ex_8f29ec2a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on causing a denial-of-service (DoS) by overwhelming the application with excessively large protobuf messages.
    *   **Mechanism:**  Deserializing very large messages consumes significant CPU and memory resources. By sending messages exceeding reasonable limits, an attacker can exhaust these resources, making the application unresponsive or causing it to crash.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation leads to a denial of service, preventing legitimate users from accessing the application.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implementing limits on the maximum size of incoming protobuf messages is essential to prevent this attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Trigger Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   This node represents the point where the application's resources are being exhausted, leading to a denial of service.
    *   It is critical because it directly impacts the availability of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Send Extremely Large Messages](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_send_extremely_large_messages.md)

*   This node represents the specific action the attacker takes to trigger the resource exhaustion.
    *   It involves sending protobuf messages with unusually large fields or a large number of repeated fields, designed to consume excessive resources during deserialization.
