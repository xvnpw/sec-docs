# Threat Model Analysis for grpc/grpc

## Threat: [Protobuf Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./threats/protobuf_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: An attacker crafts malicious protobuf messages and sends them to the gRPC server or client. These messages exploit flaws in the protobuf deserialization process, potentially triggering buffer overflows, memory corruption, or logic errors. This can be achieved by manipulating message fields, nesting levels, or data types in unexpected ways.
Impact: Denial of Service (DoS) - server or client crashes, Remote Code Execution (RCE) - attacker gains control of the server or client, Information Disclosure - sensitive data is leaked, Data Corruption - data integrity is compromised.
Affected gRPC Component: Protobuf library, Deserialization functions within generated gRPC code, potentially custom deserialization logic.
Risk Severity: High to Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Use the latest stable version of the protobuf library and gRPC framework.
    *   Implement input validation on protobuf messages beyond schema validation, checking for business logic constraints and resource limits.
    *   Employ fuzzing and security testing techniques specifically targeting protobuf deserialization.
    *   Monitor for and patch any reported vulnerabilities in protobuf libraries promptly.
    *   Carefully manage protobuf schema evolution to ensure compatibility and prevent unexpected deserialization behavior.

## Threat: [HTTP/2 Denial of Service Attacks](./threats/http2_denial_of_service_attacks.md)

Description: An attacker exploits HTTP/2 features to overwhelm the gRPC server. This can involve sending a flood of RST_STREAM frames (Rapid Reset Attack), sending excessively large compressed headers (HPACK Bomb), or opening a massive number of streams (Stream Multiplexing Abuse). The attacker aims to exhaust server resources like CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, making the service unavailable to legitimate users.
Impact: Denial of Service (DoS) - gRPC service becomes unavailable, Resource Exhaustion - server performance degrades or crashes, Performance Degradation - slow response times for legitimate requests.
Affected gRPC Component: HTTP/2 transport layer within gRPC, gRPC server's connection handling and stream management.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Configure HTTP/2 server settings to limit:
        *   `max_concurrent_streams`: Maximum number of concurrent streams per connection.
        *   `max_header_list_size`: Maximum size of header lists.
        *   `initial_window_size`: Initial flow control window size.
    *   Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or reverse proxy with HTTP/2 specific DoS protection rules.
    *   Implement rate limiting on incoming requests at the connection or stream level.
    *   Monitor server resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts for anomalies.

## Threat: [Streaming Resource Exhaustion](./threats/streaming_resource_exhaustion.md)

Description: A malicious client or compromised account abuses gRPC streaming features. The attacker initiates numerous concurrent streams, sends extremely large messages through streams, or keeps streams open for extended periods without sending data. This consumes server-side resources (memory, connections, processing threads) intended for handling legitimate streaming requests, leading to service degradation or failure.
Impact: Denial of Service (DoS) - gRPC streaming services become unavailable or unresponsive, Resource Exhaustion - server runs out of resources, Performance Degradation - slow streaming performance for other clients, Server Instability - potential server crashes.
Affected gRPC Component: gRPC streaming implementation, server-side stream handling logic, resource management for streams.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement rate limiting on streaming requests, controlling the number of streams per client or connection.
    *   Set maximum message size limits for streaming messages to prevent excessively large data transfers.
    *   Implement backpressure mechanisms to control data flow and prevent server overload during streaming.
    *   Set timeouts for streams to automatically close idle or long-running streams and reclaim resources.
    *   Monitor resource usage for streaming services and implement alerts for unusual streaming activity patterns.

## Threat: [Insecure Authentication and Authorization](./threats/insecure_authentication_and_authorization.md)

Description: An attacker exploits weaknesses in the gRPC service's authentication and authorization implementation. This could involve bypassing authentication checks due to misconfiguration, exploiting vulnerabilities in custom authentication logic, or leveraging weak or missing authorization controls to access resources or functionalities they are not permitted to use. Attackers might use stolen credentials, exploit session management flaws, or attempt privilege escalation.
Impact: Unauthorized Access - attacker gains access to restricted gRPC services or data, Data Breach - sensitive information is exposed or stolen, Data Manipulation - attacker modifies data they shouldn't, Elevation of Privilege - attacker gains higher privileges than authorized, Repudiation - attacker actions cannot be reliably attributed.
Affected gRPC Component: Authentication interceptors, Authorization logic within gRPC service methods or interceptors, credential management, session management.
Risk Severity: Critical to High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms like mutual TLS (mTLS), OAuth 2.0, API keys, or JWT.
    *   Enforce robust server-side authorization checks for every gRPC method, based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Use secure credential storage and transmission methods; avoid hardcoding credentials.
    *   Regularly review and penetration test authentication and authorization logic.
    *   Utilize gRPC interceptors for centralized and consistent authentication and authorization enforcement.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Generated Code](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_generated_code.md)

Description: While less frequent, vulnerabilities could exist within the code generated by gRPC's protobuf compiler (`protoc`) or related plugins. If the code generation process has flaws, or if generated code is not reviewed, it might introduce security weaknesses like buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other code-level vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting specific inputs or requests that trigger the flawed generated code paths.
Impact: Varies widely depending on the vulnerability - could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, or Data Corruption.
Affected gRPC Component: Code generated by `protoc` from `.proto` files, gRPC client and server libraries that rely on generated code.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Use official and trusted gRPC code generation tools and plugins from reputable sources.
    *   Keep gRPC libraries and code generation tools updated to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Review the generated code, especially if customizing the generation process or using third-party plugins, to identify potential security issues.
    *   Perform static analysis and code scanning on generated code to detect common vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Interceptor Vulnerabilities](./threats/interceptor_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: gRPC interceptors are used to add cross-cutting functionality. If interceptors are not implemented securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities. For example, a flawed authentication interceptor might incorrectly validate credentials, leading to authentication bypass. A logging interceptor might leak sensitive data. An attacker could exploit these interceptor flaws to bypass security controls, gain unauthorized access, or cause other security issues.
Impact: Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass, Information Disclosure (via logging), Performance Degradation (if interceptor is inefficient), other vulnerabilities depending on the interceptor's purpose.
Affected gRPC Component: Custom gRPC interceptor implementations, gRPC interceptor chain execution.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    *   Thoroughly review and security test custom interceptor implementations.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when writing interceptors, ensuring they are robust and do not introduce new attack vectors.
    *   Ensure interceptors are correctly applied to all relevant gRPC methods and are not easily bypassed.
    *   Use well-tested and established interceptor patterns and libraries where possible.
    *   Consider the security implications of each interceptor's functionality and potential for misuse.
