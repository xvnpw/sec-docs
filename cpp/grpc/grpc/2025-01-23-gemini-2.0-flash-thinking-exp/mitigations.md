# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for grpc/grpc

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Rate Limiting (gRPC Interceptor based)](./mitigation_strategies/request_rate_limiting__grpc_interceptor_based_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical gRPC Services/Methods:** Determine which gRPC services or methods are most vulnerable to DoS attacks.
    2.  **Define gRPC Rate Limits:** Establish appropriate request rate limits specifically for these gRPC services/methods.
    3.  **Implement gRPC Interceptor:** Develop a server-side gRPC interceptor. This interceptor will:
        *   Track request counts per client (e.g., based on IP address or authenticated identity) within a defined time window.
        *   For each incoming gRPC request, increment the counter for the client.
        *   Check if the counter exceeds the defined rate limit.
        *   If the limit is exceeded, reject the gRPC request by returning a `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` or `UNAVAILABLE` gRPC error status code.
    4.  **Register Interceptor:** Register this rate limiting interceptor with your gRPC server during server initialization.
    5.  **Monitoring:** Monitor the effectiveness of the rate limiting interceptor by tracking rejected request counts and server resource utilization.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting gRPC services (Severity: High)
        *   Resource Exhaustion on gRPC servers (CPU, Memory) (Severity: High)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS attacks: High reduction in risk for gRPC services.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: High reduction in risk for gRPC server resources.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented using API Gateway rate limiting for external gRPC access. No gRPC interceptor based rate limiting within the gRPC services themselves.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Missing gRPC interceptor implementation within gRPC services for internal rate limiting and finer control at the gRPC method level.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Message Size Limits (gRPC Channel Options)](./mitigation_strategies/message_size_limits__grpc_channel_options_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze gRPC Message Sizes:** Analyze typical message sizes exchanged by your gRPC services.
    2.  **Define gRPC Message Size Limits:** Determine appropriate maximum message sizes for both requests and responses for your gRPC application.
    3.  **Configure gRPC Channel Options:** Set the following gRPC channel options during gRPC channel and server creation:
        *   `grpc.max_send_message_length`:  Set the maximum size of messages that can be *sent* via gRPC.
        *   `grpc.max_receive_message_length`: Set the maximum size of messages that can be *received* via gRPC.
    4.  **Apply Consistently:** Ensure these gRPC channel options are consistently configured on both gRPC clients and servers.
    5.  **gRPC Error Handling:** Implement error handling to gracefully manage `INVALID_ARGUMENT` or `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` gRPC errors that may occur when message size limits are exceeded.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks via oversized gRPC messages (Severity: High)
        *   Resource Exhaustion (Memory, Bandwidth) on gRPC servers due to large messages (Severity: High)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS attacks via large payloads: High reduction in risk for gRPC services.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: High reduction in risk for gRPC server resources.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented globally by setting `grpc.max_send_message_length` and `grpc.max_receive_message_length` channel options during gRPC server and client initialization.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation. gRPC message size limits are consistently applied using gRPC channel options.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Request Timeouts (gRPC Deadlines and Context Cancellation)](./mitigation_strategies/request_timeouts__grpc_deadlines_and_context_cancellation_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define gRPC Timeouts (Deadlines):** For each gRPC method, determine appropriate timeout values (deadlines) based on expected processing time.
    2.  **Configure gRPC Client Deadlines:** On the gRPC client side, configure deadlines when initiating gRPC requests. This can be done using gRPC client libraries' deadline or timeout mechanisms.
    3.  **Utilize gRPC Context Cancellation:** In gRPC service implementations, leverage gRPC's context cancellation mechanism. When a client-side deadline is reached, the gRPC framework will automatically cancel the request context on the server.
    4.  **Resource Cleanup in gRPC Services:** Within gRPC service methods, implement logic to check for context cancellation (`context.Context.Done()`) and gracefully terminate operations and release resources when a timeout occurs.
    5.  **gRPC Monitoring and Logging:** Log gRPC timeout events on both client and server sides to monitor performance and identify potential issues.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Resource Holding DoS attacks targeting gRPC services (Severity: Medium)
        *   Resource Exhaustion on gRPC servers due to long-running gRPC requests (Severity: Medium)
        *   Cascading Failures in gRPC based systems (Severity: Medium)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Resource Holding DoS attacks: Medium reduction in risk for gRPC services.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium reduction in risk for gRPC server resources.
        *   Cascading Failures: Medium reduction in risk in gRPC systems.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Client-side gRPC deadlines are generally configured. Server-side gRPC context cancellation is used in service implementations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent review and definition of appropriate gRPC deadlines for all methods. Some gRPC methods might lack specific deadline configurations or have overly long timeouts.
