## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS/Resource Exhaustion) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dosresource_exhaustion___high-risk_.md)

*   **Overall Goal:** Render the application unavailable to legitimate users by overwhelming server resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Resource Exhaustion (Server-Side) [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_resource_exhaustion__server-side___high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker rapidly creates and tears down gRPC streams without sending significant data, consuming server resources and potentially leading to denial of service.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   *1.2.1.1 Rapid stream creation/teardown without data transfer:*  The core of the attack.
    *   *1.2.1.2 Exploiting server-side stream limits (if poorly configured):*  If limits are too high or not enforced, the attack is more effective.
*   **Mitigations:**  Strict stream limits, connection quotas, monitoring of stream creation rates.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Large Message Payloads [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_large_message_payloads__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker sends very large gRPC messages, exceeding configured limits or exploiting inefficient deserialization, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   *1.2.2.1 Sending messages exceeding configured limits:*  Directly violates size restrictions.
    *   *1.2.2.2 Exploiting inefficient deserialization (protobuf):*  Targets weaknesses in how the server processes large or complex protobuf messages.
*   **Mitigations:**  Strict message size limits, optimized protobuf schema and deserialization, streaming for large data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3 Connection Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_connection_exhaustion__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker opens a large number of gRPC connections to the server without closing them, exhausting available connection slots.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**
    *   *1.2.3.1 Opening many connections without closing them:* The core of the attack.
*   **Mitigations:** Connection limits per client IP, connection pooling on the client-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.4 CPU/Memory Exhaustion via Complex Protobuf Processing](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_4_cpumemory_exhaustion_via_complex_protobuf_processing.md)

* **Description:** Attacker crafts specific protobuf messages designed to consume excessive CPU or memory during processing.
* **Sub-Vectors:**
    * *1.2.4.1 Crafting deeply nested protobuf messages:* Exploits the recursive nature of protobuf deserialization.
    * *1.2.4.2 Exploiting protobuf "oneof" fields with large alternatives:* Forces the server to allocate memory for potentially large, unused data.
* **Mitigations:** Avoid deeply nested structures, careful "oneof" design, performance profiling, and optimized protobuf libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Unauthorized Access / Data Exfiltration [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__unauthorized_access__data_exfiltration__high-risk_.md)

*   **Overall Goal:** Gain access to sensitive data or functionality without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Bypassing Authentication/Authorization [HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_bypassing_authenticationauthorization__high-risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.

*   **2.1.1 Exploiting flaws in custom authentication implementations [HIGH-RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in custom-built authentication logic allow attackers to bypass security checks.
    *   **Sub-Vectors (all [CRITICAL]):**
        *   *2.1.1.1 Incorrect handling of gRPC metadata (credentials):*  Improperly validated or exposed credentials.
        *   *2.1.1.2 Weaknesses in token validation (JWT, etc.):*  Flaws in how tokens are generated, signed, or verified.
        *   *2.1.1.3 Improperly configured interceptors:*  Interceptors that fail to enforce security policies correctly.
    *   **Mitigations:**  Use standard authentication libraries (OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect), thorough credential validation, secure metadata handling, robust interceptor configuration, regular security audits.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Code Injection / Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__code_injection__remote_code_execution__rce___critical_.md)

*   **Overall Goal:** Execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Vulnerabilities in Protobuf Deserialization [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_vulnerabilities_in_protobuf_deserialization__critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in the protobuf library to achieve code execution during message deserialization.

    *   *3.1.1 Exploiting known vulnerabilities in specific protobuf library versions:*  Using publicly known exploits against outdated libraries.
    *   *3.1.2 Fuzzing the deserialization process to find new vulnerabilities:*  Attempting to discover new zero-day vulnerabilities through fuzz testing.
*   **Mitigations:**  Keep protobuf libraries up-to-date, fuzz testing, use memory-safe languages.

*   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities within the gRPC framework itself to achieve code execution.
*   **Sub-Vectors (all [CRITICAL]):**
    *   *3.2.1 Exploiting known CVEs in the specific gRPC version used:*  Using publicly known exploits against outdated gRPC versions.

*   **Sub-Vectors (all [CRITICAL]):**
    *   *3.3.1 Injecting malicious code that is executed during request processing:*  The core of the attack; injecting code through manipulated input.
