# Threat Model Analysis for grpc/grpc

## Threat: [Fake Client/Server using Stolen or Forged Certificates](./threats/fake_clientserver_using_stolen_or_forged_certificates.md)

*   **Threat:** Fake Client/Server using Stolen or Forged Certificates

    *   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid certificate (e.g., through theft, social engineering, or compromising a CA) or forges a certificate that appears valid. They then use this certificate to impersonate a legitimate client or server, initiating or intercepting gRPC communication. This directly exploits gRPC's reliance on TLS for authentication.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Fake Server:**  The attacker can return malicious data to the client, potentially leading to data corruption, execution of malicious code, or further compromise of the client system.
        *   **Fake Client:** The attacker can send malicious requests to the server, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities, gaining unauthorized access to data, or causing denial of service.
    *   **gRPC Component Affected:**
        *   `grpc::SslCredentials` (and related classes for certificate handling)
        *   `grpc::ServerCredentials`
        *   `grpc::ChannelCredentials`
        *   The underlying TLS implementation *as used by gRPC*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Certificate Pinning:** Implement certificate pinning on both the client and server.  This involves hardcoding the expected certificate fingerprint or public key within the gRPC client and server code, making it much harder for an attacker to use a forged or stolen certificate. *Note:* Pinning can make certificate rotation more complex.
        *   **Short-Lived Certificates:** Use short-lived certificates (e.g., through a system like SPIFFE/SPIRE) to reduce the window of opportunity for an attacker to use a stolen certificate. This integrates directly with gRPC's credential system.
        *   **Certificate Revocation:** Implement robust certificate revocation mechanisms (e.g., OCSP stapling, CRLs) to ensure that compromised certificates are quickly invalidated.  Ensure gRPC clients and servers are configured to check revocation status.
        *   **Secure Certificate Storage:** Store private keys securely (e.g., using hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure enclaves), accessible only to the gRPC process.
        *   **Monitor Certificate Issuance:** Monitor certificate issuance logs (e.g., Certificate Transparency logs) to detect unauthorized certificate issuance.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) with Protocol Downgrade](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__with_protocol_downgrade.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) with Protocol Downgrade

    *   **Description:** An attacker positions themselves between the client and server and forces a downgrade from HTTP/2 to HTTP/1.1, or from TLS 1.3 to an older, vulnerable TLS version.  While this leverages the underlying transport, gRPC's configuration and reliance on HTTP/2 make it a direct target.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can eavesdrop on the communication, potentially stealing sensitive data. They can also modify requests and responses, leading to data corruption, unauthorized access, or other malicious actions.
    *   **gRPC Component Affected:**
        *   `grpc::Channel` (specifically, the connection establishment process and how it enforces HTTP/2)
        *   `grpc::SslCredentials` (how it enforces TLS versions)
        *   The underlying HTTP/2 and TLS implementations *as configured and used by gRPC*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict HTTP/2 Enforcement:** Configure both the gRPC client and server (using gRPC API calls) to *require* HTTP/2 and refuse connections using HTTP/1.1.
        *   **TLS 1.3 (or Latest) Only:** Configure both the gRPC client and server (using `grpc::SslCredentialsOptions`) to *require* TLS 1.3 (or the latest secure version) and disable support for older, insecure TLS versions and cipher suites.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep gRPC itself up to date to patch any vulnerabilities related to protocol negotiation *within gRPC's handling*.

## Threat: [Missing or Incorrect Authorization (within gRPC Interceptors)](./threats/missing_or_incorrect_authorization__within_grpc_interceptors_.md)

*   **Threat:** Missing or Incorrect Authorization (within gRPC Interceptors)

    *   **Description:** An attacker accesses gRPC methods or data without proper authorization, specifically because authorization checks within gRPC interceptors are missing, bypassed, or implemented incorrectly. This is a direct vulnerability within gRPC's authorization mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality exposed by gRPC services.
    *   **gRPC Component Affected:**
        *   `grpc::ServerInterceptor` (the primary mechanism for implementing authorization in gRPC)
        *   Application-specific code *within* the interceptor that handles authorization logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory Authorization Interceptor:** Implement a gRPC `ServerInterceptor` that performs authorization checks for *every* incoming request *before* the request reaches the service handler.  This interceptor must be correctly configured and cannot be bypassed.
        *   **RBAC/ABAC within Interceptor:** Use a role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) system *within the interceptor* to manage permissions and enforce them consistently.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users and services only the minimum permissions required, enforced by the interceptor's logic.
        *   **Fail Closed:** The interceptor should deny access by default if authorization checks fail or are inconclusive.
        * **Context Propagation:** Ensure that authentication information (e.g., user identity, roles) is correctly propagated to the interceptor via the `grpc::ServerContext`.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via Large Messages (gRPC Message Size Limits)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos__via_large_messages__grpc_message_size_limits_.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via Large Messages (gRPC Message Size Limits)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends very large gRPC messages to consume excessive server resources (memory, CPU), leading to a denial of service. This directly targets gRPC's message handling.
    *   **Impact:** The gRPC server becomes unresponsive, denying service to legitimate clients.
    *   **gRPC Component Affected:**
        *   `grpc::ServerBuilder::SetMaxMessageSize` (and related methods for configuring message size limits *within gRPC*)
        *   `grpc::ClientContext::set_max_receive_message_length`
        *   The Protocol Buffer parsing and serialization process *within gRPC*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Set Maximum Message Size (Server):** Use `grpc::ServerBuilder::SetMaxMessageSize` to limit the maximum size of gRPC messages that the server will accept. Choose a reasonable limit based on your application's requirements and resource constraints. This is a *direct* gRPC configuration.
        *   **Set Maximum Message Size (Client):** Use `grpc::ClientContext::set_max_receive_message_length` on client to limit size of messages that client will accept.
        * **Streaming:** For large data transfers, use gRPC streaming instead of sending a single large message. Streaming allows data to be processed in chunks, reducing memory consumption, and is a core gRPC feature.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via High Request Rate (gRPC-Specific Rate Limiting)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos__via_high_request_rate__grpc-specific_rate_limiting_.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (DoS) via High Request Rate (gRPC-Specific Rate Limiting)

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of gRPC requests in a short period, overwhelming the gRPC server's capacity. While general rate limiting applies, this focuses on gRPC-specific mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** The gRPC server becomes unresponsive, denying service to legitimate clients.
    *   **gRPC Component Affected:**
        *   `grpc::Server` (overall request handling)
        *   `grpc::ServerInterceptor` (potential location for gRPC-specific rate limiting logic)
        *   The underlying thread pool and connection management *within gRPC*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **gRPC Interceptor for Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting using a gRPC `ServerInterceptor`. This allows you to apply rate limiting logic specifically to gRPC requests, potentially using gRPC metadata or other context information. This is a *direct* use of gRPC's features for mitigation.
        *   **gRPC-Aware Load Balancer:** Use a load balancer that understands gRPC and can perform rate limiting based on gRPC-specific criteria (e.g., method, client ID from metadata).
