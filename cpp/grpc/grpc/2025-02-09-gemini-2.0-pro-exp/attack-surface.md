# Attack Surface Analysis for grpc/grpc

## Attack Surface: [HTTP/2 Protocol Exploits](./attack_surfaces/http2_protocol_exploits.md)

*Description:* Attacks targeting vulnerabilities in the HTTP/2 protocol, which gRPC uses as its transport layer.
*gRPC Contribution:* gRPC's inherent reliance on HTTP/2 exposes it to any flaws in the HTTP/2 implementation. This is a *direct* dependency.
*Example:* An attacker sends malformed HTTP/2 frames (e.g., a HEADERS frame with an invalid priority) to trigger a vulnerability in the server's HTTP/2 parsing library, leading to a denial-of-service or potentially remote code execution.
*Impact:* Denial of service, resource exhaustion, potential for remote code execution (RCE) in severe cases (depending on the specific HTTP/2 vulnerability).
*Risk Severity:* High to Critical (depending on the specific HTTP/2 vulnerability).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use the latest stable versions of gRPC and its underlying HTTP/2 library.  Prioritize immediate updates when security patches are released.
        *   Configure HTTP/2 server settings (exposed through gRPC APIs) to limit header sizes, concurrent streams, and other parameters that could be abused.  Use the most restrictive settings that are compatible with your application's needs.
        *   Implement robust error handling for HTTP/2-related errors. Avoid revealing internal server details.
    *   **Users/Operators:**
        *   Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) with specific HTTP/2 attack detection and mitigation capabilities.
        *   Implement network-level rate limiting to prevent HTTP/2 request floods.
        *   Actively monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, network) for anomalies indicative of HTTP/2 attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass (gRPC-Specific Mechanisms)](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass__grpc-specific_mechanisms_.md)

*Description:* Attacks that bypass or circumvent authentication and authorization mechanisms *specifically implemented within the gRPC framework*.
*gRPC Contribution:* gRPC provides mechanisms like interceptors, TLS integration, and metadata handling, which, if misconfigured or misused, can lead to authentication/authorization bypasses. This is a *direct* consequence of using gRPC's features.
*Example:* A gRPC service uses a custom interceptor for authentication, but the interceptor has a logic flaw that allows requests with a specific, attacker-controlled metadata value to bypass authentication.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access to data and functionality, potential for data breaches, privilege escalation.
*Risk Severity:* Critical.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use well-established and vetted authentication mechanisms *within the gRPC context* (e.g., TLS client certificates with proper verification, OAuth 2.0/JWT integrated with gRPC interceptors).
        *   Implement fine-grained authorization checks *within each gRPC method* using gRPC's context and interceptor capabilities.  Do not rely solely on authentication.
        *   Thoroughly review and test any custom gRPC interceptors for security vulnerabilities, especially those related to authentication and authorization.  Apply rigorous code reviews and security testing.
        *   Avoid sending sensitive information in gRPC metadata. Use the appropriate, secure gRPC mechanisms for credential and token exchange.
        *   Validate *all* inputs, including metadata, within gRPC service methods to prevent injection attacks that might bypass security checks.
    *   **Users/Operators:**
        *   Ensure that TLS is *always* enabled for gRPC communication, and that server certificates are properly validated.
        *   Monitor application logs for authentication and authorization failures, specifically looking for patterns related to gRPC requests.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion via gRPC Features](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_via_grpc_features.md)

*Description:* Attacks that leverage gRPC specific features to cause denial of service.
*gRPC Contribution:* gRPC's features, like stream multiplexing, metadata, and message handling, can be abused to consume resources if not properly limited.
*Example:* An attacker opens a large number of gRPC streams and sends continuous streams of small requests with large metadata, exhausting server file descriptors and memory.
*Impact:* Denial of service.
*Risk Severity:* High.
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    * **Developers:**
        * Implement connection limits and connection pooling to prevent attackers from opening too many connections.
        * Set appropriate deadlines and timeouts for gRPC calls to prevent long-running requests from consuming resources indefinitely.
        * Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests a client can make within a given time period. This can be done at the application level or using a dedicated rate-limiting service.
        * Limit the size and number of metadata entries allowed.
    * **Users/Operators:**
        * Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, network connections, file descriptors) to detect potential DoS attacks.
        * Configure network-level rate limiting and connection limits.
        * Use a load balancer to distribute traffic across multiple server instances.
