# Threat Model Analysis for grpc/grpc

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Protobuf Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_protobuf_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a crafted protobuf message containing malicious data or unexpected structures. If the server uses gRPC's built-in protobuf handling to deserialize this data without proper validation, it could lead to vulnerabilities like remote code execution or denial of service. This directly involves gRPC's reliance on protobuf for message serialization and deserialization.

**Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the server, data corruption, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** gRPC's protobuf message handling and deserialization mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always validate incoming protobuf messages against the defined schema *before* processing them within your gRPC service logic.
* Sanitize or reject messages that deviate from the expected structure or contain unexpected fields.
* Consider using secure deserialization practices specific to your programming language's protobuf implementation within the gRPC context.

## Threat: [Insecure Method Exposure](./threats/insecure_method_exposure.md)

**Description:** Developers define gRPC service methods in their `.proto` files that unintentionally expose internal or administrative functionalities. Attackers can then call these methods through the gRPC interface, gaining unauthorized access. This is a direct consequence of how gRPC services are defined and exposed.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, potential for data manipulation or system compromise.

**Affected Component:** gRPC service definition (`.proto` files) and the gRPC framework's method invocation mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review and restrict the methods exposed in your `.proto` files.
* Implement robust authorization checks *within* your gRPC service method implementations.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing your gRPC service API.

## Threat: [Bypass of Authentication/Authorization in Interceptors or Service Methods](./threats/bypass_of_authenticationauthorization_in_interceptors_or_service_methods.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the implementation of authentication or authorization logic within gRPC interceptors (a core gRPC feature) or directly within service methods can allow unauthorized access. Attackers might exploit weaknesses in how gRPC's authentication mechanisms are used or implemented.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, potential for data breaches or system compromise.

**Affected Component:** gRPC interceptor implementation and gRPC service method implementations, specifically the usage of gRPC's authentication context.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong and well-tested authentication and authorization mechanisms *using gRPC's built-in features or recommended patterns*.
* Use established security protocols like TLS for transport security and consider using authentication methods like mutual TLS or API keys *integrated with gRPC*.
* Ensure authorization checks are consistently applied to all relevant methods and are not easily bypassed *within the gRPC request processing pipeline*.
* Regularly review and audit authentication and authorization code related to your gRPC services.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through gRPC Streaming](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_grpc_streaming.md)

**Description:** Malicious clients can exploit gRPC's streaming capabilities by initiating long-lived or high-volume streams to overwhelm server resources. This directly leverages gRPC's streaming functionality.

**Impact:** Server becomes unresponsive or experiences performance degradation, leading to denial of service for other clients.

**Affected Component:** gRPC's streaming implementation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the number of concurrent streams per client *within your gRPC server configuration or logic*.
* Set timeouts for stream duration *within your gRPC service implementation*.
* Implement backpressure mechanisms *within your gRPC streaming handlers* to prevent the server from being overwhelmed by incoming data.
* Monitor resource usage for streaming connections.
