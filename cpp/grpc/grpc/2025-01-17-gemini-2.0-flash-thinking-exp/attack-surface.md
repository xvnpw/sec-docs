# Attack Surface Analysis for grpc/grpc

## Attack Surface: [Protocol Buffers (protobuf) Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/protocol_buffers__protobuf__deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

*   **Description:** Deserializing untrusted protobuf messages can lead to various vulnerabilities if the message contains malicious or unexpected data. This can include code injection, denial of service (through resource exhaustion), or logic errors.
    *   **How gRPC Contributes:** gRPC uses protobuf as its default serialization mechanism. If the application doesn't properly validate incoming protobuf messages, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A malicious client sends a gRPC request with a protobuf message containing deeply nested structures that consume excessive memory during deserialization, crashing the server.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (if vulnerabilities in the deserialization process exist), Logic Errors, Data Corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate all incoming protobuf messages before deserialization to ensure they conform to the expected schema and constraints.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Enforce strict schema validation on the server-side to reject messages that don't adhere to the defined protobuf structure.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement limits on the size and complexity of deserialized messages to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep gRPC and protobuf libraries updated to benefit from security patches.
        *   **Consider Alternatives:** If security is paramount and the data structure is simple, consider alternative serialization formats with fewer known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [gRPC Interceptor Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/grpc_interceptor_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** gRPC interceptors allow developers to add custom logic to the request/response pipeline. Vulnerabilities can arise from poorly implemented interceptors that introduce new security flaws or bypass existing security measures.
    *   **How gRPC Contributes:** gRPC's interceptor mechanism, while powerful, provides an entry point for custom code that might not be as rigorously vetted as the core gRPC framework.
    *   **Example:** An interceptor intended for logging might inadvertently expose sensitive data from the request or response. Another interceptor might have a flaw that allows bypassing authentication checks.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass, potentially leading to broader system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Develop interceptors with security in mind, following secure coding guidelines.
        *   **Thorough Testing:**  Rigorous testing of interceptors, including security testing, is crucial.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews of all custom interceptor logic.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure interceptors only have the necessary permissions to perform their intended function.
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Operations:**  Minimize the amount of sensitive data handled within interceptors if possible.

## Attack Surface: [gRPC Metadata Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/grpc_metadata_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** gRPC allows sending metadata with requests and responses. If not handled carefully, this metadata can be manipulated by attackers to bypass security checks or inject malicious data.
    *   **How gRPC Contributes:** gRPC's metadata feature provides a mechanism for transmitting additional information, which can be a target for manipulation if not properly secured.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies metadata intended for authentication to impersonate another user or bypass authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass, Information Disclosure (if metadata contains sensitive information).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Treat Metadata as Untrusted:**  Always validate and sanitize metadata received from clients.
        *   **Secure Metadata Transmission:** Ensure metadata is transmitted over a secure channel (TLS).
        *   **Cryptographic Signing/Verification:**  Sign or encrypt sensitive metadata to prevent tampering.
        *   **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data in Metadata:**  Minimize the storage of sensitive information in metadata.
