## Attack Tree Path: [2. Request Smuggling -> Exploit Header Manipulation for Request Forgery (HIGH RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/2__request_smuggling_-_exploit_header_manipulation_for_request_forgery__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the HTTP/2 protocol implementation to manipulate header fields. This allows the attacker to inject malicious requests that are interpreted by the server as legitimate, potentially bypassing security checks or accessing unauthorized resources.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized Access, Data Modification)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Manipulate gRPC Metadata -> Inject Malicious Metadata for Server-Side Processing (HIGH RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/3__manipulate_grpc_metadata_-_inject_malicious_metadata_for_server-side_processing__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** gRPC uses metadata to pass additional information with requests. Attackers can inject malicious metadata to influence server-side logic, potentially leading to information disclosure or unexpected behavior.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium (Logic Errors, Information Disclosure)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner

*   **Attack Vector:** If the application relies on metadata for authentication or authorization, attackers can spoof metadata to impersonate legitimate users or elevate their privileges, gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If Authentication relies heavily on metadata)
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized Access)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate

*   This involves exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities present in the core gRPC library.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in the gRPC Core Library -> Leverage Publicly Disclosed CVEs (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/8__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_the_grpc_core_library_-_leverage_publicly_disclosed_cves__critic_77cb68dd.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers can leverage publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in the gRPC library. If the application uses a vulnerable version of gRPC, attackers can exploit these known weaknesses.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on patch status)
*   **Impact:** Critical (Can range from DoS to RCE)
*   **Effort:** Low (If exploits are readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner (To use existing exploits) to Expert (To develop new ones)

*   This represents a set of vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations in the gRPC setup.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Insecure Configuration of gRPC -> Disable or Weaken Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms -> Access Sensitive Endpoints Without Proper Credentials (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/10__insecure_configuration_of_grpc_-_disable_or_weaken_authenticationauthorization_mechanisms_-_acce_6182a338.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If authentication or authorization mechanisms are disabled or weakly configured, attackers can bypass these controls and access sensitive endpoints without providing proper credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If developers make mistakes)
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized Access)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If proper logging is in place)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using weak or outdated TLS configurations, or not enforcing TLS at all, allows attackers to perform man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks, intercepting and potentially modifying communication between the client and server.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If default or weak configurations are used)
*   **Impact:** High (Data Breach, Credential Theft)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Without proper network monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Insecure Configuration of gRPC -> Expose Debug or Administrative Endpoints Without Protection (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/12__insecure_configuration_of_grpc_-_expose_debug_or_administrative_endpoints_without_protection__cr_d2124b63.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Accidentally exposing debug or administrative endpoints without proper authentication and authorization allows attackers to gain access to sensitive information or control functionality, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Should be avoided in production)
*   **Impact:** Critical (Full Compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If endpoints are known)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Similar to gRPC library vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying Protocol Buffer libraries. Insecure deserialization can lead to remote code execution or information disclosure.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on patch status)
*   **Impact:** Critical (Code Execution, Data Breach)
