# Attack Surface Analysis for grpc/grpc

## Attack Surface: [HTTP/2 Protocol Exploits](./attack_surfaces/http2_protocol_exploits.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the underlying HTTP/2 protocol implementation can be exploited to cause denial-of-service, information disclosure, or other issues.
    *   **How gRPC Contributes:** gRPC mandates the use of HTTP/2 as its transport layer. This inherently exposes the application to any vulnerabilities present in the HTTP/2 implementation used by the gRPC library or the operating system.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted sequence of HTTP/2 frames that triggers a known vulnerability in the server's HTTP/2 library, causing the server to crash or become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for remote code execution if the vulnerability is severe enough.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep gRPC libraries and underlying HTTP/2 implementations (e.g., within the operating system or networking libraries) updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust connection management and resource limits to mitigate resource exhaustion attacks related to HTTP/2 stream management.
        *   Consider using a reverse proxy or load balancer with strong HTTP/2 security features to act as a first line of defense.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Authentication and Authorization](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_authentication_and_authorization.md)

*   **Description:** gRPC endpoints exposed without proper authentication or authorization controls are vulnerable to unauthorized access and manipulation.
    *   **How gRPC Contributes:** gRPC provides mechanisms for authentication (e.g., using interceptors and credentials), but it's the developer's responsibility to implement and enforce them. Failure to do so leaves services open.
    *   **Example:** An attacker directly calls a gRPC method that should only be accessible to authenticated administrators, gaining access to sensitive data or administrative functionalities.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of data, compromise of system integrity.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for gRPC services, such as mutual TLS (mTLS), API keys, or token-based authentication (e.g., JWT).
        *   Enforce granular authorization checks within gRPC service implementations to ensure users only have access to the resources and actions they are permitted to use.
        *   Utilize gRPC interceptors to implement authentication and authorization logic consistently across all services.

## Attack Surface: [Metadata Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/metadata_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** gRPC uses metadata to pass contextual information between clients and servers. Manipulating this metadata can lead to security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How gRPC Contributes:** gRPC's design relies on metadata for various purposes, including authentication hints, tracing information, and custom context. If not properly validated, malicious metadata can be injected.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the authentication metadata in a gRPC request to impersonate another user or bypass authentication checks.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, potential for injection attacks if metadata is used in logging or other processing without sanitization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any metadata received from clients before using it.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-provided metadata for critical security decisions.
        *   Use secure mechanisms for transmitting sensitive metadata, such as TLS encryption.

## Attack Surface: [Interceptor Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/interceptor_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Custom gRPC interceptors, used for cross-cutting concerns like logging, authentication, or authorization, can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented securely.
    *   **How gRPC Contributes:** gRPC's interceptor mechanism allows developers to add custom logic to the request/response pipeline. Flaws in this custom logic can create security holes.
    *   **Example:** A poorly written authentication interceptor might have a bypass vulnerability, allowing unauthenticated requests to proceed.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, authorization bypass, potential for other vulnerabilities depending on the interceptor's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing gRPC interceptors.
        *   Thoroughly test interceptors for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Ensure interceptors correctly handle errors and exceptions to prevent unexpected behavior.
        *   Regularly review and audit the code of custom interceptors.
