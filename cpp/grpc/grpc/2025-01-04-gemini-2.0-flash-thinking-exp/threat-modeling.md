# Threat Model Analysis for grpc/grpc

## Threat: [HTTP/2 Request Smuggling](./threats/http2_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits discrepancies in how intermediary proxies and the gRPC server (specifically its HTTP/2 implementation) interpret HTTP/2 framing. They craft malicious requests that are interpreted differently by the proxy and the server, allowing them to "smuggle" requests to the backend server without the proxy's knowledge.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access to resources, data manipulation, potentially gaining control over the application's functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC Server's HTTP/2 Framing Implementation (within `grpc/grpc`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure the gRPC server library is running the latest version with known HTTP/2 smuggling vulnerabilities patched.
        *   Configure the gRPC server to have strict adherence to HTTP/2 specifications.

## Threat: [HTTP/2 Denial of Service (Stream Multiplexing Abuse)](./threats/http2_denial_of_service__stream_multiplexing_abuse_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker opens an excessive number of concurrent HTTP/2 streams to the gRPC server. The `grpc/grpc` library manages these streams, and an attacker can exploit this to overwhelm the server's resources.
    *   **Impact:**  Service disruption, unavailability of the gRPC application, potential resource exhaustion on the server.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC Server's HTTP/2 Connection Handling (within `grpc/grpc`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on the number of concurrent streams allowed per client connection (configurable within `grpc/grpc` or using middleware).
        *   Configure maximum concurrent streams on the gRPC server (settings within `grpc/grpc`).
        *   Implement connection timeouts and idle stream timeouts (configurable within `grpc/grpc`).

## Threat: [HTTP/2 Denial of Service (HPACK Bomb)](./threats/http2_denial_of_service__hpack_bomb_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a small number of HTTP/2 headers that are heavily compressed using HPACK (Header Compression). The `grpc/grpc` library's HPACK decoding implementation can be targeted to cause excessive memory and CPU usage during decompression.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, server resource exhaustion, potential crash of the gRPC application.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC Server's HPACK Decoding Implementation (within `grpc/grpc`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure limits on the maximum size of decompressed headers on the gRPC server (configuration within `grpc/grpc`).
        *   Update the `grpc/grpc` library to versions with known HPACK bomb mitigations.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Protobuf Data (Resource Exhaustion)](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_protobuf_data__resource_exhaustion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a maliciously crafted protobuf message containing excessively large or deeply nested structures to the gRPC server. The `grpc/grpc` library uses a protobuf deserialization library, and vulnerabilities here can lead to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, server resource exhaustion, potential crash of the gRPC application.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC Protobuf Deserialization Library (used by `grpc/grpc`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the maximum size of incoming gRPC messages (configurable within `grpc/grpc`).
        *   Define clear and restrictive protobuf schemas, avoiding overly complex or deeply nested structures.
        *   Consider using techniques like "safe deserialization" if available in your specific gRPC implementation.
        *   Implement timeouts for deserialization operations.

## Threat: [Protobuf Message Manipulation (Integrity Breach)](./threats/protobuf_message_manipulation__integrity_breach_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts a gRPC communication and modifies the serialized protobuf message before it reaches the server. If the application doesn't implement integrity checks beyond TLS, the attacker can alter data. While TLS is part of secure gRPC usage, the core vulnerability lies in the lack of application-level checks on the protobuf message itself.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized actions performed based on the modified message, potential security breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC Communication Channel, Protobuf Serialization/Deserialization (handled by libraries used with `grpc/grpc`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce the use of TLS for all gRPC communication.
        *   Implement message signing or Message Authentication Codes (MACs) to verify the integrity of the protobuf messages at the application layer.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass due to Weak Credentials](./threats/authentication_bypass_due_to_weak_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises weak or default credentials used for gRPC authentication mechanisms supported by `grpc/grpc` (e.g., using insecure metadata). They can then impersonate legitimate clients and access gRPC services.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to gRPC services and data, potential for data breaches or malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC Authentication Mechanism (e.g., interceptors, metadata handling within `grpc/grpc`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies and multi-factor authentication where applicable.
        *   Avoid using default credentials.
        *   Properly manage and securely store authentication credentials.
        *   Consider using more robust authentication mechanisms like mutual TLS (mTLS) or OAuth 2.0 which are often integrated with or supported by `grpc/grpc`.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Flawed Logic in Interceptors](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_flawed_logic_in_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in custom gRPC interceptors, a key feature of `grpc/grpc` for adding custom logic, including authorization. Flaws in these interceptors can lead to bypassing authorization checks.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to specific gRPC methods or data, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom gRPC Interceptors (feature of `grpc/grpc`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test all custom gRPC interceptors for security vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when implementing authorization logic within interceptors.
        *   Avoid making authorization decisions based solely on client-provided metadata without proper validation.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Streaming (Excessive Data)](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_streaming__excessive_data_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large amount of data through a gRPC stream, overwhelming the server's memory or processing capabilities. `grpc/grpc` handles the streaming infrastructure, making it a direct component involved in this threat.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, server resource exhaustion, potential crash of the gRPC application.
    *   **Affected Component:** gRPC Streaming Implementation (within `grpc/grpc`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the maximum size of data that can be sent or received on a single stream (configurable within `grpc/grpc`).
        *   Implement backpressure mechanisms to control the rate of data flow (features within `grpc/grpc`).
        *   Set timeouts for streaming operations (configurable within `grpc/grpc`).
