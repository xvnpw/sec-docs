## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application Using Rippled](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_using_rippled.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application Using Rippled:** The ultimate goal of the attacker. This can be achieved through various means by exploiting weaknesses in the `rippled` integration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Rippled API Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_rippled_api_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Rippled API Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**

    *   **Parameter Injection (e.g., manipulating transaction parameters) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers inject malicious code or unexpected values into API parameters. If the application doesn't properly sanitize input before sending it to `rippled`, this can lead to unintended consequences, such as unauthorized transactions or data manipulation.
    *   **Business Logic Exploitation (e.g., exploiting flaws in how the application uses specific API calls) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit flaws in the application's logic when interacting with the `rippled` API. This involves understanding the intended workflow and finding ways to manipulate it for malicious purposes.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Achieve Desired Outcome (e.g., unauthorized transaction, data manipulation within the application) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** This represents the successful exploitation of API vulnerabilities, leading to the attacker's desired outcome, such as unauthorized transactions, data breaches, or manipulation of the application's state.
