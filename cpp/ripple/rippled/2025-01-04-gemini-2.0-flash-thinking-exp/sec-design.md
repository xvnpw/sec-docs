**5. Detailed Component Description**

* **Network Layer:**
    * **Functionality:** Manages all low-level network communication, including establishing and maintaining TCP/IP connections with peers. It handles raw socket operations, connection management, and basic message framing.
    * **Responsibilities:**
        * Establishing outbound connections to known peers.
        * Accepting inbound connections from other peers.
        * Managing connection state (active, idle, disconnected).
        * Implementing basic network security measures (e.g., connection limits).
    * **Key Technologies:** Asio library for asynchronous network operations, TCP/IP sockets.
    * **Security Considerations:** Vulnerable to SYN flood attacks, connection exhaustion, and potentially exploitable bugs in the Asio library.

* **Consensus Engine:**
    * **Functionality:** Implements the core consensus protocol (likely a variant of Federated Byzantine Agreement) that allows the network to agree on the validity and ordering of transactions and the state of the ledger. This involves proposing, voting on, and validating ledger versions.
    * **Responsibilities:**
        * Participating in rounds of consensus voting.
        * Validating proposed ledger states based on protocol rules and cryptographic signatures.
        * Maintaining a view of the network's agreement progress.
        * Detecting and handling disagreements or Byzantine behavior.
    * **Key Technologies:** Custom implementation of the consensus algorithm, relying heavily on cryptographic primitives.
    * **Security Considerations:** Susceptible to attacks that aim to disrupt the consensus process, such as validator collusion, message manipulation, or timing attacks. The security of the cryptographic signatures used in voting is critical.

* **Transaction Engine:**
    * **Functionality:** Processes and validates incoming transactions before they are proposed for consensus. This includes syntax checks, signature verification, account balance checks, and protocol-specific validation rules.
    * **Responsibilities:**
