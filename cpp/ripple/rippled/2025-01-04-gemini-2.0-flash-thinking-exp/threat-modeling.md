# Threat Model Analysis for ripple/rippled

## Threat: [Unauthenticated/Unauthorized API Access](./threats/unauthenticatedunauthorized_api_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker could directly interact with the `rippled` API, bypassing the application's intended security measures. They might craft malicious API calls to submit unauthorized transactions, retrieve sensitive ledger data, or even attempt administrative actions if those endpoints are exposed.

**Impact:** Financial loss due to unauthorized transactions, exposure of sensitive user or ledger data, disruption of application functionality, potential compromise of the `rippled` node.

**Affected Component:** `rippled`'s JSON-RPC API endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) for all interactions with the `rippled` API.
* Enforce strict authorization checks to ensure users can only access the API endpoints and perform actions they are permitted to.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access.

## Threat: [API Rate Limiting Abuse / Denial of Service](./threats/api_rate_limiting_abuse__denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods the `rippled` API with a large number of requests, overwhelming the node and potentially causing it to become unresponsive. This can disrupt the application's ability to interact with the ledger.

**Impact:** Application downtime, inability to process transactions, degraded performance for legitimate users, potential resource exhaustion on the `rippled` node.

**Affected Component:** `rippled`'s JSON-RPC API request handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rate limiting on API calls to `rippled` to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
* Monitor API usage for suspicious patterns and implement blocking mechanisms for malicious IPs or users.
* Configure `rippled`'s internal rate limiting features if available and applicable.

## Threat: [Insecure `rippled` Configuration](./threats/insecure__rippled__configuration.md)

**Description:** The `rippled` node is not configured securely, such as using default passwords, having open administrative ports, or enabling unnecessary features. This can allow attackers to directly compromise the node.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the `rippled` node, potential access to sensitive data, ability to manipulate the node's behavior, and disruption of the application.

**Affected Component:** `rippled`'s configuration file (`rippled.cfg`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow security best practices for `rippled` configuration, including setting strong passwords for administrative interfaces.
* Restrict network access to the `rippled` node, allowing only necessary connections.
* Disable any unnecessary features or modules in the `rippled` configuration.
* Regularly review and update the `rippled` configuration.

## Threat: [Exposure of `rippled` Administrative Interfaces](./threats/exposure_of__rippled__administrative_interfaces.md)

**Description:** The `rippled` administrative API or command-line interface (e.g., via `remote_console`) is accessible without proper authentication or from untrusted networks.

**Impact:** Full control over the `rippled` node, allowing attackers to modify its configuration, shut it down, or potentially access sensitive data.

**Affected Component:** `rippled`'s administrative API and command-line interface.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure administrative interfaces are only accessible from trusted networks (e.g., internal networks).
* Implement strong authentication for administrative access.
* Consider disabling administrative interfaces entirely in production environments if not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `rippled`](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__rippled_.md)

**Description:** `rippled` relies on various libraries and dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the `rippled` node.

**Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Third-party libraries and dependencies used by `rippled`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep the `rippled` node updated to the latest stable version, which includes security patches for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* Regularly monitor security advisories for `rippled` and its dependencies.
* Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Information Leakage from `rippled`'s Local Storage](./threats/information_leakage_from__rippled_'s_local_storage.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system where the `rippled` node stores ledger data, configuration files, or logs, potentially exposing sensitive information.

**Impact:** Exposure of private keys, transaction history, configuration details, or other sensitive data.

**Affected Component:** `rippled`'s data directory, configuration files, and log files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strong file system permissions to restrict access to the `rippled` node's data directory and configuration files.
* Encrypt sensitive data at rest if possible.
* Avoid storing sensitive information in log files or implement secure logging practices.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known `rippled` Bugs](./threats/exploitation_of_known__rippled__bugs.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in specific versions of `rippled` to compromise the node or disrupt its functionality.

**Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, or data breaches.

**Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within `rippled` depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay informed about known vulnerabilities in `rippled` by monitoring security advisories and release notes.
* Promptly apply security updates and patches to the `rippled` node.
* Participate in the `rippled` security community and report any discovered issues.
