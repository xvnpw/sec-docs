# Attack Surface Analysis for ripple/rippled

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated RPC Interface Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_rpc_interface_access.md)

* **How `rippled` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rippled` exposes an RPC interface for administrative and operational control. If not properly secured, it allows direct interaction with the node.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the RPC port (e.g., port 5005) without providing valid credentials or using easily guessable credentials. They then send RPC commands to shut down the node or access sensitive information.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the `rippled` node, leading to service disruption, potential data manipulation, or access to sensitive ledger information.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enable and enforce strong authentication for the RPC interface using `admin_user` and `admin_password` in `rippled.cfg`.
        * Restrict access to the RPC interface by configuring `admin_ips` in `rippled.cfg` to only allow connections from trusted IP addresses.
        * Avoid exposing the RPC port directly to the public internet. Use a firewall or VPN.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated WebSocket Interface Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_websocket_interface_access.md)

* **How `rippled` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rippled` provides a WebSocket interface for real-time data streaming and interaction. Lack of proper authentication allows unauthorized access.
    * **Example:** An attacker connects to the WebSocket port (e.g., port 5006) without authentication and subscribes to streams containing sensitive transaction data or internal node metrics.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for targeted attacks based on observed data, or resource exhaustion through excessive subscriptions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Enable WebSocket authentication using `websocket_credentials` in `rippled.cfg`.
        * Restrict access to the WebSocket interface using firewall rules or by binding the interface to specific internal IP addresses.
        * Implement rate limiting on WebSocket connections to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Interface to Malicious Nodes](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_the_peer-to-peer__p2p__interface_to_malicious_nodes.md)

* **How `rippled` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rippled` relies on a P2P network for consensus and data propagation. Malicious peers can exploit vulnerabilities in the P2P protocol.
    * **Example:** A malicious node sends malformed P2P messages that exploit a parsing vulnerability in `rippled`, causing the node to crash or behave unpredictably.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, network instability, potential for consensus manipulation (though highly complex).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully curate the list of trusted peers using `unl_node` in `rippled.cfg`.
        * Monitor the node's connection status and identify potentially malicious peers.
        * Keep `rippled` updated to the latest version to patch known P2P protocol vulnerabilities.
        * Consider running the node in a private or permissioned network.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration File Handling](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_file_handling.md)

* **How `rippled` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rippled`'s configuration is stored in `rippled.cfg`, which can contain sensitive information like API keys, secrets, and database credentials.
    * **Example:** The `rippled.cfg` file has overly permissive file permissions (e.g., world-readable), allowing an attacker with access to the server to read sensitive configuration details.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to other systems or the `rippled` node itself.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure the `rippled.cfg` file has restrictive permissions (e.g., readable only by the `rippled` user).
        * Avoid storing highly sensitive information directly in `rippled.cfg` if possible. Consider using environment variables or a secrets management system.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Known Software Vulnerabilities in `rippled`](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_known_software_vulnerabilities_in__rippled_.md)

* **How `rippled` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Like any software, `rippled` may contain undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a specific version of `rippled` to achieve remote code execution on the server running the node.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, data breach, service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update `rippled` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Subscribe to security advisories from Ripple to stay informed about potential threats.
        * Implement a vulnerability management process to track and address known issues.
