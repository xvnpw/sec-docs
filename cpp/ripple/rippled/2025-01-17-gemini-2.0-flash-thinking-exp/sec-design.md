# Project Design Document: RippleD

**Version:** 1.1
**Date:** October 26, 2023
**Author:** AI Software Architect

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed architectural design of the `rippled` project, the core server software for the XRP Ledger. This document serves as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's components, interactions, and data flows. The focus is on aspects relevant to identifying potential security vulnerabilities and attack vectors.

## 2. Project Overview

The `rippled` software implements the core functionality of the XRP Ledger, a decentralized, open-source, permissionless cryptographic ledger. It facilitates the transfer of value across the network and maintains the shared, immutable record of all XRP transactions and ledger states. Key features include:

* **Decentralized Consensus:**  A federated Byzantine Agreement (FBA) based consensus protocol for validating transactions without a central authority.
* **Cryptographically Secured Ledger:**  Maintaining a tamper-proof, shared database across multiple independently operated nodes.
* **Atomic Transactions:** Ensuring that transactions either fully succeed or completely fail, maintaining data consistency.
* **Built-in Decentralized Exchange (DEX):**  Functionality for trading assets directly on the ledger.
* **Open API:** Providing well-defined interfaces for external applications to interact with the ledger.
* **Peer-to-Peer Network:**  A resilient network architecture where nodes communicate directly with each other.

## 3. Architectural Design

The `rippled` architecture is modular, with distinct components responsible for specific functionalities. Understanding these components and their interactions is crucial for identifying potential threat surfaces.

### 3.1. Core Components

### 3.3. Data Flow

A detailed understanding of how data flows through the `rippled` system is essential for identifying potential interception or manipulation points.

* **Transaction Submission and Propagation:**
    1. A client application (Y) creates and signs a transaction using its private key.
    2. The signed transaction is submitted to a `rippled` server via the API (E), typically over a secure channel like WebSocket or HTTPS.
    3. The API (E) performs initial validation, including signature verification using the Cryptographic Modules (G).
    4. If valid, the Networking Layer (A) broadcasts the transaction to a subset of connected peers (X).
    5. Other `rippled` instances (X) receive the transaction and may further propagate it across the network.
* **Consensus and Ledger Validation:**
    1. Each participating `rippled` instance's Consensus Engine (B) evaluates the received transactions.
    2. Nodes exchange proposals and votes on which transactions should be included in the next ledger version.
    3. The consensus protocol ensures that a supermajority of validators agree on the set of transactions and their order.
    4. Once consensus is reached, a new validated ledger is formed, containing the agreed-upon transactions.
* **Ledger Application and Persistence:**
    1. The Transaction Processing Engine (C) applies the effects of the validated transactions to the current ledger state. This involves modifying account balances, trust lines, and other ledger objects.
    2. The updated ledger state is then written to the Ledger Store (D).
    3. The new validated ledger is digitally signed by the validating nodes, ensuring its integrity.
* **Ledger Synchronization:**
    1. The Networking Layer (A) facilitates the synchronization of the new validated ledger with other nodes (X) that may not have participated in the consensus round or are lagging behind.
    2. Nodes exchange ledger data to ensure all participants have an identical copy of the validated ledger.
* **Data Retrieval:**
    1. Client applications (Y) can query the `rippled` server via the API (E) to retrieve information about accounts, transactions, and ledger history.
    2. The API (E) interacts with the Ledger Store (D) to fetch the requested data.
