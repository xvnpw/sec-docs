# Threat Model Analysis for ripple/rippled

## Threat: [Malformed Transaction Submission](./threats/malformed_transaction_submission.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft and submit a malformed transaction to the `rippled` server. This could involve invalid fields, incorrect signatures, or exceeding size limits. The attacker might attempt this to crash the `rippled` node, cause unexpected behavior, or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in transaction processing logic.

**Impact:** Potential denial of service for the `rippled` node, disruption of network consensus if the malformed transaction is propagated, or exploitation of vulnerabilities leading to data corruption or unexpected state changes on the ledger.

**Affected `rippled` Component:** `TxProcessing` module, `Network` module (if propagated), potentially specific transaction type handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement strict input validation on the application side before submitting transactions to `rippled`.
*   Utilize `rippled`'s built-in transaction validation mechanisms and error responses to identify and reject malformed transactions.
*   Ensure the application handles `rippled`'s error responses gracefully and does not retry submission indefinitely without proper checks.

## Threat: [Exploiting `rippled` API Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting__rippled__api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could identify and exploit vulnerabilities in the `rippled` API endpoints. This could involve sending unexpected parameters, exploiting injection flaws (though less common in REST APIs), or leveraging logic errors in API handling to gain unauthorized information or manipulate the ledger.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to ledger data, potential manipulation of ledger state (if vulnerabilities exist in state-changing API calls), or denial of service if API calls can be used to overload the server.

**Affected `rippled` Component:** Specific API endpoints (e.g., `/ledger`, `/transaction_entry`), API request handling logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Stay updated with the latest `rippled` releases and security patches.
*   Thoroughly review the `rippled` API documentation and adhere to recommended usage patterns.
*   Implement input validation and sanitization on the application side before making API calls to `rippled`.
*   Monitor `rippled` logs for suspicious API requests.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on `rippled` Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on__rippled__communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker could intercept communication between the application and the `rippled` server if the connection is not properly secured. They could then eavesdrop on sensitive data (like account balances or transaction details) or even attempt to modify requests or responses.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential manipulation of transactions or API calls leading to financial loss or data corruption.

**Affected `rippled` Component:** `Network` module, specifically the communication layer between the application and `rippled`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Mandatory use of HTTPS/TLS for all communication with the `rippled` server.**
*   Verify the `rippled` server's SSL/TLS certificate to prevent connecting to a rogue server.
*   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for enhanced authentication between the application and `rippled`.

## Threat: [Exploiting `rippled` Configuration Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting__rippled__configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If the `rippled` server is misconfigured (e.g., open admin ports, weak access controls, insecure logging), an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the server, potentially leading to data breaches, manipulation of the ledger, or complete control over the `rippled` node.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the `rippled` server, leading to severe consequences including financial loss, data corruption, and reputational damage.

**Affected `rippled` Component:** `Configuration` module, `Admin` interface (if enabled), `Security` features.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Follow security best practices for configuring and deploying `rippled`.
*   Disable unnecessary features and ports.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for administrative access.
*   Regularly review and audit the `rippled` configuration.
