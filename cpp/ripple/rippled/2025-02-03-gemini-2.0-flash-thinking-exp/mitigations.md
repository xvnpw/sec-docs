# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ripple/rippled

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure `rippled` Connection Limits](./mitigation_strategies/configure__rippled__connection_limits.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Edit `rippled.cfg`:** Open the `rippled` configuration file (`rippled.cfg`).
2.  **Set `max_inbound_connections`:** Locate or add the `[server]` section and the `max_inbound_connections` parameter. Set this value to a reasonable limit based on your expected workload and server resources. This limits the number of incoming peer and client connections.
3.  **Set `max_outbound_connections`:** Locate or add the `max_outbound_connections` parameter in the `[server]` section. Set this value to limit the number of outbound connections `rippled` will attempt to establish to other peers.
4.  **Restart `rippled`:** Restart the `rippled` service for the configuration changes to take effect.
5.  **Monitor Connections:** Monitor `rippled`'s connection metrics (if available through monitoring tools or logs) to ensure the limits are effective and adjust as needed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks via Connection Flooding: Severity: High
    *   Resource Exhaustion on `rippled` Server: Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks via Connection Flooding: High - Reduces the effectiveness of connection flooding attacks by limiting the number of connections an attacker can establish.
    *   Resource Exhaustion on `rippled` Server: High - Prevents `rippled` from being overwhelmed by excessive connections, ensuring resource availability for legitimate operations.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - `rippled` connection limits are set to default values in `rippled.cfg`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Tuning `max_inbound_connections` and `max_outbound_connections` based on specific workload and server capacity.
    *   Active monitoring of `rippled` connection metrics to verify effectiveness and adjust limits dynamically.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply the Principle of Least Privilege (for `rippled` process)](./mitigation_strategies/apply_the_principle_of_least_privilege__for__rippled__process_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create Dedicated User and Group:** Create a dedicated system user (e.g., `rippled_user`) and group (e.g., `rippled_group`) specifically for running the `rippled` process.
2.  **Change `rippled` Process User:** Configure the service manager (e.g., systemd, init.d) or startup script used to launch `rippled` to run the process under the newly created `rippled_user`.
3.  **Restrict File System Permissions:** Set file system permissions on `rippled`'s data directory, configuration files (`rippled.cfg`), and executable files so that only `rippled_user` and `rippled_group` have the necessary read and write permissions. Remove unnecessary permissions for other users and groups.
4.  **Verify Effective User:** After restarting `rippled`, verify that the process is indeed running as the intended `rippled_user` using system tools like `ps` or `top`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Privilege Escalation from `rippled` Process: Severity: High
    *   System-Wide Damage in Case of `rippled` Compromise: Severity: High
    *   Data Breach due to Compromised `rippled` Process: Severity: High
