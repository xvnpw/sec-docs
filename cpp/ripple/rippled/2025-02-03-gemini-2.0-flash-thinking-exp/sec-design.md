# BUSINESS POSTURE

The rippled project aims to provide a robust, scalable, and secure server for the XRP Ledger, a decentralized cryptographic ledger. The primary business goal is to maintain and enhance the infrastructure that supports the XRP Ledger, enabling fast, low-cost, and reliable transactions of value.

Business Priorities:
- Reliability and Availability: Ensuring the XRP Ledger is consistently operational and accessible for transaction processing.
- Security and Integrity: Protecting the ledger from manipulation, unauthorized access, and ensuring the integrity of transaction data.
- Scalability and Performance:  Maintaining and improving the network's capacity to handle increasing transaction volumes and user growth.
- Compliance and Regulation: Adhering to relevant financial regulations and compliance standards in different jurisdictions where the XRP Ledger is used.
- Community and Ecosystem Growth: Fostering a healthy ecosystem around the XRP Ledger by providing a stable and feature-rich server implementation.

Business Risks:
- Security Breaches and Financial Loss: Vulnerabilities in rippled could lead to exploits, resulting in loss of funds or manipulation of the ledger, causing significant financial damage and reputational harm.
- Network Disruptions and Downtime:  Failures in rippled or the network infrastructure could lead to network outages, disrupting transaction processing and impacting users.
- Regulatory Scrutiny and Non-compliance:  Failure to comply with evolving financial regulations could result in legal penalties, fines, and restrictions on the use of the XRP Ledger.
- Performance Bottlenecks and Scalability Issues:  Inability to handle increasing transaction volumes could lead to network congestion, slow transaction processing, and user dissatisfaction.
- Forks and Consensus Failures:  Issues in the consensus mechanism or software bugs could lead to network forks or failures in reaching consensus, compromising the integrity of the ledger.
