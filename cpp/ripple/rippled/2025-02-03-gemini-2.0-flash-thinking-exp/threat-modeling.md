# Threat Model Analysis for ripple/rippled

## Threat: [Consensus Failure Exploitation](./threats/consensus_failure_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a bug in `rippled`'s consensus algorithm implementation. This could involve crafting specific transactions or network messages to cause nodes to disagree on the ledger state, leading to a fork or acceptance of invalid transactions.
*   **Impact:** Network fork, invalid ledger state, transaction reversals, financial discrepancies, loss of trust in the application and XRP Ledger.
*   **Affected Component:** `rippled` Consensus Module (specifically the consensus algorithm implementation).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `rippled` updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
    *   Monitor XRP Ledger network health and consensus status.
    *   Participate in XRP Ledger community security discussions.
    *   Implement robust error handling in the application to detect and react to potential consensus issues.

## Threat: [Sybil Attack for Network Influence](./threats/sybil_attack_for_network_influence.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker deploys a large number of malicious `rippled` nodes to the network. These nodes attempt to overwhelm legitimate nodes, gain disproportionate influence in the consensus process, or disrupt network operations by flooding or manipulating network traffic.
*   **Impact:** Network instability, potential manipulation of transaction validation, reduced reliability of application's connection, delayed transactions, potential censorship.
*   **Affected Component:** `rippled` P2P Networking Module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure `rippled` node with reasonable connection limits.
    *   Rely on XRP Ledger's inherent Sybil resistance mechanisms.
    *   Monitor node's peer connections for suspicious activity (large number of new connections from unknown sources).
    *   Connect to a diverse set of reputable and known validators/peers.

## Threat: [Node Isolation via Eclipse Attack](./threats/node_isolation_via_eclipse_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets a specific `rippled` node, surrounding it with attacker-controlled nodes. These malicious nodes feed the target node false or manipulated ledger information, effectively isolating it from the legitimate XRP Ledger network view.
*   **Impact:** Application operates on an outdated or manipulated ledger view, incorrect transaction processing, data inconsistencies, potential double-spending from the application's perspective.
*   **Affected Component:** `rippled` P2P Networking Module, Ledger Synchronization.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure `rippled` connects to a diverse and reputable set of peers.
    *   Monitor peer connectivity and network health regularly.
    *   Use trusted validators or well-known public `rippled` servers as initial peers.
    *   Implement checks to verify ledger consistency with multiple sources if critical operations are performed.

## Threat: [Network Level DoS Attack](./threats/network_level_dos_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the network connection to the `rippled` node with excessive traffic (e.g., SYN floods, UDP floods). This overwhelms the node's network resources, preventing it from processing legitimate requests and participating in the XRP Ledger network.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, inability to interact with XRP Ledger, service disruption, potential financial losses due to downtime.
*   **Affected Component:** `rippled` Network Listener, Operating System Network Stack.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement network firewalls and intrusion detection/prevention systems.
    *   Configure rate limiting on `rippled` API endpoints and network connections.
    *   Utilize DDoS mitigation services, especially if the application is publicly exposed.
    *   Ensure sufficient network bandwidth and server resources for the `rippled` node.

## Threat: [API Vulnerability for Unauthorized Access](./threats/api_vulnerability_for_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability in `rippled`'s JSON-RPC or WebSocket API endpoints (e.g., injection flaws, authentication bypass). This allows them to send malicious commands, gain unauthorized access to node functionalities, or extract sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized control over `rippled` node, data breaches (if sensitive data is exposed via API), disruption of application functionality, potential financial losses.
*   **Affected Component:** `rippled` JSON-RPC and WebSocket API Modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `rippled` updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for API access if exposed publicly.
    *   Carefully validate and sanitize all inputs to the `rippled` API from the application.
    *   Regularly audit and pen-test application's API interactions and `rippled` configuration.
    *   Follow secure API development best practices.

## Threat: [Third-Party Dependency Vulnerability](./threats/third-party_dependency_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** `rippled` relies on various third-party libraries. An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of these dependencies to compromise `rippled`. This could involve exploiting vulnerable parsing logic, memory corruption issues, or other flaws in the dependency code.
*   **Impact:** Node compromise, potential data breaches, service disruption, potential for remote code execution on the `rippled` server.
*   **Affected Component:** Third-party libraries used by `rippled` (e.g., OpenSSL, Boost, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep `rippled` updated to the latest versions, which include updated dependencies with security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories for `rippled` and its dependencies.
    *   Consider using dependency scanning tools (primarily for `rippled` developers, but users benefit from updated releases).
