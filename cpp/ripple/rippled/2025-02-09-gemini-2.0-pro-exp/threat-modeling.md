# Threat Model Analysis for ripple/rippled

## Threat: [RPC/WebSocket Interface Hijacking](./threats/rpcwebsocket_interface_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `rippled` server's RPC or WebSocket interface.  This could be through credential theft, session hijacking (if sessions are used insecurely), or exploiting a vulnerability in the interface itself. The attacker could then issue commands as if they were the legitimate application.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete control over the `rippled` node's interaction with the XRP Ledger.
        *   Submission of fraudulent transactions.
        *   Retrieval of sensitive information (account balances, transaction history).
        *   Node shutdown or reconfiguration.
        *   Denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rippled`'s RPC server (JSON-RPC over HTTP/HTTPS) and WebSocket server. Specifically, the handlers for administrative commands (e.g., `stop`, `sign`, `submit`, `ledger_accept`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong, unique passwords and consider multi-factor authentication if feasible (through a reverse proxy).
        *   **IP Whitelisting:**  Strictly limit access to the RPC/WebSocket interface to known, trusted IP addresses using the `[ips_fixed]` and `[ips]` configuration sections in `rippled.cfg`.
        *   **TLS Encryption:**  Always use HTTPS (for JSON-RPC) and WSS (for WebSocket) with valid, trusted TLS certificates.  Configure `rippled` to require TLS.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Commands:**  Disable administrative commands (especially `admin` functions) if they are not absolutely required by the application.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on the application side and potentially within `rippled` (if supported) or via a reverse proxy to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the `rippled.cfg` and any reverse proxy configurations for security misconfigurations.

## Threat: [Exploitation of `rippled` Software Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of__rippled__software_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the `rippled` codebase (e.g., a buffer overflow, integer overflow, logic error) to gain unauthorized access or cause a denial of service.  This could be a known vulnerability in an outdated version or a zero-day vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of the `rippled` node.
        *   Remote code execution.
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Potentially any component of `rippled`, depending on the specific vulnerability.  This could include the RPC server, WebSocket server, peer-to-peer networking code, transaction processing logic, consensus engine, or any other module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep `rippled` Updated:**  *Always* run the latest stable release of `rippled`.  Monitor Ripple's official channels for security advisories and updates.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Regularly scan the `rippled` codebase and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Code Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the `rippled` codebase (if you have the expertise) or rely on audits performed by Ripple and the community.
        *   **Bug Bounty Programs:**  Participate in or monitor bug bounty programs related to `rippled` to stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Validator Key Compromise (if running a validator)](./threats/validator_key_compromise__if_running_a_validator_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the validator's secret key. This could be through physical theft, malware infection, or exploiting a vulnerability in the key storage mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   The attacker can impersonate the validator.
        *   The attacker can sign invalid proposals or votes, potentially disrupting the consensus process.
        *   Loss of trust in the validator.
    *   **Affected Component:** The validator's key management system and the `rippled` components responsible for signing proposals and votes (related to the consensus engine).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Hardware Security Module (HSM):** Store the validator secret key in a secure HSM.
        *   **Offline Key Generation:** Generate the validator key offline in a secure environment.
        *   **Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate the validator key.
        *   **Multi-Signature (if supported):** Consider using a multi-signature scheme for validator keys to increase security.
        *   **Strict Access Control:**  Limit physical and logical access to the validator server and key material.

## Threat: [Ledger Data Corruption (highly unlikely, but severe)](./threats/ledger_data_corruption__highly_unlikely__but_severe_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker manages to corrupt the ledger data stored by the `rippled` node. This is extremely difficult due to the decentralized nature of the XRP Ledger and the cryptographic integrity checks, but theoretically possible through a sophisticated attack targeting the node's storage or a critical bug in the ledger handling code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Loss of data integrity.
        *   Inconsistent view of the ledger.
        *   Potential for double-spending or other fraudulent activities.
        *   Node failure.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rippled`'s ledger storage and retrieval mechanisms (database interaction, data validation). The `NodeStore` and related components are critical.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (but extremely low probability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Data Backups:** Regularly back up the `rippled` node's data to a secure location.
        *   **Data Integrity Checks:** Implement additional data integrity checks on the application side (if feasible) to verify the consistency of data retrieved from `rippled`.
        *   **Redundancy:** Run multiple `rippled` nodes and compare their ledger data to detect any discrepancies.
        *   **Run a validated ledger:** Use `ledger_cleaner` to ensure that your node is storing a validated copy of the ledger.

## Threat: [Denial-of-Service (DoS) via Peer Protocol Overload](./threats/denial-of-service__dos__via_peer_protocol_overload.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the `rippled` node with a large number of connection requests or specially crafted messages via the peer-to-peer protocol. This overwhelms the node's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), making it unresponsive to legitimate requests.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   `rippled` node becomes unavailable.
        *   Application functionality that depends on `rippled` is disrupted.
        *   Potential disruption of the XRP Ledger if the node is a validator.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rippled`'s peer-to-peer networking component, including connection management, message parsing, and validation logic.  The `overlay` module is a key area.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure appropriate resource limits (CPU, memory, file descriptors, network connections) for the `rippled` process using operating system tools.
        *   **Network Firewalls:** Use a firewall to restrict incoming connections to the `rippled` node to known and trusted peers.
        *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy an IDS/IPS to detect and block malicious network traffic.
        *   **`rippled.cfg` Tuning:**  Adjust `rippled.cfg` parameters related to peer connections (e.g., `peer_connect_max`, `peer_private`) to limit the impact of DoS attacks.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Network Level):** Implement network-level rate limiting to prevent excessive connection attempts.
