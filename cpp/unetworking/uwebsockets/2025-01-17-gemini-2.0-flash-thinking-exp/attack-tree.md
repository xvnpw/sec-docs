## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Send messages designed to trigger specific server-side logic flaws (CRITICAL NODE):**
Attackers craft WebSocket messages with specific content or sequences intended to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's message processing logic. This could involve bypassing authentication, triggering unintended actions, or causing data corruption.

**Exploit vulnerabilities in HTTP parsing logic (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
If the application uses uWebSockets for HTTP handling, attackers can send malformed or specially crafted HTTP requests that exploit weaknesses in uWebSockets' HTTP parsing implementation. This could lead to buffer overflows, denial of service, or even remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Management Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_management_issues.md)

**Trigger Buffer Overflow (CRITICAL NODE):**
    **Exploit potential vulnerabilities in internal uWebSockets buffer management (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers send data exceeding the allocated buffer size in uWebSockets, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions. This can lead to crashes, denial of service, or, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution. This could involve oversized WebSocket messages or HTTP headers/bodies.

**Trigger Use-After-Free (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    **Exploit race conditions in connection handling leading to dangling pointers (CRITICAL NODE):** Attackers manipulate the connection lifecycle (e.g., rapid connection/disconnection sequences) to trigger a state where memory is freed while still being referenced. This can lead to crashes or, more dangerously, allow attackers to control the freed memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit State Management Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_state_management_issues.md)

**Connection Hijacking (CRITICAL NODE):**
Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how uWebSockets manages connection states or session identifiers to take over an existing legitimate connection. This could allow them to impersonate a user, access sensitive data, or perform unauthorized actions.

**Cross-Protocol Attacks (if HTTP and WebSocket are both used) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):**
If the application uses both HTTP and WebSocket functionalities provided by uWebSockets, attackers might exploit vulnerabilities arising from the interaction or shared state between these protocols. This could involve using an HTTP request to influence a WebSocket connection or vice versa, leading to unexpected behavior or security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Dependencies/Native Code Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_dependenciesnative_code_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries used by uWebSockets, such as OpenSSL for secure connections. This is often done by sending specific data or triggering conditions that exploit the dependency's flaw. Successful exploitation can lead to various impacts, including data breaches, denial of service, or remote code execution, depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency.
