# Threat Model Analysis for unetworking/uwebsockets

## Threat: [Oversized WebSocket Message](./threats/oversized_websocket_message.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a WebSocket message with an extremely large payload, exceeding the server's expected or manageable limits. This can cause the server to allocate excessive memory, consume significant processing time, or potentially crash due to how `uwebsockets` handles message buffering and processing.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion (memory, CPU).

**Affected Component:** WebSocket Message Handler, Memory Allocation within uWebSockets.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure maximum allowed message size within the uWebSockets application.
*   Implement application-level checks to validate the size of incoming messages before processing.
*   Implement backpressure mechanisms to handle situations where the application cannot keep up with incoming messages.

## Threat: [Malformed WebSocket Frame](./threats/malformed_websocket_frame.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a crafted WebSocket frame that violates the WebSocket protocol specification. This could exploit vulnerabilities in `uwebsockets`' frame parsing logic, leading to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially memory corruption within the library.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential for remote code execution if memory corruption is exploitable within `uwebsockets`.

**Affected Component:** WebSocket Frame Parser.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure uWebSockets is updated to the latest version with known bug fixes.
*   Implement robust error handling around WebSocket frame parsing.
*   Consider using a well-vetted WebSocket security library or proxy in front of the application for additional validation.

## Threat: [Connection Exhaustion](./threats/connection_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker rapidly opens a large number of WebSocket connections to the server, exceeding its connection limits and exhausting available resources (e.g., file descriptors, memory) managed by `uwebsockets`. This can prevent legitimate users from connecting.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).

**Affected Component:** Connection Management within uWebSockets.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure maximum allowed connections within the uWebSockets application.
*   Implement rate limiting on new connection requests.
*   Implement mechanisms to detect and block malicious connection attempts.

## Threat: [Memory Leaks](./threats/memory_leaks.md)

**Description:** Bugs within `uwebsockets'` C++ codebase could cause memory to be allocated but not properly released when handling connections, messages, or errors. Over time, this can lead to increased memory consumption, performance degradation, and eventually application crashes due to issues within the library itself.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion, performance degradation.

**Affected Component:** Memory Management within various uWebSockets modules (e.g., connection handling, message processing).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update uWebSockets to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Monitor the application's memory usage for unusual patterns.
*   Consider using memory profiling tools to identify potential leaks within the application's interaction with uWebSockets.

## Threat: [File Descriptor Exhaustion](./threats/file_descriptor_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** Each WebSocket connection typically consumes a file descriptor. If `uwebsockets` doesn't properly close connections or if there are leaks in file descriptor management within the library, an attacker could exhaust the available file descriptors on the server, preventing new connections and potentially impacting other services.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).

**Affected Component:** Connection Management, Socket Handling within uWebSockets.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure appropriate timeouts for idle connections to ensure they are closed by uWebSockets.
*   Monitor the number of open file descriptors used by the application.
*   Ensure proper error handling and connection closure in the application's logic, especially when interacting with uWebSockets' connection management.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflows in Native Code](./threats/buffer_overflows_in_native_code.md)

**Description:** As a C++ library, `uwebsockets` is susceptible to buffer overflow vulnerabilities if input data is not handled carefully within its native code. An attacker could send specially crafted data that overflows a buffer within `uwebsockets`, potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution within the server process.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Affected Component:** Various modules within uWebSockets' C++ codebase where input data is processed (e.g., frame parsing, header handling).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update uWebSockets to benefit from security patches.
*   Thoroughly audit any custom code interacting directly with uWebSockets' API.
*   Consider using memory safety tools during development and testing of applications using uWebSockets.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free Errors](./threats/use-after-free_errors.md)

**Description:** Improper memory management in `uwebsockets'` C++ code could lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities, where the library attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can lead to crashes or exploitable conditions within the `uwebsockets` library.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Affected Component:** Memory Management within various uWebSockets modules.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update uWebSockets to benefit from security patches.
*   Thoroughly audit any custom code interacting directly with uWebSockets' API.
*   Consider using memory safety tools during development and testing of applications using uWebSockets.

## Threat: [Lack of Secure Defaults for TLS](./threats/lack_of_secure_defaults_for_tls.md)

**Description:** The default TLS configuration within `uwebsockets` (if it manages TLS directly) might not be optimal for security. Weak ciphers or outdated protocols could be enabled by default, making connections vulnerable to attacks.

**Impact:** Exposure to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Affected Component:** TLS/SSL implementation within uWebSockets.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure uWebSockets to use strong TLS ciphers and protocols.
*   Disable support for outdated or insecure TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1).
*   Ensure proper certificate validation is enabled when configuring TLS within uWebSockets.
