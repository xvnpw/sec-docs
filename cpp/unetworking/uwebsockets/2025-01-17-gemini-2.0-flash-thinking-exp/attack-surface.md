# Attack Surface Analysis for unetworking/uwebsockets

## Attack Surface: [Malformed HTTP Request Handling](./attack_surfaces/malformed_http_request_handling.md)

* **Description:** Malformed HTTP Request Handling
    * **How uWebSockets Contributes to the Attack Surface:** uWebSockets is responsible for parsing incoming HTTP requests. If it doesn't robustly handle malformed or unexpected request structures (e.g., excessively long headers, invalid characters in request lines), it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends an HTTP request with an extremely long header exceeding buffer limits within uWebSockets' parsing logic.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to crashes or resource exhaustion, potential for memory corruption if not handled safely.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure uWebSockets with appropriate limits for header sizes and request line lengths.
        * Keep uWebSockets updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Excessive Connections](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_excessive_connections.md)

* **Description:** Resource Exhaustion through Excessive Connections
    * **How uWebSockets Contributes to the Attack Surface:** uWebSockets manages network connections. If not properly configured or if the application doesn't implement connection limits, an attacker can open a large number of connections, exhausting server resources.
    * **Example:** An attacker rapidly opens thousands of WebSocket connections to the server, consuming memory and CPU resources, making the application unresponsive to legitimate users.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure uWebSockets with appropriate limits on the maximum number of concurrent connections.

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Origin Validation Bypass](./attack_surfaces/websocket_origin_validation_bypass.md)

* **Description:** WebSocket Origin Validation Bypass
    * **How uWebSockets Contributes to the Attack Surface:** While uWebSockets provides mechanisms for origin validation, the application is ultimately responsible for enforcing it. If the application doesn't properly validate the `Origin` header during the WebSocket handshake, it can be vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH).
    * **Example:** An attacker hosts a malicious webpage that attempts to establish a WebSocket connection to the vulnerable application with a forged `Origin` header, potentially allowing them to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.
    * **Impact:**  Unauthorized actions, data theft, session hijacking.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict `Origin` header validation within the application's WebSocket handshake logic.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tls_configuration.md)

* **Description:** Insecure TLS Configuration
    * **How uWebSockets Contributes to the Attack Surface:** uWebSockets handles TLS/SSL termination for HTTPS and WSS connections. Misconfiguration of TLS options (e.g., using weak cipher suites, outdated protocols) can weaken the security of these connections.
    * **Example:** The application is configured to allow the use of outdated SSLv3 or weak cipher suites, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker could decrypt the communication.
    * **Impact:** Data interception, eavesdropping, potential for data manipulation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Configure uWebSockets to use strong and modern TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
        * Disable support for weak or deprecated cipher suites.
        * Regularly update the TLS library used by uWebSockets.
