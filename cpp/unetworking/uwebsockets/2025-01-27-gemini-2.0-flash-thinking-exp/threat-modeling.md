# Threat Model Analysis for unetworking/uwebsockets

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow](./threats/buffer_overflow.md)

Description: An attacker could send specially crafted HTTP requests or WebSocket messages exceeding expected buffer sizes. If `uwebsockets`'s parsing logic lacks proper bounds checking, this can overwrite adjacent memory regions. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the attacker controls the overflowed data, or denial of service through crashes.
Impact: Code execution, denial of service, information disclosure (in some scenarios).
Affected uWebSockets Component: HTTP parser, WebSocket frame parser, input handling functions.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Keep `uwebsockets` updated to benefit from security patches released by maintainers.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in application code *before* passing data to `uwebsockets`, although primary mitigation relies on the library itself being secure.
*   Utilize compiler and OS level buffer overflow protection mechanisms (ASLR, DEP) as a secondary defense layer.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free](./threats/use-after-free.md)

Description: An attacker might trigger a sequence of events that causes `uwebsockets` to free memory that is still being referenced internally. Subsequently, if the attacker can trigger access to this freed memory (e.g., by sending another request or message), it can lead to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
Impact: Code execution, denial of service, memory corruption, unpredictable application behavior.
Affected uWebSockets Component: Connection management, object lifecycle management within the library, event handling.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Keep `uwebsockets` updated to benefit from security patches released by maintainers.
*   Carefully review application code interacting with `uwebsockets` for proper object lifetime management, although primary mitigation relies on the library itself being secure.
*   Use memory sanitizers during development and testing to detect use-after-free errors in application code and potentially within `uwebsockets` if you are developing or debugging the library itself.

## Threat: [HTTP/WebSocket Protocol Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/httpwebsocket_protocol_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: An attacker sends malformed or crafted HTTP requests or WebSocket frames designed to exploit weaknesses in `uwebsockets`'s protocol parsing logic. Successful exploitation could lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, security bypasses, or in severe cases, arbitrary code execution if parsing flaws are critical enough.
Impact: Code execution, denial of service, security bypasses, information disclosure.
Affected uWebSockets Component: HTTP parser module, WebSocket frame parser module.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Crucially, keep `uwebsockets` updated.** Security patches for protocol parsing vulnerabilities are primarily addressed by library updates.
*   Consider deploying a Web Application Firewall (WAF) as an additional layer of defense to filter out potentially malicious requests at the protocol level, although this is a general web application security measure and not specific to `uwebsockets` itself.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of TLS/SSL](./threats/misconfiguration_of_tlsssl.md)

Description: Incorrect TLS/SSL configuration when using HTTPS/WSS with `uwebsockets` (e.g., using weak or outdated ciphers, disabling essential security features, improper certificate handling) can make the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping, and compromise the confidentiality and integrity of communication.
Impact: Compromised confidentiality and integrity of communication, man-in-the-middle attacks, denial of service (due to weakened security and potential exploitation).
Affected uWebSockets Component: TLS/SSL integration within `uwebsockets`, configuration settings related to HTTPS/WSS.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Enforce strong TLS/SSL configurations:** Use strong and modern cipher suites, enforce TLS 1.2 or higher, and ensure proper certificate management (including using valid certificates from trusted CAs).
*   Regularly review and update TLS/SSL configurations to align with security best practices and address newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   Utilize TLS/SSL testing tools and services (e.g., SSL Labs SSL Test) to validate and verify the strength and correctness of your TLS/SSL configurations.
