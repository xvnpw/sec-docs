# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for unetworking/uwebsockets

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Connection Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_connection_limits.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Implement Connection Limits

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Server Capacity:** Determine the maximum number of concurrent WebSocket connections your server infrastructure can reliably handle.
    2.  **Configure uWebSockets `maxPayloadLength`:**  Within your `uwebsockets` server setup (likely in your main server initialization code, e.g., in `listen` or `ws` handler setup), set the `maxPayloadLength` option to a reasonable value. This indirectly helps with connection management by limiting message sizes and potential resource consumption per connection.
    3.  **Implement Connection Counter (Application Level):** Maintain a counter in your application code that tracks active WebSocket connections. Increment on connection open, decrement on close.
    4.  **Reject New Connections (Application Level):** In your `uwebsockets` connection handler (`ws.on('connection', ...)`), check the connection counter. If limit reached, reject the new connection by not proceeding with setup or sending a close frame.
    5.  **Monitor Connection Count (Application Level):** Monitor the application-level connection counter to ensure limits are effective and adjust if needed.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS (Denial of Service) via Connection Flooding (High Severity):** Attackers can overwhelm the server by opening excessive connections.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Memory, CPU) (Medium Severity):**  High connection count can lead to resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Connection Flooding (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces risk by limiting concurrent connections.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Memory, CPU) (Medium Reduction):** Helps control resource usage during peak loads.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `server.js` with `maxPayloadLength` in `ws` handler. Explicit connection counting and rejection logic are missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit connection counter and rejection logic in `server.js` within `ws.on('connection', ...)` handler.
    *   Configuration for the maximum connection limit needs to be externalized.
    *   Monitoring of the connection count is not integrated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Message Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_message_size_limits.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Enforce Message Size Limits

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Maximum Message Size:** Decide on a reasonable maximum size for WebSocket messages based on your application's needs and server capacity.
    2.  **Configure uWebSockets `maxPayloadLength`:**  Set the `maxPayloadLength` option in your `uwebsockets` server setup (e.g., in `listen` or `ws` handler options). This is a direct `uwebsockets` configuration to limit incoming message size.
    3.  **Handle Oversized Messages (uWebsockets will handle):** `uwebsockets` will automatically reject messages exceeding `maxPayloadLength` and close the connection with a close frame. Ensure your application logs or handles these close events appropriately if needed.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **DoS (Denial of Service) via Large Message Flooding (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers can send extremely large messages to consume server bandwidth, memory, and processing power.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Memory) (Medium Severity):** Large messages can lead to memory exhaustion if not limited.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS via Large Message Flooding (Medium to High Reduction):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the server with oversized messages.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Memory) (Medium Reduction):** Limits memory consumption from individual messages.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `server.js`. `maxPayloadLength` is set to 64KB in `ws` handler options.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and potentially adjust `maxPayloadLength` to a value appropriate for the application's needs.
    *   Ensure logging or handling of connection closures due to `maxPayloadLength` violations if required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep uWebSockets Library Up-to-Date](./mitigation_strategies/keep_uwebsockets_library_up-to-date.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Keep uWebSockets Library Up-to-Date

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Check for Updates:** Monitor the `unetworking/uwebsockets` GitHub repository for new releases and security advisories.
    2.  **Update uWebSockets Dependency:** Use your project's package manager (e.g., npm, yarn if using a wrapper, or manual C++ build process) to update the `uwebsockets` library to the latest stable version.
    3.  **Test After Updates:** After updating, thoroughly test your application to ensure compatibility and that the update hasn't introduced regressions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known uWebSockets Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated libraries may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known uWebSockets Vulnerabilities (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation by patching known vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Likely depends on project's dependency management and update practices. Needs to be verified.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Establish a process for regularly checking and updating `uwebsockets` library.
    *   Integrate dependency update checks into CI/CD pipeline if possible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Properly Handle WebSocket Close Frames](./mitigation_strategies/properly_handle_websocket_close_frames.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Properly Handle WebSocket Close Frames

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement `ws.on('close', ...)` Handler:** Ensure you have a `close` event handler defined in your `uwebsockets` WebSocket setup (`ws.on('close', ...)`).
    2.  **Graceful Connection Closure:** Within the `close` handler, perform any necessary cleanup tasks, such as releasing resources associated with the connection (e.g., removing connection from active user lists, closing database connections if tied to the WebSocket connection).
    3.  **Log Connection Closures:** Log WebSocket connection closure events, including the close code and reason (if provided). This aids in debugging and security auditing.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Leaks (Medium Severity):** Improperly handled connection closures can lead to resource leaks if resources are not released when connections terminate.
    *   **Unexpected Application State (Medium Severity):**  Incorrect handling of close events can lead to inconsistent application state if connection termination is not properly managed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Leaks (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk of resource leaks by ensuring proper cleanup on connection closure.
    *   **Unexpected Application State (Medium Reduction):** Improves application stability and predictability by handling connection termination gracefully.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `server.js`. A basic `ws.on('close', ...)` handler exists, but resource cleanup and detailed logging might be missing or incomplete.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and enhance the `ws.on('close', ...)` handler in `server.js` to ensure comprehensive resource cleanup and logging.
    *   Document the resource cleanup procedures performed in the `close` handler.
