# Attack Surface Analysis for unetworking/uwebsockets

## Attack Surface: [WebSocket Protocol Implementation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/websocket_protocol_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in uWebSockets' implementation of the WebSocket protocol (RFC 6455) that deviate from the standard or contain bugs in parsing and handling WebSocket frames and handshake.
*   **uWebSockets Contribution:** uWebSockets is responsible for the core WebSocket protocol logic. Bugs here are direct vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A buffer overflow in the frame parsing logic allows an attacker to send a specially crafted WebSocket frame that overwrites memory, leading to code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Protocol Downgrade, Security Bypass.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep uWebSockets Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Fuzzing uWebSockets (for library maintainers/advanced users):** Employ fuzzing techniques to automatically discover protocol implementation bugs.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Protocol Handling Vulnerabilities (Handshake)](./attack_surfaces/http_protocol_handling_vulnerabilities__handshake_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from uWebSockets' handling of HTTP requests specifically during the WebSocket handshake process.
*   **uWebSockets Contribution:** uWebockets includes HTTP parsing and request handling logic for the initial handshake. Flaws in this HTTP handling code are direct attack vectors.
*   **Example:**  An HTTP Request Smuggling vulnerability in uWebSockets' HTTP parser allows an attacker to inject malicious requests during the handshake, potentially bypassing authentication or gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**  Security Bypass, Data Injection, Unauthorized Access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep uWebSockets Updated:**  Updates often include fixes for HTTP parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Strict HTTP Header Validation in Application (for critical headers):**  While uWebSockets handles HTTP, perform application-level validation of critical HTTP headers if your application logic relies on them for security during the handshake.

## Attack Surface: [C++ Memory Safety Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/c++_memory_safety_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Memory corruption vulnerabilities inherent to C++ programming within the uWebSockets codebase, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, and integer overflows.
*   **uWebSockets Contribution:**  As uWebSockets is written in C++, it is susceptible to common C++ memory safety issues if not carefully coded.
*   **Example:**  A buffer overflow in the message processing logic allows an attacker to send a message larger than expected, overwriting adjacent memory regions and potentially gaining control of the server process.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure, Privilege Escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep uWebSockets Updated:**  Updates often address memory safety bugs.
    *   **Memory Sanitizers during Development:**  Use memory sanitizers (like AddressSanitizer, MemorySanitizer) during development and testing of applications using uWebSockets to detect memory errors early.

## Attack Surface: [Concurrency Issues (Race Conditions, Deadlocks)](./attack_surfaces/concurrency_issues__race_conditions__deadlocks_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from improper synchronization in uWebSockets' concurrent operations, leading to race conditions or deadlocks within the library itself.
*   **uWebSockets Contribution:**  uWebSockets is designed for high performance and uses multi-threading or asynchronous operations. Incorrect synchronization in its internal logic can introduce concurrency issues.
*   **Example:**  A race condition in connection handling allows an attacker to manipulate connection state in an unexpected way, potentially bypassing authentication or causing data corruption due to internal uWebsockets state issues.
*   **Impact:**  Denial of Service (Deadlocks), Data Corruption, Security Bypass, Unpredictable Behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep uWebSockets Updated:**  Updates may include fixes for concurrency bugs.
    *   **Stress Testing and Concurrency Testing:**  Perform rigorous stress testing and concurrency testing of applications using uWebSockets to potentially trigger underlying concurrency issues in uWebsockets itself.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (Resource Exhaustion due to uWebsockets design/defaults)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__resource_exhaustion_due_to_uwebsockets_designdefaults_.md)

*   **Description:**  DoS attacks that specifically exploit resource exhaustion vulnerabilities related to uWebSockets' design or default configurations, making the application unavailable.
*   **uWebSockets Contribution:**  Default settings or design choices in uWebSockets might make it susceptible to certain types of resource exhaustion DoS if not properly configured.
*   **Example:**  Default connection limits in uWebSockets are too high, allowing an attacker to easily launch a connection flood DoS attack and overwhelm the server.
*   **Impact:**  Service Disruption, Financial Loss, Reputational Damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review and Harden uWebSockets Configuration:**  Carefully review uWebSockets configuration options and set secure resource limits (connection limits, message size limits, timeouts) appropriate for your application.
    *   **Implement Rate Limiting (application level):** Implement application-level rate limiting on WebSocket connections and messages to further mitigate flood-based DoS attacks.
