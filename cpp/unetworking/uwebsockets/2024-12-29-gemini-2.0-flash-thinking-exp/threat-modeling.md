### High and Critical uWebSockets Threats

Here are the high and critical severity threats that directly involve the uWebSockets library:

*   **Threat:** Excessive Connection Request Flooding
    *   **Description:** An attacker might initiate a large number of connection requests directly to the uWebSockets server. This overwhelms uWebSockets' connection handling, consuming server resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors) and making it unresponsive to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - legitimate users cannot connect, and the server might crash.
    *   **Affected uWebSockets Component:** Connection Handling Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure connection limits within uWebSockets (if available and configurable).
        *   Use a reverse proxy with connection management and rate limiting capabilities *in front of* the uWebSockets application.

*   **Threat:** Malformed WebSocket Frame Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted, invalid, or oversized WebSocket frames directly to the uWebSockets server. This exploits vulnerabilities in uWebSockets' frame parsing logic, potentially leading to crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior within the uWebSockets process.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the server might crash or become unstable. Potential for information disclosure if error messages from uWebSockets reveal internal state.
    *   **Affected uWebSockets Component:** WebSocket Frame Parser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize uWebSockets' built-in frame validation features if available and configurable.
        *   Consider using a WebSocket firewall or proxy to filter out malformed frames *before* they reach uWebSockets.

*   **Threat:** Memory Exhaustion via Memory Leaks
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability within uWebSockets' code causes memory leaks under specific conditions. Over time, the uWebSockets process consumes excessive memory, leading to performance degradation or crashes of the application using uWebSockets.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - the application becomes unstable, slows down significantly, or crashes due to memory exhaustion within the uWebSockets process.
    *   **Affected uWebSockets Component:** Memory Management within various uWebSockets modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update uWebSockets to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Monitor the memory usage of the uWebSockets process.
        *   Report potential memory leaks to the uWebSockets maintainers.

*   **Threat:** Memory Corruption Leading to Data Leaks or RCE
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities like buffer overflows or use-after-free errors within uWebSockets' C++ codebase allow an attacker to send specially crafted data that overwrites memory regions *within the uWebSockets process*. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive data held by uWebSockets or, in severe cases, allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the uWebSockets process.
    *   **Impact:** Information Disclosure - sensitive data handled by uWebSockets can be leaked. Remote Code Execution (RCE) - attackers can gain control of the server process running uWebSockets.
    *   **Affected uWebSockets Component:** Native C++ code in various uWebSockets modules, particularly those handling data parsing and manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update uWebSockets to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Carefully review any custom native code extensions or integrations with uWebSockets.

*   **Threat:** Integer Overflow/Underflow Exploitation
    *   **Description:** Integer overflow or underflow vulnerabilities in uWebSockets' code cause unexpected behavior when handling data sizes or calculations *within the uWebSockets process*. An attacker might craft inputs that trigger these overflows, potentially leading to buffer overflows or other exploitable conditions within uWebSockets.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential for Information Disclosure or Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the context of the overflow within uWebSockets.
    *   **Affected uWebSockets Component:** Native C++ code in various uWebSockets modules performing arithmetic operations on size-related variables.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update uWebSockets to the latest stable version with security patches.

*   **Threat:** HTTP Request Smuggling (If HTTP Features are Used)
    *   **Description:** If the application utilizes uWebSockets for handling HTTP requests, vulnerabilities in *uWebSockets'* request parsing or handling could allow an attacker to smuggle malicious HTTP requests through the server. This can lead to bypassing security controls or performing unintended actions.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious actions depending on the smuggled request handled by uWebSockets.
    *   **Affected uWebSockets Component:** HTTP Request Parser (within uWebSockets).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure strict adherence to HTTP standards when configuring and using uWebSockets' HTTP handling features.
        *   Use a well-vetted reverse proxy for HTTP handling *in front of* the uWebSockets application, as reverse proxies often have built-in protection against request smuggling.
