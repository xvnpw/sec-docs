# Threat Model Analysis for unetworking/uwebsockets

## Threat: [Malformed HTTP Request Handling](./threats/malformed_http_request_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with malformed headers, methods, or URIs. This could cause the `HTTP Parser` component to crash, enter an infinite loop, or exhibit unexpected behavior.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially leading to server unavailability.

**Affected Component:** `HTTP Parser` module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strict HTTP parsing according to RFC standards.
- Set limits on the size and complexity of HTTP headers and URIs.
- Implement proper error handling and recovery mechanisms in the HTTP parser.
- Fuzz testing the HTTP parser with various malformed inputs.

## Threat: [Oversized HTTP Headers](./threats/oversized_http_headers.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends an HTTP request with excessively large headers. This could lead to excessive memory consumption in the `Request Handling` component, potentially causing memory exhaustion and a denial-of-service.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).

**Affected Component:** `Request Handling` module, specifically header processing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement limits on the maximum size of individual HTTP headers and the total size of all headers.
- Allocate memory for headers dynamically and with appropriate limits.
- Reject requests with headers exceeding the defined limits.

## Threat: [Memory Leak in Connection Handling](./threats/memory_leak_in_connection_handling.md)

**Description:** Due to a bug in the `Connection Management` module, resources (memory, file descriptors) are not properly released when connections are closed or terminated. Repeated connection attempts and closures by an attacker could lead to resource exhaustion.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** `Connection Management` module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Conduct thorough memory leak testing and analysis.
- Ensure proper resource deallocation in connection close handlers.
- Use memory analysis tools to detect and fix leaks.

## Threat: [Buffer Overflow in Data Processing](./threats/buffer_overflow_in_data_processing.md)

**Description:**  A vulnerability exists in how `uwebsockets` processes incoming HTTP request bodies or WebSocket message payloads in the `Data Handling` component. An attacker sends data exceeding expected buffer sizes, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Critical - Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete server compromise.

**Affected Component:** `Data Handling` module (for both HTTP and WebSocket).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strict bounds checking on all data inputs.
- Use memory-safe programming practices and libraries.
- Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits.
- Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to detect potential buffer overflows.
