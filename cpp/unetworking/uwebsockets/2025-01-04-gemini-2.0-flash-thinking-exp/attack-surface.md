# Attack Surface Analysis for unetworking/uwebsockets

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Native Code](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_in_native_code.md)

* **Description:** Bugs like buffer overflows, use-after-free, or double-free errors can exist within uWebSockets' C++ codebase.
    * **How uWebSockets Contributes:** As a native library, uWebSockets directly handles memory management. Vulnerabilities in its memory handling logic can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A crafted HTTP request with an excessively long header could cause a buffer overflow in uWebSockets' header parsing logic.
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to crashes, denial of service, arbitrary code execution, or information leaks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep uWebSockets Updated: Regularly update to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for memory corruption bugs.
        * Code Audits: Conduct thorough code audits of the uWebSockets codebase or rely on the community and maintainers for this.
        * Memory Sanitizers: When developing or testing, use memory sanitizers (like AddressSanitizer or MemorySanitizer) to detect memory errors early.

## Attack Surface: [Malformed HTTP Header Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malformed_http_header_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  The uWebSockets HTTP parser might be vulnerable to specially crafted or malformed HTTP headers.
    * **How uWebSockets Contributes:** uWebSockets is responsible for parsing incoming HTTP requests. Vulnerabilities in this parsing logic can be exploited.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends an HTTP request with an extremely long header name or value, potentially causing a buffer overflow or excessive resource consumption in the parser.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service (resource exhaustion), potential crashes, or in some cases, the ability to bypass security checks if header parsing is flawed.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep uWebSockets Updated: Updates often include fixes for parsing vulnerabilities.
        * Limit Header Sizes: Configure uWebSockets (if possible through provided options or by forking and modifying) to enforce limits on the size of HTTP headers.

## Attack Surface: [Malformed WebSocket Frame Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/malformed_websocket_frame_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  The uWebSockets WebSocket frame parser might be susceptible to malformed or oversized WebSocket frames.
    * **How uWebSockets Contributes:** uWebSockets handles the parsing and processing of WebSocket frames. Vulnerabilities here can be exploited directly.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a WebSocket frame with an invalid opcode or an excessively large payload, potentially causing a crash or unexpected behavior in uWebSockets.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, potential crashes, or the ability to inject malicious data if frame parsing is flawed.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep uWebSockets Updated:  Ensure you are using the latest version with bug fixes.
        * Limit Message Sizes: Configure uWebSockets (if possible) to enforce limits on the maximum size of WebSocket messages.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Connection Handling](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_connection_handling.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can overwhelm the server by opening a large number of connections, consuming resources.
    * **How uWebSockets Contributes:** uWebSockets manages connection handling. If not configured properly, it can be susceptible to connection flooding.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of connection requests to the server, exhausting available sockets, memory, or CPU resources.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Connection Limits: Configure uWebSockets (if it provides options) to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections.
        * Timeouts: Implement timeouts for idle connections to free up resources.
