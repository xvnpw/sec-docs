# Attack Tree Analysis for unetworking/uwebsockets

Objective: Compromise application using uWebSockets by exploiting weaknesses within the library itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application via uWebSockets Exploitation **(Critical Node)**
    * Exploit uWebSockets Directly **(High-Risk Path Start)**
        * Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities **(Critical Node)**
            * Buffer Overflow in Message Parsing **(High-Risk Path)**
                * Send crafted WebSocket message exceeding buffer limits
                    * Trigger arbitrary code execution **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path End)**
    * Exploit Application's Use of uWebSockets **(High-Risk Path Start)**
        * Lack of Input Validation on WebSocket Messages **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
            * Send malicious data through WebSocket messages
                * Exploit vulnerabilities in application logic processing the data
                    * Achieve unintended actions or access sensitive information **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path End)**
        * Lack of Authentication/Authorization on WebSocket Connections **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
            * Connect to the WebSocket server without proper authentication
                * Access protected functionalities or data without authorization **(Critical Node, High-Risk Path End)**
