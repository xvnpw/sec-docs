# Attack Surface Analysis for unetworking/uwebsockets

## Attack Surface: [Malformed Message Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/malformed_message_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send messages with invalid data (e.g., incorrect UTF-8, corrupted binary data) to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's message parsing logic.  While the *vulnerability* is in the application, uWebSockets.js delivers the malicious payload.
*   **uWebSockets Contribution:** uWebSockets.js handles the WebSocket protocol framing and delivers the raw message data to the application. It *does not* validate the application-level content of the message. This is a crucial point: uWebSockets.js is the *conduit* for the attack.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a text message with invalid UTF-8 characters, hoping to trigger a buffer overflow in the application's text processing code. Or, sends crafted binary data to exploit a vulnerability in a custom binary protocol parser. uWebSockets.js delivers this data.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, arbitrary code execution (in severe cases), data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible), High (otherwise)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** *Always* validate the content and encoding of incoming messages *after* receiving them from uWebSockets.js. Use robust parsing libraries. This is the application's responsibility, but it's triggered by data *from* uWebSockets.js.
    *   **UTF-8 Validation:** For text messages, explicitly validate that the data is valid UTF-8.
    *   **Schema Validation (Binary):** If using a custom binary protocol, define a schema and validate incoming binary data against that schema.
    *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzzing tools to test the application's message parsing logic with a wide range of invalid and unexpected inputs. This testing should include data *as received* from uWebSockets.js.
    *   **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for parsing failures. Never assume that incoming data is valid.

## Attack Surface: [Compression Bomb (Zip Bomb)](./attack_surfaces/compression_bomb__zip_bomb_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send highly compressed WebSocket messages that expand to a massive size, consuming excessive memory.
*   **uWebSockets Contribution:** This attack is *specifically enabled* by the use of WebSocket compression (permessage-deflate), which is a feature *directly handled* by uWebSockets.js. The library performs the decompression.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a small, highly compressed message that expands to several gigabytes when decompressed by uWebSockets.js.
*   **Impact:** Server memory exhaustion, application crashes, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Limit Expansion Ratio:** Configure uWebSockets.js to limit the maximum expansion ratio for compressed messages. This is a *direct* configuration of the library.
    *   **`maxPayloadLength` (Again):** Even with compression, `maxPayloadLength` (a uWebSockets.js setting) applies to the *uncompressed* size, providing a hard limit.
    *   **Disable Compression (If Possible):** If compression is not essential, disable it within uWebSockets.js to eliminate this attack vector entirely.
    *   **Memory Monitoring:** Monitor memory usage and trigger alerts if excessive memory is allocated during decompression (handled by uWebSockets.js).

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (uSockets)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__usockets_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying uSockets library can be exploited through uWebSockets.js.
*   **uWebSockets Contribution:** uWebSockets.js *directly and completely* depends on uSockets. Any vulnerability in uSockets is *inherently* a vulnerability in uWebSockets.js. This is a direct, fundamental relationship.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability is discovered in uSockets's handling of certain network packets. This directly impacts uWebSockets.js.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the uSockets vulnerability, potentially ranging from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Updated:** Regularly update uWebSockets.js (which will update uSockets) to the latest version. This is the *primary* mitigation, as it directly addresses the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or follow the uWebSockets.js and uSockets projects on GitHub to be notified of security updates.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit all dependencies, including uSockets, for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Weak TLS Configuration (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/weak_tls_configuration__if_applicable_.md)

* **Description:** If TLS is used, weak ciphers or outdated protocols can expose communications to eavesdropping or MITM attacks.
    * **uWebSockets Contribution:** uWebSockets.js *directly* handles the TLS handshake and encryption/decryption. The configuration of TLS *is* a uWebSockets.js configuration.
    * **Example:** The server, through uWebSockets.js's configuration, is set to use TLS 1.0 or 1.1 with weak ciphers.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of confidentiality and integrity of WebSocket communications.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strong Ciphers:** Configure uWebSockets.js to use only strong, modern ciphers (e.g., AES-256-GCM, ChaCha20-Poly1305). This is a *direct* configuration setting within uWebSockets.js.
        * **TLS 1.3 (Preferred):** Use TLS 1.3 whenever possible. Avoid TLS 1.0 and 1.1. TLS 1.2 is acceptable if configured with strong ciphers, all configured within uWebSockets.js.
        * **Certificate Validation:** Ensure proper certificate validation is implemented and enforced.
        * **Regular Review:** Regularly review and update the TLS configuration within uWebSockets.js.
