Okay, let's create a design document for the uWebSockets project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

uWebSockets is a widely used, high-performance WebSocket and HTTP server/client library.  It's designed for resource-constrained environments and prioritizes speed and efficiency over extensive feature sets.  It's often used as a foundational component in applications requiring real-time communication, such as online gaming, financial trading platforms, and collaborative applications.

Priorities:

*   Performance:  Minimize latency and maximize throughput for WebSocket and HTTP communication.
*   Efficiency:  Reduce CPU and memory usage, allowing for high connection density on limited hardware.
*   Reliability:  Maintain stable connections and handle network disruptions gracefully.
*   Security: Protect against common web vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity and confidentiality.
*   Ease of Use (secondary): Provide a relatively straightforward API for developers, although performance is prioritized over absolute simplicity.

Goals:

*   Provide a highly performant alternative to other WebSocket and HTTP libraries.
*   Enable developers to build scalable real-time applications.
*   Serve as a reliable foundation for performance-critical systems.

Business Risks:

*   Vulnerabilities leading to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks: Given its focus on performance, vulnerabilities that allow attackers to consume excessive resources or crash the server are a major risk.
*   Data breaches:  If used in applications handling sensitive data, vulnerabilities that expose or allow modification of data in transit or at rest are critical.
*   Compromise of dependent systems: As a foundational component, a vulnerability in uWebSockets could be exploited to compromise the entire application built upon it.
*   Reputation damage:  Security incidents could damage the reputation of the library and any projects that rely on it.
*   Loss of competitive advantage: If other libraries offer better security with comparable performance, users may migrate away.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Fuzzing: The project uses continuous fuzzing with OSS-Fuzz (mentioned in the README and build system). This helps identify potential memory corruption bugs and other vulnerabilities.
*   security control: AddressSanitizer (ASan): Used during testing to detect memory errors like buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities.
*   security control: MemorySanitizer (MSan): Used to detect use of uninitialized memory.
*   security control: UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan): Detects undefined behavior in C/C++ code.
*   security control: Static Analysis: The project mentions using static analysis tools, although the specific tools are not detailed in the provided information.
*   security control: Regular Updates: The project appears to be actively maintained, with regular updates and bug fixes, which is crucial for addressing newly discovered vulnerabilities.
*   security control: SSL/TLS Support: uWebSockets supports SSL/TLS for secure communication (wss:// and https://), leveraging OpenSSL or other compatible libraries. This is described in documentation.
*   security control: HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 support: uWebSockets supports modern HTTP protocols.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Dependency on external libraries: uWebSockets relies on external libraries like OpenSSL, Libuv, and zlib. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could impact the security of uWebSockets.
*   accepted risk: Complexity of C/C++: The use of C/C++ introduces inherent risks related to memory management and potential buffer overflows, despite mitigation efforts.
*   accepted risk: Limited built-in input validation: While some input validation is likely present, the library's focus on performance may mean that extensive validation is left to the application layer.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Integrate a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool: To automatically identify and track vulnerabilities in dependencies like OpenSSL, Libuv, and zlib.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) and other HTTP security headers: Provide guidance and examples for using these headers to mitigate XSS and other web-based attacks.
*   Provide specific guidance on secure WebSocket usage: Including recommendations for authentication, authorization, and input validation within WebSocket message handlers.
*   Consider a bug bounty program: To incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The library should support standard authentication mechanisms for HTTP and WebSocket connections (e.g., HTTP Basic Auth, Bearer Tokens, cookies).
    *   Integration with external authentication providers (e.g., OAuth 2.0, OpenID Connect) should be possible, though likely handled at the application level.
    *   Provide examples and best practices for secure session management.

*   Authorization:
    *   The library should allow developers to implement authorization checks to control access to specific resources or endpoints.
    *   Support for role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) should be considered, potentially through callbacks or hooks.

*   Input Validation:
    *   The library should perform basic validation of WebSocket and HTTP protocol elements (e.g., headers, URLs).
    *   Provide clear guidance and helper functions for validating user-supplied data within WebSocket messages and HTTP requests.
    *   Encourage the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Ensure that SSL/TLS is correctly configured by default, with strong cipher suites and protocols.
    *   Provide options for customizing SSL/TLS settings to meet specific security requirements.
    *   Use cryptographically secure random number generators for all security-sensitive operations.
    *   Provide guidance on securely storing and managing cryptographic keys.
