### 2. Threat Understanding: Slowloris Mechanics

Slowloris is a *low-bandwidth* denial-of-service attack.  It doesn't rely on flooding the server with a massive volume of traffic. Instead, it exploits the way many web servers (and WebSocket servers) handle connections.  Here's how it works:

*   **Multiple Connections:** The attacker establishes numerous connections to the target server.
*   **Partial Requests (HTTP):**  For HTTP, the attacker sends incomplete HTTP request headers.  For example, they might send:
    ```
    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0
    ```
    ...and then *never* send the final `\r\n\r\n` that signals the end of the headers.  The server keeps the connection open, waiting for the rest of the request.
*   **Slow Data Transfer (HTTP & WebSockets):** The attacker sends data very slowly, byte by byte, with long pauses in between.  For example, they might send a single character of a header every few seconds.  Or, for WebSockets, they might send a single byte of a WebSocket frame.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**  The server allocates resources (threads, memory, file descriptors) to each open connection.  By keeping many connections open in this "half-open" state, the attacker eventually exhausts the server's resources, preventing legitimate clients from connecting.

**Key Differences from Other DoS Attacks:**

*   **Low Bandwidth:**  Slowloris doesn't require a botnet or high-bandwidth connection.  A single machine can often launch a successful attack.
*   **Targeted Resource Exhaustion:**  It specifically targets connection-handling resources, rather than overwhelming network bandwidth or CPU.
*   **Long-Lived Connections:**  The attack relies on maintaining connections for extended periods, unlike attacks that send many short-lived requests.

### 3. uWebSockets.js Internals Review

uWebSockets.js is designed for high performance and low overhead.  This focus on efficiency can, ironically, make it *more* vulnerable to Slowloris if not configured correctly.  Here are some key aspects of uWebSockets.js relevant to this threat:

*   **Asynchronous, Non-Blocking I/O:** uWebSockets.js uses libuv (the same library used by Node.js) for asynchronous, non-blocking I/O.  This means it can handle many connections concurrently without creating a separate thread for each.  However, each connection still consumes *some* resources.
*   **Minimal Overhead:** uWebSockets.js is designed to minimize memory usage and CPU overhead per connection.  This is achieved by using highly optimized C++ code and avoiding unnecessary data copies.
*   **Configurable Timeouts:** uWebSockets.js *does* provide mechanisms for setting timeouts, but they are *not* aggressive by default.  This is crucial: **the developer must explicitly configure timeouts to mitigate Slowloris.**
*   **Connection Limits:** uWebSockets.js allows setting limits on the maximum number of connections, both globally and per IP address. This is another essential mitigation.
*   **`uWS::App` and `uWS::SSLApp`:** These are the main entry points for creating HTTP and HTTPS/WebSocket servers, respectively.  Timeout and connection limit configurations are typically set here.
*   **`idleTimeout`:** This is the most critical timeout for Slowloris. It specifies the maximum time a connection can remain idle (no data sent or received) before being closed.
*   **`maxPayloadLength`:** While not directly related to Slowloris, setting a reasonable limit on the maximum WebSocket message size can help prevent other types of resource exhaustion attacks.
*   **`upgrade` and `open` callbacks:** The `upgrade` callback (for HTTP upgrades to WebSockets) and the `open` callback (for new WebSocket connections) are where you can implement custom connection acceptance/rejection logic, potentially based on IP address or other criteria.

### 4. Vulnerability Assessment

Based on the above, here are the key vulnerabilities:

*   **Insufficiently Aggressive Timeouts (Default Configuration):**  The default uWebSockets.js configuration likely has very long or even disabled timeouts.  This is the *primary* vulnerability.  An attacker can easily keep connections open indefinitely.
*   **Unlimited Connections (Default Configuration):**  If the maximum number of connections is not limited, an attacker can exhaust all available file descriptors or other system resources.
*   **Lack of Per-IP Connection Limits:**  Even with a global connection limit, a single attacker (or a small number of attackers) could consume all available connections.  Per-IP limits are essential.
*   **No Connection Monitoring:**  Without monitoring, the application has no way to detect and proactively close slow or stalled connections.
*   **Ignoring Reverse Proxy Configuration:**  Even if a reverse proxy (like Nginx) is used, relying *solely* on the reverse proxy's timeouts is insufficient.  uWebSockets.js *must* also have its own timeouts configured. The reverse proxy adds a layer of defense, but it's not a complete solution.

### 5. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation and Recommendations

Here's a detailed breakdown of the mitigation strategies and how to implement them effectively:

**5.1. Strict Connection Timeouts (Crucial)**

*   **`idleTimeout` (Most Important):**  Set this to a relatively short value, such as 10-30 seconds.  This is the *primary* defense against Slowloris.  The exact value depends on the application's expected behavior, but it should be low enough to prevent attackers from holding connections open indefinitely.
*   **Handshake Timeout (Important):**  While uWebSockets.js doesn't have an explicit "handshake timeout" setting, you can achieve this by using a timer within the `upgrade` callback (for WebSockets) or the initial request handler (for HTTP).  If the handshake (HTTP upgrade or WebSocket opening handshake) doesn't complete within a few seconds, close the connection.
*   **Data Transfer Timeout (Important):**  Use `idleTimeout` to cover this.  If a client is sending data *extremely* slowly, `idleTimeout` will eventually trigger.

**Implementation (Code Example - uWS::App):**

```javascript
const uWS = require('uWebSockets.js');

const app = uWS.App({
    // ... other options ...
}).ws('/*', {
    /* Options */
    idleTimeout: 15, // 15 seconds idle timeout
    maxBackpressure: 1024,
    maxPayloadLength: 16 * 1024,
    compression: 0,

    upgrade: (res, req, context) => {
        // Implement a handshake timeout here (e.g., 5 seconds)
        let timer = setTimeout(() => {
            console.log('Handshake timeout!');
            res.close(); // or res.end() for HTTP
        }, 5000);

        res.upgrade(
            { /* your data */ },
            req.getHeader('sec-websocket-key'),
            req.getHeader('sec-websocket-protocol'),
            req.getHeader('sec-websocket-extensions'),
            context
        );
        clearTimeout(timer); // Clear the timer if the upgrade succeeds
    },
    open: (ws) => {
        console.log('A WebSocket connected!');
        // You could also set a timer here for the initial message
    },
    message: (ws, message, isBinary) => {
        /* Ok is false if backpressure was built up, wait for drain */
        let ok = ws.send(message, isBinary);
    },
    drain: (ws) => {
        console.log('WebSocket backpressure: ' + ws.getBufferedAmount());
    },
    close: (ws, code, message) => {
        console.log('WebSocket closed');
    }
}).listen(9001, (token) => {
    if (token) {
        console.log('Listening to port 9001');
    } else {
        console.log('Failed to listen to port 9001');
    }
});
```

**5.2. Limit Concurrent Connections**

*   **Global Limit:**  Set a reasonable maximum number of concurrent connections for the entire application.  This value depends on the server's resources (memory, file descriptors) and the expected load.
*   **Per-IP Limit:**  Implement a mechanism to track and limit the number of connections per IP address.  This is *crucial* to prevent a single attacker from monopolizing all connections.

**Implementation (Conceptual - Requires Custom Logic):**

uWebSockets.js doesn't have built-in per-IP limiting. You'll need to implement this yourself, likely within the `upgrade` or `open` callbacks.  Here's a conceptual approach:

```javascript
const ipConnections = new Map(); // Store connection counts per IP

// ... inside your uWS::App or uWS::SSLApp configuration ...

upgrade: (res, req, context) => {
    const ip = req.getHeader('x-forwarded-for') || req.getRemoteAddressAsText(); // Get IP (handle proxies)

    let count = ipConnections.get(ip) || 0;
    if (count >= MAX_CONNECTIONS_PER_IP) {
        console.log(`Rejecting connection from ${ip} (too many connections)`);
        res.close(); // or res.end()
        return;
    }

    ipConnections.set(ip, count + 1);

    // ... rest of your upgrade logic ...

    res.onAborted(() => {
        // Decrement the connection count when the connection is closed
        let count = ipConnections.get(ip) || 0;
        if (count > 0) {
            ipConnections.set(ip, count - 1);
        }
    });

     // ... rest of upgrade logic
},

// ... inside open callback for websockets
open: (ws) => {
    const ip = ws.getRemoteAddressAsText(); // Get IP (handle proxies)
    // ... rest of open logic
}
```

**5.3. Monitor Connection States**

*   **Active Monitoring:**  Implement a periodic task (e.g., using `setInterval`) to check the state of active connections.  Look for connections that have been idle for an unusually long time (but haven't yet triggered `idleTimeout`) or that are sending data very slowly.
*   **Logging:**  Log detailed information about connection events (establishment, closure, timeouts, errors) to help diagnose potential attacks.

**Implementation (Conceptual):**

uWebSockets.js doesn't provide direct access to a list of all active connections.  You'll need to maintain your own list within the `open` and `close` callbacks.  This is complex and requires careful handling of concurrency.  The monitoring would then iterate over this list.  This is generally less critical than the timeouts and connection limits.

**5.4. Reverse Proxy (Additional Layer)**

*   **Nginx/HAProxy:**  Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy in front of your uWebSockets.js application.  Configure the reverse proxy to:
    *   Handle SSL termination (if using HTTPS).
    *   Enforce its own connection timeouts and limits.
    *   Potentially buffer requests and responses (but be careful with buffering large WebSocket messages).
    *   Provide more sophisticated rate limiting and request filtering capabilities.

**Important:**  Even with a reverse proxy, *always* configure timeouts and connection limits within your uWebSockets.js application.  The reverse proxy is an additional layer of defense, not a replacement for proper uWebSockets.js configuration.

### 6. Testing and Validation

After implementing the mitigations, it's crucial to test the application's resilience to Slowloris attacks.

*   **Slowloris Tools:**  Use specialized tools like `slowhttptest` or `slowloris.py` to simulate Slowloris attacks against your application.
*   **Load Testing:**  Combine Slowloris testing with regular load testing to ensure the application can handle both legitimate traffic and attacks simultaneously.
*   **Monitoring:**  Monitor server resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors, network connections) during testing to verify that the mitigations are effective.
*   **Logging:**  Examine application logs to identify any connections that are closed due to timeouts or connection limits.

### 7. Conclusion
The Slowloris attack is a significant threat to any web server, including those built with uWebSockets.js. Due to its performance-focused design, uWebSockets.js requires careful configuration to mitigate this threat. The most critical mitigations are:

1.  **Strict Connection Timeouts:** Implement `idleTimeout` aggressively, and add handshake timeouts.
2.  **Connection Limits:** Set both global and per-IP connection limits.
3.  **Reverse Proxy (Optional but Recommended):** Use a reverse proxy for an additional layer of defense, but *always* configure uWebSockets.js timeouts as well.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of a successful Slowloris attack and ensure the availability and stability of the uWebSockets.js application. Remember to thoroughly test the implemented solutions.
