# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for unetworking/uwebsockets

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Connection Limits](./mitigation_strategies/implement_connection_limits.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Identify the maximum acceptable number of concurrent WebSocket connections** your server can handle.
    2.  **Configure `uwebsockets` to enforce limits using `maxPayload` and `maxBackpressure` options during `App` or `SSLApp` initialization.** These options indirectly influence connection limits by controlling resource allocation per connection and backpressure handling.
    3.  **Optionally implement custom connection counting and rejection logic within your `uwebsockets` application's `open` handler** for more direct control if needed beyond `maxPayload` and `maxBackpressure`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the server with excessive connection requests.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion - High Severity:** Reduces the risk of server resources being depleted by a large number of connections.

**Impact:**
    *   **DoS Mitigation - High Reduction:** Significantly reduces the impact of connection-based DoS attacks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion Mitigation - High Reduction:** Prevents resource exhaustion from excessive connections.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `maxPayload` and `maxBackpressure` are configured in the `uwebsockets` application setup.
**Missing Implementation:** Explicit connection rejection logic in the `open` handler based on a direct connection count is missing for more granular control beyond `uwebsockets`' built-in options.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Apply Rate Limiting for Messages](./mitigation_strategies/apply_rate_limiting_for_messages.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Define appropriate message rate limits** for your application.
    2.  **Implement rate limiting logic within your `uwebsockets` application's message handlers (`message` event).**  While `uwebsockets` doesn't provide built-in rate limiting, you must implement this logic in your application code that processes WebSocket messages received by `uwebsockets`.
    3.  **Use a rate limiting algorithm** (e.g., token bucket, leaky bucket) within your message handlers to track message rates per connection.
    4.  **Handle rate limit violations** in your message handlers. When a client exceeds the rate limit, reject or drop subsequent messages within your application logic.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Message Flooding DoS - High Severity:** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the server by sending a large volume of messages.
    *   **Application Logic Abuse - Medium Severity:** Reduces the risk of malicious clients abusing application logic by sending excessive messages.

**Impact:**
    *   **Message Flooding DoS Mitigation - High Reduction:** Effectively mitigates message flooding attacks.
    *   **Application Logic Abuse Mitigation - Medium Reduction:** Reduces the impact of abuse through excessive messaging.

**Currently Implemented:** Basic rate limiting is implemented using a simple token bucket algorithm for incoming messages on critical WebSocket endpoints within the application logic.
**Missing Implementation:** More sophisticated rate limiting algorithms and per-user/role rate limits are missing from the application logic built around `uwebsockets`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Timeout Management](./mitigation_strategies/connection_timeout_management.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Configure inactivity timeouts using `uwebsockets`' ping/pong mechanism.** Implement the `ping` and `pong` handlers in your `uwebsockets` application.
    2.  **Set a reasonable timeout for pong responses.** Within your `ping` handler, send a ping and expect a `pong` within a defined timeframe.
    3.  **Implement connection closure logic in your `pong` handler or a timeout mechanism.** If a `pong` is not received within the timeout, initiate connection closure using `ws.close()` within your `uwebsockets` application logic.
    4.  **Optionally implement handshake timeouts within your application logic** if needed beyond `uwebsockets`' default connection handling. This would involve tracking handshake duration and closing connections that take too long to establish.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Slowloris DoS - Medium Severity:** Mitigates slowloris-style attacks by timing out slow or incomplete handshake attempts (if custom handshake timeout is implemented).
    *   **Idle Connection Resource Exhaustion - Low Severity:** Prevents resource wastage by closing idle connections.
    *   **Hanging Connections - Low Severity:** Reduces the risk of connections hanging indefinitely.

**Impact:**
    *   **Slowloris DoS Mitigation - Medium Reduction:** Reduces the effectiveness of slowloris attacks (with custom handshake timeout).
    *   **Idle Connection Resource Management - Low Reduction:** Improves resource utilization by closing idle connections.
    *   **Hanging Connection Management - Low Reduction:** Enhances connection stability and resource cleanup.

**Currently Implemented:** Inactivity timeouts using the ping/pong mechanism are implemented with a default timeout within the `uwebsockets` application.
**Missing Implementation:** Custom handshake timeouts are not explicitly implemented. Timeout values for ping/pong might need adjustment and configuration options within the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure WebSocket Handshake Process](./mitigation_strategies/secure_websocket_handshake_process.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Enforce `wss://` for secure connections.** Configure your `uwebsockets` `SSLApp` to listen on `wss://` ports, ensuring TLS/SSL encryption.
    2.  **Implement Origin header validation in your `uwebsockets` `upgrade` handler.** Access the `Origin` header from the `sec-websocket-origin` property of the `req` object in the `upgrade` handler.
    3.  **Validate the `Origin` header against a whitelist of allowed origins** within your `upgrade` handler logic. Reject connections with invalid `Origin` headers using `res.close()`.
    4.  **Configure TLS/SSL options when creating `SSLApp` in `uwebsockets`.** Use strong ciphers and ensure up-to-date TLS versions are configured when setting up the `SSLApp`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks - High Severity:** `wss://` prevents eavesdropping and data manipulation by encrypting communication.
    *   **Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) - Medium Severity:** Origin header validation mitigates CSWSH attacks.
    *   **Eavesdropping - High Severity:** `wss://` protects sensitive data transmitted over WebSockets.

**Impact:**
    *   **MitM Attack Mitigation - High Reduction:** Effectively prevents MitM attacks.
    *   **CSWSH Mitigation - Medium Reduction:** Reduces the risk of CSWSH attacks.
    *   **Eavesdropping Prevention - High Reduction:** Ensures confidentiality of WebSocket communication.

**Currently Implemented:** `wss://` is enforced using `SSLApp`. TLS/SSL is configured.
**Missing Implementation:** Origin header validation in the `upgrade` handler is not consistently implemented across all WebSocket endpoints within the `uwebsockets` application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Message Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/message_size_limits.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Determine the maximum acceptable message size** for your application.
    2.  **Configure `uwebsockets` message size limits using the `maxPayload` option during `App` or `SSLApp` initialization.** Set `maxPayload` to the determined maximum message size in bytes.
    3.  **`uwebsockets` will automatically enforce this limit.** Connections sending messages exceeding `maxPayload` will be closed by `uwebsockets`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow - Medium Severity:** Prevents potential buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   **Memory Exhaustion - Medium Severity:** Reduces the risk of memory exhaustion from large messages.
    *   **Denial of Service (Resource Consumption) - Medium Severity:** Mitigates DoS attacks attempting to consume resources with large messages.

**Impact:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow Mitigation - Medium Reduction:** Reduces the risk of buffer overflow vulnerabilities.
    *   **Memory Exhaustion Mitigation - Medium Reduction:** Prevents memory exhaustion from large messages.
    *   **DoS Mitigation (Resource Consumption) - Medium Reduction:** Mitigates resource consumption DoS attacks.

**Currently Implemented:** `maxPayload` is configured in `uwebsockets` application setup.
**Missing Implementation:** The current `maxPayload` value might not be optimally tuned. Consider reviewing and adjusting `maxPayload` based on application needs and resource constraints.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Proper Handling of WebSocket Close Frames](./mitigation_strategies/proper_handling_of_websocket_close_frames.md)

**Description:**
    1.  **Implement `close` event handlers in your `uwebsockets` application.** Define handlers for the `ws.on('close', ...)` event for each WebSocket connection.
    2.  **Access close code and reason within the `close` handler.** The `close` handler in `uwebsockets` receives the `code` and `message` (reason) as arguments.
    3.  **Log close events, including the `code` and `message`, within your `close` handler.**
    4.  **Implement resource cleanup logic within your `close` handler.** Ensure resources associated with the connection are released when the `close` event is triggered in `uwebsockets`.
    5.  **Optionally validate close frame status codes within your `close` handler** to detect unexpected or suspicious closure reasons.

**Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Leaks - Low Severity:** Prevents resource leaks by ensuring proper cleanup when connections close.
    *   **Denial of Service (Indirect) - Low Severity:** Prevents resource exhaustion due to uncleaned resources, indirectly aiding DoS resilience.
    *   **Security Monitoring - Low Severity:** Provides information for security monitoring by logging close events.

**Impact:**
    *   **Resource Leak Mitigation - Low Reduction:** Reduces the risk of resource leaks.
    *   **DoS Resilience (Indirect) - Low Reduction:** Indirectly improves DoS resilience.
    *   **Security Monitoring Improvement - Low Reduction:** Enhances security monitoring capabilities.

**Currently Implemented:** Basic `close` event handlers are implemented for logging and basic resource cleanup within the `uwebsockets` application.
**Missing Implementation:** Validation of close frame status codes and more comprehensive resource cleanup logic within the `close` handlers in the `uwebsockets` application are missing.
