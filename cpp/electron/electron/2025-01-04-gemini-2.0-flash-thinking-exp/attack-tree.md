## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Insecure `nodeIntegration` (High-Risk Path & Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_insecure__nodeintegration___high-risk_path_&_critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** When the `nodeIntegration` option is enabled for a `BrowserWindow` displaying untrusted content (e.g., web pages, external data), the JavaScript code running within that renderer process gains direct access to Node.js APIs.
*   **How an Attacker Might Compromise:**
    *   **Access Node.js APIs Directly from Renderer:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the renderer process (e.g., through Cross-Site Scripting if context isolation is also disabled or poorly implemented).
    *   **Execute System Commands via `child_process`:** The attacker's script can use the `child_process` module to execute arbitrary commands on the user's operating system with the privileges of the application. This allows for a complete system compromise.
    *   **Access File System via `fs`:** The attacker can use the `fs` module to read, write, modify, or delete files on the user's system. This can lead to data theft, data corruption, or installation of malware.
    *   **Modify Application Behavior via `process`:** The attacker can manipulate the application's environment and behavior using the `process` module. This could involve altering environment variables, exiting the application, or injecting code into other parts of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Insecure Context Bridge (`contextBridge`) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_insecure_context_bridge___contextbridge____high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Even with `nodeIntegration: false`, the `contextBridge` API allows controlled communication between the renderer and main processes. However, vulnerabilities can arise if the functions exposed by the main process are not carefully designed and sanitized.
*   **How an Attacker Might Compromise:**
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Exposed Functions:** Attackers analyze the functions exposed by the main process through the `contextBridge`. If these functions lack proper input validation or have logical flaws, attackers can craft malicious input from the renderer process.
    *   **Trigger Unintended Actions in Main Process:** By exploiting vulnerabilities in the exposed functions, attackers can cause the main process (which typically has higher privileges) to perform actions that were not intended, such as accessing sensitive data, modifying application settings, or even executing system commands if the main process itself has vulnerabilities.
    *   **Leak Sensitive Information from Main Process:**  Attackers can manipulate the exposed functions to leak sensitive information that resides within the main process's scope. This could include API keys, user credentials, or other confidential data.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Native Modules (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_native_modules__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Electron applications can utilize native Node.js modules, which are written in languages like C or C++. These modules can have security vulnerabilities just like any other software.
*   **How an Attacker Might Compromise:**
    *   **Exploit Security Flaws in Native Code:** Attackers can identify and exploit known vulnerabilities (or discover new ones) in the native modules used by the application. This often involves memory corruption bugs like buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities.
    *   **Achieve Code Execution in Native Context:** Successfully exploiting a vulnerability in a native module allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application, directly within the native environment. This can lead to a complete system compromise or allow for low-level manipulation of system resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Insecure Update Mechanisms (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_insecure_update_mechanisms__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Electron applications often use auto-update mechanisms to deliver new versions to users. If this process is not secured, attackers can inject malicious updates.
*   **How an Attacker Might Compromise:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Update Server:** An attacker can intercept network traffic between the application and its update server. If the communication is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS with certificate pinning), the attacker can inject a malicious update package.
    *   **Serve Malicious Update Package:** The attacker replaces the legitimate update package with a compromised version containing malware or backdoors. When the application downloads and installs this malicious update, the attacker gains control of the user's system.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Update Verification Process:** Even if the update is delivered securely, vulnerabilities in how the application verifies the authenticity of the update can be exploited. For example, if signature checks are weak or can be bypassed, an attacker can distribute a malicious update that appears legitimate.
    *   **Bypass Signature Checks:** Attackers find ways to circumvent the signature verification process. This could involve exploiting flaws in the verification logic, obtaining the signing key (though highly unlikely), or tricking the application into accepting an unsigned or incorrectly signed package.
