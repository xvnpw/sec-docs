# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for electron/electron

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Node.js Integration in Renderer Processes](./mitigation_strategies/disable_node_js_integration_in_renderer_processes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  In your main process file (e.g., `main.js`), locate the `BrowserWindow` creation.
    2.  Within the `webPreferences` option of the `BrowserWindow` constructor, set `nodeIntegration: false`.
    3.  This prevents renderer processes from directly accessing Node.js APIs like `require`, `process`, etc.
    4.  Restart the application for changes to take effect.
    5.  Verify in renderer process console that `require` is undefined.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) via XSS in Renderer Process - Severity: High (If XSS allows Node.js API access, attacker gains full system control)
    *   Privilege Escalation from Renderer Process - Severity: High (Renderer process should have limited privileges, Node.js integration breaks this)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) via XSS in Renderer Process: High risk reduction - XSS in renderer is contained to renderer context, preventing direct system access.
    *   Privilege Escalation from Renderer Process: High risk reduction - Renderer process remains isolated, limiting potential damage from compromise.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Main process configuration file (`main.js`) - `webPreferences` are set with `nodeIntegration: false` for all user-facing `BrowserWindow` instances.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Implemented globally for all user-facing renderer processes. Review needed for any new `BrowserWindow` instances to ensure this setting is applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Context Isolation in Renderer Processes](./mitigation_strategies/enable_context_isolation_in_renderer_processes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  In your main process file (e.g., `main.js`), find the `BrowserWindow` creation.
    2.  Within the `webPreferences` option, set `contextIsolation: true`.
    3.  This isolates the renderer process's JavaScript context from the main process's context and Electron's internal Node.js environment.
    4.  Restart the application.
    5.  Verify in renderer process console that `window` object does not expose Node.js globals or main process scope directly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Accidental or Intentional Access to Node.js APIs from Renderer Process (even with `nodeIntegration: false`) - Severity: Medium (If not properly isolated, loopholes might exist)
    *   Exposure of Main Process Globals to Renderer Process - Severity: Medium (Accidental exposure of sensitive data from main process to renderer)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Accidental or Intentional Access to Node.js APIs from Renderer Process: Medium risk reduction - Strengthens isolation, reducing unintended access paths.
    *   Exposure of Main Process Globals to Renderer Process: Medium risk reduction - Prevents leakage of sensitive main process data to potentially compromised renderer.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Main process configuration file (`main.js`) - `webPreferences` include `contextIsolation: true` for all user-facing `BrowserWindow` instances.

*   **Missing Implementation:** N/A - Implemented globally for all user-facing renderer processes. Review needed for any new `BrowserWindow` instances to ensure this setting is applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize `contextBridge` for Secure Communication between Renderer and Main Processes](./mitigation_strategies/utilize__contextbridge__for_secure_communication_between_renderer_and_main_processes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Create a preload script file (e.g., `preload.js`).
    2.  In the preload script, use `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('api', { functionName: () => ipcRenderer.send('ipc-channel') })` to expose specific functions to the renderer. Define a minimal API.
    3.  In `BrowserWindow` `webPreferences`, set `preload: path.join(__dirname, 'preload.js')`.
    4.  In renderer process, access exposed functions via `window.api.functionName()`.
    5.  Handle `ipcMain.on('ipc-channel', ...)` in the main process to receive and process requests securely.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) - Severity: Medium (Uncontrolled IPC can lead to vulnerabilities)
    *   Over-exposure of Main Process Functionality to Renderer Process - Severity: Medium (Exposing too much main process logic increases attack surface)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Medium risk reduction - Enforces controlled, defined, and auditable communication channels.
    *   Over-exposure of Main Process Functionality to Renderer Process: Medium risk reduction - Limits attack surface by exposing only necessary and well-defined functions.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented for communication between main process and "Renderer Process A" for features like settings and updates. Preload script at `src/preload.js` used in "Renderer Process A" `BrowserWindow` config.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Not fully implemented for "Renderer Process B". "Renderer Process B" uses direct `ipcRenderer.send` and `ipcMain.on` without `contextBridge` API. Refactor "Renderer Process B" to use `contextBridge` for secure IPC.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Using the `remote` Module](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_using_the__remote__module.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all instances of `require('electron').remote` in renderer process code.
    2.  Replace `remote` calls with `contextBridge` and IPC for main process communication.
    3.  Define specific IPC messages and `contextBridge` APIs to replace `remote` functionality.
    4.  Test refactored code to ensure functionality and improved security.
    5.  Remove all `require('electron').remote` statements from renderer code.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Bypassing Security Boundaries between Renderer and Main Processes - Severity: High (Direct `remote` access weakens process isolation)
    *   Increased Attack Surface in Renderer Processes - Severity: Medium (Exposes main process objects directly to renderer)
    *   Potential for Privilege Escalation - Severity: Medium (Compromised renderer can directly manipulate main process objects)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Bypassing Security Boundaries between Renderer and Main Processes: High risk reduction - Enforces clear separation and controlled communication flow.
    *   Increased Attack Surface in Renderer Processes: Medium risk reduction - Reduces direct access points to main process functionality from renderer.
    *   Potential for Privilege Escalation: Medium risk reduction - Limits renderer's ability to directly manipulate main process objects, reducing escalation risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** `remote` module avoided in "Renderer Process A" and new development.

*   **Missing Implementation:** "Renderer Process B" still uses `remote` in legacy components for dialogs and app paths. Refactor "Renderer Process B" to use `contextBridge` and IPC instead of `remote`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Electron and Chromium Versions](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_electron_and_chromium_versions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Monitor Electron release notes and security advisories for new versions and security patches.
    2.  Establish a process for regular Electron updates (e.g., development cycle, security patching).
    3.  Test application after each Electron update for compatibility and regressions.
    4.  Automate Electron updates if possible (dependency tools, CI/CD).
    5.  Prioritize and promptly apply security updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Electron and Chromium - Severity: High (Exploitable vulnerabilities in outdated versions)
    *   Zero-day Exploits targeting Electron/Chromium - Severity: High (Staying updated reduces window of opportunity)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Known Vulnerabilities in Electron and Chromium: High risk reduction - Patches known flaws, reducing exploitability.
    *   Zero-day Exploits targeting Electron/Chromium: Medium risk reduction - Reduces exposure time to newly discovered vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Electron version updated manually every few months. Dependency updates checked regularly with `npm audit`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated Electron update process missing. Integrate Electron updates into CI/CD pipeline and establish more frequent update schedule, especially for security releases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Securely Handle Custom Protocols and Deep Links](./mitigation_strategies/securely_handle_custom_protocols_and_deep_links.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review custom protocol/deep link handling if implemented.
    2.  Validate and sanitize all data from custom protocol handlers/deep link parameters.
    3.  Avoid direct shell command execution or sensitive resource access based on protocol/deep link parameters without validation.
    4.  Use `protocol.handle` API for custom protocols, ensure sanitization in handler.
    5.  Test custom protocol/deep link handling for injection vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Command Injection via Custom Protocols/Deep Links - Severity: High (Malicious protocols/deep links can trigger command execution)
    *   Path Traversal via Custom Protocols/Deep Links - Severity: Medium (Accessing unauthorized file paths via manipulated protocols/deep links)
    *   Arbitrary File Access via Custom Protocols/Deep Links - Severity: Medium (Accessing sensitive files through protocol/deep link manipulation)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Command Injection via Custom Protocols/Deep Links: High risk reduction - Prevents command execution via malicious protocol/deep link input.
    *   Path Traversal via Custom Protocols/Deep Links: Medium risk reduction - Prevents unauthorized file system path access.
    *   Arbitrary File Access via Custom Protocols/Deep Links: Medium risk reduction - Limits access to sensitive files via protocol/deep link manipulation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Custom protocol handling for application updates using `protocol.handle`. Partial input validation for update URLs.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Input sanitization for custom protocol parameters needs strengthening to prevent injection attacks. Deep link handling not implemented yet, but mitigation should be considered for future implementation.
