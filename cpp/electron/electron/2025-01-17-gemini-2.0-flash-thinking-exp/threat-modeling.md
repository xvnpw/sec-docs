# Threat Model Analysis for electron/electron

## Threat: [Node.js API Exposure leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/node_js_api_exposure_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the main process or insecurely exposed Node.js APIs (provided by Electron's Node.js environment) to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine. This might involve crafting malicious IPC messages or exploiting flaws in how the main process handles external data or events.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, installation of malware, data exfiltration, denial of service.
*   **Affected Electron Component:** Main Process, specifically Electron's embedded Node.js runtime and any custom Node.js modules used within it.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Minimize the use of Node.js APIs in the main process.
    *   Carefully validate all input received by the main process, especially from renderer processes via Electron's IPC.
    *   Avoid using `eval()` or similar dynamic code execution functions within the Electron main process.
    *   Keep Electron's embedded Node.js and all dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
    *   Implement robust error handling to prevent information leaks from the Electron main process.

## Threat: [Insecure `remote` Module Usage for Privilege Escalation](./threats/insecure__remote__module_usage_for_privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could leverage Electron's `remote` module (if enabled) to access and manipulate objects or functions in the main process from a compromised renderer process. This allows them to execute privileged operations they wouldn't normally have access to.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution in the main process context, access to sensitive data handled by the main process.
*   **Affected Electron Component:** Electron's `remote` module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strongly consider disabling Electron's `remote` module entirely.**
    *   If `remote` is necessary, carefully restrict access to specific objects and methods exposed via `remote`.
    *   Validate all data passed through `remote` calls.
    *   Use Electron's `contextBridge` API for safer communication between renderer and main processes.
