## Attack Tree Path: [CN: Exploit Main Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/cn_exploit_main_process_vulnerabilities.md)

This is a critical node because the main process has full access to system resources and Node.js APIs. Successful exploitation can lead to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [HRP, CN: Exploit Vulnerable Node.js Modules](./attack_tree_paths/hrp__cn_exploit_vulnerable_node_js_modules.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identifying Outdated Dependencies:** Attackers scan the `package.json` file or use automated tools to identify outdated Node.js modules with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities:** Once a vulnerable module is identified, attackers leverage publicly available exploits or craft their own to trigger the vulnerability. This often involves sending crafted input to vulnerable functions within the module.
*   **Impact:** Can range from information disclosure to remote code execution within the main process.

## Attack Tree Path: [CN: Exploit Renderer Process Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/cn_exploit_renderer_process_vulnerabilities.md)

This is a critical node because while renderer processes are typically sandboxed, successful exploitation can lead to code execution within the renderer's context and potentially escalate to main process compromise if Node.js integration is enabled or context isolation is disabled.

## Attack Tree Path: [HRP, CN: Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_tree_paths/hrp__cn_exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Stored XSS:** Injecting malicious scripts into the application's data storage (e.g., database) which are then rendered in other users' browsers.
    *   **Reflected XSS:** Crafting malicious URLs or manipulating input fields to inject scripts that are immediately executed by the user's browser.
    *   **DOM-Based XSS:** Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) on the client-side to execute malicious scripts.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, and potentially further exploitation if Node.js integration is enabled.

## Attack Tree Path: [HRP, CN: Exploit Insecure Node.js Integration (if enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/hrp__cn_exploit_insecure_node_js_integration__if_enabled_.md)

This is a high-risk path and critical node because enabling Node.js integration in the renderer process bypasses the security sandbox, granting the renderer access to powerful Node.js APIs.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Access Restricted Node.js APIs:** Using `require()` or other Node.js functions to access sensitive file system locations, execute system commands, or interact with other system resources.
    *   **Execute Arbitrary Code via `eval()` or similar:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code that is then executed within the renderer's Node.js context using functions like `eval()`, `Function()`, or `require('vm').runInThisContext()`.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to complete system compromise from the renderer process.

## Attack Tree Path: [CN: Exploit Insecure Context Isolation (if disabled)](./attack_tree_paths/cn_exploit_insecure_context_isolation__if_disabled_.md)

This is a critical node because disabling context isolation allows the renderer process to directly access objects and functions in the main process, bypassing a crucial security boundary.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Access Main Process Objects and Functions:** Directly calling functions or accessing variables defined in the main process from the renderer, potentially triggering unintended actions or gaining access to sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to complete system compromise from the renderer process.

## Attack Tree Path: [CN: Exploit Build and Distribution Process](./attack_tree_paths/cn_exploit_build_and_distribution_process.md)

This is a critical node because compromising the build or distribution process allows attackers to inject malicious code into the application before it reaches users, affecting a large number of individuals.

## Attack Tree Path: [HRP, CN: Compromise Build Pipeline](./attack_tree_paths/hrp__cn_compromise_build_pipeline.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Inject Malicious Code During Build:** Gaining access to the build environment and modifying the source code or build scripts to include malicious functionality.
    *   **Replace Legitimate Dependencies with Malicious Ones:** Substituting legitimate npm packages or other dependencies with compromised versions that contain malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Results in a compromised application being built and distributed to users.

## Attack Tree Path: [HRP, CN: Compromise Update Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/hrp__cn_compromise_update_mechanism.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Update Server:** Intercepting update requests and serving malicious application updates to users.
    *   **Exploit Insecure Update Verification:** Bypassing signature checks or other verification mechanisms to deliver unsigned or maliciously signed updates.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to distribute malicious updates, potentially overwriting the legitimate application with a compromised version.

## Attack Tree Path: [HRP, CN: Exploit Developer Errors and Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/hrp__cn_exploit_developer_errors_and_misconfigurations.md)

This is a high-risk path and critical node because developer errors are a common source of vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure Defaults:** Relying on default Electron settings that are not secure, such as enabling Node.js integration in the renderer without proper security measures.
    *   **Exposing Sensitive Information:** Accidentally including API keys, secrets, or other sensitive data directly in the application code or package.
    *   **Improper Input Sanitization:** Failing to properly sanitize user input, leading to vulnerabilities like XSS or command injection in both the main and renderer processes.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to a wide range of vulnerabilities, from information disclosure to remote code execution.
