## High and Critical Electron-Specific Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the Electron framework.

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Electron Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Node.js Integration Exploitation (Renderer)** | An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the renderer process, leveraging Node.js APIs available due to Electron's integration. This allows arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. | Full system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, privilege escalation. | Renderer Process, `nodeIntegration` setting, `require()` function, Node.js modules accessible in the renderer. | **Critical** | - **Enable Context Isolation:** Isolates the renderer's JavaScript context from the Node.js environment. <br> - **Use `contextBridge` for Controlled Communication:** Expose only necessary and sanitized Node.js functionality to the renderer. <br> - **Disable `nodeIntegration` (if possible):**  Completely remove Node.js access from the renderer. <br> - **Regularly Audit and Update Dependencies:** Patch vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. <br> - **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Restrict the sources from which the renderer can load resources. |
| **Bypassing Context Isolation** | An attacker finds a vulnerability or misconfiguration within Electron's implementation that allows them to bypass the context isolation mechanism and gain access to the Node.js environment from the renderer process. | Full system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, privilege escalation. | `contextBridge` API, internal Electron mechanisms for isolation. | **Critical** | - **Thoroughly Review `contextBridge` Usage:** Ensure all exposed functions are secure and properly validate inputs. <br> - **Stay Updated with Electron Security Advisories:** Apply security patches promptly. <br> - **Consider Third-Party Security Audits:** Have experts review the implementation. |
| **Insecure `webview` Usage** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in external web content loaded within a `<webview>` tag. If Node.js integration is enabled within the `<webview>` (an Electron feature), this can lead to system-level compromise. | Potential for XSS attacks leading to RCE, information disclosure, or manipulation of the Electron application. | `<webview>` tag, `nodeintegration` attribute of `<webview>`, `sandbox` attribute of `<webview>`. | **High** | - **Disable Node.js Integration in `<webview>`:** Use `nodeintegration="false"`. <br> - **Enable `sandbox` Attribute:** Provides an additional layer of security. <br> - **Carefully Control Loaded URLs:** Restrict the URLs that can be loaded. <br> - **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) for `<webview>`:** Further restrict the capabilities of the loaded content. |
| **Insecure Protocol Handlers** | An attacker crafts a malicious URL using a custom protocol registered by the Electron application using Electron's API. If the handler for this protocol is not implemented securely, it can lead to unintended actions. | Potentially lead to RCE, file system access, or other malicious actions depending on the handler's functionality. | `app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient()`, `protocol` module. | **High** | - **Thoroughly Validate and Sanitize Input:** Treat any data received through protocol handlers as untrusted. <br> - **Avoid Direct Execution of Paths:** Implement secure logic for handling protocol requests. <br> - **Consider the Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant necessary permissions to the protocol handler. |
| **Exposed or Insecure IPC (Inter-Process Communication)** | An attacker who has compromised the renderer process sends malicious messages through Electron's IPC channels to the main process, potentially triggering privileged actions. | Privilege escalation, RCE in the main process, data manipulation. | `ipcMain`, `ipcRenderer` modules, specific IPC channel names. | **High** | - **Validate and Sanitize IPC Messages:** The main process should rigorously validate all data received from renderer processes. <br> - **Implement Authorization Checks:** Verify that the renderer process has the authority to request the action. <br> - **Minimize Exposed IPC Handlers:** Only expose necessary functionality through IPC. <br> - **Use Specific Channel Names:** Avoid generic channel names that could be easily guessed. |
| **Insecure Handling of Native Modules** | An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in native Node.js modules used by the application, which are integrated through Electron's capabilities. | RCE, denial of service, or other issues depending on the module's vulnerability. | `require()` function for native modules, `process.dlopen()`. | **High** | - **Regularly Update Native Modules:** Keep all native modules up-to-date with the latest security patches. <br> - **Source Native Modules from Trusted Sources:** Be cautious about using untrusted or unverified native modules. <br> - **Consider Security Audits of Native Modules:** Especially for critical or complex modules. |
| **Insecure File System Operations (Main Process)** | An attacker leverages vulnerabilities in how the main process, a Node.js environment provided by Electron, interacts with the file system to manipulate files or gain access to sensitive data. | Data breaches, data corruption, or even RCE if executable files are manipulated. | `fs` module, path manipulation functions. | **High** | - **Validate and Sanitize File Paths:** Never directly use user-provided input in file paths. <br> - **Use Absolute Paths:** Avoid relative paths where possible. <br> - **Implement Access Controls:** Restrict file system access to only necessary locations. <br> - **Avoid Executing Arbitrary Files:** Be extremely cautious about executing files based on external input. |
| **Insecure Update Mechanism** | An attacker compromises the application's update mechanism, a feature often implemented using Electron's `autoUpdater` module, and injects malicious updates. | Users unknowingly install a compromised version of the application through a fake update. | `autoUpdater` module, update server infrastructure. | **High** | - **Use HTTPS for Update Downloads:** Ensure secure communication. <br> - **Verify Update Signatures:** Cryptographically verify the authenticity and integrity of updates. <br> - **Consider Using a Secure Update Framework:** Leverage built-in Electron update mechanisms securely. |
