# Threat Model Analysis for electron/electron

## Threat: [Renderer Process Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Node.js Integration](./threats/renderer_process_remote_code_execution__rce__via_node_js_integration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in web content loaded within a renderer process.  If `nodeIntegration` is enabled, the attacker's JavaScript gains access to Node.js APIs. The attacker can then execute arbitrary code on the user's operating system, potentially with the privileges of the application. This could involve installing malware, stealing data, or taking control of the system. This is the *classic* Electron RCE.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. Data theft, malware installation, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within a network.
*   **Affected Component:** `webPreferences.nodeIntegration` setting within a `BrowserWindow` or `BrowserView`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable `nodeIntegration`:** Set `nodeIntegration: false` in the `webPreferences` of all `BrowserWindow` and `BrowserView` instances. This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Enable `contextIsolation`:** Set `contextIsolation: true` (default in newer Electron versions). This isolates the preload script's context from the renderer's main world.
    *   **Use a `preload` script:** Expose *only* necessary, carefully vetted APIs to the renderer via `contextBridge`. Avoid exposing entire modules or raw Node.js functions.
    *   **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a restrictive CSP to limit the sources from which the renderer can load resources.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Unsafe IPC](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_unsafe_ipc.md)

*   **Description:** A compromised renderer process sends crafted messages to the main process via `ipcRenderer`. The main process, without proper validation, handles these messages and performs privileged actions on behalf of the attacker. This could involve writing to protected files, accessing system resources, or executing system commands.
*   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, allowing the attacker to perform actions they shouldn't be able to. Data modification, system configuration changes, and potential RCE if the main process executes attacker-controlled code.
*   **Affected Component:** `ipcMain` and `ipcRenderer` modules. Specifically, the handlers defined in `ipcMain.on`, `ipcMain.handle`, and the corresponding calls in `ipcRenderer.send`, `ipcRenderer.invoke`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate *all* data received via IPC on *both* the renderer and main process sides. Use schema validation and type checking.
    *   **Use Specific Channel Names:** Avoid generic channel names. Use descriptive names that clearly indicate the purpose of the message.
    *   **Limit Exposed Functionality:** Expose only the *minimum* necessary functionality from the main process to the renderer.
    *   **Prefer `handle`/`invoke`:** Use the `handle` and `invoke` methods for a more structured request/response pattern.
    *   **Avoid Synchronous IPC:** Use asynchronous IPC whenever possible.

## Threat: [Loading Malicious Content in `BrowserView` (with insufficient security)](./threats/loading_malicious_content_in__browserview___with_insufficient_security_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker tricks the application into loading a malicious website or web content within a `BrowserView`. If security precautions (like disabling `nodeIntegration`) are not in place, this is equivalent to a compromised renderer process with Node.js access.
*   **Impact:** Similar to renderer process RCE, depending on the `webPreferences` of the `BrowserView`.  Potential for complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** `BrowserView` instances.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Treat `BrowserView` like a Renderer:** Apply *all* the same mitigations as for a regular renderer process: disable `nodeIntegration`, enable `contextIsolation`, use a `preload` script, implement a strict CSP, and enable the sandbox (`sandbox: true`).
    *   **Strict URL Validation:** *Strictly* validate the URLs being loaded to ensure they are from trusted sources. Use allowlists.

## Threat: [Unsafe use of `shell.openExternal` leading to Command Injection](./threats/unsafe_use_of__shell_openexternal__leading_to_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses `shell.openExternal` to open URLs. If the URL is attacker-controlled (e.g., through user input or a compromised website loaded in a renderer), and contains shell metacharacters, this can lead to arbitrary command execution.  For example, an attacker might provide a URL like `https://example.com; rm -rf /`.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the user's system, potentially with the privileges of the Electron application.
*   **Affected Component:** `shell.openExternal` function.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Validate URLs:** *Strictly* validate all URLs passed to `shell.openExternal` to ensure they are safe and expected. Use an allowlist of permitted URL schemes (e.g., `https:`, `mailto:`).  Sanitize the URL to remove any potentially dangerous characters.
    *   **Avoid using with file paths:** Do *not* use `shell.openExternal` with file paths that are derived from user input or untrusted sources.
    * **Consider Alternatives:** If you need to open a file, consider using Electron's `shell.openPath` (which is safer if used correctly) or reading the file content within your application.

## Threat: [Sandbox Escape (Exploiting Chromium or OS Vulnerabilities)](./threats/sandbox_escape__exploiting_chromium_or_os_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** Even with the Chromium sandbox enabled (`sandbox: true`), an attacker might find a zero-day vulnerability in the sandbox itself, in Chromium's rendering engine (Blink), or in the underlying operating system that allows them to escape the sandbox's restrictions and gain full system access. This is less likely than the other threats but extremely serious.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, similar to RCE without the sandbox.
*   **Affected Component:** Chromium sandbox (`webPreferences.sandbox`), underlying Chromium engine, and the operating system.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (but lower probability than direct RCE)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable the Sandbox:** Set `sandbox: true` in `webPreferences`. This is the *primary* mitigation, even though it's not foolproof against zero-days.
    *   **Keep Electron Updated:** Regularly update Electron to the latest version to get the latest security patches for Chromium, the sandbox, and Node.js. This is *crucial* for mitigating zero-day vulnerabilities.
    *   **Minimize Privileges:** Run the Electron application with the least necessary privileges. Avoid running as administrator/root.
