## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Main Process Vulnerabilities - [[Node.js Integration]] - [[Direct Node.js API Access]]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_main_process_vulnerabilities_-___node_js_integration___-___direct_node_js_api_access__.md)

**Description:** If `nodeIntegration` is inadvertently enabled in the main process (a significant misconfiguration), an attacker who gains control of the main process (e.g., through another vulnerability) has direct and unrestricted access to Node.js APIs.
        
**Attack Vector:** The attacker can directly execute Node.js code, including functions like `child_process.exec()` to run arbitrary system commands, `fs` to manipulate files, and `net` to establish network connections. This provides complete control over the system.
        
**Mitigation:**
*   Ensure `nodeIntegration` is *always* disabled in the main process. This should be the default, but double-check.
*   If Node.js functionality is absolutely required in the main process, use a tightly controlled, well-audited, and minimal set of APIs exposed through a secure IPC mechanism.  Avoid direct access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Main Process Vulnerabilities - [[IPC Abuse]] - [[Unsafe IPC Message Handling]]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_main_process_vulnerabilities_-___ipc_abuse___-___unsafe_ipc_message_handling__.md)

**Description:** Inter-Process Communication (IPC) is used for communication between the main and renderer processes. If the main process doesn't properly validate or sanitize messages received from the renderer, an attacker can craft malicious messages to trigger unintended actions.
        
**Attack Vector:** The attacker sends specially crafted IPC messages to the main process. These messages might contain:
    *   Invalid or unexpected data types.
    *   Excessively long strings (potential buffer overflows).
    *   File paths or URLs that point to malicious resources.
    *   Code snippets that are executed by the main process (if the handler uses `eval` or similar functions on untrusted input).
        
**Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate *every* piece of data received via IPC. Check data types, lengths, and expected values.
    *   **Sender Verification:** Verify the origin of each IPC message. Ensure it's coming from a legitimate renderer process.
    *   **Sanitization:** Sanitize all input before using it, especially if it's used in file system operations, network requests, or system calls.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Expose only the *absolute minimum* necessary functionality through IPC.
    *   **Avoid `eval` and similar functions:** Never execute code based on untrusted input received via IPC.
    *   **Use a Request/Response Pattern:** Structure IPC interactions as request/response pairs to ensure the main process only acts on validated requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Exploit Renderer Process Vulnerabilities]] - [[XSS + Node.js Integration]] - [[Exploit XSS to gain Node.js access]] - [[Leverage Node.js Integration]]](./attack_tree_paths/__exploit_renderer_process_vulnerabilities___-___xss_+_node_js_integration___-___exploit_xss_to_gain_68e2324b.md)

**Description:** This is the most dangerous combination. If `nodeIntegration` is enabled in the renderer process (a *critical* security misconfiguration) *and* the renderer process is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), an attacker can inject JavaScript code that directly uses Node.js APIs.
        
**Attack Vector:**
    1.  **XSS:** The attacker finds a way to inject malicious JavaScript code into the renderer process. This could be through:
        *   Unvalidated user input displayed on the page.
        *   Reflected XSS (injecting code through URL parameters).
        *   Stored XSS (injecting code into a database that's later displayed).
        *   DOM-based XSS (manipulating the DOM to execute malicious code).
    2.  **Node.js Access:** Because `nodeIntegration` is (incorrectly) enabled, the injected JavaScript code has direct access to Node.js APIs.
    3.  **RCE:** The attacker's JavaScript code uses Node.js functions like `require('child_process').exec(...)` to execute arbitrary system commands, achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        
**Mitigation:**
    *   **`nodeIntegration: false`:** This is the *primary* and *most crucial* mitigation.  `nodeIntegration` must be disabled in the renderer process. This is the default setting, but it *must* be explicitly enforced.
    *   **Prevent XSS:** Implement robust XSS prevention techniques:
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate all user input on the server-side (and client-side for usability, but *never* rely solely on client-side validation).
        *   **Output Encoding:** Properly encode all output displayed in the renderer process to prevent injected scripts from being executed. Use context-specific encoding (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.  While CSP can be bypassed, it adds a significant layer of defense.
        *   **Sanitize HTML:** If you need to allow users to input HTML, use a robust HTML sanitizer to remove any potentially malicious tags or attributes.
    *   **Context Isolation:** Ensure `contextIsolation: true` is enabled. This helps isolate the renderer process even further.
