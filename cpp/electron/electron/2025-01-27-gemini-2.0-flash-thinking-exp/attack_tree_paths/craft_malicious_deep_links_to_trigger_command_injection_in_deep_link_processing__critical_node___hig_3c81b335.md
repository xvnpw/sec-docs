### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Craft malicious deep links to Trigger command injection in deep link processing

#### 4.1. Understanding Deep Links in Electron

Electron applications, like web applications, can register to handle specific protocols or deep links. This allows external applications or web pages to launch the Electron application and pass data to it.

*   **Protocol Handlers:** Electron allows registering custom protocols (e.g., `myapp://`) using `app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient()`. When a URL with this protocol is opened, the Electron application is launched (if not already running) and the URL is passed as an argument to the application.
*   **`app.on('open-url')` Event:** In the Main process, the `app.on('open-url')` event is emitted when the application is opened with a URL using a registered protocol. This event handler is the primary place where deep link URLs are processed.
*   **URL Parsing:**  The URL received in the `open-url` event handler needs to be parsed to extract relevant information, such as parameters or path segments. This parsing is often done using standard URL parsing libraries or manual string manipulation.

#### 4.2. Vulnerability Description: Command Injection in Deep Link Processing

The command injection vulnerability arises when the Electron application's Main process **insecurely processes the data extracted from deep links and uses it to construct and execute shell commands.**

This typically happens when:

1.  **Unvalidated Input:** The application extracts parameters or path segments from the deep link URL *without proper validation or sanitization*.
2.  **Dynamic Command Construction:** This unvalidated input is then directly or indirectly used to build a shell command string.
3.  **Command Execution:** The constructed command string is executed using functions like `child_process.exec`, `child_process.spawn`, or similar Node.js APIs that execute shell commands.

**Example Scenario (Vulnerable Code - Conceptual):**

```javascript
const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
const { exec } = require('child_process');

let mainWindow;

app.on('ready', () => {
  mainWindow = new BrowserWindow({ width: 800, height: 600 });
  mainWindow.loadFile('index.html');
});

app.on('open-url', (event, url) => {
  event.preventDefault(); // Prevent default handling

  const parsedUrl = new URL(url);
  const action = parsedUrl.pathname.substring(1); // Extract action from path, e.g., /update
  const param = parsedUrl.searchParams.get('file'); // Get 'file' parameter

  if (action === 'update' && param) {
    // Vulnerable code: Directly using user-provided parameter in command
    const command = `update_script.sh ${param}`;
    exec(command, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
      if (error) {
        console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
        return;
      }
      console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
      console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
      // Potentially display output to the user (further risk)
    });
  } else {
    console.log('Unknown deep link action or missing parameter.');
  }
});

app.setAsDefaultProtocolClient('myapp');
```

In this vulnerable example:

*   The application registers the `myapp://` protocol.
*   When a deep link like `myapp://update?file=myfile.txt` is opened, the `open-url` event handler is triggered.
*   The code extracts the `file` parameter from the URL.
*   **Critically, it directly uses the `file` parameter in the `exec` command without any validation.**

#### 4.3. Exploitation Path: Crafting Malicious Deep Links

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious deep link that, when processed by the vulnerable Electron application, executes arbitrary commands on the user's system.

**Steps for Exploitation:**

1.  **Identify Vulnerable Deep Link Handling:** The attacker needs to identify if the Electron application handles deep links and how it processes the URL parameters in the Main process. This might involve reverse engineering or analyzing application documentation (if available).
2.  **Determine Injection Point:** The attacker needs to pinpoint which part of the deep link URL (e.g., path, query parameters) is used to construct the command. In the example above, it's the `file` parameter.
3.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a deep link URL containing a malicious payload within the identified injection point. This payload will be designed to be interpreted as shell commands when executed by the vulnerable application.

    **Example Malicious Deep Link:**

    Using the vulnerable example above, an attacker could craft a deep link like:

    ```
    myapp://update?file=$(whoami)&
    ```

    or

    ```
    myapp://update?file=myfile.txt; rm -rf /tmp/* &
    ```

    *   **`$(whoami)`:**  This payload, when executed in a shell, will execute the `whoami` command and potentially inject its output into the command string.
    *   **`; rm -rf /tmp/* &`:** This payload attempts to execute two commands: first, process `myfile.txt` (potentially harmless), and then, using command chaining (`;`), execute `rm -rf /tmp/*` in the background (`&`), which is a destructive command that deletes all files in the `/tmp` directory.

4.  **Delivery of Malicious Deep Link:** The attacker needs to deliver this malicious deep link to the target user. This can be done through various methods:

    *   **Website Links:** Embedding the deep link in a website. Clicking the link will attempt to open the application.
    *   **Email/Messaging:** Sending the deep link via email or messaging platforms.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking the user into clicking the malicious deep link.
    *   **Malicious Applications:** Another application could programmatically trigger the deep link.

5.  **Execution and System Compromise:** When the user clicks or opens the malicious deep link, the Electron application is launched (or brought to the foreground). The `open-url` event handler is triggered, and the vulnerable code processes the malicious payload, leading to command execution.

#### 4.4. Impact of Successful Exploitation

Successful command injection can have severe consequences, potentially leading to complete system compromise:

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the user's system with the privileges of the Electron application process.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can steal sensitive data from the user's system.
*   **Malware Installation:** Attackers can download and install malware, including ransomware, spyware, or botnet agents.
*   **System Manipulation:** Attackers can modify system settings, create new user accounts, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Denial of Service:** Attackers could potentially crash the application or the entire system.
*   **Lateral Movement:** In networked environments, compromised systems can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.

**Severity:** This vulnerability is considered **CRITICAL** and **HIGH-RISK** because it allows for remote code execution, potentially leading to full system compromise with minimal user interaction (just clicking a link).

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

To prevent command injection vulnerabilities in deep link processing, developers should implement the following mitigation strategies:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Strictly validate all input** received from deep links.
    *   **Sanitize input** to remove or escape potentially harmful characters or command sequences.
    *   **Use whitelists** to allow only expected and safe characters or patterns in deep link parameters.
    *   **Avoid directly using user-provided input in shell commands.**

2.  **Avoid `child_process.exec` and Favor `child_process.spawn` (with arguments array):**
    *   `child_process.exec` executes a command in a shell, making it vulnerable to shell injection.
    *   `child_process.spawn` (and similar functions with arguments array) allows passing command arguments as separate array elements, preventing shell interpretation and reducing the risk of injection.

    **Example (Mitigated Code - Conceptual):**

    ```javascript
    const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron');
    const { spawn } = require('child_process'); // Use spawn instead of exec

    // ... (rest of the app setup) ...

    app.on('open-url', (event, url) => {
      event.preventDefault();

      const parsedUrl = new URL(url);
      const action = parsedUrl.pathname.substring(1);
      const filename = parsedUrl.searchParams.get('file');

      if (action === 'update' && filename) {
        // Input Validation and Sanitization
        const safeFilename = filename.replace(/[^a-zA-Z0-9._-]/g, ''); // Whitelist allowed characters

        if (safeFilename !== filename) {
          console.warn("Potentially unsafe characters removed from filename.");
        }

        // Use spawn with arguments array - safer command execution
        const command = 'update_script.sh';
        const args = [safeFilename]; // Pass filename as a separate argument

        const child = spawn(command, args);

        child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
          console.log(`stdout: ${data}`);
        });

        child.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
          console.error(`stderr: ${data}`);
        });

        child.on('close', (code) => {
          console.log(`child process exited with code ${code}`);
        });

      } else {
        console.log('Unknown deep link action or missing parameter.');
      }
    });
    ```

    In this mitigated example:

    *   **Input Sanitization:** The `filename` is sanitized using a regular expression to allow only alphanumeric characters, dots, underscores, and hyphens. Any other characters are removed.
    *   **`spawn` with arguments array:** `child_process.spawn` is used, and the `safeFilename` is passed as a separate argument in the `args` array, preventing shell injection.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   Run the Electron application with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running the Main process as root or with elevated privileges if possible. This limits the impact of command injection.

4.  **Secure API Usage:**
    *   If possible, avoid executing shell commands altogether. Explore alternative APIs or Node.js modules that can achieve the desired functionality without relying on shell execution.
    *   If shell commands are absolutely necessary, carefully design the command structure and minimize user-controlled input.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on deep link handling and command execution paths.
    *   Use static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.

6.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While CSP primarily targets Renderer processes, a well-configured CSP can indirectly help by limiting the application's overall attack surface and potentially preventing malicious scripts injected via other vulnerabilities from being executed.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Craft malicious deep links to Trigger command injection in deep link processing" attack path represents a critical security risk for Electron applications. Insecure handling of deep link parameters can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system, leading to severe consequences.

By understanding the vulnerability, following secure coding practices, and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of command injection attacks via deep links and build more secure Electron applications. **Prioritizing input validation, using safer command execution methods, and adhering to the principle of least privilege are crucial steps in securing deep link handling in Electron applications.** It is imperative to educate the development team about this attack vector and ensure that secure deep link processing is a core part of the application's security posture.
