# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for electron/electron

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Node.js Integration in Renderer Processes](./mitigation_strategies/disable_node_js_integration_in_renderer_processes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  In your main process code (e.g., `main.js`), when creating `BrowserWindow` instances, access the `webPreferences` property in the constructor options.
    2.  Set `nodeIntegration: false` within the `webPreferences` object. This prevents renderer processes from directly accessing Node.js APIs.
    3.  Apply this setting to all `BrowserWindow` instances, especially those loading external or potentially untrusted web content.
    4.  Verify the change by attempting to use Node.js modules (like `require('fs')`) in the renderer's developer console; it should fail.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Renderer Process (High Severity) - Malicious JavaScript in a renderer can directly execute arbitrary code on the user's system through Node.js APIs if integration is enabled.
*   **Impact:**  Drastically reduces the risk of RCE originating from compromised renderer processes by eliminating direct access to Node.js functionalities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where, e.g., "Yes, implemented in all BrowserWindow instances in `main.js`."] or [Specify if not implemented and why, e.g., "No, not currently implemented due to legacy code dependencies that rely on Node.js integration in renderers. We are working on refactoring these dependencies."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing, e.g., "N/A - Implemented in all relevant areas."] or [Specify missing areas, e.g., "Missing in the 'settings' BrowserWindow which currently has `nodeIntegration: true` for legacy reasons. Needs to be refactored."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Context Isolation](./mitigation_strategies/enable_context_isolation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  In your main process code, within the `webPreferences` of your `BrowserWindow` constructor, set `contextIsolation: true`.
    2.  Ensure this is used in conjunction with `nodeIntegration: false` for optimal security.
    3.  Context isolation creates a separate JavaScript environment for the renderer, preventing direct access to the Electron/Node.js environment, even if `nodeIntegration` is somehow bypassed or mistakenly enabled.
    4.  Verify isolation by trying to access main process globals from the renderer's console; access should be restricted.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Renderer Process Context Pollution (Medium Severity) - Prevents unintended or malicious modification of the renderer's JavaScript context, which could lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   Bypassing Node.js Integration Disablement (Medium Severity) - Makes it significantly harder to circumvent `nodeIntegration: false` through context manipulation.
*   **Impact:**  Enhances renderer process security by creating a strong isolation barrier. Reduces risks from context pollution and potential bypasses of `nodeIntegration` restrictions.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where, e.g., "Yes, implemented in all BrowserWindow instances in `main.js`."] or [Specify if not implemented and why, e.g., "No, not currently implemented due to potential compatibility issues with older libraries. We are testing compatibility and planning implementation."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing, e.g., "N/A - Implemented in all relevant areas."] or [Specify missing areas, e.g., "Missing in the 'help' BrowserWindow which was created before context isolation was mandated. Needs to be updated."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use `contextBridge` for Secure Communication](./mitigation_strategies/use__contextbridge__for_secure_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Create a preload script (e.g., `preload.js`) associated with your `BrowserWindow` via the `preload` option in `webPreferences`.
    2.  In the preload script, use the `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld('api', { ... })` API to define a secure interface.
    3.  Within this interface, expose only necessary functions that use `ipcRenderer.invoke` or `ipcRenderer.send` to communicate with the main process for specific Node.js operations.
    4.  In the main process, handle `ipcMain.handle` (for `invoke`) or `ipcMain.on` (for `send`) events to securely execute Node.js operations.
    5.  Access the exposed API in the renderer process through `window.api` (or the name you chose).
    6.  Keep the exposed API minimal, only providing essential functionalities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Uncontrolled Node.js API Exposure (High Severity) - Prevents direct, unrestricted access to Node.js APIs from the renderer, limiting the attack surface.
    *   Renderer-Side RCE via Node.js (High Severity) - Reduces RCE risk by controlling and sanitizing interactions with Node.js from the renderer through a defined API.
*   **Impact:**  Significantly reduces RCE and other vulnerabilities by establishing a controlled and secure communication channel between renderer and main processes. Minimizes the attack surface by exposing only essential functionalities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where, e.g., "Yes, implemented for file system access and system information retrieval in the main application window using `preload.js` and `contextBridge`."] or [Specify if not implemented and why, e.g., "Partially implemented. We use `ipcRenderer.send` directly in some renderers for simple tasks, which is less secure. We need to migrate these to `contextBridge`."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing, e.g., "N/A - Implemented where Node.js access is required."] or [Specify missing areas, e.g., "Missing in the 'developer tools' window which still uses direct `ipcRenderer.send` for some functionalities. Needs to be refactored to use `contextBridge`."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Exposed Node.js APIs](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_exposed_node_js_apis.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Regularly review the API surface exposed through `contextBridge` in all preload scripts.
    2.  Identify and remove any API functions that are not absolutely necessary for the renderer's functionality.
    3.  For each exposed API function, carefully assess its security implications and potential for misuse.
    4.  Implement strict input validation and sanitization in the main process handlers for all exposed API functions to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    5.  Establish a process for periodic audits of the exposed API surface as the application evolves.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Increased Attack Surface (Medium Severity) - Reduces the overall attack surface by limiting the number of potential entry points for exploits.
    *   Vulnerability Exploitation via Unnecessary APIs (Medium to High Severity) - Minimizes the risk of vulnerabilities being exploited through less critical or redundant API functions.
*   **Impact:**  Reduces overall risk by minimizing the attack surface. Makes it more difficult for attackers to find and exploit vulnerabilities through exposed Node.js functionalities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where, e.g., "Partially implemented. We have reviewed the APIs once, but need to establish a regular review process."] or [Specify if not implemented and why, e.g., "No, not currently implemented. We haven't performed a dedicated review of exposed APIs yet."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing, e.g., "Needs a regular scheduled review process for exposed APIs."] or [Specify missing areas, e.g., "Missing a formal review process and documentation of the exposed API surface."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Electron](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_electron.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Monitor Electron release notes and security advisories on the official Electron website (electronjs.org/releases, electronjs.org/blog/security).
    2.  Utilize dependency management tools (npm, yarn) to update the `electron` dependency in your project to the latest stable version.
    3.  Thoroughly test your application after each Electron update to ensure compatibility and identify any breaking changes introduced by the update.
    4.  Establish a schedule for regular Electron updates (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to maintain up-to-date security patches.
    5.  Consider automation for checking and applying Electron updates to streamline the process.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Chromium/Electron Vulnerabilities (High Severity) - Protects against publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in Chromium and Electron that are addressed in newer versions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Validate Input in Protocol Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_validate_input_in_protocol_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all custom protocol handlers registered in your Electron application using `protocol.register*Protocol` APIs.
    2.  For each handler, carefully examine how URL parameters and data are extracted and processed within the handler function.
    3.  Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data received through protocol handlers to prevent injection attacks.
    4.  Use appropriate escaping techniques when constructing URLs or commands based on protocol handler input to avoid command injection or path traversal vulnerabilities.
    5.  Avoid directly executing shell commands or accessing sensitive resources based on unsanitized protocol handler input.

    *   Protocol Handler Injection Attacks (Medium to High Severity) - Prevents injection attacks through custom protocol handlers, such as command injection or path traversal, by sanitizing and validating input.
    *   Data Exposure via Protocol Handlers (Medium Severity) - Protects against unintended data exposure or manipulation due to insecure processing of protocol handler input.
*   **Impact:**  Significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks and data breaches through custom protocol handlers. Ensures secure processing of input within protocol handlers.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where, e.g., "Yes, input sanitization is implemented in our custom protocol handler for 'myapp://' links in `main.js`."] or [Specify if not implemented and why, e.g., "Partially implemented. We have basic validation, but need to strengthen sanitization and escaping in the protocol handler."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing, e.g., "N/A - Implemented with input sanitization and validation."] or [Specify missing areas, e.g., "Needs more rigorous input sanitization and escaping in the 'myapp://' protocol handler, especially for file path parameters."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `shell.openExternal` with Untrusted URLs](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__shell_openexternal__with_untrusted_urls.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review all instances in your codebase where the Electron API `shell.openExternal` is used.
    2.  Identify the sources of URLs being passed to `shell.openExternal`.
    3.  If URLs are user-provided or originate from untrusted sources, implement strict validation and sanitization *before* using `shell.openExternal`.
    4.  Consider using a whitelist of allowed domains for external URLs and only permit opening URLs that match this whitelist.
    5.  Ideally, avoid using `shell.openExternal` for user-provided URLs altogether. Explore alternative methods for handling external links, such as displaying them within the application or using a controlled in-app browser.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Arbitrary Command Execution via `shell.openExternal` (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from executing arbitrary commands or opening malicious websites by manipulating URLs passed to the `shell.openExternal` Electron API.
    *   Phishing and Social Engineering Attacks (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of users being tricked into visiting phishing websites or becoming victims of social engineering attacks through malicious URLs opened by the application via `shell.openExternal`.
*   **Impact:**  Significantly reduces the risk of command execution and phishing attacks originating from misuse of `shell.openExternal`. Limits the potential for abuse of this Electron API with untrusted URLs.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where, e.g., "Yes, we have implemented a whitelist of allowed domains for `shell.openExternal` in `utils.js`."] or [Specify if not implemented and why, e.g., "Partially implemented. We have some validation, but not a comprehensive whitelist for all `shell.openExternal` usages."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing, e.g., "N/A - Implemented with URL validation and domain whitelisting."] or [Specify missing areas, e.g., "Needs a more comprehensive whitelist of allowed domains for `shell.openExternal` and stricter validation for user-provided URLs."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom Protocol Registration](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_protocol_registration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When registering custom protocols using Electron's `protocol.register*Protocol` APIs, carefully consider the security implications.
    2.  Ensure the chosen protocol name is unique and not easily guessable or susceptible to hijacking by other applications.
    3.  Implement robust error handling and security checks within the protocol handler function registered with Electron.
    4.  Avoid registering overly permissive protocols that could be abused by malicious applications to interact with your application in unintended ways.
    5.  Document the registered custom protocols and their security considerations for developers to ensure ongoing secure maintenance.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Protocol Hijacking (Medium Severity) - Prevents malicious applications from hijacking or interfering with your application's custom protocol handlers registered through Electron.
    *   Abuse of Custom Protocols (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of custom protocols being abused for unintended or malicious purposes by ensuring secure registration and handling within Electron.
*   **Impact:**  Reduces the risk of protocol hijacking and abuse specific to Electron's custom protocol handling mechanism. Ensures secure registration and handling of custom protocols.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where, e.g., "Yes, we have chosen a unique and less guessable protocol name and implemented error handling in the handler registration in `main.js`."] or [Specify if not implemented and why, e.g., "No, not explicitly considered during protocol registration. We used a simple protocol name and basic handler."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing, e.g., "N/A - Implemented with secure protocol name and handler considerations."] or [Specify missing areas, e.g., "Needs a review of the custom protocol registration to ensure the protocol name is sufficiently unique and the handler is robust against potential abuse."]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement a Strict Content Security Policy (CSP)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_a_strict_content_security_policy__csp_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define a Content Security Policy (CSP) specifically tailored for your Electron application to restrict resource loading in renderer processes.
    2.  Start with a strict CSP baseline, such as `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self'; font-src 'self';` to minimize allowed sources.
    3.  Implement the CSP using a `<meta>` tag in your HTML files loaded in `BrowserWindow` instances or by setting the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header if your application serves web content.
    4.  Thoroughly test your application with the CSP enabled to identify any violations and ensure functionality is not broken.
    5.  Gradually refine the CSP to allow only necessary resources while maintaining a restrictive policy to maximize security benefits within the Electron environment.
    6.  Regularly review and update the CSP as your application evolves and resource requirements change.
    7.  Utilize CSP reporting mechanisms to monitor for policy violations and detect potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attempts within your Electron application.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity) - Significantly mitigates XSS vulnerabilities in Electron renderers by restricting the sources from which executable code and other resources can be loaded.
    *   Data Injection Attacks (Medium Severity) - Reduces the potential impact of data injection attacks by limiting the capabilities of injected scripts within the CSP framework in Electron.
*   **Impact:**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks in Electron applications. Provides a strong defense-in-depth layer against malicious scripts injected into renderer processes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify if implemented and where, e.g., "Yes, a strict CSP is implemented using a `<meta>` tag in the main `index.html` file."] or [Specify if not implemented and why, e.g., "No, not currently implemented due to concerns about compatibility with third-party libraries and potential breakage. We are investigating CSP implementation."]
*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it's missing, e.g., "N/A - Implemented in the main HTML file."] or [Specify missing areas, e.g., "Needs to be implemented in all HTML files loaded in BrowserWindow instances and potentially refined to allow necessary third-party resources while maintaining strictness."]
