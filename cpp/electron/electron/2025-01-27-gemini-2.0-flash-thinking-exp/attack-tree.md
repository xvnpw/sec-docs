## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Electron Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_electron_application__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal of the attacker, aiming to gain control over the Electron application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Electron Framework Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_electron_framework_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities inherent in the Electron framework itself, focusing on areas where Electron's design introduces unique risks compared to standard web applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Node.js Integration Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_node_js_integration_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

This is a major high-risk path. Electron's ability to integrate Node.js directly into the Renderer process, if not properly secured, creates significant attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure `nodeIntegration` Enabled in Renderer [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure__nodeintegration__enabled_in_renderer__critical_node_.md)

Enabling `nodeIntegration: true` in the Renderer process is a critical misconfiguration. It grants the Renderer process full access to Node.js APIs, effectively bypassing the security sandbox of Chromium.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Node.js APIs from Renderer [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_node_js_apis_from_renderer__critical_node_.md)

Once `nodeIntegration` is enabled and the Renderer process is compromised (e.g., via XSS or Chromium vulnerability), attackers can directly use Node.js APIs from the Renderer. This allows for actions like:
*   Executing arbitrary code on the underlying system using `child_process`.
*   Accessing and manipulating the file system using `fs`.
*   Requiring and using any Node.js module.

## Attack Tree Path: [Full System Compromise from Renderer Process [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/full_system_compromise_from_renderer_process__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Successful exploitation of Node.js APIs from a compromised Renderer process with `nodeIntegration` enabled leads to full system compromise. The attacker gains the same level of control as the user running the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_inter-process_communication__ipc___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

IPC is fundamental to Electron applications for communication between the Renderer and Main processes. Insecure IPC handling is a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious IPC messages to exploit Command Injection in Main process handlers [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_ipc_messages_to_exploit_command_injection_in_main_process_handlers__critical_node____ee197959.md)

If IPC message handlers in the Main process are not carefully implemented and validated, attackers can craft malicious IPC messages to inject shell commands. When the Main process executes these commands, it leads to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Main Process Compromise (Full System Control) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/main_process_compromise__full_system_control___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Successful command injection or other vulnerabilities exploited via IPC in the Main process results in full system control. The attacker gains complete control over the application and the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Protocol Handlers [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_protocol_handlers__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Electron applications can register custom protocol handlers (e.g., `myapp://`). Insecure implementation of these handlers is a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious URLs using custom protocol to Trigger command injection in handler logic [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_urls_using_custom_protocol_to_trigger_command_injection_in_handler_logic__critical_n_ee7e498c.md)

If custom protocol handlers in the Main process are not properly validated, attackers can craft malicious URLs using the custom protocol to inject shell commands. When the Main process processes these URLs, it can execute the injected commands, leading to system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Main Process Compromise (Full System Control) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/main_process_compromise__full_system_control___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Successful command injection or other vulnerabilities exploited via custom protocol handlers in the Main process results in full system control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deep Linking [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deep_linking__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Electron applications can handle deep links, allowing them to be opened via URLs from external applications or browsers. Insecure deep link handling is a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft malicious deep links to Trigger command injection in deep link processing [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_deep_links_to_trigger_command_injection_in_deep_link_processing__critical_node___hig_3c81b335.md)

Similar to protocol handlers, if deep link handling logic in the Main process is vulnerable, attackers can craft malicious deep links to inject shell commands. Processing these deep links can lead to command execution and system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Main Process Compromise (Full System Control) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/main_process_compromise__full_system_control___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Successful command injection or other vulnerabilities exploited via deep link handlers in the Main process results in full system control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Update Mechanism [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_update_mechanism__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

The application update mechanism is a critical security component. If insecure, it becomes a high-risk path for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure update server (HTTP instead of HTTPS, compromised server) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_update_server__http_instead_of_https__compromised_server___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Using HTTP for update downloads or if the update server is compromised, attackers can perform Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks or directly host malicious updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of signature verification for updates [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_signature_verification_for_updates__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

If updates are not cryptographically signed and verified, attackers can inject unsigned malicious updates that the application will accept and install.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Replacement with Malicious Version (Full Control) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/application_replacement_with_malicious_version__full_control___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Successful exploitation of the update mechanism allows attackers to replace the legitimate application with a malicious version. This grants them full control over the application and potentially the system upon the next update.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Packaging and Distribution [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_packaging_and_distribution__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Compromising the application packaging and distribution process is a high-risk supply chain attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise application package during build or distribution [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_package_during_build_or_distribution__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can inject malicious code into the application package during the build process or compromise distribution channels to serve a modified, malicious package.

## Attack Tree Path: [Distribution of Trojanized Application (Initial Compromise) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/distribution_of_trojanized_application__initial_compromise___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Distributing a trojanized application ensures that users download and install a compromised version from the outset, granting the attacker initial access and control from the moment of installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration of Security Features [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_of_security_features__critical_node_.md)

Failing to properly configure Electron's security features is a critical vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify misconfigurations: `nodeIntegration` enabled unnecessarily [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_misconfigurations__nodeintegration__enabled_unnecessarily__critical_node_.md)

As mentioned before, leaving `nodeIntegration` enabled when it's not required is a major misconfiguration that significantly increases the attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [Increased Attack Surface and Easier Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/increased_attack_surface_and_easier_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

Security misconfigurations, especially enabling `nodeIntegration`, directly lead to a larger attack surface and make it significantly easier for attackers to exploit other vulnerabilities and achieve compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Distribute Trojanized Electron Application [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/distribute_trojanized_electron_application__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Social engineering through the distribution of trojanized applications is a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Initial Access and Control upon Installation [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/initial_access_and_control_upon_installation__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

By tricking users into downloading and installing a malicious Electron application disguised as legitimate software, attackers gain initial access and control over the user's system as soon as the application is installed and run.
