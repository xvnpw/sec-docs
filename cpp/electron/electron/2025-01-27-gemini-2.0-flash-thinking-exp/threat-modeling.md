# Threat Model Analysis for electron/electron

## Threat: [Unpatched Chromium Vulnerabilities](./threats/unpatched_chromium_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Attackers exploit known security flaws in the bundled Chromium version within Electron. They can deliver malicious web content or craft specific network requests to trigger these vulnerabilities.
Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine, Denial of Service (DoS) crashing the application, arbitrary file system access, and information disclosure within the renderer process context.
Affected Electron Component: Bundled Chromium browser engine.
Risk Severity: Critical to High
Mitigation Strategies (Developers):
    * Regularly update Electron to the latest stable version.
    * Monitor Chromium and Electron security advisories.
    * Implement automatic update mechanisms for the application.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to Node.js API access](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__leading_to_node_js_api_access.md)

Description: Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into web content loaded by the renderer process. With `nodeIntegration` enabled, this script can directly access Node.js APIs.
Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine by leveraging Node.js APIs from the compromised renderer process.
Affected Electron Component: Renderer process, `BrowserWindow` configuration (`nodeIntegration` setting), Node.js integration.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies (Developers):
    * **Strongly consider disabling `nodeIntegration`.**
    * Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).
    * Sanitize and validate all user inputs and untrusted data.
    * Use context isolation.

## Threat: [Context Isolation Bypass](./threats/context_isolation_bypass.md)

Description: Attackers find vulnerabilities or exploit developer misconfigurations to bypass context isolation, gaining access to Node.js APIs from the renderer process despite intended isolation.
Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) from the renderer process, even in applications that intended to restrict Node.js access.
Affected Electron Component: Context Isolation feature, `contextBridge` API, Renderer process.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies (Developers):
    * Ensure context isolation is enabled and correctly implemented.
    * Avoid disabling or weakening context isolation.
    * Thoroughly review and test context isolation implementation.
    * Keep Electron updated.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) - Unauthorized Access to Main Process Functionality](./threats/insecure_inter-process_communication__ipc__-_unauthorized_access_to_main_process_functionality.md)

Description: Attackers send crafted IPC messages to the main process to trigger privileged actions due to insufficient validation or authorization checks in the main process's IPC handlers.
Impact: Privilege escalation, allowing a compromised renderer process to execute privileged operations in the main process, potentially leading to file system access or system command execution.
Affected Electron Component: IPC mechanisms (`ipcRenderer`, `ipcMain`), message handlers in `ipcMain`.
Risk Severity: High to Critical
Mitigation Strategies (Developers):
    * Implement strict authorization checks in `ipcMain` handlers.
    * Follow the principle of least privilege for IPC APIs.
    * Carefully design and review IPC message handlers.
    * Consider using context-aware IPC.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration of Electron Security Settings](./threats/misconfiguration_of_electron_security_settings.md)

Description: Developers unintentionally disable or weaken important Electron security features like `nodeIntegration`, `contextIsolation`, `webSecurity`, or improperly configure CSP.
Impact: Increased vulnerability to various attacks, including XSS leading to RCE, privilege escalation, and data breaches.
Affected Electron Component: Electron security settings (`BrowserWindow` options, CSP configuration).
Risk Severity: High to Critical
Mitigation Strategies (Developers):
    * Thoroughly understand Electron security settings and their implications.
    * Follow security best practices for Electron development.
    * Use security linters and static analysis tools.
    * Conduct security code reviews.
