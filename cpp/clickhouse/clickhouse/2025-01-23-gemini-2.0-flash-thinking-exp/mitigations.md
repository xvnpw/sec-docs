# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for clickhouse/clickhouse

## Mitigation Strategy: [Least Privilege Principle for Database Users (ClickHouse Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/least_privilege_principle_for_database_users__clickhouse_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Application Needs within ClickHouse:** Determine the minimum ClickHouse permissions required for each application component or user role. Focus on what actions are performed *within* ClickHouse (e.g., reading specific tables, inserting into certain databases).
    2.  **Create Dedicated ClickHouse Users:**  Within ClickHouse's `users.xml` configuration file, define specific users for each application component or user role. Avoid using the `default` user for applications.
    3.  **Grant Granular Permissions using ClickHouse `GRANT`:** Utilize ClickHouse's `GRANT` SQL command (or `users.xml` configuration) to assign only the necessary permissions to each user. Grant permissions on specific databases, tables, and columns, and for specific operations (SELECT, INSERT, ALTER, etc.) *within ClickHouse*.
    4.  **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in ClickHouse:** Define roles within `users.xml` that represent common sets of ClickHouse permissions (e.g., `read_only_analyst`, `data_loader`). Assign users to these roles using `GRANT ROLE` instead of directly granting permissions to individual users for easier management of ClickHouse permissions.
    5.  **Regularly Review ClickHouse Permissions:** Periodically review user and role definitions in `users.xml` and granted permissions within ClickHouse to ensure they adhere to the least privilege principle and remove any excessive ClickHouse permissions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized users or application components from accessing sensitive data *within ClickHouse* that they should not have access to.
    *   Data Manipulation (High Severity) - Limits the ability of compromised accounts or malicious actors to modify or delete data *within ClickHouse* if they only have restricted ClickHouse permissions.
    *   Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity) - Reduces the impact of a compromised ClickHouse account by limiting the scope of actions an attacker can perform *within ClickHouse*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Data Access: High reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized data breaches *within ClickHouse*.
    *   Data Manipulation: High reduction - Limits the potential damage from malicious data modification *within ClickHouse*.
    *   Privilege Escalation: Medium reduction - Makes privilege escalation more difficult *within ClickHouse*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Dedicated ClickHouse users exist for different application services, but ClickHouse permissions are still somewhat broad. RBAC within ClickHouse is not fully utilized.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Granular ClickHouse permissions need to be refined to table and column level where possible using ClickHouse's `GRANT` system. RBAC should be fully implemented within ClickHouse using `users.xml` and `GRANT ROLE` to manage ClickHouse permissions more effectively. Regular reviews of ClickHouse permissions are not yet formalized.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong Authentication Mechanisms (ClickHouse Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/strong_authentication_mechanisms__clickhouse_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Strong Authentication in `users.xml`:**  Within ClickHouse's `users.xml` configuration file, configure strong authentication methods for user logins.
    2.  **Choose Strong ClickHouse Authentication Protocol:** Select a robust authentication protocol supported by ClickHouse and configure it in `users.xml`. Options include LDAP, Kerberos, or HTTP Basic/Digest authentication (when used with TLS).
    3.  **Enforce Strong Passwords in `users.xml` (If Applicable):** If using password-based authentication in ClickHouse, enforce strong password policies within `users.xml` (complexity, length, rotation - potentially through external authentication mechanisms).
    4.  **Disable Weak Authentication Methods in `users.xml`:** Disable any weak or default authentication methods in `users.xml` that are not secure or necessary.
    5.  **Secure Credential Management for ClickHouse Users:** Store ClickHouse user credentials securely (e.g., using secrets management systems) and avoid hardcoding them in application code or configuration files that interact with ClickHouse.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access (High Severity) - Prevents unauthorized individuals from gaining access to ClickHouse and its data through weak or compromised ClickHouse credentials.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity) - Makes brute-force password guessing attacks against ClickHouse logins significantly more difficult.
    *   Credential Stuffing (Medium Severity) - Reduces the risk of successful credential stuffing attacks against ClickHouse if strong, unique passwords are used for ClickHouse users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High reduction - Significantly strengthens ClickHouse access control and reduces the risk of unauthorized entry into ClickHouse.
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: High reduction - Makes brute-force attacks against ClickHouse logins impractical.
    *   Credential Stuffing: Medium reduction - Reduces risk if users practice good password hygiene for ClickHouse credentials.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   HTTP Basic Authentication with TLS/SSL is enabled for API access to ClickHouse. Strong password policies are enforced for application users *interacting with the application*, but not necessarily enforced directly within ClickHouse user configuration beyond password complexity.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   LDAP or Kerberos integration for centralized ClickHouse authentication management (configured in `users.xml`) is not yet implemented. More robust password policies directly enforced within ClickHouse user configuration (or via external authentication) could be considered.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Limits and Resource Control (ClickHouse Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/query_limits_and_resource_control__clickhouse_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**

        *   `max_memory_usage`: Limits memory usage per query *in ClickHouse*.
        *   `max_execution_time`: Limits query execution time *in ClickHouse*.
        *   `max_rows_to_read`: Limits the number of rows read by a query *in ClickHouse*.
        *   `max_threads`: Limits the number of threads used per query *in ClickHouse*.
    2.  **Set Limits at User/Profile Level in `users.xml`:** Apply these ClickHouse resource limits at the user or profile level in ClickHouse's `users.xml` configuration to control resource usage for different ClickHouse user groups or applications accessing ClickHouse.
    3.  **Monitoring and Alerting for ClickHouse Resource Usage:** Monitor ClickHouse resource usage and query performance *within ClickHouse*. Set up alerts for queries that exceed defined ClickHouse resource limits or execution time thresholds (using ClickHouse monitoring tools or external systems integrated with ClickHouse metrics).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Prevents malicious or poorly written queries from consuming excessive ClickHouse resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and causing ClickHouse service degradation or outages.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity) - Protects against accidental ClickHouse resource exhaustion due to unexpected query load or inefficient queries executed against ClickHouse.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service: High reduction - Effectively mitigates resource-based DoS attacks *targeting ClickHouse*.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: High reduction - Prevents ClickHouse performance degradation due to resource contention.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic ClickHouse resource limits (`max_memory_usage`, `max_execution_time`) are configured in `config.xml` at the server level.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More granular ClickHouse resource limits need to be defined at the user/profile level in `users.xml` to differentiate resource allocation for different application components accessing ClickHouse. Monitoring and alerting specifically for ClickHouse resource usage need to be enhanced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limits (ClickHouse Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limits__clickhouse_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `max_concurrent_queries` in ClickHouse `config.xml`:** Configure ClickHouse's `max_concurrent_queries` setting in `config.xml` to limit the total number of concurrent queries that ClickHouse will process simultaneously.
    2.  **Optimize Application Connection Pooling:** While not directly ClickHouse configuration, ensure application connection pooling is properly configured to avoid overwhelming ClickHouse with connection requests, working in conjunction with ClickHouse's connection limits.
    3.  **Monitoring and Alerting for ClickHouse Connections:** Monitor the number of active connections to ClickHouse. Set up alerts if the number of connections approaches or exceeds the configured `max_concurrent_queries` limit.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Prevents connection-based DoS attacks against ClickHouse by limiting the number of concurrent connections ClickHouse will accept.
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity) - Prevents ClickHouse resource exhaustion due to an excessive number of concurrent connections consuming server resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service: High reduction - Effectively mitigates connection-based DoS attacks *targeting ClickHouse*.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: High reduction - Prevents ClickHouse performance degradation due to connection overload.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `max_concurrent_queries` is set to a default value in ClickHouse `config.xml`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `max_concurrent_queries` limit should be reviewed and potentially adjusted based on expected application load and ClickHouse server capacity. Monitoring and alerting for ClickHouse connection counts need to be implemented.

    2.  **Enable TLS for Client Connections:** Configure ClickHouse to require TLS/SSL for all client connections (e.g., from applications, command-line clients).
    3.  **Enable TLS for Inter-node Communication (Cluster):** If using a ClickHouse cluster, configure TLS/SSL for communication between ClickHouse nodes.
    4.  **Enable TLS for Administrative Interfaces:** Ensure TLS/SSL is enabled for administrative interfaces like ClickHouse Keeper if used.
    5.  **Generate and Manage TLS Certificates for ClickHouse:** Generate and properly manage TLS certificates required for ClickHouse server and client configuration.
    6.  **Verify TLS Configuration in ClickHouse:** Regularly verify that TLS/SSL encryption is properly enabled and configured for all relevant ClickHouse communication channels.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Data Breach (High Severity) - Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access if network traffic to and from ClickHouse is intercepted.
