# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for clickhouse/clickhouse

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within ClickHouse](./mitigation_strategies/strict_role-based_access_control__rbac__within_clickhouse.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Inventory Data and Operations:** Within ClickHouse, identify all databases, tables, and operations (SELECT, INSERT, ALTER, MATERIALIZE VIEW, etc.) that users need to perform.
2.  **Define Roles (using `CREATE ROLE`):** Create roles within ClickHouse that correspond to specific job functions or access needs (e.g., "reporting_analyst", "data_engineer", "logs_writer").  Use ClickHouse's `CREATE ROLE` statement.
3.  **Grant Granular Privileges (using `GRANT`):** Assign *only* the necessary privileges to each role using ClickHouse's `GRANT` statement.  Specify databases, tables, and operations explicitly.  Avoid `GRANT ... ON *.*`.  Use `GRANT ... ON CLUSTER` sparingly.
4.  **Create Users (using `CREATE USER`):** Create individual user accounts within ClickHouse using the `CREATE USER` statement.
5.  **Assign Roles to Users (using `GRANT`):** Assign the appropriate roles to each user using `GRANT rolename TO username`.
6.  **Implement Row-Level Security (using Row Policies):** If your data model supports it, use ClickHouse's row policies (`CREATE ROW POLICY`) to restrict access to specific rows within a table based on user attributes or other conditions.  This is a powerful feature *within* ClickHouse.
7.  **Regularly Audit (using system tables):** Periodically review user accounts, roles, and privileges *within ClickHouse*. Use ClickHouse's system tables (e.g., `system.users`, `system.roles`, `system.grants`, `system.role_grants`) to assist with auditing.  These tables are *internal* to ClickHouse.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Internal/External):** (Severity: High) Prevents users from accessing ClickHouse data they are not authorized to see.
*   **Data Modification (Accidental/Malicious):** (Severity: High) Prevents unauthorized users from modifying or deleting data within ClickHouse.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** (Severity: High) Limits the ability of an attacker to gain higher privileges *within ClickHouse*.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** (Severity: High) By limiting read access within ClickHouse, reduces the potential for data exfiltration.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Internal/External):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Data Modification (Accidental/Malicious):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic user accounts with passwords are created in `users.xml`.
*   Some roles are defined, but they are not consistently applied, and some users have overly broad privileges.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive review and redesign of roles and privileges within ClickHouse to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
*   Implementation of row-level security (row policies) where applicable within ClickHouse.
*   Regular auditing of user accounts and privileges using ClickHouse's system tables.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Restrictions and Resource Limits (ClickHouse Settings)](./mitigation_strategies/query_restrictions_and_resource_limits__clickhouse_settings_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Analyze Typical Query Patterns:** Use ClickHouse's query log (`system.query_log`) and monitoring tools to understand the typical resource usage (memory, CPU, execution time) of queries.
2.  **Set Global Limits (in `config.xml`):** Configure global limits *within ClickHouse's `config.xml`* to prevent resource exhaustion:
    *   `max_memory_usage`: Limits RAM per query.
    *   `max_execution_time`: Sets a maximum query execution time.
    *   `max_rows_to_read`, `max_bytes_to_read`: Limits data scanned.
    *   `max_result_rows`, `max_result_bytes`: Limits the size of the result set.
3.  **Set User-Specific Limits (in `users.xml` or using `SET`):** Use profiles in ClickHouse's `users.xml` or the `SET` command during a session to set more restrictive limits for specific users or groups of users.  This is *within* ClickHouse.
4.  **Implement Quotas (in `users.xml`):** Define quotas *within ClickHouse's `users.xml`* to limit resource usage over time (e.g., queries per hour, data read per day).
5.  **Consider Query Complexity Limits (in `config.xml`):** Use ClickHouse settings like `max_ast_depth`, `max_ast_elements`, and `max_expanded_ast_elements` (in `config.xml`) to restrict overly complex queries.
6.  **Monitor and Adjust (using system tables):** Regularly monitor resource usage using ClickHouse's system tables and adjust the limits as needed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS) (against ClickHouse):** (Severity: High) Prevents attackers from overwhelming the ClickHouse server with resource-intensive queries.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Accidental) (within ClickHouse):** (Severity: Medium) Prevents legitimate users from accidentally running queries that consume excessive ClickHouse resources.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Large Queries):** (Severity: Medium) Limits the amount of data that can be retrieved in a single ClickHouse query.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Accidental):** Risk moderately reduced.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Large Queries):** Risk moderately reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Some global limits (e.g., `max_memory_usage`) are set in `config.xml`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive analysis of typical query patterns using `system.query_log`.
*   Implementation of user-specific limits and quotas within `users.xml`.
*   Consideration and potential implementation of query complexity limits in `config.xml`.
*   Regular monitoring and adjustment of limits using ClickHouse system tables.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parameterized Queries / Prepared Statements (within Client Libraries interacting with ClickHouse)](./mitigation_strategies/parameterized_queries__prepared_statements__within_client_libraries_interacting_with_clickhouse_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify All User Input Points:** In your application code (Python, Go, Java, etc.) that interacts with ClickHouse, identify all places where user input is used to construct ClickHouse queries.
2.  **Use Parameterized Queries:** *Always* use the parameterized query (prepared statement) mechanism provided by your ClickHouse *client library*.  This is how your application *talks to* ClickHouse. This involves using placeholders (e.g., `?` or `:name`) in the SQL query and passing the user input as separate parameters *to the client library*.
3. **Avoid String Concatenation:** *Never* construct SQL queries by concatenating strings with user input within your application code before sending the query to ClickHouse.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **SQL Injection (into ClickHouse):** (Severity: Critical) Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code into your ClickHouse queries.

**Impact:**
*   **SQL Injection:** Risk eliminated (if implemented correctly).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Some parts of the application use parameterized queries.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of parameterized queries throughout the entire application wherever it interacts with ClickHouse.
*   Code review to identify and fix any instances of string concatenation used to build SQL queries before sending them to ClickHouse.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Masking at Query Time (Using ClickHouse Functions)](./mitigation_strategies/data_masking_at_query_time__using_clickhouse_functions_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Columns:** Determine which columns in your ClickHouse tables contain sensitive data that should be masked for certain users.
2.  **Choose Masking Functions:** Select appropriate ClickHouse functions for masking:
    *   `replaceRegexpOne`, `replaceRegexpAll`: For replacing parts of strings with patterns.
    *   `substring`: For extracting only a portion of a string.
    *   `lower`, `upper`: For case manipulation (can be used for basic masking).
    *   `hash`: For creating one-way hashes (irreversible masking).
    *   Custom UDFs (User-Defined Functions): If built-in functions are insufficient, create custom UDFs in ClickHouse for more complex masking logic.
3.  **Create Views (Optional):** Create ClickHouse views that apply the masking functions to the sensitive columns.  Grant access to these views to users who should see masked data, while restricting access to the underlying tables.
4.  **Modify Queries:** If views are not used, modify the queries issued by your application to include the masking functions directly in the `SELECT` statement. This is done *within the query sent to ClickHouse*.
5. **Conditional Masking (Using `if`):** Use ClickHouse's `if` function within your queries to apply masking conditionally, based on the user or other criteria. This allows for different levels of masking for different users.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Internal/External):** (Severity: High) Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive data to unauthorized users, even if they have some level of access to ClickHouse.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Sensitive Data):** (Severity: Medium) Makes exfiltrated data less valuable if it is masked.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Internal/External):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Sensitive Data):** Risk moderately reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No data masking is currently implemented.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Identification of sensitive columns.
*   Implementation of masking using ClickHouse functions, either through views or directly in queries.
*   Consideration of custom UDFs for complex masking.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption in Transit (Requiring TLS/SSL for ClickHouse Connections)](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_in_transit__requiring_tlsssl_for_clickhouse_connections_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Obtain SSL Certificates:** Obtain valid SSL certificates for your ClickHouse server(s). You can use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) or create self-signed certificates (for testing only).
2.  **Configure ClickHouse Server (`config.xml`):**
    *   Set `<openSSL><server><certificateFile>...</certificateFile><privateKeyFile>...</privateKeyFile></server></openSSL>` to point to your certificate and private key files.
    *   Set `<tcp_port_secure>` to enable the secure TCP port (default is 9440).
    *   Consider setting `<require_server_verification>` to `true` in the `<openSSL><client>` section to enforce client certificate verification (for mutual TLS).
3.  **Configure ClickHouse Clients:** Configure your ClickHouse client libraries (Python, Go, etc.) to connect to the secure port (`tcp_port_secure`) and to verify the server's certificate.  This is done in the *client configuration*, but it's how the client *talks to ClickHouse*.
4. **Disable Unencrypted Ports (Optional but Recommended):** Once you have verified that secure connections are working, consider disabling the unencrypted ports (`tcp_port` and `http_port`) in `config.xml` to enforce encryption.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** (Severity: High) Prevents attackers from intercepting and eavesdropping on the communication between ClickHouse clients and the server.
*   **Data Exfiltration (in transit):** (Severity: High) Protects data as it travels between the client and the server.

**Impact:**
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Data Exfiltration (in transit):** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   ClickHouse is configured to accept both encrypted and unencrypted connections.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Enforcement of TLS/SSL for all ClickHouse connections.
*   Configuration of client libraries to require secure connections and verify server certificates.
*   Disabling of unencrypted ports in `config.xml`.
