# Deep Analysis: ClickHouse Query Restrictions and Resource Limits

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly evaluate the "Query Restrictions and Resource Limits" mitigation strategy for a ClickHouse deployment.  The goal is to identify gaps in the current implementation, assess the effectiveness of the strategy against specific threats, and provide concrete recommendations for improvement to enhance the security and stability of the ClickHouse cluster.  We will focus on practical implementation details and how to leverage ClickHouse's built-in features for optimal protection.

## 2. Scope

This analysis covers the following aspects of the mitigation strategy:

*   **Configuration Files:**  Analysis of `config.xml` and `users.xml` for relevant settings.
*   **ClickHouse Settings:**  Evaluation of global limits, user-specific limits, quotas, and query complexity limits.
*   **Monitoring Tools:**  Utilization of `system.query_log` and other system tables for analysis and ongoing monitoring.
*   **Threats:**  Assessment of the strategy's effectiveness against DoS/DDoS, accidental resource exhaustion, and data exfiltration.
*   **ClickHouse Version:**  Assuming a reasonably recent version of ClickHouse (e.g., 22.x or later), as features and settings may vary between versions.  If a specific version is in use, it should be documented here.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Network-level security measures (firewalls, intrusion detection systems).
*   Authentication and authorization mechanisms *outside* of ClickHouse's built-in user management.
*   Operating system-level resource limits (e.g., cgroups).
*   Physical security of the ClickHouse servers.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Review Existing Configuration:** Examine the current `config.xml` and `users.xml` files to document the implemented settings.
2.  **Query Log Analysis:**  Analyze a representative sample of the `system.query_log` data to understand typical query patterns, resource usage, and potential outliers.  This will involve:
    *   Identifying the most frequent queries.
    *   Determining the average and maximum resource consumption (memory, CPU, execution time) for different query types.
    *   Identifying any queries that significantly exceed expected resource usage.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Re-evaluate the identified threats (DoS/DDoS, resource exhaustion, data exfiltration) in the context of the query log analysis and existing configuration.
4.  **Gap Analysis:**  Identify discrepancies between the desired level of protection and the current implementation.
5.  **Recommendations:**  Provide specific, actionable recommendations for improving the mitigation strategy, including:
    *   Optimal values for ClickHouse settings.
    *   User-specific profiles and quotas.
    *   Monitoring procedures.
6.  **Implementation Guidance:** Offer practical advice on how to implement the recommendations, including example configurations and commands.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy: Query Restrictions and Resource Limits

### 4.1. Review of Existing Configuration (Currently Implemented)

The document states that *some* global limits, like `max_memory_usage`, are set in `config.xml`.  This is a good starting point, but it's insufficient.  We need to know *exactly* which settings are configured and their values.  For example:

*   **`config.xml`:**
    *   `max_memory_usage`:  What is the current value?  Is it appropriate for the available RAM and expected workload?
    *   `max_execution_time`: Is this set?  If so, to what value?
    *   `max_rows_to_read`, `max_bytes_to_read`: Are these limits in place?  They are crucial for preventing scans of massive datasets.
    *   `max_result_rows`, `max_result_bytes`:  Are these set to limit the size of result sets returned to clients?
    *   `max_ast_depth`, `max_ast_elements`, `max_expanded_ast_elements`: Are these complexity limits configured?

*   **`users.xml`:**
    *   Are there any user-specific profiles defined?
    *   Are any quotas configured?

**Without this detailed information, a complete assessment is impossible.**  We'll assume for the rest of this analysis that *only* `max_memory_usage` is set to a hypothetical value (e.g., 10GB) and that no other relevant settings are configured in either `config.xml` or `users.xml`.

### 4.2. Query Log Analysis (Missing Implementation)

This is a critical missing piece.  Analyzing `system.query_log` is essential for understanding the *actual* workload and tailoring the resource limits appropriately.  Here's a breakdown of the analysis process:

1.  **Enable Query Logging:** Ensure that query logging is enabled in `config.xml`.  The relevant setting is `query_log`.  You'll likely want to configure:
    *   `database`:  The database to store the query log (usually `system`).
    *   `table`:  The table name (usually `query_log`).
    *   `partition_by`:  How to partition the table (e.g., by `event_date`).
    *   `flush_interval_milliseconds`:  How often to flush the log to disk.
    *   `engine`:  Usually `MergeTree`.

    ```xml
    <query_log>
        <database>system</database>
        <table>query_log</table>
        <partition_by>toYYYYMM(event_date)</partition_by>
        <flush_interval_milliseconds>7500</flush_interval_milliseconds>
        <engine>MergeTree() ORDER BY (event_date, event_time) PARTITION BY toYYYYMM(event_date) SETTINGS index_granularity = 8192</engine>
    </query_log>
    ```

2.  **Collect Sufficient Data:**  Gather query log data for a representative period (e.g., a week or a month) that captures typical usage patterns, including peak loads.

3.  **Analyze the Data:**  Use ClickHouse itself to query the `system.query_log` table.  Here are some example queries and their purpose:

    *   **Identify the most frequent queries:**

        ```sql
        SELECT
            query,
            count() AS num_executions,
            avg(query_duration_ms) AS avg_duration,
            max(query_duration_ms) AS max_duration,
            avg(memory_usage) AS avg_memory,
            max(memory_usage) AS max_memory,
            avg(read_rows) AS avg_read_rows,
            max(read_rows) AS max_read_rows
        FROM system.query_log
        WHERE event_date >= today() - 7  -- Last 7 days
        GROUP BY query
        ORDER BY num_executions DESC
        LIMIT 10;
        ```

    *   **Find queries exceeding a specific memory threshold:**

        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM system.query_log
        WHERE event_date >= today() - 7
          AND memory_usage > 10737418240; -- 10 GB
        ```

    *   **Identify long-running queries:**

        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM system.query_log
        WHERE event_date >= today() - 7
          AND query_duration_ms > 60000; -- 60 seconds
        ```
    *  **Identify queries by user:**
        ```sql
        SELECT
            user,
            count() AS num_executions,
            avg(query_duration_ms) AS avg_duration,
            max(query_duration_ms) AS max_duration,
            avg(memory_usage) AS avg_memory,
            max(memory_usage) AS max_memory
        FROM system.query_log
        WHERE event_date >= today() - 7
        GROUP BY user
        ORDER BY num_executions DESC;
        ```

    *   **Identify queries reading large amounts of data:**

        ```sql
        SELECT *
        FROM system.query_log
        WHERE event_date >= today() - 7
          AND read_rows > 1000000000; -- 1 billion rows
        ```

4.  **Identify Outliers and Anomalies:**  Look for queries that deviate significantly from the norm in terms of resource usage or execution time.  These could indicate inefficient queries, potential attacks, or data exfiltration attempts.

5.  **Categorize Queries:**  Group queries into categories based on their purpose and resource usage (e.g., reporting queries, analytical queries, data ingestion queries).  This will help in setting appropriate limits for different types of workloads.

### 4.3. Threat Modeling (Re-evaluation)

Based on the (hypothetical) query log analysis and existing configuration, we can re-evaluate the threats:

*   **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS):**  With only `max_memory_usage` set, the system is still highly vulnerable to DoS attacks.  An attacker could craft queries that consume excessive CPU time, read massive amounts of data, or generate huge result sets, even if they stay within the memory limit.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Accidental):**  The risk is partially mitigated by the `max_memory_usage` setting, but other resources are unprotected.  A legitimate user could still inadvertently run a query that overwhelms the server.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Large Queries):**  Without limits on `max_result_rows` and `max_result_bytes`, an attacker with query access could potentially retrieve large amounts of data.

### 4.4. Gap Analysis

The following gaps exist between the desired level of protection and the current implementation:

*   **Insufficient Global Limits:**  Only `max_memory_usage` is (hypothetically) configured.  Other crucial limits like `max_execution_time`, `max_rows_to_read`, `max_bytes_to_read`, `max_result_rows`, and `max_result_bytes` are missing.
*   **Lack of User-Specific Limits:**  No user-specific profiles or quotas are defined in `users.xml`.  This means all users are subject to the same (insufficient) global limits.
*   **No Query Complexity Limits:**  Settings like `max_ast_depth`, `max_ast_elements`, and `max_expanded_ast_elements` are not used, leaving the system vulnerable to complex, resource-intensive queries.
*   **Absence of Monitoring and Adjustment:**  There's no process for regularly reviewing resource usage and adjusting the limits based on observed patterns.

### 4.5. Recommendations

To address the identified gaps, the following recommendations are made:

1.  **Set Comprehensive Global Limits (in `config.xml`):**

    *   `max_memory_usage`:  Adjust the existing value based on the query log analysis and available RAM.  Consider setting it to a value that allows for multiple concurrent queries without exhausting memory.  Example: `20G` (if the server has 64GB RAM).
    *   `max_execution_time`:  Set a reasonable time limit to prevent long-running queries.  Example: `300` (5 minutes).
    *   `max_rows_to_read`:  Limit the number of rows scanned.  Example: `1000000000` (1 billion rows).
    *   `max_bytes_to_read`:  Limit the amount of data scanned.  Example: `100G`.
    *   `max_result_rows`:  Limit the number of rows returned.  Example: `1000000` (1 million rows).
    *   `max_result_bytes`:  Limit the size of the result set.  Example: `1G`.
    *   `max_ast_depth`:  Limit the depth of the query AST.  Example: `50`.
    *   `max_ast_elements`:  Limit the number of elements in the query AST.  Example: `1000`.
    *   `max_expanded_ast_elements`:  Limit the number of elements after macro expansion.  Example: `10000`.
    *   `readonly`: Set to `1` for read-only users by default.

    ```xml
    <max_memory_usage>20000000000</max_memory_usage>
    <max_execution_time>300</max_execution_time>
    <max_rows_to_read>1000000000</max_rows_to_read>
    <max_bytes_to_read>107374182400</max_bytes_to_read>
    <max_result_rows>1000000</max_result_rows>
    <max_result_bytes>1073741824</max_result_bytes>
    <max_ast_depth>50</max_ast_depth>
    <max_ast_elements>1000</max_ast_elements>
    <max_expanded_ast_elements>10000</max_expanded_ast_elements>
    <readonly>1</readonly>
    ```

2.  **Implement User-Specific Limits and Quotas (in `users.xml`):**

    *   **Create Profiles:** Define different profiles for various user groups (e.g., `analysts`, `developers`, `readonly_users`).  Each profile should have tailored resource limits.

    *   **Assign Profiles to Users:**  Assign the appropriate profile to each user.

    *   **Set Quotas:**  Define quotas to limit resource usage over time.  For example, limit the number of queries per hour or the amount of data read per day.

    ```xml
    <profiles>
        <readonly_users>
            <readonly>1</readonly>
            <max_memory_usage>5000000000</max_memory_usage>
            <max_execution_time>60</max_execution_time>
            <max_result_rows>100000</max_result_rows>
        </readonly_users>
        <analysts>
            <max_memory_usage>10000000000</max_memory_usage>
            <max_execution_time>300</max_execution_time>
            <max_result_rows>1000000</max_result_rows>
             <quota>
                <interval>
                    <duration>3600</duration> <!-- 1 hour -->
                    <queries>100</queries>
                    <errors>10</errors>
                    <result_rows>10000000</result_rows>
                    <read_rows>1000000000</read_rows>
                    <execution_time>600</execution_time>
                </interval>
            </quota>
        </analysts>
    </profiles>

    <users>
        <john>
            <password>...</password>
            <profile>analysts</profile>
            <networks>...</networks>
        </john>
        <jane>
            <password>...</password>
            <profile>readonly_users</profile>
            <networks>...</networks>
        </jane>
    </users>
    ```

3.  **Regular Monitoring and Adjustment:**

    *   **Use System Tables:**  Regularly query `system.query_log`, `system.processes`, and other relevant system tables to monitor resource usage.
    *   **Set up Alerts:**  Configure alerts (e.g., using Grafana or a custom script) to notify administrators when resource usage approaches or exceeds predefined thresholds.
    *   **Review and Adjust Limits:**  Periodically review the effectiveness of the resource limits and adjust them as needed based on observed usage patterns and changing workloads.  This should be done at least quarterly, or more frequently if significant changes occur.

### 4.6. Implementation Guidance

*   **Testing:**  Before applying any changes to the production environment, thoroughly test them in a staging or development environment.
*   **Gradual Rollout:**  Implement changes gradually, starting with the most restrictive limits and monitoring the impact on users and applications.
*   **Documentation:**  Document all configured settings and their rationale.
*   **User Communication:**  Inform users about the implemented resource limits and quotas.
* **Use `SET` for Session-Specific Overrides:** If a user needs to temporarily exceed their profile limits for a specific task, they can use the `SET` command within their session. For example: `SET max_memory_usage = 20000000000;` This overrides the profile setting *only for that session*.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Query Restrictions and Resource Limits" mitigation strategy is crucial for securing and stabilizing a ClickHouse deployment.  However, the current implementation, with only `max_memory_usage` set, is insufficient.  By implementing comprehensive global limits, user-specific profiles and quotas, query complexity restrictions, and regular monitoring, the system's resilience against DoS attacks, accidental resource exhaustion, and data exfiltration can be significantly improved.  The detailed query log analysis is the foundation for making informed decisions about appropriate resource limits.  The recommendations provided in this analysis offer a practical roadmap for enhancing the security and stability of the ClickHouse cluster.
