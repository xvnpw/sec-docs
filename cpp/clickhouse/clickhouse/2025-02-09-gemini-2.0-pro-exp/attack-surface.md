# Attack Surface Analysis for clickhouse/clickhouse

## Attack Surface: [Network Exposure of Core Ports](./attack_surfaces/network_exposure_of_core_ports.md)

*   **1. Network Exposure of Core Ports**

    *   **Description:**  Exposure of ClickHouse's primary communication ports (TCP, HTTP, Interserver) to untrusted networks.
    *   **How ClickHouse Contributes:** ClickHouse relies on these ports for client connections, data ingestion, and inter-node communication.  Default configurations may bind to all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`).
    *   **Example:**  An attacker scans for open port 9000 (native TCP) and finds a ClickHouse instance exposed to the public internet.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to data, data modification/deletion, denial-of-service, potential remote code execution (if vulnerabilities exist).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   **Firewall:** Implement strict firewall rules to allow access *only* from trusted IP addresses/networks.  This is the *primary* defense.
            *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate ClickHouse servers on a dedicated, protected network segment.
            *   **VPN/Private Network:** Require VPN or private network access for all client connections.
            *   **Interface Binding:** Configure ClickHouse to bind to specific network interfaces (e.g., a private IP address) instead of `0.0.0.0`.
            *   **Disable Unnecessary Ports:** If the HTTP interface (8123) or interserver port (9009) are not needed for specific use cases, disable them in the configuration.
            *   **TLS/SSL:** Use HTTPS (8123) with strong TLS configurations and valid certificates.  Consider using TLS for the native TCP port (9440) if supported by your client libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_authentication.md)

*   **2. Weak or Default Authentication**

    *   **Description:**  Using default or easily guessable credentials, or disabling authentication entirely.
    *   **How ClickHouse Contributes:** ClickHouse provides built-in user management and authentication, but it's the administrator's responsibility to configure it securely.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker uses the default `default` user with no password (or a well-known default password) to gain access.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the ClickHouse instance, including data access, modification, and deletion.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   **Strong Passwords:** *Always* change the default password for the `default` user and any other pre-configured users.  Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity).
            *   **Disable Default User:** Create dedicated user accounts for applications and users, and disable or restrict the `default` user.
            *   **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):**  Use ClickHouse's RBAC features to grant granular permissions to users and roles.  Apply the principle of least privilege.
            *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** While ClickHouse doesn't natively support MFA, consider implementing it at the network or application level (e.g., using a VPN with MFA).
            *   **Regular Password Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular password changes.
            *   **External Authentication (LDAP, Kerberos):** If using external authentication, ensure it's configured securely and regularly updated.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Use of `remote()` and `cluster()` Functions](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_use_of__remote____and__cluster____functions.md)

*   **3. Unsafe Use of `remote()` and `cluster()` Functions**

    *   **Description:**  Misuse of `remote()` and `cluster()` table functions to connect to untrusted or compromised servers.
    *   **How ClickHouse Contributes:** These functions allow querying data from remote ClickHouse servers or other clusters, providing powerful distributed query capabilities.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker injects a malicious server address into a query using the `remote()` function, leading to data exfiltration or an SSRF attack.
    *   **Impact:**  Data exfiltration, SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery), potential compromise of other systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Input Validation:**  *Never* allow user-supplied input to directly construct the server address or other parameters of `remote()` or `cluster()` functions.  Use a whitelist of allowed servers.
            *   **Parameterized Queries (Limited Applicability):** While ClickHouse doesn't have parameterized queries in the same way as traditional SQL databases, consider using techniques like string escaping or building queries with trusted components to minimize injection risks.
            *   **Code Review:**  Carefully review any code that uses these functions to ensure that they are used securely.
        *   **Users:**
            *   **Configuration Review:**  Regularly review the ClickHouse configuration to ensure that `remote()` and `cluster()` are only configured to connect to trusted servers.
            *   **Access Control:** Restrict the ability to use these functions to specific, trusted users.

## Attack Surface: [Unsafe Use of URL and File Table Engines](./attack_surfaces/unsafe_use_of_url_and_file_table_engines.md)

*   **4. Unsafe Use of URL and File Table Engines**

    *   **Description:**  Exploiting the URL or File table engines to access unauthorized resources or execute malicious code.
    *   **How ClickHouse Contributes:** These engines allow ClickHouse to read data from external URLs or local files, respectively.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **URL Engine:** An attacker uses the URL engine to access internal services (SSRF) or to download a malicious file that ClickHouse then attempts to process.
        *   **File Engine:** An attacker uploads a malicious file to the server and then uses the File engine to read it, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:**  SSRF, data exfiltration, potential code execution, file system access.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Input Validation (URL Engine):**  Strictly validate and sanitize any user-supplied URLs used with the URL engine.  Use a whitelist of allowed domains/URLs.
            *   **File Upload Restrictions (File Engine):**  Implement strict controls over file uploads to the server.  Limit the directories that the File engine can access.  Use file type validation and potentially virus scanning.
            *   **Content Validation:** Validate the content retrieved from URLs or files before processing it.
        *   **Users:**
            *   **Configuration Review:**  Regularly review the ClickHouse configuration to ensure that the URL and File engines are used securely.  Limit the scope of these engines as much as possible.
            *   **Access Control:** Restrict the ability to use these engines to specific, trusted users.

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched ClickHouse Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_clickhouse_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

*   **5. Unpatched ClickHouse Vulnerabilities (CVEs)**

    *   **Description:**  Running a version of ClickHouse with known, unpatched security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How ClickHouse Contributes:** Like any software, ClickHouse may have vulnerabilities that are discovered and publicly disclosed.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a known CVE in an outdated ClickHouse version to gain unauthorized access or execute code.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from data breaches to complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the CVE)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:**
            *   **Stay Updated:**  Regularly update ClickHouse to the latest stable version.  Subscribe to ClickHouse security advisories and mailing lists.
            *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your ClickHouse deployment.
            *   **Patch Management:**  Implement a robust patch management process to ensure that security updates are applied promptly.
