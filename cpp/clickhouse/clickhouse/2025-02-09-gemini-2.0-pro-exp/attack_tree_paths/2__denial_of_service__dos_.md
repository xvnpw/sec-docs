# Deep Analysis of ClickHouse Denial of Service Attack Tree Path

This document provides a deep analysis of a specific attack tree path related to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks against a ClickHouse deployment.  We will focus on the **Memory Exhaustion** path (2.1.1) within the broader DoS attack vector.

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the mechanics of a memory exhaustion attack against ClickHouse.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities and attack vectors within the application's use of ClickHouse that could lead to memory exhaustion.
*   Propose concrete, actionable recommendations beyond the general mitigations listed in the original attack tree, tailored to the development team's context.
*   Assess the effectiveness of existing and proposed mitigations.
*   Provide guidance on monitoring and detection specific to memory exhaustion attacks.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses solely on the **Memory Exhaustion (2.1.1)** attack path within the Denial of Service (DoS) branch of the attack tree.  It assumes the application interacts with ClickHouse using standard client libraries and SQL queries.  It does *not* cover:

*   Other DoS attack vectors (Disk/CPU Exhaustion, Network Flooding).
*   Attacks exploiting vulnerabilities in the ClickHouse server software itself (e.g., zero-day exploits).  We assume the ClickHouse server is patched and up-to-date.
*   Attacks targeting the underlying infrastructure (e.g., network infrastructure, operating system).

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Attack Vector Breakdown:**  Decompose the Memory Exhaustion attack into specific, actionable scenarios.
2.  **Vulnerability Assessment:**  Identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's interaction with ClickHouse that could be exploited in each scenario.
3.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of existing mitigations and propose additional, tailored mitigations.
4.  **Detection and Monitoring:**  Recommend specific monitoring strategies and metrics to detect memory exhaustion attacks.
5.  **Code Review Guidance:** Provide specific areas to focus on during code reviews to prevent memory exhaustion vulnerabilities.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Memory Exhaustion (2.1.1)

### 2.1 Attack Vector Breakdown

Memory exhaustion attacks in ClickHouse typically exploit how the database processes queries.  Here's a breakdown of specific attack vectors:

*   **2.1.1.a  Large JOIN Operations:**  Joining large tables without appropriate filtering or indexing can lead to massive intermediate result sets that consume significant memory.  This is especially true for `JOIN` types that create Cartesian products (e.g., `CROSS JOIN` without restrictive `ON` clauses).
*   **2.1.1.b  GROUP BY on High-Cardinality Columns:**  `GROUP BY` operations on columns with a very large number of distinct values (e.g., user IDs, timestamps) can create a large number of groups, each requiring memory to store aggregate values.
*   **2.1.1.c  Large IN Clauses:**  Using `IN` clauses with extremely large lists of values (e.g., thousands or millions of IDs) can consume substantial memory during query processing.
*   **2.1.1.d  Unbounded Array Operations:**  ClickHouse supports array data types.  Operations on very large arrays, especially those involving array joins or aggregations, can lead to memory exhaustion.
*   **2.1.1.e  Dictionary Attacks on String Columns:**  If string columns are not properly indexed, queries involving string comparisons (e.g., `LIKE`, `equals`) can trigger full table scans and potentially load large amounts of string data into memory.
*   **2.1.1.f  Recursive CTEs (Common Table Expressions):**  Poorly designed recursive CTEs can lead to infinite loops or extremely deep recursion, consuming excessive memory.
*   **2.1.1.g  Large DISTINCT Operations:** Similar to `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT` on columns with many unique values can consume significant memory.
*   **2.1.1.h  Window Functions with Large Windows:**  Window functions operating over very large windows (e.g., `rank() OVER (ORDER BY ...)` on a large dataset without partitioning) can require significant memory to store intermediate results.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Assessment

To assess vulnerabilities, we need to consider how the application interacts with ClickHouse.  Here are key questions and areas to investigate:

*   **Query Patterns:**
    *   Are there any queries that perform `JOIN` operations on large tables?  Are these joins properly filtered and indexed?  Are there any `CROSS JOIN` operations?
    *   Are there any queries that use `GROUP BY` on columns that could potentially have a very high cardinality?  Are there limits on the number of groups returned?
    *   Are `IN` clauses used?  If so, what is the typical and maximum size of the value lists?  Are there any user-provided inputs that directly populate `IN` clauses?
    *   Does the application use array data types?  If so, are there any operations on arrays that could potentially involve very large arrays?
    *   Are there any queries that perform string comparisons on potentially large string columns without appropriate indexes?
    *   Are recursive CTEs used? If so, are they carefully designed to prevent infinite loops or excessive recursion?
    *   Are `DISTINCT` operations used on potentially high-cardinity columns?
    *   Are window functions used? If so, what are the window sizes and partitioning strategies?
*   **User Input:**
    *   Are there any user-provided inputs that directly influence query parameters, such as filter values, `IN` clause lists, or `ORDER BY` clauses?  If so, are these inputs properly validated and sanitized to prevent malicious query construction?
*   **Data Model:**
    *   Are there any tables with a very large number of rows or columns?
    *   Are there any columns with very high cardinality?
    *   Are indexes appropriately defined to optimize common query patterns?
* **Existing Mitigations:**
    *  What are the current values for `max_memory_usage`, `max_memory_usage_for_user`, and `max_memory_usage_for_all_queries`? Are these values appropriate for the expected workload and available resources?
    *  Is query profiling regularly performed to identify and optimize potentially problematic queries?
    *  Is there any existing query queueing mechanism in place?

### 2.3 Mitigation Analysis

The original attack tree lists several general mitigations.  Here's a more detailed analysis and additional recommendations:

*   **2.3.1  Strict Query Resource Limits:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Essential.  This is the primary defense against memory exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Fine-grained Limits:**  Set different limits for different users or user groups based on their expected resource usage.  For example, administrative users might have higher limits than regular users.
        *   **Dynamic Limits:**  Consider implementing a system that dynamically adjusts resource limits based on current system load.  This can help prevent resource starvation during peak usage.
        *   **Per-Query Limits:**  Use `max_memory_usage` to limit memory consumption for individual queries.  This is crucial for preventing a single malicious query from bringing down the entire system.
        *   **Per-User Limits:**  Use `max_memory_usage_for_user` to limit the total memory consumption for all queries from a single user.  This prevents a user from launching multiple memory-intensive queries to bypass per-query limits.
        *   **Global Limits:**  Use `max_memory_usage_for_all_queries` to limit the total memory consumption for all queries across the entire ClickHouse instance.  This provides a final safety net.
        *   **Conservative Initial Values:**  Start with conservative values for all resource limits and gradually increase them as needed, based on monitoring and performance testing.
        *   **Regular Review:**  Regularly review and adjust resource limits based on changing workload patterns and system capacity.
*   **2.3.2  Query Profiling and Optimization:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Highly effective for identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks that could be exploited for memory exhaustion.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Regular Profiling:**  Integrate query profiling into the development and testing process.  Run profiling tools regularly to identify slow or memory-intensive queries.
        *   **Automated Analysis:**  Use tools that automatically analyze query profiles and suggest optimizations, such as adding indexes or rewriting queries.
        *   **Focus on High-Impact Queries:**  Prioritize optimization efforts on queries that are frequently executed or that consume a significant amount of resources.
        *   **Explain Plan Analysis:**  Use ClickHouse's `EXPLAIN` statement to understand how queries are executed and identify potential performance bottlenecks.
*   **2.3.3  Query Queueing:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Useful for managing resource contention and preventing a large number of concurrent queries from overwhelming the system.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Priority Queues:**  Implement priority queues to prioritize important queries over less critical ones.
        *   **Concurrency Limits:**  Limit the number of concurrent queries that can be executed at any given time.
        *   **Timeout Settings:**  Set appropriate timeouts for queries to prevent them from running indefinitely and consuming resources.
*   **2.3.4  Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Crucial for preventing attackers from injecting malicious code or data into queries.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Strict Validation:**  Validate all user-provided inputs against a whitelist of allowed values or patterns.  Reject any input that does not conform to the expected format.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.  Never directly embed user-provided input into SQL queries.
        *   **Escape Special Characters:**  If direct string concatenation is unavoidable, properly escape any special characters in user-provided input to prevent them from being interpreted as SQL code.
        *   **Limit Input Length:**  Enforce reasonable limits on the length of user-provided input to prevent excessively large values from being used in queries.
*   **2.3.5  Schema and Index Optimization:**
    *   **Effectiveness:**  Improves overall query performance and reduces the likelihood of memory exhaustion.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Appropriate Data Types:**  Use the most appropriate data types for each column to minimize storage and memory usage.
        *   **Indexing:**  Create indexes on columns that are frequently used in `WHERE` clauses, `JOIN` conditions, and `ORDER BY` clauses.
        *   **Materialized Views:**  Use materialized views to pre-compute expensive calculations and aggregations, reducing the need for complex queries at runtime.
        *   **Data Partitioning:**  Partition large tables based on a common query pattern (e.g., date) to improve query performance and reduce the amount of data that needs to be scanned.
*   **2.3.6  Avoid Unnecessary `SELECT *`:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Reduces the amount of data retrieved and processed, minimizing memory usage.
    *   **Recommendations:** Always explicitly list the columns needed in the `SELECT` statement.
*   **2.3.7  Use `LIMIT` and `OFFSET` Appropriately:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Controls the number of rows returned, preventing excessively large result sets.
    *   **Recommendations:**  Always use `LIMIT` to restrict the number of rows returned, especially when dealing with potentially large tables. Use `OFFSET` with caution, as it can become inefficient for large offsets. Consider using keyset pagination instead.
*  **2.3.8 Use `FINAL` modifier with caution:**
    * **Effectiveness:** `FINAL` ensures data consistency in `ReplacingMergeTree` and similar engines, but it can be memory-intensive.
    * **Recommendations:** Avoid using `FINAL` in queries that are susceptible to DoS attacks. If `FINAL` is necessary, ensure strict resource limits are in place.

### 2.4 Detection and Monitoring

Effective monitoring is crucial for detecting memory exhaustion attacks in progress and for identifying potential vulnerabilities.

*   **2.4.1  System Resource Monitoring:**
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **Memory Usage:**  Monitor overall system memory usage, ClickHouse process memory usage, and free memory.
        *   **Swap Usage:**  Monitor swap usage, as excessive swapping indicates memory pressure.
        *   **CPU Usage:**  Monitor CPU usage, as high CPU usage can be a side effect of memory contention.
        *   **Disk I/O:**  Monitor disk I/O, as high disk I/O can also be related to memory pressure.
    *   **Tools:**  Use standard system monitoring tools (e.g., `top`, `htop`, `vmstat`, `iostat`, Prometheus, Grafana).
    *   **Alerting:**  Set alerts for high memory usage, high swap usage, and low free memory.
*   **2.4.2  ClickHouse-Specific Monitoring:**
    *   **Metrics:**
        *   **`MemoryTracking`:**  Monitor the `MemoryTracking` metric in the `system.events` table to track memory allocation by ClickHouse.
        *   **`QueryMemoryUsage`:** Monitor memory usage per query using the `system.query_log` table.
        *   **`MergeTreeData.MemoryUsage`:** Monitor memory usage by MergeTree tables.
        *   **`OSMemoryUsage`:** Monitor overall OS memory usage.
        *   **Number of running queries:** Monitor the number of concurrently running queries.
    *   **Tools:**  Use ClickHouse's built-in monitoring tools (e.g., `system.metrics`, `system.events`, `system.query_log`, `system.asynchronous_metrics`).  Integrate with external monitoring systems like Prometheus and Grafana.
    *   **Alerting:**
        *   Set alerts for queries that exceed a predefined memory usage threshold.
        *   Set alerts for a high number of concurrent queries.
        *   Set alerts for queries that run for an excessively long time.
        *   Set alerts for errors related to memory allocation (e.g., "Memory limit (total) exceeded").
*   **2.4.3  Log Analysis:**
    *   **Logs:**  Monitor ClickHouse's error logs and query logs.
    *   **Patterns:**  Look for error messages related to memory allocation failures (e.g., "Memory limit exceeded").  Look for patterns of queries with high memory usage or long execution times.
    *   **Tools:**  Use log analysis tools (e.g., `grep`, `awk`, `sed`, ELK stack, Splunk) to search for relevant patterns.
*   **2.4.4  Application-Level Monitoring:**
    *   **Metrics:**  Track the number of requests, response times, and error rates for API endpoints that interact with ClickHouse.
    *   **Alerting:**  Set alerts for high error rates or slow response times, which could indicate a DoS attack.

### 2.5 Code Review Guidance

During code reviews, pay close attention to the following:

*   **SQL Queries:**  Carefully review all SQL queries that interact with ClickHouse, paying particular attention to the attack vectors listed in Section 2.1.
*   **User Input Handling:**  Ensure that all user-provided inputs are properly validated and sanitized before being used in SQL queries.
*   **Resource Limits:**  Verify that appropriate resource limits are set for all ClickHouse users and queries.
*   **Error Handling:**  Ensure that the application gracefully handles errors returned by ClickHouse, especially errors related to memory allocation failures.
*   **Data Model:** Review the data model and indexing strategy to ensure they are optimized for performance.
*   **Use of ClickHouse Features:**  Review the use of ClickHouse-specific features, such as array data types, window functions, and recursive CTEs, to ensure they are used safely and efficiently.

## 3. Conclusion

Memory exhaustion attacks against ClickHouse can be effectively mitigated through a combination of strict resource limits, query optimization, input validation, and careful monitoring.  By following the recommendations in this analysis, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of successful DoS attacks targeting the application's ClickHouse deployment.  Regular security audits and penetration testing should be conducted to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities. Continuous monitoring and proactive response are essential for maintaining the availability and reliability of the application.
