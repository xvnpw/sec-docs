# Threat Model Analysis for clickhouse/clickhouse

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via Spoofed Connection](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_spoofed_connection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker impersonates a legitimate client or server by forging credentials, certificates, or network addresses. They might use compromised credentials, perform a man-in-the-middle attack on an unencrypted connection, or exploit authentication vulnerabilities within ClickHouse's authentication mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized read and/or write access to data within ClickHouse, potentially leading to data breaches, data modification, or data deletion.
*   **Affected Component:** `Authentication mechanisms` (e.g., password authentication, TLS/SSL handshake, client certificate validation), `Network communication layer` (TCP/IP sockets, HTTP interface).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all ClickHouse users.
    *   Mandate TLS/SSL encryption for all client-server and inter-server communication.
    *   Implement and enforce strict server certificate validation on the client-side.  Do *not* disable certificate checks.
    *   Use client-side certificates for authentication where appropriate.
    *   Implement network-level access controls (firewalls, security groups) to restrict access to ClickHouse ports.
    *   Regularly rotate credentials and certificates.
    *   Utilize ClickHouse's built-in user management and access control features (users, roles, row-level security).

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Direct Access](./threats/data_tampering_via_direct_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains direct access to the ClickHouse server (e.g., through compromised credentials or a vulnerability in ClickHouse itself) and directly modifies, deletes, or inserts data using ClickHouse's native interface or HTTP API.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, incorrect reporting, and potential manipulation of application logic that relies on the compromised data.
*   **Affected Component:** `Data storage engine` (e.g., MergeTree family), `Query processing engine`, `Data access control mechanisms`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls (as described in the previous threat).
    *   Use ClickHouse's `readonly` user setting for users/applications that only require read access.
    *   Leverage ClickHouse's row-level security to restrict data modification based on user attributes.
    *   Implement data validation and integrity checks within the application *before* inserting data into ClickHouse (this helps prevent malicious data from being inserted, even if access controls are bypassed).
    *   Consider using MergeTree engine families with data versioning (e.g., `VersionedCollapsingMergeTree`).
    *   Regularly audit ClickHouse logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Implement robust backup and disaster recovery procedures.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering](./threats/configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the ClickHouse server and modifies configuration files (e.g., `config.xml`, `users.xml`) to weaken security, disable logging, or alter server behavior.  This could involve disabling authentication, changing network settings, or modifying resource limits, directly impacting ClickHouse's security posture.
*   **Impact:** Reduced security posture, potential for data breaches, denial of service, and loss of audit trails.
*   **Affected Component:** `Configuration files` (`config.xml`, `users.xml`, and other configuration files in the ClickHouse configuration directory).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to ClickHouse configuration files to authorized administrators only (using operating system-level permissions).
    *   Monitor configuration files for unauthorized changes using file integrity monitoring tools.
    *   Store configuration files in a secure location, separate from the data directory.
    *   Regularly back up configuration files.
    *   Implement change management procedures for configuration updates.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of complex queries, inserts massive amounts of data at a high rate, or otherwise overwhelms the ClickHouse server's resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network bandwidth) *directly* targeting ClickHouse's capabilities.
*   **Impact:** ClickHouse server becomes unresponsive or crashes, leading to service unavailability for legitimate users.
*   **Affected Component:** `Query processing engine`, `Data storage engine`, `Network communication layer`, `Resource management components` (memory manager, thread pool).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure ClickHouse resource limits (e.g., `max_memory_usage`, `max_threads`, `max_concurrent_queries`, `max_execution_time`).
    *   Implement rate limiting in the application to control the frequency and volume of requests to ClickHouse (this is a *supporting* mitigation, as the core issue is ClickHouse's resource handling).
    *   Use ClickHouse's query complexity restrictions (e.g., `max_ast_depth`, `max_ast_elements`, `max_expanded_ast_elements`).
    *   Monitor ClickHouse server performance and resource usage to detect and respond to DoS attempts.
    *   Consider using a load balancer or proxy in front of ClickHouse to distribute traffic (again, a supporting mitigation).
    *   Design queries and data ingestion processes efficiently to minimize resource consumption.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via ClickHouse Vulnerability](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_clickhouse_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability *within ClickHouse itself* (e.g., a buffer overflow, code injection) could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the ClickHouse process. This is distinct from application-level vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Potential for complete server compromise, data breaches, data modification, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially any component of ClickHouse, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep ClickHouse up to date with the latest security patches. Subscribe to ClickHouse security advisories and update promptly.
    *   Run ClickHouse as a non-root user with limited privileges.
    *   Regularly audit the ClickHouse server and its dependencies for vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a containerized deployment (e.g., Docker) to isolate ClickHouse from the host operating system.
    *   Implement security hardening measures on the host operating system.

## Threat: [Data Loss Due to Disk Failure (Operational, High Impact)](./threats/data_loss_due_to_disk_failure__operational__high_impact_.md)

* **Description:** Hardware failure (e.g., hard drive crash) on the ClickHouse server leads to data loss. While operational, the impact is high and directly related to ClickHouse data storage.
* **Impact:** Loss of data stored in ClickHouse.
* **Affected Component:** `Data storage engine`, underlying storage hardware.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks) for data redundancy.
    * Use a distributed ClickHouse cluster with replication to ensure data availability even if one node fails.
    * Regularly back up ClickHouse data to a separate location.
    * Monitor disk health and replace failing disks proactively.
