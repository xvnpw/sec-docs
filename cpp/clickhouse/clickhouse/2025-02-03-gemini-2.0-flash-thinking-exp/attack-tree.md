## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit ClickHouse SQL Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_clickhouse_sql_injection_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into ClickHouse queries, typically through user-supplied input that is not properly sanitized. This can lead to unauthorized data access, manipulation, or even potentially server-side command execution in severe cases (especially with ClickHouse specific functions).
*   **Target Interfaces:** Primarily HTTP and TCP interfaces used to interact with ClickHouse.
*   **Specific Techniques (High-Risk Sub-Paths):**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Inject malicious SQL in `query` parameter [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers target the `query` parameter in HTTP GET or POST requests to inject SQL code directly. This is a common and easily accessible attack vector if input validation is weak or missing.
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Utilize ClickHouse specific functions for injection (e.g., `url`, `file`, `remote`) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers leverage ClickHouse-specific SQL functions like `url`, `file`, and `remote` within SQL injection attacks. These functions, designed for data integration, can be abused to read arbitrary files from the server (`file`), initiate Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks (`url`), or connect to external systems (`remote`), significantly escalating the impact of SQL injection.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data used in ClickHouse queries. Use parameterized queries or prepared statements where possible. Regularly update ClickHouse to patch known SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit ClickHouse Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_clickhouse_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses__critical_node___high_6fb0e084.md)

*   **Attack Description:** Attackers exploit weak or misconfigured authentication and authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to ClickHouse and its data. This is a direct path to compromising the entire ClickHouse instance and potentially the application.
*   **Specific Techniques (High-Risk Sub-Paths):**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Default or Weak Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Attempt default credentials (if not changed) [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers attempt to log in using default credentials that are often well-known and easily guessed. If default credentials are not changed, especially in development or testing environments, this attack is highly likely to succeed with minimal effort.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Enforce strong password policies for ClickHouse users. Change default credentials immediately after installation. Implement account lockout policies for failed login attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit ClickHouse Specific Features for Data Exfiltration or Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_clickhouse_specific_features_for_data_exfiltration_or_manipulation__critical_4e1ae9a3.md)

*   **Attack Description:** Attackers misuse ClickHouse-specific features, particularly table functions, to bypass intended application logic, exfiltrate sensitive data, or manipulate data in ways not intended by the application developers.
*   **Specific Techniques (High-Risk Sub-Paths):**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Abuse Table Functions (e.g., `url`, `file`, `remote`, `hdfs`) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] `url` function abuse [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Read arbitrary files from ClickHouse server using `url('file:///etc/passwd')` in SQL injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers exploit SQL injection to use the `url` function with the `file://` protocol to read local files from the ClickHouse server. This can expose sensitive system files like `/etc/passwd`, leading to credential disclosure and further compromise.
            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Initiate Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) using `url('http://malicious-external-site')` in SQL injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers use SQL injection and the `url` function with `http://` or `https://` protocols to make requests to arbitrary external or internal servers from the ClickHouse server. This can be used to probe internal networks, bypass firewalls, or potentially gain access to other internal systems.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Disable or restrict usage of dangerous table functions like `url`, `file`, `remote`, `hdfs` if not absolutely necessary for application functionality. Implement strict input validation and sanitization even when using these functions. Consider ClickHouse settings to disable or restrict these functions globally.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit ClickHouse Server Vulnerabilities (Software Bugs) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_clickhouse_server_vulnerabilities__software_bugs___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Description:** Attackers exploit software vulnerabilities (bugs) in the ClickHouse server software itself. This can range from known vulnerabilities in older versions to zero-day vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences like Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or complete system compromise.
*   **Specific Techniques (High-Risk Sub-Paths):**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in ClickHouse server software [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers utilize publicly known exploits for vulnerabilities in older ClickHouse versions or develop exploits for newly discovered (zero-day) vulnerabilities. Exploiting known vulnerabilities is significantly easier as exploit code and information are often readily available.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Regularly update ClickHouse to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block malicious traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Insufficient Logging and Monitoring [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__insufficient_logging_and_monitoring__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Description:** Lack of adequate logging and monitoring is not a direct attack vector itself, but it is a critical weakness that significantly hinders the ability to detect, respond to, and recover from *any* type of attack. It allows attackers to operate undetected for longer periods, increasing the potential damage.
*   **Specific Techniques:**  This is not about specific attack techniques, but rather the *absence* of security controls. The attacker benefits from the lack of visibility into their actions.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for ClickHouse. Monitor query logs, error logs, and system metrics. Integrate ClickHouse logs with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Running Outdated ClickHouse Version [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__running_outdated_clickhouse_version__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Description:** Running an outdated version of ClickHouse directly increases the attack surface because it likely contains known, unpatched vulnerabilities. Attackers can easily target these known vulnerabilities, as exploits and vulnerability information are often publicly available.
*   **Specific Techniques (High-Risk Sub-Paths):**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Using an old, unpatched version of ClickHouse with known vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Attackers identify the version of ClickHouse being used (e.g., through banner grabbing or error messages) and then search for known vulnerabilities affecting that version. They can then utilize readily available exploit code to compromise the system.
*   **Actionable Insight:** Maintain a regular patching schedule for ClickHouse. Subscribe to security advisories and promptly apply security updates.
