# BUSINESS POSTURE

ClickHouse is a fast open-source column-oriented database management system that allows users to generate analytical data reports in real-time. The primary business goal for ClickHouse is to provide a highly performant and scalable solution for online analytical processing (OLAP). This enables businesses to gain insights from large datasets quickly, supporting data-driven decision-making.

Business priorities include:

- Performance: Delivering query results with minimal latency is critical for interactive analytics.
- Scalability: Handling ever-increasing data volumes and user concurrency is essential.
- Reliability: Ensuring data integrity and system availability is paramount for business continuity.
- Open Source: Maintaining a vibrant open-source community and ecosystem is important for adoption and innovation.

Key business risks associated with ClickHouse include:

- Data breaches: Unauthorized access to sensitive analytical data could lead to financial loss, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties.
- Data integrity issues: Corruption or loss of data could compromise the accuracy of analytical insights and business decisions.
- Availability disruptions: System downtime can interrupt critical analytical processes and impact business operations.
- Performance degradation: Slow query performance can hinder user productivity and diminish the value of real-time analytics.
- Supply chain vulnerabilities: Compromised dependencies in the build or deployment process could introduce security weaknesses.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Access control lists (ACLs) for database access. (Implementation details would be in ClickHouse documentation and configuration)
- security control: Role-based access control (RBAC) for managing user permissions. (Implementation details would be in ClickHouse documentation and configuration)
- security control: Encryption of data in transit using TLS/SSL. (Implementation details would be in ClickHouse documentation and configuration)
- security control: Encryption of data at rest. (Implementation details would be in ClickHouse documentation and configuration, likely configurable)
- security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning. (Likely performed by ClickHouse developers and community, details in public security reports if available)
- security control: Secure software development lifecycle (SSDLC) practices. (Assumed for a project of this scale, but details are not explicitly provided in the input)
- security control: Code reviews and static analysis. (Likely part of the development process, details not explicitly provided)
- security control: Input validation and sanitization. (Expected to be implemented within the database engine, details in code and documentation)

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Complexity of configuration can lead to misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities if not properly managed.
- accepted risk: Open-source nature implies reliance on community for vulnerability patching and security updates, which may have SLAs different from commercial offerings.
- accepted risk: Potential for SQL injection vulnerabilities if input validation is not comprehensive across all features.

Recommended Security Controls:

- security control: Implement automated security testing (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Establish a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
- security control: Implement security information and event management (SIEM) integration for monitoring and alerting on security events.
- security control: Regularly perform penetration testing to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement database activity monitoring (DAM) to track and audit database access and operations.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Securely authenticate users accessing the ClickHouse database.
    - Requirement: Support multiple authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, LDAP, Kerberos).
    - Requirement: Enforce strong password policies.
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement granular access control to manage user permissions on databases, tables, and operations.
    - Requirement: Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.
    - Requirement: Audit authorization decisions and access attempts.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection).
    - Requirement: Sanitize inputs before processing and storing them in the database.
    - Requirement: Implement input validation at multiple layers (e.g., application and database).
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms for data in transit (TLS/SSL).
    - Requirement: Use strong encryption algorithms for data at rest (e.g., AES-256).
    - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- Real-time analytical reporting: Providing timely insights for business decision-making.
- Data-driven decision support: Enabling users to make informed decisions based on data analysis.
- Business performance monitoring: Tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) and identifying trends.
- Fraud detection: Analyzing data to identify and prevent fraudulent activities.
- Log analysis and security monitoring: Analyzing logs for security events and incident response.

Data Sensitivity:

- Analytical data: Sensitivity depends on the nature of the data being analyzed. It can range from publicly available data to highly sensitive customer data, financial data, or personal identifiable information (PII).
- Metadata: Database schemas, user information, access logs, and audit logs can also be sensitive and require protection.
- Configuration data: Database configuration files, connection strings, and encryption keys are highly sensitive and must be protected.

Data Sensitivity Levels (example, needs to be defined based on actual data):

- Public: Publicly available aggregated data. Low sensitivity.
- Internal: Internal business data, not intended for public disclosure. Medium sensitivity.
- Confidential: Sensitive business data, requiring strict access control. High sensitivity.
- Highly Confidential: PII, financial data, or other regulated data. Very high sensitivity.
