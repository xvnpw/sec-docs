# Attack Surface Analysis for clickhouse/clickhouse

## Attack Surface: [1. Network Exposure of Default Ports (High Severity Scenario)](./attack_surfaces/1__network_exposure_of_default_ports__high_severity_scenario_.md)

*   **Description:** ClickHouse services are exposed on default network ports, directly accessible from untrusted networks, increasing vulnerability to exploitation.
*   **ClickHouse Contribution:** ClickHouse defaults to listening on well-known ports `8123` (HTTP) and `9000` (native TCP), making it easily discoverable if exposed to the internet or less trusted networks without access controls.
*   **Example:** A ClickHouse server running with default ports is directly exposed to the internet. Attackers scan for port `8123` and `9000` and attempt to exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations from anywhere on the internet.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to ClickHouse, data breach, denial of service, complete server compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (when default ports are exposed to untrusted networks like the internet without proper access control).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Network Access:** Implement strict firewall rules to limit access to ClickHouse ports (`8123`, `9000`, and any other configured ports) only from trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
    *   **Consider Non-Default Ports:** Change default ports to less predictable values as an additional security measure.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unencrypted HTTP Interface](./attack_surfaces/2__unencrypted_http_interface.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive data transmitted over the default unencrypted HTTP interface is vulnerable to eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **ClickHouse Contribution:** ClickHouse's default HTTP interface on port `8123` operates over unencrypted HTTP. This exposes all communication, including queries and data, to potential interception.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as a client communicating with ClickHouse over HTTP can intercept network traffic and read sensitive data being transmitted, including query parameters and results.
*   **Impact:** Data breach due to eavesdropping, potential credential theft if basic authentication is used over HTTP, data manipulation through man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (especially when transmitting sensitive data or using authentication over HTTP).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enable HTTPS/TLS:**  Mandatory to enable HTTPS/TLS for the HTTP interface by configuring `https_port` and TLS settings in ClickHouse configuration. Use valid SSL/TLS certificates.
    *   **Disable HTTP if Unnecessary:** If the HTTP interface is not required, disable it entirely to eliminate this attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [3. Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/3__weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default or easily guessable passwords for ClickHouse user accounts allows trivial unauthorized access.
*   **ClickHouse Contribution:** ClickHouse often initializes with a `default` user account that may have no password or a weak default password. If not immediately secured, this account is a critical vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker attempts to log in to ClickHouse using the `default` username and a common default password or no password. Successful login grants full access to ClickHouse.
*   **Impact:** Complete unauthorized access, data breach, data manipulation, data deletion, denial of service, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if default credentials are used in any environment, especially production).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Set Strong Passwords Immediately:**  Forcefully set strong, unique passwords for the `default` user and all other ClickHouse user accounts upon deployment.
    *   **Implement Password Policies:** Enforce password complexity and rotation policies for all ClickHouse users.
    *   **Disable or Remove Default User:** If the `default` user is not essential, disable or completely remove it.

## Attack Surface: [4. Resource Exhaustion via Complex Queries (Denial of Service - High Severity Scenario)](./attack_surfaces/4__resource_exhaustion_via_complex_queries__denial_of_service_-_high_severity_scenario_.md)

*   **Description:**  Maliciously crafted, extremely complex queries can overwhelm ClickHouse server resources, leading to denial of service for all users.
*   **ClickHouse Contribution:** ClickHouse, while performant, can be resource-intensive when processing very complex analytical queries. Attackers can exploit this by sending queries designed to consume excessive resources.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods ClickHouse with highly complex aggregation queries or queries that scan massive datasets without filters. This exhausts CPU, memory, and disk I/O, causing ClickHouse to become unresponsive and deny service to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, service unavailability, performance degradation, business disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if easily exploitable, especially from external networks, and can cause significant service disruption).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Query Complexity Limits:** Configure ClickHouse settings to limit query complexity based on execution time, memory usage, and processed rows.
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Define resource quotas to restrict resource consumption per user or query source.
    *   **Query Monitoring and Throttling:** Monitor query performance, log slow queries, and implement query throttling or rate limiting to control resource usage.

## Attack Surface: [5. User-Defined Functions (UDFs) Security](./attack_surfaces/5__user-defined_functions__udfs__security.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious or vulnerable User-Defined Functions (UDFs) can introduce severe security risks, including remote code execution on the ClickHouse server.
*   **ClickHouse Contribution:** ClickHouse allows UDFs, which, if not properly secured, can be exploited to execute arbitrary code within the ClickHouse server's context.
*   **Example:** A malicious user creates a UDF in Python that executes system commands. If this UDF is executed, it can allow the attacker to gain complete control of the ClickHouse server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, privilege escalation, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if UDF creation and execution are not strictly controlled and UDFs are not thoroughly vetted, especially if leading to RCE).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict UDF Creation:** Limit UDF creation privileges to only highly trusted administrators.
    *   **Strict Code Review and Audit:** Mandate thorough code reviews and security audits for all UDFs before deployment.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary UDF Languages:** Disable UDF language support that is not required to minimize potential risks.
    *   **Consider Sandboxing (If Available and Effective):** Explore and implement any available sandboxing mechanisms for UDF execution to limit their capabilities.
    *   **Monitor UDF Usage:** Log and monitor UDF execution for suspicious activity.
