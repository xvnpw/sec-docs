# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for clickhouse/clickhouse

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within ClickHouse](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__within_clickhouse.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** ClickHouse Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define ClickHouse Roles:**  Within ClickHouse, identify necessary roles based on user functions and required data access. Examples: `read_only_analyst`, `data_engineer`, `admin_role`.
    2.  **Create Roles using ClickHouse SQL:** Use ClickHouse's `CREATE ROLE` command to define these roles directly in ClickHouse.  Example: `CREATE ROLE read_only_analyst;`
    3.  **Grant Granular Permissions within ClickHouse:**  Utilize `GRANT` statements in ClickHouse SQL to assign specific permissions to each role. Focus on limiting access to databases, tables, columns, and operations (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `ALTER`) based on the principle of least privilege. Example: `GRANT SELECT ON database_name.sensitive_table TO read_only_analyst;`
    4.  **Create ClickHouse Users:** Create user accounts directly within ClickHouse using `CREATE USER`.
    5.  **Assign ClickHouse Roles to Users:**  Use `GRANT <role> TO <user>` to assign the defined ClickHouse roles to individual users. Example: `GRANT read_only_analyst TO analyst_user;`
    6.  **Regularly Review ClickHouse Roles and Permissions:** Periodically audit and update roles and permissions within ClickHouse to maintain alignment with security needs and remove any unnecessary access.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Users within ClickHouse gaining access to sensitive data they are not authorized to view.
    *   **Data Modification or Deletion by Unauthorized ClickHouse Users (High Severity):**  Users with ClickHouse accounts accidentally or maliciously altering or deleting data they shouldn't have access to modify.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within ClickHouse (Medium Severity):** Users with limited ClickHouse privileges attempting to gain higher privileges within the ClickHouse system.
    *   **Insider Threats leveraging ClickHouse Access (Medium Severity):** Malicious actions by authorized ClickHouse users exceeding their intended and permitted access within ClickHouse.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** **Significant Reduction** - ClickHouse RBAC directly controls data access within the database based on defined roles.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion:** **Significant Reduction** - ClickHouse permissions restrict data modification and deletion operations based on roles.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** **Moderate Reduction** - Well-defined ClickHouse roles limit the scope for privilege escalation attempts within the database system.
    *   **Insider Threats:** **Moderate Reduction** -  Limits the potential damage an insider with ClickHouse access can cause by restricting their permissions within the database.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented within ClickHouse. User accounts exist, and basic `GRANT SELECT` is used. However, formal roles are not consistently defined or applied across all databases and tables within ClickHouse.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal definition of roles *within ClickHouse* based on user functions.
    *   Granular permission assignment to roles *within ClickHouse* for all databases and tables.
    *   Consistent role assignment to all users *within ClickHouse*.
    *   Regular review and update process for roles and permissions *within ClickHouse*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies for ClickHouse Users](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies_for_clickhouse_users.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strong Password Policies for ClickHouse User Accounts

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define ClickHouse Password Complexity Requirements:** Establish rules specifically for ClickHouse user passwords, including minimum length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols). Document these requirements for ClickHouse user account creation.
    2.  **Encourage Password Complexity for ClickHouse Users:**  While ClickHouse itself has limited built-in password complexity enforcement, strongly encourage users to create strong passwords for their ClickHouse accounts through documentation, user training, and account creation guidelines.
    3.  **Encourage/Enforce Password Rotation for ClickHouse Users:** Recommend or mandate regular password changes for ClickHouse user accounts (e.g., every 90 days). Communicate this policy to ClickHouse users.
    4.  **Password Management Guidance for ClickHouse Users:** Provide ClickHouse users with guidance on creating and managing strong, unique passwords specifically for their ClickHouse accounts, and discourage password reuse across different systems including ClickHouse.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks against ClickHouse Authentication (High Severity):** Attackers attempting to guess ClickHouse user passwords through automated trials against ClickHouse's authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks against ClickHouse Authentication (High Severity):** Attackers using lists of common passwords to try and gain access to ClickHouse user accounts.
    *   **Credential Stuffing targeting ClickHouse (High Severity):** Attackers using compromised credentials from other services to attempt access to ClickHouse user accounts.
    *   **Exploitation of Weak/Default ClickHouse Passwords (High Severity):** Easily guessable or unchanged default passwords on ClickHouse user accounts being exploited.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks against ClickHouse:** **Significant Reduction** - Strong ClickHouse passwords make brute-force attacks against ClickHouse user accounts significantly harder.
    *   **Dictionary Attacks against ClickHouse:** **Significant Reduction** - Complex ClickHouse passwords are less likely to be found in dictionary lists used against ClickHouse authentication.
    *   **Credential Stuffing targeting ClickHouse:** **Moderate Reduction** - Unique ClickHouse passwords prevent compromise if credentials from other services are leaked and tried against ClickHouse.
    *   **Weak/Default ClickHouse Passwords:** **Significant Reduction** - Eliminates the risk of easily guessable passwords for ClickHouse user accounts.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented for ClickHouse users. Users are informally advised to use strong passwords for ClickHouse accounts. No formal password complexity requirements are documented or enforced specifically for ClickHouse.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Documented password complexity requirements *specifically for ClickHouse user accounts*.
    *   Formal enforcement of password complexity for ClickHouse users (if possible within ClickHouse or external authentication used with ClickHouse).
    *   Mandatory password rotation policy for ClickHouse users.
    *   User training specifically on strong password practices for ClickHouse accounts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce TLS Encryption for ClickHouse Client-Server Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_tls_encryption_for_clickhouse_client-server_communication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** ClickHouse TLS Encryption

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS Certificates for ClickHouse:** Acquire TLS/SSL certificates for the ClickHouse server specifically for securing ClickHouse client connections (e.g., from a Certificate Authority or self-signed certificates for internal use).
    2.  **Configure ClickHouse for TLS (Native Interface):**  Modify the ClickHouse server's `config.xml` configuration file to explicitly enable TLS encryption for the ClickHouse native interface (port 9000).  Specify the paths to the TLS certificate and private key files *within the ClickHouse configuration*.
    3.  **Configure ClickHouse for TLS (HTTP Interface):** If the ClickHouse HTTP interface (port 8123) is used, configure TLS in the HTTP server settings section of `config.xml`, similarly providing the certificate and key file paths *within the ClickHouse configuration*.
    4.  **Configure ClickHouse Clients for TLS:** Ensure all client applications and tools connecting to ClickHouse are configured to use TLS encryption. Specify the necessary TLS settings in client connection strings or configurations to connect to ClickHouse over TLS.
    5.  **Disable Non-TLS Connections in ClickHouse:**  Within ClickHouse configuration, disable or restrict non-TLS connections to both the native and HTTP interfaces to enforce that all communication with ClickHouse is encrypted.
    6.  **Implement ClickHouse Certificate Management:** Establish a process for managing and rotating TLS certificates used by ClickHouse before they expire, ensuring continuous TLS protection for ClickHouse connections.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping/Sniffing of ClickHouse Traffic (High Severity):** Attackers intercepting network traffic to read sensitive data transmitted between clients and the ClickHouse server, specifically targeting ClickHouse communication.

    *   **Data Exposure in Transit to/from ClickHouse (High Severity):** Sensitive data related to ClickHouse queries and results being transmitted in plaintext over the network.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping/Sniffing of ClickHouse Traffic:** **Significant Reduction** - ClickHouse TLS encryption renders intercepted ClickHouse-related traffic unreadable.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on ClickHouse Connections:** **Significant Reduction** - ClickHouse TLS provides authentication and integrity for ClickHouse communication, making MITM attacks significantly harder.
    *   **Data Exposure in Transit to/from ClickHouse:** **Significant Reduction** - Ensures all data transmitted between clients and ClickHouse is encrypted and protected during transit.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented for ClickHouse. TLS is configured for the HTTP interface (port 8123) in ClickHouse using self-signed certificates.  The native interface (port 9000) of ClickHouse is not currently using TLS.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   TLS encryption for the ClickHouse native interface (port 9000) *within ClickHouse configuration*.
    *   Use of certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority for ClickHouse TLS (currently self-signed for HTTP).
    *   Enforcement of TLS-only connections to ClickHouse (non-TLS connections are still possible on port 9000 of ClickHouse).
    *   Formal certificate management and rotation process *for ClickHouse TLS certificates*.
    *   Client applications are not consistently configured to use TLS for native connections to ClickHouse.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Query Limits and Resource Controls within ClickHouse](./mitigation_strategies/implement_query_limits_and_resource_controls_within_clickhouse.md)
