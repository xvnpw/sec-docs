## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_sql_injection.md)

* **Improper Input Sanitization in Application:**
    * Attack Vector: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input before incorporating it into ClickHouse SQL queries.
* **Crafted Malicious SQL Query:**
    * Attack Vector: The attacker leverages the lack of input sanitization to inject malicious SQL code into the query. This often involves understanding ClickHouse-specific syntax and functions.
* **`Inject Query to Exfiltrate Data` (Critical Node):**
    * Attack Vector: The injected SQL code is designed to extract sensitive data from the ClickHouse database and transmit it to the attacker.
* **`Inject Query to Modify Data` (Critical Node):**
    * Attack Vector: The injected SQL code is designed to alter or corrupt data within the ClickHouse database, potentially causing application malfunction or data integrity issues.
* **`Inject Query to Execute Arbitrary Commands (via functions like system)` (Critical Node):**
    * Attack Vector: If ClickHouse is configured to allow the use of functions like `system`, the attacker can inject SQL code to execute arbitrary operating system commands on the ClickHouse server, leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Weak Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_weak_credentials.md)

* **`Exploit Weak or Default Credentials` (Critical Node):**
    * Attack Vector: The ClickHouse instance is configured with default credentials or easily guessable passwords. The attacker simply uses these credentials to gain unauthorized access to ClickHouse.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: API Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_api_abuse.md)

* **`Exploit Weak or Default Credentials` (Critical Node - Shared with Path 2):**
    * Attack Vector: As described above, gaining initial access via weak credentials is a common starting point.
* **Unauthorized Data Insertion/Modification:**
    * Attack Vector: Once authenticated (or if authentication is bypassed), the attacker uses the ClickHouse HTTP API endpoints to insert malicious data or modify existing data without proper authorization checks.
* **Data Deletion:**
    * Attack Vector:  Similar to data modification, the attacker uses API endpoints to delete critical data from ClickHouse, leading to data loss and potential application failure.
* **Access Sensitive Data via API Endpoints:**
    * Attack Vector: The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the API's authorization mechanisms to access sensitive data through API endpoints that should be restricted.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4: Configuration Takeover](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4_configuration_takeover.md)

* **Exploiting Default Ports/Services:**
    * Attack Vector: ClickHouse services are exposed on default ports without proper firewalling, making them easily discoverable and accessible to attackers.
* **Weak Security Settings:**
    * Attack Vector: ClickHouse is configured with weak security settings, such as disabled authentication or overly permissive access controls, making it easier for attackers to gain unauthorized access.
* **`Modify Configuration to Allow Malicious Actions` (Critical Node):**
    * Attack Vector: If the attacker gains access to the ClickHouse configuration files (potentially through OS-level vulnerabilities or by exploiting the initial weak configuration), they can modify the configuration to disable security features, enable remote access, or grant themselves higher privileges, leading to full control over ClickHouse.
