# Attack Surface Analysis for clickhouse/clickhouse

## Attack Surface: [Exposed ClickHouse Server Ports (HTTP/Native)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_clickhouse_server_ports__httpnative_.md)

*   **Description:** ClickHouse listens on specific ports (default 8123 for HTTP, 9000 for native TCP) for client connections. If these ports are directly accessible from untrusted networks, they become entry points for attackers.
    *   **How ClickHouse Contributes:** ClickHouse's core functionality relies on these ports for communication. Without them, clients cannot interact with the database.
    *   **Example:** An attacker scans the internet for open port 8123 and attempts to connect to a ClickHouse instance, trying default credentials or exploiting known vulnerabilities in the HTTP interface.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, potential data exfiltration, data modification or deletion, denial of service by overwhelming the server with connection attempts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to ClickHouse ports from only trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
        *   Use a VPN or other secure tunnel for remote access.
        *   Avoid exposing ClickHouse ports directly to the public internet.
        *   Consider using ClickHouse Keeper for internal cluster communication instead of directly exposing inter-node ports.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Authentication Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_authentication_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using default usernames and passwords or easily guessable credentials for ClickHouse users.
    *   **How ClickHouse Contributes:** ClickHouse relies on user authentication to control access to data and functionality. Weak credentials bypass this security mechanism.
    *   **Example:** An administrator sets up a ClickHouse instance and uses the default username 'default' with a simple password. An attacker finds this information online or through a brute-force attack.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the ClickHouse instance, full access to all data, ability to modify or delete data, potential for further lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies, requiring complex and unique passwords.
        *   Immediately change default usernames and passwords upon installation.
        *   Consider using more robust authentication methods like LDAP or Kerberos.
        *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of User-Defined Functions (UDFs)](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_user-defined_functions__udfs_.md)

*   **Description:** If user-defined functions are enabled, and the process for creating or managing them is not secure, attackers could introduce malicious code.
    *   **How ClickHouse Contributes:** ClickHouse allows extending its functionality with UDFs, which can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a ClickHouse instance with permissions to create UDFs and uploads a function that executes system commands, allowing them to gain shell access to the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the ClickHouse server, full system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (if UDF creation is not properly controlled)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully control who has the permission to create and manage UDFs.
        *   Implement a review process for UDF code before deployment.
        *   Consider disabling UDFs if they are not strictly necessary.
        *   Run ClickHouse with restricted user privileges to limit the impact of malicious UDFs.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Settings](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_settings.md)

*   **Description:** Leaving default or insecure configuration settings enabled in ClickHouse.
    *   **How ClickHouse Contributes:** ClickHouse's behavior and security posture are heavily influenced by its configuration. Insecure settings can directly create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Leaving the `listen_host` configuration set to `::` (listening on all interfaces) without proper firewall rules, making the server accessible from the internet. Or disabling authentication requirements for certain interfaces.
    *   **Impact:**  Increased exposure to attacks, potential for unauthorized access, data leaks, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review and harden the ClickHouse configuration based on security best practices.
        *   Restrict `listen_host` to specific internal interfaces if external access is not required.
        *   Enable and configure appropriate authentication mechanisms.
        *   Disable unnecessary features or interfaces.
        *   Regularly review and update the ClickHouse configuration.
