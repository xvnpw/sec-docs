# Threat Model Analysis for clickhouse/clickhouse

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries that are executed by the ClickHouse server due to vulnerabilities in the application's query construction. This directly targets ClickHouse's SQL parsing and execution.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within ClickHouse, modification or deletion of data, potential execution of arbitrary commands on the ClickHouse server (depending on ClickHouse configuration and privileges).
*   **Affected Component:** ClickHouse Query Processing, specifically the SQL parser and execution engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements within the application to prevent direct injection of user input into SQL queries sent to ClickHouse.
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for the database user used by the application to interact with ClickHouse.

## Threat: [Exposure of ClickHouse Configuration Details](./threats/exposure_of_clickhouse_configuration_details.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive ClickHouse configuration files (e.g., `config.xml`, users configuration) directly from the ClickHouse server due to insecure file permissions or misconfigurations on the server itself.
*   **Impact:** Disclosure of ClickHouse database credentials (usernames, passwords), internal network configurations relevant to ClickHouse, and potentially sensitive settings that could be exploited for further attacks or to gain unauthorized access directly to ClickHouse.
*   **Affected Component:** ClickHouse Server Configuration Files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Securely store and manage ClickHouse configuration files with appropriate file system permissions, restricting access to authorized users and processes on the ClickHouse server only.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files; consider using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions managed at the server level.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Queries](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_malicious_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker directly sends complex or resource-intensive queries to the ClickHouse server (e.g., by exploiting an open HTTP interface or through compromised credentials) that consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk I/O on the ClickHouse server itself.
*   **Impact:** Performance degradation for legitimate users of ClickHouse, potential denial of service of the ClickHouse server, and instability of the ClickHouse instance.
*   **Affected Component:** ClickHouse Query Processing and Resource Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query timeouts and resource limits within the ClickHouse server configuration.
    *   Analyze and optimize frequently executed queries within ClickHouse to minimize their resource footprint.
    *   Monitor ClickHouse resource usage directly and set up alerts for unusual activity on the server.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering via Exposed HTTP Interface](./threats/configuration_tampering_via_exposed_http_interface.md)

*   **Description:** If ClickHouse's HTTP interface is directly exposed without proper authentication or authorization on the ClickHouse server, attackers can send commands directly to the server to modify database settings, create or drop users, or perform other administrative actions.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the ClickHouse instance, including direct data manipulation, denial of service initiated at the server level, and potential privilege escalation within ClickHouse.
*   **Affected Component:** ClickHouse HTTP Interface.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the ClickHouse HTTP interface is not publicly accessible unless absolutely necessary.
    *   Enable and enforce strong authentication (username/password, TLS client certificates) directly on the ClickHouse HTTP interface.
    *   Restrict access to the HTTP interface to specific IP addresses or networks using firewall rules at the server level.

## Threat: [Exploiting Weak or Default Credentials](./threats/exploiting_weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The ClickHouse server itself has default or easily guessable administrative credentials, allowing direct unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the ClickHouse instance, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service directly impacting the server.
*   **Affected Component:** ClickHouse Authentication System.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Change all default ClickHouse passwords immediately upon installation.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for ClickHouse users directly within the ClickHouse configuration.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Server Communication in a ClickHouse Cluster](./threats/insecure_inter-server_communication_in_a_clickhouse_cluster.md)

*   **Description:** If a ClickHouse cluster involves multiple servers, communication directly between these ClickHouse servers (e.g., for replication or distributed queries) is not properly encrypted or authenticated.
*   **Impact:** Attackers on the network could eavesdrop on sensitive data being transferred between ClickHouse servers or potentially inject malicious data or commands directly into the ClickHouse cluster communication.
*   **Affected Component:** ClickHouse Inter-Server Communication (Replication, Distributed Query Processing).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce TLS encryption for inter-server communication within the ClickHouse cluster configuration.
    *   Implement proper authentication mechanisms for communication between ClickHouse servers.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ClickHouse Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_clickhouse_itself.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the ClickHouse server software itself.
*   **Impact:**  Can lead to a wide range of critical impacts, including remote code execution on the ClickHouse server, data breaches, denial of service, and complete server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Various core components of the ClickHouse server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the ClickHouse server updated to the latest stable version with security patches applied promptly.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to ClickHouse.
    *   Implement network segmentation and access controls to limit the attack surface of the ClickHouse server.

## Threat: [Insecure Backups and Recovery](./threats/insecure_backups_and_recovery.md)

*   **Description:** ClickHouse backups are not stored securely at the server level, or the ClickHouse recovery process itself has vulnerabilities that can be directly exploited.
*   **Impact:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data stored in ClickHouse backups, or they could manipulate the recovery process to compromise the ClickHouse instance directly.
*   **Affected Component:** ClickHouse Backup and Recovery Mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Encrypt ClickHouse backups at rest and in transit at the server level.
    *   Securely store backups in a location with restricted access at the server level.
    *   Regularly test the ClickHouse backup and recovery process to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the process itself.
