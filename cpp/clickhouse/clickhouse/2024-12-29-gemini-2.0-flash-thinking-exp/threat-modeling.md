Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving ClickHouse:

*   **Threat:** ClickHouse SQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious SQL code into queries by manipulating user input that is not properly sanitized or parameterized. This could allow them to bypass intended data access restrictions, potentially reading sensitive data, modifying existing data, or even executing arbitrary commands on the ClickHouse server (though less common).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification or deletion, potential for remote command execution (limited by ClickHouse's architecture), compromise of the ClickHouse instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Query processing engine, `clickhouse-server` process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements. Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side before sending data to ClickHouse. Enforce least privilege principles for database users.

*   **Threat:** Data Manipulation via HTTP API
    *   **Description:** If the ClickHouse HTTP API is enabled and not properly secured, an attacker could directly send malicious queries or data manipulation requests, bypassing application-level security controls.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, deletion, or retrieval. Potential for denial of service by sending resource-intensive queries.
    *   **Affected Component:** HTTP Handler, Query processing engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Secure the HTTP API with strong authentication (e.g., API keys, basic authentication). Restrict access to the API based on IP address or other criteria. Disable the HTTP API if not required.

*   **Threat:** Configuration File Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ClickHouse configuration files (e.g., `config.xml`, `users.xml`) and modifies them to alter the behavior of the database, potentially weakening security or enabling malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:** Weakened authentication, unauthorized access, potential for privilege escalation, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading module, `clickhouse-server` process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Restrict access to ClickHouse configuration files using appropriate file system permissions. Implement monitoring for changes to configuration files. Run the `clickhouse-server` process with minimal necessary privileges.

*   **Threat:** Replication Source Spoofing
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises or impersonates a legitimate replication source, injecting malicious or corrupted data into the ClickHouse cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption across the cluster, potential service disruption due to invalid data, introduction of backdoors or vulnerabilities through malicious data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Replication module, Inter-server communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Securely configure replication sources with strong authentication. Use mutual TLS for replication connections. Implement data integrity checks on replicated data. Monitor replication processes for anomalies.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion through Malicious Queries
    *   **Description:** Attackers craft complex or resource-intensive queries that consume excessive CPU, memory, or disk I/O on the ClickHouse server, leading to performance degradation or service unavailability (Denial of Service).
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, performance degradation affecting legitimate users, potential for system crashes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Query processing engine, Resource management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement query timeouts and resource limits within ClickHouse. Monitor resource usage and identify potentially malicious queries. Implement rate limiting for query execution.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting ClickHouse Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the ClickHouse software itself to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the ClickHouse instance, data breaches, service disruption, potential for lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various components depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update ClickHouse to the latest stable version and apply security patches promptly. Subscribe to security advisories for ClickHouse. Implement a vulnerability management program.

*   **Threat:** Abuse of `SYSTEM` Commands
    *   **Description:** Attackers with sufficient privileges abuse ClickHouse's `SYSTEM` commands to perform privileged actions on the server, potentially leading to security breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized access to the underlying system, potential for data manipulation or deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:** Command processing module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully control access to `SYSTEM` commands. Implement strict role-based access control. Audit the execution of `SYSTEM` commands. Consider disabling or restricting access to potentially dangerous commands.
