## ClickHouse Application Threat Model - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Attacker's Goal:** To gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulate data, or gain control over the application's infrastructure by exploiting weaknesses within the ClickHouse database system.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* **[CRITICAL] Data Exfiltration (High-Risk Path)**
    * **SQL Injection**
* **[CRITICAL] Data Modification (High-Risk Path)**
    * **SQL Injection (UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE)**
* **[CRITICAL] Server Compromise (High-Risk Path)**
    * **Abusing Insecure Configurations (Weak Passwords, Exposed Ports)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. [CRITICAL] Data Exfiltration (High-Risk Path)**

* **Attack Vector: SQL Injection**
    * **Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to data within the ClickHouse database.
    * **How:**
        * The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided data before embedding it into SQL queries executed against ClickHouse.
        * The application constructs SQL queries dynamically using string concatenation, making it vulnerable to injection.
        * The application doesn't utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements.
    * **Examples:**
        * Injecting `OR 1=1 --` to bypass authentication checks.
        * Using `UNION SELECT` to retrieve data from other tables.
    * **Likelihood:** High
    * **Impact:** High (Potential for significant data breach, exposure of sensitive information)
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

**2. [CRITICAL] Data Modification (High-Risk Path)**

* **Attack Vector: SQL Injection (UPDATE, INSERT, DELETE)**
    * **Goal:** Manipulate or corrupt data within the ClickHouse database.
    * **How:**
        * Similar to data exfiltration SQL injection, but the attacker crafts SQL queries to modify data.
        * This requires the application's database user to have write privileges.
    * **Examples:**
        * Injecting `UPDATE users SET is_admin = 1 WHERE username = 'victim'`.
        * Injecting `DELETE FROM sensitive_data`.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Data corruption, manipulation of application state)
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

**3. [CRITICAL] Server Compromise (High-Risk Path)**

* **Attack Vector: Abusing Insecure Configurations (Weak Passwords, Exposed Ports)**
    * **Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to the ClickHouse server itself.
    * **How:**
        * **Weak Passwords:** The ClickHouse server is configured with default or easily guessable passwords for administrative or user accounts.
        * **Exposed Ports:** The ClickHouse server's ports (typically 8123 for HTTP, 9000 for native TCP) are directly accessible from the public internet or untrusted networks.
    * **Examples:**
        * Brute-forcing weak passwords to gain access to a ClickHouse user account.
        * Directly connecting to the ClickHouse server through an exposed port and exploiting vulnerabilities or using default credentials.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Full access to the database and potentially the server)
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
