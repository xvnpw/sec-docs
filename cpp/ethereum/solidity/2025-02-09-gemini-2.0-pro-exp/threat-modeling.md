# Threat Model Analysis for ethereum/solidity

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow (Pre-0.8.0 or with `unchecked`)](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow__pre-0_8_0_or_with__unchecked__.md)

*   **Description:**  Arithmetic operations result in values exceeding type limits, causing "wrapping."  Attacker crafts inputs to trigger this, leading to incorrect calculations.  *Crucially, this is only HIGH/CRITICAL if you are using an older Solidity version or explicitly using `unchecked` blocks.*
*   **Impact:** Loss of funds, manipulated contract logic, potential DoS.
*   **Affected Component:** Functions with arithmetic on integer types (`uint`, `int`).  Specifically, vulnerable are arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (pre-0.8.0 or with `unchecked` blocks).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Solidity 0.8.0 or later (built-in checks).
    *   If using older versions or `unchecked`:
        *   Use SafeMath (or equivalent).
        *   Strict input validation.
        *   Extensive testing/auditing.

## Threat: [Reentrancy](./threats/reentrancy.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker's contract calls back into the victim contract before the initial function call completes, exploiting incomplete state updates.
*   **Impact:** Theft of funds, state manipulation, DoS.
*   **Affected Component:** Functions making external calls *before* updating state.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern.
    *   Reentrancy Guards (Mutexes).
    *   Pull over Push for Payments.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Gas Limit](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_gas_limit.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker causes a function to consume excessive gas, leading to transaction failure (out-of-gas).
*   **Impact:** Contract unusability, blocked users, potential financial loss.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   Functions with unbounded loops.
    *   Functions with complex calculations/large data storage.
    *   Functions calling untrusted contracts.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid unbounded loops; use pagination.
    *   Optimize gas usage.
    *   Implement circuit breakers.
    *   Set gas limits for external calls.

## Threat: [Unexpected State Changes due to `delegatecall`](./threats/unexpected_state_changes_due_to__delegatecall_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits `delegatecall` to a malicious contract, modifying the calling contract's storage unexpectedly.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data corruption, theft of funds.
*   **Affected Component:** Functions using `delegatecall` (especially to untrusted contracts).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use `delegatecall` *only* with audited, trusted contracts.
    *   Understand storage layouts to prevent collisions.
    *   Avoid `delegatecall` if possible.

## Threat: [Randomness Issues](./threats/randomness_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker predicts outcomes due to predictable on-chain randomness sources.
*   **Impact:** Predictable outcomes in games, lotteries, etc.
*   **Affected Component:** Functions using predictable sources (e.g., `blockhash`, `block.timestamp`) for randomness.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use an oracle (e.g., Chainlink VRF).
    *   Commit-reveal schemes.
    *   Avoid on-chain randomness for high security.

## Threat: [Front-Running/Transaction Ordering Dependence](./threats/front-runningtransaction_ordering_dependence.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker observes a pending transaction and submits their own with a higher gas price to manipulate the outcome.
*   **Impact:** Financial loss for users, state manipulation.
*   **Affected Component:** Functions where transaction order matters (exchanges, auctions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Commit-reveal schemes.
    *   Submarine sends.
    *   Design for less order sensitivity.
    *   Private mempools/ordering services (advanced).

## Threat: [Incorrect Use of `tx.origin`](./threats/incorrect_use_of__tx_origin_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker tricks a user into interacting with a malicious contract that uses `tx.origin` for authorization, bypassing checks.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing authorization, unauthorized access.
*   **Affected Component:** Functions using `tx.origin` for authorization.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use `msg.sender` instead of `tx.origin`.

## Threat: [Unhandled Exceptions](./threats/unhandled_exceptions.md)

*   **Description:** Low-level calls fail, but the calling contract doesn't handle the failure, leading to inconsistent state.
*   **Impact:** Unexpected state, loss of funds.
*   **Affected Component:** Functions using low-level calls without return value checks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always check return values of low-level calls.
    *   Use higher-level functions (e.g., `transfer`).

## Threat: [Logic Errors](./threats/logic_errors.md)

*    **Description:** General errors in the Solidity code logic, leading to unintended behavior.
*    **Impact:** Varies widely, from minor bugs to critical vulnerabilities.
*    **Affected Component:** Any part of Solidity code.
*    **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*    **Mitigation Strategies:**
     *   Thorough code reviews.
     *   Extensive testing (unit, integration, fuzzing).
     *   Formal verification.
     *   Professional security audits.
