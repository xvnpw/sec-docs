# Threat Model Analysis for ethereum/solidity

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow.md)

**Description:** An attacker can trigger arithmetic operations that result in values exceeding the maximum or falling below the minimum representable value for a given integer type in Solidity. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as manipulating balances to extremely large or small values. For example, an attacker might contribute a small amount to a crowdfunding campaign, causing an overflow that makes them appear to have contributed a massive amount due to how Solidity handles integer arithmetic.

**Impact:** Financial loss, incorrect state updates, unexpected contract behavior, potential for exploitation of other vulnerabilities due to incorrect calculations.

**Affected Solidity Component:** Arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) on integer types (`uint`, `int`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use Solidity version 0.8.0 or later, which includes built-in overflow and underflow checks by default.
* For older Solidity versions, utilize SafeMath libraries for arithmetic operations to explicitly handle overflows and underflows.

## Threat: [Reentrancy](./threats/reentrancy.md)

**Description:** An attacker contract can recursively call a vulnerable function in the target Solidity contract before the initial invocation has completed, potentially exploiting logic flaws and manipulating state multiple times before the first call's effects are finalized. For instance, an attacker could repeatedly withdraw funds from a contract before their balance is updated, effectively draining the contract due to the way Solidity allows external calls and state modifications.

**Impact:** Financial loss, unauthorized state changes, potential for complete contract compromise.

**Affected Solidity Component:** External function calls (`.call()`, `.delegatecall()`, `.send()`, `.transfer()`) and fallback/receive functions within Solidity contracts.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern: Ensure that state changes are performed *before* making external calls within Solidity functions.
* Use reentrancy guards (mutex locks) implemented in Solidity to prevent recursive calls.
* Utilize the `transfer()` or `send()` functions for transferring Ether, as they limit gas and prevent deep call stacks, mitigating some reentrancy scenarios within Solidity's execution environment.

## Threat: [Gas Limit and Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/gas_limit_and_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can craft transactions that consume excessive gas within a Solidity contract, causing the contract to run out of gas during execution and revert. This can prevent legitimate users from interacting with the contract. Attackers might exploit loops or complex computations implemented in Solidity that consume a large amount of gas.

**Impact:** Contract becomes temporarily or permanently unusable, preventing legitimate users from accessing its functionality.

**Affected Solidity Component:** Loops (`for`, `while`), complex computations, unbounded array/mapping iterations within Solidity code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully manage gas costs within the Solidity contract logic.
* Implement limits on loops and computations within Solidity functions.
* Use pagination or other techniques within Solidity to process large datasets in chunks.
* Consider the gas costs of external calls made from Solidity and handle potential reverts.
* Implement withdrawal patterns (pull payments) instead of push payments where possible in Solidity contracts.

## Threat: [Delegatecall Vulnerabilities](./threats/delegatecall_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker can trick a Solidity contract into executing arbitrary code in its own storage context by using the `delegatecall` function to call into a malicious contract. This allows the attacker to modify the vulnerable contract's state and potentially take control of it due to how `delegatecall` operates within the Solidity environment.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the vulnerable contract, including its state and potentially any assets it holds.

**Affected Solidity Component:** The `delegatecall()` function in Solidity.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Exercise extreme caution when using `delegatecall` in Solidity.
* Thoroughly audit the code of any contract that is called via `delegatecall` from your Solidity contract.
* Restrict the use of `delegatecall` to trusted and well-vetted contracts.
* Consider using libraries instead of `delegatecall` where appropriate in Solidity development.

## Threat: [Improper Access Control](./threats/improper_access_control.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit flaws in the Solidity contract's logic that controls who can access certain functions or modify state. This can allow unauthorized users to perform privileged actions, such as withdrawing funds they are not entitled to or changing critical contract parameters, due to weaknesses in how access is managed within the Solidity code.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functions or data, financial loss, manipulation of contract state.

**Affected Solidity Component:** Function visibility modifiers (`public`, `private`, `internal`, `external`), custom modifiers for access control implemented in Solidity.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement clear and well-tested access control mechanisms using modifiers like `onlyOwner`, or role-based access control patterns within Solidity contracts.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing access control in Solidity.
* Thoroughly test access control logic implemented in Solidity.
