        * Trigger Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            * Step 1: Identify vulnerable arithmetic operation (e.g., addition, multiplication).
            * Step 2: Provide input values that cause the result to exceed or fall below the data type's limits.
            * Step 3: Exploit the unexpected result to manipulate state (e.g., mint excessive tokens, bypass access controls).
    * Reentrancy [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Execute Reentrant Call [HIGH-RISK PATH]
            * Step 1: Identify a function that sends Ether or calls an external contract before updating its state.
            * Step 2: Create a malicious contract that calls back into the vulnerable function before the original call completes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_arithmetic_overflowunderflow.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path exploits the way Solidity handles arithmetic operations. If a calculation results in a value that is too large or too small for the data type (e.g., a `uint8` can only hold values from 0 to 255), the result wraps around.

**Steps:**
* The attacker first identifies a vulnerable arithmetic operation within the contract's code, such as addition or multiplication.
* They then craft input values specifically designed to cause the result of this operation to exceed the maximum or fall below the minimum value for the data type being used.
* Finally, the attacker leverages this unexpected wrapped-around value to manipulate the contract's state in a harmful way, such as minting an excessive number of tokens or bypassing access control checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Reentrant Call](./attack_tree_paths/execute_reentrant_call.md)

**Attack Vector:** Reentrancy occurs when a contract makes an external call to another contract or sends Ether before updating its own state. The called contract can then recursively call back into the original contract before the initial transaction is finalized, potentially leading to unexpected state changes or fund drainage.

**Steps:**
* The attacker identifies a function in the target contract that sends Ether or calls an external contract *before* updating critical state variables.
* The attacker deploys a malicious contract. This malicious contract, when receiving the external call from the target contract, is designed to immediately call back into the vulnerable function of the target contract.
* This recursive calling continues before the target contract can finalize its initial state changes, allowing the attacker to repeatedly execute the vulnerable function and potentially drain funds or manipulate state in an unintended manner.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Upgrade Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_upgrade_mechanism.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path targets the upgradeability features of a smart contract. If the mechanism for upgrading the contract is flawed or the administrative controls are compromised, an attacker can replace the legitimate contract logic with malicious code.

**Steps:**
* The attacker first analyzes the contract to understand the upgrade mechanism being used (e.g., a proxy pattern or a diamond standard).
* The attacker then focuses on compromising the administrator account or the key responsible for initiating the upgrade process. This could involve social engineering, phishing attacks, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the key management system.
* Once the attacker gains control of the upgrade process, they can deploy a new, malicious implementation of the contract. This malicious implementation can then be used to steal funds, alter data, or completely take over the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Solidity Application via Solidity Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_solidity_application_via_solidity_vulnerabilities.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker, achieved by successfully exploiting any of the Solidity-specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Arithmetic Overflow/Underflow](./attack_tree_paths/arithmetic_overflowunderflow.md)

Successfully exploiting this vulnerability can lead to critical consequences like the creation of unauthorized assets or the circumvention of essential security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reentrancy](./attack_tree_paths/reentrancy.md)

This vulnerability is critical due to its potential for immediate and significant financial loss by allowing attackers to repeatedly withdraw funds beyond their authorized limits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Delegatecall Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/delegatecall_vulnerability.md)

This is a critical vulnerability because it allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the vulnerable contract, effectively granting them complete control over its state and assets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect Access Control (specifically leading to state manipulation)](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_access_control__specifically_leading_to_state_manipulation_.md)

While the entire path isn't marked as high-risk, the final step of manipulating state due to bypassed access controls is critical. It allows unauthorized actions that can severely compromise the application's integrity and security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Immutable Bug Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/immutable_bug_exploitation.md)

If a deployed contract has an exploitable bug and is immutable (cannot be patched), this represents a critical vulnerability. Attackers can leverage this bug indefinitely, potentially causing significant and irreversible damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Centralization Risks in Upgradeable Contracts](./attack_tree_paths/centralization_risks_in_upgradeable_contracts.md)

The upgrade mechanism is a critical point of control in upgradeable contracts. If compromised, the attacker gains the ability to deploy arbitrary code, leading to a complete takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Publicly Writable Storage](./attack_tree_paths/publicly_writable_storage.md)

While less common in modern Solidity, if storage variables are inadvertently made public and writable, attackers can directly modify the contract's state, leading to immediate and critical compromise.
