# Attack Surface Analysis for ethereum/solidity

## Attack Surface: [Reentrancy](./attack_surfaces/reentrancy.md)

**Description:** A contract makes an external call to another contract or address, and the called contract (or a subsequent call) can recursively call back into the original contract *before* the initial call has completed. This can lead to unexpected state changes and fund draining.

**How Solidity Contributes:** Solidity's ability to make external calls using `call`, `send`, or `transfer` allows for this interaction. The EVM's execution model, where state changes are applied after the transaction completes (unless reverted), enables the reentrant call to execute with the partially updated state.

**Example:** A vulnerable contract allows users to withdraw funds. It updates the user's balance *after* sending the funds. A malicious contract called during the withdrawal can call back the withdraw function multiple times before the initial balance update, effectively withdrawing more funds than intended.

**Impact:** Critical - Potential for significant financial loss, theft of assets, and disruption of contract functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement the **Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern**: Perform all state changes (effects) *before* making external calls (interactions).
*   Use **reentrancy guards (mutex locks)**: Employ modifiers that prevent a function from being called again during its execution.
*   Favor **`transfer` or `send`** for sending Ether: These methods forward a fixed amount of gas, which is usually insufficient for a reentrant call. However, be aware of their limitations (e.g., `send` failing if the recipient is a contract without a payable fallback function).
*   Use **pull payment patterns**: Instead of pushing funds, allow users to withdraw their funds.

## Attack Surface: [Arithmetic Overflow and Underflow](./attack_surfaces/arithmetic_overflow_and_underflow.md)

**Description:** Performing arithmetic operations that result in a value exceeding the maximum or falling below the minimum value representable by the data type. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as incorrect calculations or bypassing access controls.

**How Solidity Contributes:** Prior to Solidity 0.8.0, arithmetic operations did not have built-in overflow/underflow checks. Developers had to manually implement checks using libraries like SafeMath.

**Example:** A token contract increments a user's balance. If the balance reaches the maximum value and is incremented again, it can wrap around to zero, granting the user an incorrect balance.

**Impact:** High - Can lead to incorrect accounting, unauthorized access, and manipulation of contract state.

**Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical in older Solidity versions)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use Solidity version 0.8.0 or later:** These versions have built-in overflow and underflow checks by default.
*   **Carefully use `unchecked` blocks:** Only use `unchecked` blocks when you are absolutely certain that overflow or underflow cannot occur, and document the reasoning.
*   **Consider using libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeCast:** For explicit type conversions and bounds checking if needed.

## Attack Surface: [Delegatecall Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/delegatecall_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The `delegatecall` opcode allows a contract to execute code from another contract *in the context of the calling contract's storage*. If a contract delegates calls to an untrusted or malicious contract, the malicious contract can manipulate the storage of the calling contract, potentially leading to ownership takeover or data corruption.

**How Solidity Contributes:** Solidity provides the `delegatecall` functionality. If used improperly, it can be a significant security risk.

**Example:** A contract uses `delegatecall` to a library contract for shared functionality. If the library contract is compromised, it can modify the storage variables of the delegating contract, potentially changing ownership or stealing funds.

**Impact:** Critical - Can lead to complete control of the contract, theft of assets, and data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid using `delegatecall` unless absolutely necessary.**
*   **Only delegatecall to trusted and thoroughly audited contracts.**
*   **Ensure storage layout compatibility:** The storage layout of the calling and called contracts must be carefully aligned to prevent unintended overwrites. Consider using libraries designed for `delegatecall` safety.
*   **Consider using libraries deployed as separate contracts and called via regular `call` instead of `delegatecall` when possible.**

## Attack Surface: [Visibility Issues (Public/External Functions)](./attack_surfaces/visibility_issues__publicexternal_functions_.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly marking sensitive functions as `public` or `external` can expose them to unintended access and manipulation by any user.

**How Solidity Contributes:** Solidity's access modifier keywords (`public`, `external`, `internal`, `private`) control the visibility and accessibility of functions. Misuse of these modifiers can create vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A function intended only for the contract owner to change critical parameters is mistakenly declared as `public`, allowing anyone to call it.

**Impact:** High - Can lead to unauthorized state changes, bypassing access controls, and potential financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Use the most restrictive visibility modifier possible:** Prefer `private` or `internal` unless a function needs to be called externally.
*   **Carefully review the visibility of all functions during development and auditing.**
*   **Follow the principle of least privilege.**
