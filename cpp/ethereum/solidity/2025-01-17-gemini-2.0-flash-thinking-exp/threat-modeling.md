# Threat Model Analysis for ethereum/solidity

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate input values or contract logic to cause integer variables to exceed their maximum or minimum representable value. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as transferring incorrect amounts of tokens or bypassing access controls. For example, an attacker might cause a balance to wrap around to a very large number by subtracting from zero.

**Impact:** Incorrect calculations, financial losses, bypassing security checks, unexpected contract behavior.

**Affected Component:** Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), data types (uint, int).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use Solidity version 0.8.0 or later, which includes built-in overflow and underflow checks.
*   For older versions, utilize safe math libraries like SafeMath for arithmetic operations.

## Threat: [Reentrancy](./threats/reentrancy.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit a vulnerable contract by recursively calling its functions before the initial invocation has completed. This can allow the attacker to drain funds or manipulate state in unintended ways. For example, a withdrawal function might not update the user's balance before sending funds, allowing the attacker to withdraw multiple times.

**Impact:** Loss of funds, manipulation of contract state, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** External calls, state updates, function modifiers.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern: Perform checks before making external calls, update internal state (effects), and then make external calls (interactions).
*   Use mutex locks or reentrancy guards (e.g., using a boolean flag) to prevent recursive calls.
*   Favor pull payments over push payments where possible.

## Threat: [Delegatecall Vulnerability](./threats/delegatecall_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker can trick a contract into using `delegatecall` to execute malicious code in the context of the vulnerable contract. This allows the attacker to modify the vulnerable contract's storage and potentially take complete control.

**Impact:** Complete control over the vulnerable contract, loss of funds, data corruption.

**Affected Component:** `delegatecall` function.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Exercise extreme caution when using `delegatecall`.
*   Only delegatecall to trusted contracts with thoroughly audited code.
*   Consider using libraries or inheritance instead of `delegatecall` when possible.

## Threat: [Lack of Access Control](./threats/lack_of_access_control.md)

**Description:** An attacker can call privileged functions that should only be accessible to specific users or contracts, leading to unauthorized actions.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of contract state, loss of funds, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Function modifiers, `msg.sender`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust access control mechanisms using modifiers like `onlyOwner`, role-based access control, or other authorization patterns.
*   Carefully define and enforce access permissions for all sensitive functions.

## Threat: [Oracle Manipulation](./threats/oracle_manipulation.md)

**Description:** If a smart contract relies on external data from an oracle, an attacker might compromise the oracle or manipulate the data feed, causing the contract to make decisions based on false information.

**Impact:** Incorrect contract behavior, financial losses, manipulation of outcomes.

**Affected Component:** External calls to oracle contracts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Choose reputable and decentralized oracles.
*   Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of oracle data.
*   Consider using multiple oracles and aggregating their data.

## Threat: [Immutable Bugs](./threats/immutable_bugs.md)

**Description:** Once a smart contract is deployed, its code is generally immutable. If bugs are discovered after deployment, they cannot be directly fixed, potentially leading to ongoing vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Persistent vulnerabilities, potential for exploitation, loss of trust.

**Affected Component:** Deployed contract code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test and audit smart contracts before deployment.
*   Consider using upgradeable contract patterns (with associated risks and complexities).

## Threat: [Upgradeability Vulnerabilities](./threats/upgradeability_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** While upgradeable contracts offer flexibility, they introduce new attack vectors related to the upgrade process itself, such as unauthorized upgrades or data migration issues.

**Impact:** Unauthorized modification of contract logic, data corruption, loss of control.

**Affected Component:** Upgrade mechanisms, proxy contracts, implementation contracts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement secure upgrade mechanisms with proper authorization and governance.
*   Carefully manage the upgrade process and data migration.
*   Thoroughly audit the upgrade logic itself.
