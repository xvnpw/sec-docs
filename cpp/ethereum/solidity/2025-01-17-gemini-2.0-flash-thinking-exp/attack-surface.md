# Attack Surface Analysis for ethereum/solidity

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow and Underflow](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflow_and_underflow.md)

*   **Description:** Arithmetic operations on integer types can result in values exceeding the maximum or falling below the minimum representable value, wrapping around to the opposite extreme.
    *   **Solidity Contribution:** Prior to Solidity 0.8.0, overflow and underflow were not checked by default. While Solidity 0.8.0+ includes default checks, the `unchecked` keyword allows developers to bypass these checks.
    *   **Example:** A token contract's `transfer` function might subtract the transfer amount from the sender's balance. If the sender's balance is less than the transfer amount and overflow checks are disabled (or using an older Solidity version), the balance could wrap around to a very large positive number, allowing the sender to effectively mint tokens.
    *   **Impact:** Financial loss, incorrect state updates, unexpected contract behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use Solidity version 0.8.0 or higher to leverage default overflow/underflow checks. Avoid using `unchecked` blocks unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. Thoroughly test arithmetic operations with boundary conditions.

## Attack Surface: [Reentrancy](./attack_surfaces/reentrancy.md)

*   **Description:** A contract makes an external call to another contract or address, and the called contract (or a subsequent call) makes a recursive call back into the original contract *before* the initial call has completed. This can lead to unexpected state changes and vulnerabilities.
    *   **Solidity Contribution:** Solidity's ability to make external calls using `call`, `delegatecall`, or sending Ether creates the opportunity for reentrancy.
    *   **Example:** A DeFi lending protocol allows users to deposit and withdraw funds. A malicious contract could deposit funds, then trigger a withdrawal. During the withdrawal process, the malicious contract's fallback function calls back into the lending protocol's withdrawal function *again* before the initial withdrawal's state updates are finalized. This can allow the attacker to withdraw more funds than they initially deposited.
    *   **Impact:**  Significant financial loss, contract state corruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement the "checks-effects-interactions" pattern: perform checks before making state changes, and make external calls last. Use reentrancy guards (e.g., mutex locks) to prevent recursive calls. Limit the amount of gas forwarded with external calls. Consider using pull payments instead of push payments.

## Attack Surface: [Gas Limit and Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/gas_limit_and_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can exploit the gas mechanism of the EVM to make contracts unusable or prevent legitimate transactions.
    *   **Solidity Contribution:** Solidity code that involves unbounded loops, large data structures, or complex computations can consume excessive gas.
    *   **Example:** A contract might have a function that iterates through a list of users. If an attacker can add a very large number of users to this list, calling this function could exceed the block gas limit, making the function unusable for everyone.
    *   **Impact:** Contract unavailability, inability to perform critical functions, financial loss due to locked funds.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Avoid unbounded loops and large data structures. Implement pagination or other techniques to process data in chunks. Set gas limits for external calls. Use the "pull over push" pattern where users initiate actions that cost gas. Carefully consider the gas costs of all operations. Implement circuit breakers or emergency stop mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Delegatecall Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/delegatecall_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** The `delegatecall` function allows a contract to execute code from another contract *in the context of the calling contract's storage*. If the called contract is malicious or has vulnerabilities, it can manipulate the caller's state.
    *   **Solidity Contribution:** The `delegatecall` function itself is a powerful feature of Solidity but introduces this risk if used with untrusted code.
    *   **Example:** A contract uses `delegatecall` to interact with a library contract for some functionality. If the library contract is compromised, it could execute malicious code that modifies the storage of the calling contract, potentially stealing funds or altering critical data.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the calling contract, including theft of funds and data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Only `delegatecall` to trusted and thoroughly audited contracts. Carefully manage the storage layout of contracts that use `delegatecall`. Consider using libraries linked at deployment time instead of relying on dynamic `delegatecall`.

## Attack Surface: [Visibility Modifiers and Access Control Issues](./attack_surfaces/visibility_modifiers_and_access_control_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly setting visibility modifiers (`public`, `external`, `internal`, `private`) can expose sensitive functions or data, allowing unauthorized access and manipulation.
    *   **Solidity Contribution:** Solidity's visibility modifiers control the accessibility of contract members. Misunderstanding or misusing these modifiers can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A critical function intended only for the contract owner is mistakenly declared `public`. An attacker can then call this function directly and perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, manipulation of contract state, financial loss.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Carefully choose the appropriate visibility modifier for each function and variable. Implement robust access control mechanisms using `onlyOwner` modifiers or similar patterns. Understand the limitations of `private` visibility.
