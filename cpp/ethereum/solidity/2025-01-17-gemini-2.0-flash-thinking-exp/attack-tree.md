## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Smart Contract Logic Flaws (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_smart_contract_logic_flaws__critical_node_.md)

This category encompasses fundamental errors in the design or implementation of the smart contract's logic. Attackers exploit these flaws to deviate from the intended behavior, often leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reentrancy Attack (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/reentrancy_attack__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Trigger a function that makes an external call before updating state:** The attacker calls a function in the vulnerable contract that interacts with another contract *before* updating its own internal state (e.g., deducting funds).
* **Recurse into the vulnerable function before the initial call completes:** The external call is made to a malicious contract (or a carefully crafted benign contract). This malicious contract then calls back into the *same vulnerable function* in the original contract *before* the initial call has finished and the state has been updated. This allows the attacker to repeatedly withdraw funds or manipulate state in an unintended way.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Business Logic (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_business_logic__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Identify flaws in the intended functionality of the contract:** The attacker analyzes the contract's code to find discrepancies between the intended behavior and the actual implementation. This could involve incorrect calculations, flawed reward distribution mechanisms, or vulnerabilities in access control logic.
* **Manipulate the contract state or execution flow based on these flaws:** Once a logic error is identified, the attacker crafts transactions to exploit this flaw. This could involve calling functions in a specific order, providing unexpected inputs, or leveraging edge cases to gain an unfair advantage or cause harm.

## Attack Tree Path: [Delegatecall Vulnerability (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/delegatecall_vulnerability__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Control the address of the contract being called via `delegatecall`:** The vulnerable contract uses the `delegatecall` function, and the attacker can influence the address of the contract being called. This often happens when the target address is a parameter controlled by the user or fetched from an untrusted source.
* **Inject malicious code into the target contract, allowing it to execute in the context of the calling contract (manipulating storage):** The attacker deploys a malicious contract at the controlled address. When the vulnerable contract uses `delegatecall` to this malicious contract, the malicious code is executed *in the context of the vulnerable contract*. This means the malicious code can directly modify the vulnerable contract's storage, effectively taking control of it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Access Control Issues (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_access_control_issues__critical_node_.md)

This category involves vulnerabilities related to who is authorized to perform certain actions within the smart contract.

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing or Incorrect Access Modifiers (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/missing_or_incorrect_access_modifiers__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Identify functions that should be restricted but are publicly accessible:** The attacker examines the contract code and finds functions that perform sensitive operations (like withdrawing funds or changing ownership) but are marked as `public` or lack proper access restrictions.
* **Call these functions to perform unauthorized actions or manipulate state:** The attacker directly calls these unrestricted functions, bypassing the intended security measures and performing actions they should not be allowed to do.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reentrancy through Untrusted Contracts (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/reentrancy_through_untrusted_contracts__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Interact with a malicious contract that calls back into the vulnerable contract during its execution:** The vulnerable contract interacts with an external contract that is controlled by the attacker or is itself malicious.
* **Exploit reentrancy vulnerabilities indirectly through the malicious contract:** The malicious external contract is designed to call back into the vulnerable contract during its execution, exploiting a reentrancy vulnerability in the original contract. This allows the attacker to leverage the vulnerability even if they are not directly interacting with the vulnerable contract initially.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit External Interactions (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_external_interactions__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the smart contract's reliance on external data or other smart contracts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Oracle Manipulation (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/oracle_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Compromise the data source of an oracle providing external information:** The attacker targets the source of data for an oracle that the smart contract relies on (e.g., a price feed). This could involve hacking the oracle provider's systems or exploiting vulnerabilities in their data aggregation methods.
* **Feed the smart contract with false or manipulated data, leading to incorrect execution:** Once the oracle's data source is compromised, the attacker can inject false information (e.g., manipulating the price of an asset). The smart contract, believing this false data, executes its logic incorrectly, potentially leading to financial losses or other unintended consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Libraries (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_libraries__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Include a malicious or compromised library in the smart contract:** During the development process, a developer might unknowingly include a library that contains malicious code or has been compromised. This could happen through supply chain attacks or by using untrusted sources.
* **The malicious library executes code that compromises the contract's functionality or data:** Once the malicious library is included in the contract, its code is executed as part of the contract's operations. This malicious code can perform any action within the contract's context, including stealing funds, manipulating data, or bricking the contract.
