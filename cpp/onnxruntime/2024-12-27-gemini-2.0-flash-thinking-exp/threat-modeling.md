## High and Critical ONNX Runtime Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the ONNX Runtime library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & How) | Impact | Affected ONNX Runtime Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Model Loading - Code Execution** | An attacker crafts a malicious ONNX model containing specially crafted nodes or attributes that exploit vulnerabilities in the ONNX Runtime's parsing or execution engine. Upon loading the model using functions like `onnxruntime.InferenceSession()`, the malicious code embedded within the model is executed on the server. | **Critical:** Full compromise of the server, including data access, modification, and potential for further attacks. | `onnxruntime.InferenceSession` (model loading and initialization), ONNX Parser, Execution Providers (CPU, GPU, etc.) | **Critical** | * **Model Validation & Sanitization:** Implement rigorous validation of the ONNX model structure and content *before* loading. Use `onnx.checker.check_model` for basic validation and develop custom checks for suspicious patterns or unexpected node types/attributes. <br> * **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Run ONNX Runtime in a sandboxed environment or a separate process with limited privileges to contain potential damage. Consider using containerization technologies like Docker. <br> * **Regular Updates:** Keep ONNX Runtime updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes. <br> * **Model Provenance Tracking:** Maintain a clear record of where ONNX models originate and who has modified them. Use digital signatures or other mechanisms to verify model integrity. |
| **Malicious Model Loading - Denial of Service (DoS)** | An attacker provides a maliciously crafted ONNX model that, when loaded or during inference, causes excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, GPU) leading to a denial of service for the application or the underlying system. This could involve deeply nested graphs, computationally expensive operators, or memory allocation issues *within ONNX Runtime*. | **High:** Application unavailability, system instability, potential for cascading failures. | `onnxruntime.InferenceSession`, ONNX Parser, Memory Allocator, Execution Providers | **High** | * **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits for ONNX Runtime execution, such as maximum memory usage, execution time, and thread count. Configure these limits appropriately based on expected model complexity. <br> * **Model Complexity Analysis:** Analyze the complexity of the ONNX model before execution to estimate resource requirements. Reject models exceeding predefined thresholds. <br> * **Monitoring:** Monitor resource usage during ONNX Runtime execution to detect and mitigate resource exhaustion attacks. Implement alerts for unusual resource consumption. <br> * **Request Prioritization:** Implement request prioritization to ensure critical tasks are not starved by resource-intensive model executions. |
| **Exploiting Operator Vulnerabilities** | An attacker leverages known vulnerabilities in specific ONNX operators *implemented within ONNX Runtime*. By crafting an input that triggers this vulnerability during inference (using `session.run()`), they can cause crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially even code execution within the ONNX Runtime process. | **High:** Application crash, unexpected results, potential for information disclosure or limited code execution within the ONNX Runtime process. | Specific ONNX Operator implementations within Execution Providers (e.g., CPU kernels, CUDA kernels) | **High** | * **Stay Informed:** Monitor security advisories and release notes for ONNX Runtime and its dependencies, paying attention to operator-specific vulnerabilities. <br> * **Restrict Operator Usage:** If possible, limit the set of ONNX operators used in your models to a well-vetted and understood subset. <br> * **Fuzzing:** Employ fuzzing techniques to test ONNX Runtime with a wide range of inputs and model structures to uncover potential vulnerabilities in operator implementations. <br> * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate all inputs provided to the `session.run()` function to prevent triggering known operator vulnerabilities. |
| **Custom Operator Security Flaws** | If the application uses custom operators, vulnerabilities in their implementation (which are integrated with ONNX Runtime) could be exploited by malicious models. This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the ONNX Runtime process. | **High:** Potential for arbitrary code execution within the ONNX Runtime process, leading to full compromise. | Custom Operator implementations, `onnxruntime.InferenceSession` (loading and executing models with custom operators) | **High** | * **Secure Development Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom operators, including input validation, bounds checking, and memory management. <br> * **Thorough Testing:** Conduct rigorous testing, including security testing (e.g., fuzzing), of custom operator implementations. <br> * **Code Review:** Perform thorough code reviews of custom operator implementations to identify potential vulnerabilities. <br> * **Sandboxing for Custom Operators:** If possible, explore ways to sandbox or isolate the execution of custom operators to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities. |
