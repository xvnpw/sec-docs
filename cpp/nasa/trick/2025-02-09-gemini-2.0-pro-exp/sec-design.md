Okay, let's create a design document for the NASA Trick simulation toolkit.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Trick is a simulation development environment designed to build simulations of various types, from simple to complex, real-time, and human-in-the-loop systems. It appears to be targeted towards internal NASA projects and potentially external collaborators in the aerospace and scientific communities.

Priorities:

*   Provide a flexible and powerful simulation environment.
*   Enable rapid prototyping and development of simulations.
*   Support a wide range of simulation complexities and use cases.
*   Facilitate code reuse and collaboration.
*   Ensure the reliability and accuracy of simulations.

Goals:

*   Become the standard simulation toolkit within NASA.
*   Reduce the time and cost of developing simulations.
*   Improve the quality and fidelity of simulations.
*   Enable the development of new and innovative simulation capabilities.

Business Risks:

*   Inadequate simulation fidelity leading to incorrect conclusions or design flaws.
*   Security vulnerabilities in the simulation environment or resulting simulations, potentially exposing sensitive data or allowing unauthorized control.
*   Lack of adoption by NASA engineers and scientists, hindering its goal of becoming a standard.
*   Difficulty in integrating Trick with existing NASA tools and workflows.
*   Insufficient documentation or training, limiting the usability of the toolkit.
*   Inability to scale to meet the demands of increasingly complex simulations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the provided GitHub repository, the following security controls and accepted risks are identified. It's important to note that this assessment is based solely on the public repository and may not reflect the full security posture of Trick deployments within NASA.

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews: The GitHub repository shows evidence of a pull request process, suggesting that code reviews are likely part of the development lifecycle. (Inferred from GitHub workflow)
*   security control: Limited external dependencies: The project appears to have a relatively small number of external dependencies, reducing the attack surface. (Observed in repository structure)
*   security control: Input validation: Some level of input validation is likely present within the core Trick codebase to handle user-provided simulation parameters and configurations. (Assumed based on the nature of the software)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The simulation environment itself may not be hardened against sophisticated attacks. The focus is likely on the accuracy and functionality of the simulations, rather than the security of the Trick framework itself. This is a common trade-off in scientific computing environments.
*   accepted risk: Simulations created using Trick may inherit vulnerabilities from user-provided code or models. Trick provides the framework, but the security of the specific simulation implementation is the responsibility of the simulation developer.
*   accepted risk: Limited authentication and authorization mechanisms within the core Trick framework. Access control is likely managed at the operating system or deployment environment level.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the build process to identify potential vulnerabilities in the Trick codebase.
*   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
*   Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Perform DAST on deployed instances of Trick to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
*   Security Training: Provide security training to developers using Trick, emphasizing secure coding practices and the importance of input validation and output encoding.
*   Documentation: Create security-focused documentation for Trick, guiding users on how to develop secure simulations.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: While Trick itself may not require strong authentication, any deployment environment or web interface built around Trick should implement robust authentication mechanisms, preferably integrating with NASA's existing identity management systems.
*   Authorization: Access control should be enforced at the operating system or deployment environment level, limiting access to Trick and simulation data based on user roles and permissions. Consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC) within any web interfaces or APIs built around Trick.
*   Input Validation: Trick should perform robust input validation on all user-provided data, including simulation parameters, configuration files, and external data sources. This is crucial to prevent injection attacks and ensure the stability of the simulation environment. Specific validation rules will depend on the type of data being processed.
*   Cryptography: If Trick handles sensitive data, appropriate cryptographic techniques should be used to protect the data in transit and at rest. This may include using TLS for network communication and encrypting sensitive data stored on disk. The specific cryptographic algorithms and key management practices should adhere to NASA's security policies.

## DEPLOYMENT

Trick simulations can be deployed in various ways, depending on the specific needs of the user and the complexity of the simulation. Here are a few possible deployment scenarios:

1.  Local Workstation: A single user runs Trick simulations on their local machine. This is suitable for development, testing, and small-scale simulations.
2.  High-Performance Computing (HPC) Cluster: Trick simulations are deployed on an HPC cluster to leverage parallel processing capabilities for large-scale simulations.
3.  Cloud-Based Environment: Trick simulations are deployed on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) to provide scalability and accessibility.

We will describe the Local Workstation deployment in detail, as it is the simplest and most likely the initial deployment scenario for many users.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph Local Workstation
        OperatingSystem[("Operating System (Linux, macOS, Windows)")]

        SimulationCode -- Reads/Writes --> DataFiles
    end
```

Element Descriptions:

## BUILD

Trick's build process, as evident from the GitHub repository, utilizes SCons (a software construction tool) as its primary build system. The build process transforms the source code into executable binaries and libraries that form the Trick runtime environment.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer[("Developer")]
    SourceCode[("Source Code (C++, Python, etc.)")]
    SCons[("SCons Build System")]
    Compiler[("Compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)")]
    Linker[("Linker")]
    Libraries[("Libraries (Trick Libraries)")]
    Executables[("Executables (Trick Runtime)")]
	  Tests[("Automated Tests")]

    Developer -- Writes --> SourceCode
    SCons -- Reads --> SourceCode
    SCons -- Invokes --> Compiler
    Compiler -- Compiles --> SourceCode
    Compiler -- Produces --> ObjectFiles[("Object Files")]
    Linker -- Links --> ObjectFiles
    Linker -- Uses --> Libraries
    Linker -- Produces --> Executables
	  SCons -- Runs --> Tests
	  Tests -- Test --> Executables
	  Tests -- Test --> Libraries

```
Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Compiler Warnings and Errors: The build process should be configured to treat compiler warnings as errors, ensuring that potential code quality issues are addressed.
*   Static Analysis: Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., Coverity, SonarQube) into the SCons build process to automatically scan the code for vulnerabilities.
*   Dependency Management: SCons can be used to manage external dependencies, ensuring that only approved and up-to-date libraries are used.
*   Automated Testing: The build process includes automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) to verify the functionality and stability of the Trick codebase.
*   Reproducible Builds: Aim for reproducible builds, where the same source code and build environment consistently produce the same binary output. This enhances trust and auditability.

# RISK ASSESSMENT
