# Threat Model Analysis for nasa/trick

## Threat: [Simulation Input File Tampering (S_define/S_overload)](./threats/simulation_input_file_tampering__s_defines_overload_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the simulation input files (e.g., `S_define`, `S_overload`, or files included via `#include`) modifies them to inject malicious parameters, alter initial conditions, or change the simulation logic *that Trick processes*. They might change a coefficient in an aerodynamic model, alter failure conditions, or modify the behavior of a simulated system. This directly impacts how Trick interprets and executes the simulation.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect simulation results, leading to flawed analysis, design decisions, or training scenarios. In safety-critical applications, this could have severe consequences. The simulation might also crash or become unstable due to invalid configurations *within Trick's domain*.
*   **Trick Component Affected:**  Input file parsing and processing within Trick (primarily the preprocessor and the mechanisms that load and interpret `S_define`, `S_overload`, and included files). The specific models and algorithms *as implemented within Trick* are also directly affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if the simulation controls safety-critical systems or is used for high-stakes decision-making); High (in most other cases).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File System Permissions:** Use OS file permissions to restrict write access to simulation input files.
    *   **Application-Level Access Control:** If the application manages input files, implement robust access controls.
    *   **Input Validation (Trick-Related):** While general input validation is important, focus on validating input *specifically as it relates to Trick's configuration and parameters*. Check for valid Trick keywords, data types expected by Trick models, and parameter ranges that are meaningful *within the context of the Trick simulation*.
    *   **Version Control:** Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes.
    *   **Checksums/Digital Signatures:** Calculate checksums or use digital signatures for input files and verify them *before Trick processes them*.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review file permissions and access control.

## Threat: [Variable Server Manipulation (Inter-Process Communication)](./threats/variable_server_manipulation__inter-process_communication_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or modifies communication between the application and Trick's Variable Server. The Variable Server is a *core Trick component* for runtime interaction. The attacker might inject false data, alter variable values, or send unauthorized commands *directly to the Variable Server*. This exploits the communication protocol *specific to Trick*.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect simulation results, unpredictable simulation behavior, potential denial of service (if the Variable Server is overloaded or crashed), or even execution of arbitrary code (if vulnerabilities exist in the Variable Server's handling of *its specific protocol*).
*   **Trick Component Affected:** The Variable Server (specifically, its communication interfaces and data handling logic *as implemented by Trick*).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the central role of the Variable Server *within Trick*).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure IPC (Trick-Specific):** Use secure IPC mechanisms, paying close attention to the security of the *specific methods Trick uses for communication*. If using sockets, ensure proper authentication and encryption (e.g., TLS). If using named pipes, set appropriate permissions.
    *   **Mutual Authentication:** Implement mutual authentication between the application and the *Trick Variable Server*. Both sides should verify each other's identity.
    *   **Input Validation (Variable Server Side):** The *Trick Variable Server itself* should validate all incoming data and commands according to *its defined protocol*. This is a crucial responsibility of the Trick developers, but users should be aware of it.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** The *Variable Server* should limit the rate of requests to prevent DoS.
    *   **Auditing:** Log all interactions with the *Trick Variable Server*.

## Threat: [Runtime Data Tampering (Shared Memory/Direct Access - Trick Context)](./threats/runtime_data_tampering__shared_memorydirect_access_-_trick_context_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with access to the running *Trick simulation's* memory directly modifies the values of simulation variables. This bypasses the Variable Server and targets the *in-memory representation of the simulation state managed by Trick*. The attacker might alter critical parameters or inject errors *directly into Trick's data structures*.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect simulation results, unpredictable behavior, potential crashes, and potentially compromised system integrity if the attacker can leverage memory corruption *within Trick* to gain further control.
*   **Trick Component Affected:** The simulation's runtime environment *as managed by Trick*, including the memory space where simulation variables are stored *by Trick*. This is about the execution environment *provided by Trick*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the direct manipulation of *Trick's* simulation state).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Attack Surface:** Limit access to the running *Trick simulation*.
    *   **Operating System Protections:** Utilize OS features like ASLR and DEP.
    *   **Memory Protection (If Feasible, Trick-Specific):** If the *Trick simulation environment* and performance allow, explore memory protection. This is often challenging.
    *   **Runtime Integrity Checks (If Feasible, Trick-Specific):** Periodically check critical *Trick simulation variables* against expected ranges or checksums. This can impact performance.

## Threat: [Trick Binary/Library Tampering](./threats/trick_binarylibrary_tampering.md)

* **Description:** An attacker replaces Trick's executable files or shared libraries with malicious versions. This directly compromises the *integrity of the Trick framework itself*. The malicious code could alter simulation behavior, steal data, or provide a backdoor.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the *Trick simulation environment*. The attacker could control all aspects of the simulation.
    * **Trick Component Affected:** The entire Trick framework, including all executables and libraries.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Installation:** Install Trick from trusted sources and verify file integrity.
        * **File System Permissions:** Protect the Trick installation directory.
        * **Code Signing:** If possible, use code signing for Trick binaries.
        * **Regular Security Updates:** Keep the OS and supporting software updated.
        * **Intrusion Detection Systems:** Monitor for unauthorized file modifications.
        * **System Hardening:** Implement general system hardening.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Trick Vulnerabilities (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/exploitation_of_trick_vulnerabilities__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within Trick itself* (e.g., a buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, or logic error) to gain elevated privileges. This targets *bugs in Trick's code*.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for complete system compromise, depending on the vulnerability and the privileges of the *Trick process*.
    *   **Trick Component Affected:** The specific vulnerable component *within Trick* (could be anywhere in the framework).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Trick Updated:** Regularly update Trick to the latest version.
        *   **Run with Least Privilege:** Run *Trick processes* with minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits, including vulnerability scanning.
        *   **Input Validation (Within Trick):** *Trick itself* should have robust input validation. This is the responsibility of the Trick developers.
        *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Consider running *Trick* within a sandbox or container.
