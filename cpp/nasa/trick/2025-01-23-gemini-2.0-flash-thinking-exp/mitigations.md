# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nasa/trick

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation for Simulation Parameters](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_for_simulation_parameters.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Input Schemas for Trick Configuration:**  Specifically for Trick, define schemas for all input parameters used in:
    *   `S_define` files:  Specify data types, allowed ranges, and formats for all variables defined in `S_define`.
    *   Trick Input Files (`.inp`): Define schemas for data read from input files, ensuring correct data types and formats are expected.
    *   Command-line arguments passed to Trick executables: Define expected formats and valid values for command-line options.
2.  **Implement Validation in Trick Configuration Parsing:** Modify or extend Trick's configuration parsing mechanisms (likely within the `S_define` processing and input file reading code) to validate inputs against the defined schemas.
3.  **Trick Error Reporting for Validation Failures:** Ensure Trick's error reporting system is used to clearly log and report input validation failures, providing informative messages to users about incorrect configuration parameters.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious code or commands through manipulated Trick simulation parameters, especially within `S_define` or input files that might be processed in unsafe ways by custom models or Trick internals.
*   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Ensures Trick simulations are configured with valid and expected data, preventing simulations from running with nonsensical or corrupt configurations defined in `S_define` or input files.
*   **Denial of Service (Low to Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of DoS attacks caused by malformed Trick configurations that could crash the Trick simulation engine or lead to excessive resource consumption during setup.

**Impact:**
*   Injection Attacks: High reduction in risk.
*   Data Integrity Issues: Medium reduction in risk.
*   Denial of Service: Low to Medium reduction in risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented. Trick likely has basic syntax checking for `S_define` and input files, but likely lacks formal schema validation and detailed error reporting for invalid input *values*.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formal schema definitions for all Trick configuration parameters (`S_define`, input files, command-line arguments).
*   Robust validation logic integrated into Trick's configuration parsing to enforce these schemas.
*   Improved error reporting within Trick to clearly communicate input validation failures to users.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Trick Simulation Configuration Files](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_trick_simulation_configuration_files.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Restrict File System Permissions for Trick Configuration Directories:**  Specifically for Trick projects, implement strict file system permissions on directories containing `S_define` files, input files (`.inp`), and any other Trick-specific configuration files.
    *   Limit write access to these directories to only authorized users or processes involved in simulation development and setup.
    *   Restrict read access to users who need to run or manage Trick simulations.
2.  **Secure Storage Location for Trick Projects:** Store Trick project directories and configuration files in secure locations, away from publicly accessible areas or standard user home directories, to limit unauthorized access to Trick simulation configurations.
3.  **Version Control for Trick Configuration:** Mandate the use of version control (like Git) for all Trick project configuration files (`S_define`, `.inp`, model configuration scripts). This provides an audit trail of changes to Trick configurations and allows for rollback if needed.
4.  **Integrity Checks for Trick Configuration Files (Optional):**  Consider implementing integrity checks specifically for critical Trick configuration files. This could involve checksums or digital signatures to ensure that `S_define` or key input files haven't been tampered with before a Trick simulation starts.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Configuration Modification (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from modifying Trick simulation configurations (`S_define`, input files) to alter simulation behavior, inject malicious logic, or gain unintended access within the simulation environment.

*   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity - if sensitive data is in Trick config files):** Prevents unauthorized access to sensitive information that might be inadvertently stored within Trick configuration files (though this should be minimized by design).

**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Configuration Modification: High reduction in risk.
*   Data Integrity Issues: Medium reduction in risk.
*   Information Disclosure: Medium reduction in risk (if applicable).

**Currently Implemented:**

    *   Reviews should be conducted by developers familiar with both Trick and secure coding practices.
    *   Focus reviews on identifying potential vulnerabilities *within the context of Trick*, such as how models interact with the Trick simulation engine, handle Trick data structures, and use Trick APIs.
2.  **Security Audit Checklists for Trick Model Code:** Develop security audit checklists tailored to the specific types of code used in Trick models (C++, Python, S-functions). These checklists should include vulnerability patterns relevant to Trick's environment and APIs.
3.  **Static Analysis Tools for Trick Model Code:** Utilize static analysis tools to scan Trick model code for potential vulnerabilities. Choose tools that are effective for the languages used in Trick models (C++, Python) and can identify common security weaknesses in these languages.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   Information Disclosure from Trick Simulations: Medium reduction in risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Code reviews might be practiced for Trick model development, but security-focused code reviews and audits specifically targeting Trick model vulnerabilities are less common. Static analysis tools might be used for general code quality but not specifically for Trick model security.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formalized and mandatory security-focused code review process for all custom Trick model code.
*   Security audit checklists specifically tailored to Trick model development and common Trick-related vulnerabilities.
*   Systematic use of static analysis tools for security vulnerability detection in Trick model code as part of the development workflow.

1.  **Identify Input Points in Trick Models from Simulation Data:** Within each custom Trick model and S-function, specifically identify all points where data received *from the Trick simulation engine* (e.g., state variables, input signals, environment data) is used as input for model calculations or decisions.
2.  **Apply Sanitization and Validation to Trick Simulation Inputs within Models:** For each identified input point within a Trick model, implement sanitization and validation steps *inside* the model's code. This is to ensure that even data coming from within the Trick simulation environment is handled safely.
    *   **Data Type and Range Checks (within models):** Re-verify data types and ranges of inputs received from Trick within the model's logic, as assumptions about data validity from the Trick engine itself might be flawed or exploitable.
    *   **Boundary Condition Handling (within models):** Ensure Trick models handle boundary conditions and edge cases of simulation data gracefully and securely. Avoid assumptions that data from Trick will always be within perfectly expected ranges.
    *   **Input Transformation and Encoding (within models):** If Trick simulation data needs to be transformed or encoded within a model, do so securely to prevent injection vulnerabilities during transformation, especially if the transformed data is used in system calls or external communications initiated by the model.
3.  **Error Handling within Trick Models for Simulation Data Issues:** Implement robust error handling within Trick models to gracefully handle invalid or unexpected data received from the Trick simulation engine. Avoid crashing the simulation or exposing sensitive information in model error messages.

Implement authorization controls to restrict what actions authenticated users or systems are allowed to perform within the Trick simulation environment. This should be based on the principle of least privilege. For example:
    *   Different roles for simulation administrators, operators, and viewers.
    *   Permissions to start/stop simulations, modify configurations, access simulation data, etc.
4.  **Enforce Authentication and Authorization in Trick Interface Logic:**  Integrate authentication and authorization checks into the code that handles requests from Trick interfaces.
