# Threat Model Analysis for nasa/trick

## Threat: [Malicious Simulation Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious_simulation_configuration_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious configuration files or input parameters for the Trick simulation. This might involve manipulating numerical values to cause unexpected behavior, injecting commands that are interpreted by Trick or its underlying system, or providing malformed data that triggers vulnerabilities in Trick's parsing logic *within Trick itself*.

**Impact:** The simulation could produce incorrect or misleading results, consume excessive resources leading to denial of service, or potentially execute arbitrary code on the server if *Trick's configuration parsing has vulnerabilities*.

**Affected Component:** Trick's Input Processing Modules (e.g., the routines that load and parse configuration files, input decks, or command line arguments).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all configuration data and simulation parameters *within Trick's input processing logic*.
* Use a well-defined and restricted schema for configuration files *enforced by Trick*.
* Avoid interpreting configuration values as executable code unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution *within Trick's design*.
* Run Trick with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities *within the Trick process*.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Simulation](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_simulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide inputs or configurations that cause the Trick simulation to enter an infinite loop or consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) without bound *due to flaws in Trick's simulation logic or resource management*. This could be achieved by manipulating simulation parameters related to termination conditions or by exploiting flaws in the simulation logic itself *within Trick*.

**Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unresponsive or crashing the server hosting the simulation. Other applications on the same server might also be affected.

**Affected Component:** Trick's Core Simulation Engine (specifically the simulation loop and resource management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts and resource limits *within Trick's simulation engine*.
* Monitor resource usage of running simulations and automatically terminate those exceeding predefined thresholds *at the Trick level*.
* Carefully review simulation logic *within Trick's codebase* to identify and prevent potential infinite loops or unbounded resource consumption.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Malicious Simulation Models or Definitions](./threats/code_injection_via_malicious_simulation_models_or_definitions.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to define or upload simulation models, environments, or other components that are processed by Trick, an attacker could inject malicious code within these definitions. If *Trick's parsing or execution of these definitions is not properly secured*, this code could be executed on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server or perform arbitrary actions.

**Affected Component:** Trick's Model Loading and Interpretation Modules (the parts of Trick that parse and execute simulation definitions).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid allowing users to directly define or upload executable code for the simulation if possible *within the application's interaction with Trick*.
* Implement strict validation and sanitization of all user-provided simulation definitions *within Trick's model loading logic*.
* Employ static analysis tools to scan simulation definitions for potentially malicious code patterns *before they are processed by Trick*.
