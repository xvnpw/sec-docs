# Attack Surface Analysis for nasa/trick

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Simulation Definition Files (S-files)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_simulation_definition_files__s-files_.md)

**Description:** Attackers provide or modify S-files containing malicious code or logic.

**How TRICK Contributes:** TRICK interprets and executes the logic defined in S-files. If not properly sandboxed or validated, malicious code within these files can be executed with the privileges of the TRICK process.

**Example:** An attacker injects a system call within an S-file that deletes critical system files when the simulation is run.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or system running the TRICK simulation, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation on S-files, including syntax checks, schema validation, and potentially sandboxing the execution environment for initial parsing.
* Avoid allowing users to directly upload or modify S-files in production environments.
* If dynamic S-file generation is necessary, ensure robust sanitization and validation of all user-provided inputs used in the generation process.
* Consider using a more restrictive language or configuration format for defining simulations if full S-file flexibility is not required.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Input Data Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_input_data_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers provide malicious input data that exploits vulnerabilities in how TRICK processes and uses this data.

**How TRICK Contributes:** TRICK relies on input data to drive simulations. Weak input validation within TRICK's core or within custom models can lead to exploitable conditions.

**Example:** Providing an excessively large numerical value as input that causes a buffer overflow within a TRICK component or a custom model written in C/C++.

**Impact:** Denial of service, memory corruption, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if the overflow is exploitable.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization on all data provided to the TRICK simulation, both at the application level and within custom models.
* Enforce data type and range checks.
* Use safe memory handling practices in custom models (avoid raw pointers, use smart pointers, bounds checking).
* Regularly update TRICK and its dependencies to patch known input handling vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in External Models and Libraries](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_external_models_and_libraries.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within custom or third-party models integrated with TRICK.

**How TRICK Contributes:** TRICK allows the integration of external models, often written in languages like C/C++. Vulnerabilities in these models become part of the application's attack surface.

**Example:** A custom flight dynamics model has a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by specific simulation parameters.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the TRICK process, denial of service, data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Conduct thorough security reviews and static/dynamic analysis of all external models before integration.
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom models.
* Regularly update and patch external libraries and dependencies used by the models.
* Consider sandboxing or isolating external models to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.
