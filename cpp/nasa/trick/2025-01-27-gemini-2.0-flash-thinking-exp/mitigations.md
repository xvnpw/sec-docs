## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) within Trick](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_role-based_access_control__rbac__within_trick.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Trick
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles in Trick:** Leverage Trick's built-in role management features (if available) or configure its authorization system to define granular roles directly within Trick. Examples: "Trick Config Viewer," "Trick Experiment Editor," "Trick Admin."
    2.  **Assign Permissions within Trick:**  Within Trick's configuration, assign specific permissions to each defined role.  For instance, a "Trick Config Viewer" role might only have read access to configurations within the Trick UI or API. An "Experiment Editor" role could be granted permissions to create and modify experiments within Trick.
    3.  **Assign Users to Trick Roles:**  Assign users to these Trick-specific roles directly within the Trick platform's user management interface or through its API. Ensure user assignments align with the principle of least privilege within the context of Trick's functionalities.
    4.  **Enforce RBAC in Trick's Configuration:** Configure Trick to actively enforce these roles and permissions for all actions performed within the Trick platform, including accessing the UI, using the API, and modifying configurations or experiments.
    5.  **Regularly Review Trick Role Assignments:** Periodically review user role assignments within Trick to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with current access needs related to Trick's functionalities.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Trick Configurations/Experiments (High Severity):** Prevents users from viewing or modifying Trick configurations and experiments without proper authorization within the Trick platform itself.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Trick (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users gaining elevated privileges *within Trick* that they are not entitled to, limiting their ability to misuse Trick's features.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration via Trick (Medium Severity):** Limits the potential for accidental misconfigurations *within Trick* by restricting modification access to authorized personnel within the Trick platform.
*   **Impact:** **Moderate** to **Significant** risk reduction for unauthorized actions and data breaches *specifically related to Trick*. RBAC within Trick directly controls access to its functionalities.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic user roles might be present in the underlying system Trick uses for authentication, but granular roles *within Trick itself* and their enforcement are likely not fully configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Granular roles need to be defined *within Trick's configuration*. Permissions need to be meticulously assigned to these roles *within Trick*.  The enforcement of these roles needs to be configured within Trick's authorization mechanisms.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Configuration Validation and Schema Enforcement within Trick](./mitigation_strategies/implement_configuration_validation_and_schema_enforcement_within_trick.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configuration Schema Validation within Trick
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Configuration Schemas for Trick:** Create schemas (e.g., using JSON Schema or a format supported by Trick if it has schema features) that define the structure, data types, allowed values, and required fields for all configurations *managed by Trick*.
    2.  **Utilize Trick's Validation Features:** Explore if Trick offers built-in configuration validation features or mechanisms to enforce schemas. If so, configure Trick to use these features and load your defined schemas into Trick.
    3.  **Implement Custom Validation in Trick Integration (if needed):** If Trick lacks built-in schema validation, implement custom validation logic within your application's code that *integrates with Trick*. This logic should fetch configurations from Trick and validate them against your schemas *before* applying them to your application.
    4.  **Configure Trick to Reject Invalid Configurations:** Ensure that Trick (or your integration logic) is configured to reject any configuration that fails schema validation and provide informative error messages *through Trick's interface or API* or your application's logs.
    5.  **Maintain Schemas alongside Trick Configurations:** Version control schemas alongside your Trick configurations and update schemas whenever the structure of configurations managed by Trick changes.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks via Trick Configurations (e.g., Command Injection, SQL Injection - Medium to High Severity depending on context):** Prevents injection attacks by ensuring that configuration values *managed by Trick* conform to expected data types and formats, preventing malicious code injection through Trick.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Trick Configurations (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of invalid or corrupted configurations *within Trick* being applied to your application, which could lead to malfunctions or unexpected behavior originating from Trick.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Malformed Trick Configurations (Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks caused by configurations *managed by Trick* that consume excessive resources or trigger application errors due to invalid data passed through Trick.
*   **Impact:** **Moderate** risk reduction for injection attacks and data integrity issues *specifically related to configurations managed by Trick*. Schema validation within or integrated with Trick acts as input sanitization for configurations flowing through Trick.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  Likely not implemented specifically within Trick.  Some basic validation might exist in the application code that *uses* configurations from Trick, but schema enforcement *within Trick itself* is probably missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to investigate Trick's capabilities for schema validation. If available, schemas need to be defined and configured within Trick. If not, custom validation logic needs to be implemented in the application's integration with Trick to validate configurations fetched from Trick.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Configuration Change Auditing and Logging within Trick](./mitigation_strategies/enable_configuration_change_auditing_and_logging_within_trick.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configuration Change Auditing and Logging within Trick
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Audit Logging in Trick:**  Configure Trick to enable its built-in audit logging features (if available). This should log all configuration changes made *within Trick*, including who made the change, when, what was changed (old and new values), and the source of the change (e.g., Trick UI, API).
    2.  **Centralize Trick's Logs:** Integrate Trick's audit logs with your central logging system.  Configure Trick to export its logs to your central logging infrastructure for easier analysis and correlation with other application logs.
    3.  **Implement Monitoring and Alerting on Trick Logs:** Set up monitoring and alerting rules specifically on Trick's audit logs to detect suspicious or unauthorized configuration changes *made through Trick*. Alert on events like changes by unauthorized users *within Trick*, changes to critical configurations *managed by Trick*, or unusual modification patterns *within Trick*.
    4.  **Secure Trick's Log Storage:** Ensure that Trick's logs (and the central logging system) are securely stored and access is restricted to authorized personnel. Protect logs from tampering or deletion, especially logs originating from Trick.
    5.  **Regularly Review Trick's Audit Logs:** Periodically review audit logs *from Trick* to identify any security incidents, policy violations, or areas for improvement in configuration management processes *within Trick*.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes via Trick (High Severity):** Provides visibility into who is making configuration changes *within Trick*, making it easier to detect and investigate unauthorized modifications made through the Trick platform.
    *   **Insider Threats via Trick (Medium Severity):** Helps detect malicious activities by insiders who might attempt to tamper with configurations *using Trick* for malicious purposes.
    *   **Compliance Violations related to Trick Configuration Management (Medium Severity):** Provides an audit trail for configuration changes *made through Trick*, which is often required for compliance when using a configuration management tool like Trick.
    *   **Incident Response and Forensics related to Trick (Medium Severity):** Audit logs *from Trick* are crucial for incident response and forensic investigations to understand the timeline of events and identify the root cause of security incidents related to configuration changes made via Trick.
*   **Impact:** **Moderate** risk reduction for unauthorized changes *made through Trick* and improved incident response capabilities *related to Trick*. Auditing within Trick provides visibility and accountability for actions performed in the platform.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic logging *of application events* might be present, but dedicated audit logging *within Trick itself* for configuration changes is likely not fully enabled or integrated.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Audit logging needs to be enabled and configured *within Trick*. Integration of Trick's logs with a central logging system is missing. Monitoring and alerting specifically on Trick's audit logs are not yet configured.
