# Threat Model Analysis for nasa/trick

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Simulation Control](./threats/unauthenticated_simulation_control.md)

Description: Attacker gains access to the Trick web interface without valid credentials or bypassing authentication mechanisms. They can then use the web interface to start, stop, modify parameters, or otherwise control the simulation. This could be achieved by exploiting default credentials, weak authentication, or authentication bypass vulnerabilities *within Trick's web interface implementation*.
Impact: Unauthorized modification of simulation parameters leading to incorrect or unreliable results, denial of service by stopping or disrupting the simulation, potential information disclosure if the attacker can access simulation outputs or logs.
Affected Trick Component: Trick Web Interface, Authentication Module (if present within Trick)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Trick web interface (e.g., strong passwords, multi-factor authentication).
    * Disable or remove default credentials provided by Trick (if any).
    * Regularly audit and patch authentication components *within the Trick web interface context*.
    * Enforce principle of least privilege for user access to the web interface.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass in Web API](./threats/authorization_bypass_in_web_api.md)

Description: Attacker, even if authenticated, bypasses authorization checks in the Trick web API. They can then access or modify resources or perform actions they are not supposed to, such as accessing sensitive simulation data or modifying critical simulation parameters beyond their authorized scope. This could be due to flaws in the API authorization logic *specific to Trick's web API*.
Impact: Unauthorized access to sensitive simulation data, unauthorized control over the simulation potentially leading to data integrity issues or denial of service, privilege escalation within the Trick system.
Affected Trick Component: Trick Web Interface, Web API, Authorization Module (within Trick's web interface)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement robust and well-tested authorization logic in the Trick web API.
    * Use role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions within the Trick web interface.
    * Regularly audit and test API authorization endpoints provided by Trick.
    * Follow secure coding practices for authorization implementation *within the Trick web interface*.

## Threat: [Web Interface Input Injection](./threats/web_interface_input_injection.md)

Description: Attacker injects malicious input into the Trick web interface forms or API requests. This input is not properly validated and processed by the Trick application, leading to unintended consequences. This could manifest as command injection if inputs are used to execute system commands *by Trick components*, or injection into simulation parameters causing unexpected simulation behavior.
Impact: Potential for arbitrary code execution on the Trick server *if Trick components are vulnerable to command injection*, manipulation of simulation behavior leading to incorrect results or denial of service.
Affected Trick Component: Trick Web Interface, Input Handling Modules, Simulation Parameter Processing
Risk Severity: High (for command injection),
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement strict input validation on all web interface inputs and API requests *handled by Trick components*.
    * Avoid using user-provided input directly in system commands or sensitive operations *within Trick components*.
    * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when Trick components interact with databases or external systems.

## Threat: [Simulation Data Injection Vulnerability](./threats/simulation_data_injection_vulnerability.md)

Description: If Trick allows external data injection into the simulation (e.g., through network sockets, files, or other interfaces *provided by Trick*), an attacker can send malicious or malformed data. If this data is not properly validated and processed by the simulation engine, it could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even code execution *within the simulation environment*.
Impact: Manipulation of simulation results, potential for denial of service by crashing the simulation, in severe cases, potential for code execution on the Trick server *within the simulation context*.
Affected Trick Component: Trick Simulation Engine, Data Input Modules, External Interface Handlers (provided by Trick)
Risk Severity: High (if code execution is possible),
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all external data sources *ingested by Trick*.
    * Use secure protocols and authentication for external data interfaces *provided by Trick*.
    * Isolate the simulation engine from untrusted networks if possible.
    * Regularly audit and test data input handling logic *within Trick's simulation engine*.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Trick Core Logic](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_trick_core_logic.md)

Description: Bugs or security vulnerabilities exist within the core C++ or Python simulation engine code of Trick itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to cause unexpected simulation behavior, crashes, or potentially gain code execution on the server *within the simulation environment*. This is more likely in older or unpatched versions of Trick.
Impact: Unpredictable simulation behavior, potential for crashes, in extreme cases, potential for code execution and system compromise *within the simulation context*.
Affected Trick Component: Trick Simulation Engine (Core C++ and Python Code)
Risk Severity: High (if code execution is possible),
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Trick updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
    * Monitor for security advisories and patch releases for Trick and its dependencies.
    * Consider static and dynamic code analysis of Trick core components if feasible.
    * Report any discovered vulnerabilities to the Trick development team.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Dependencies](./threats/vulnerable_dependencies.md)

Description: Trick relies on third-party libraries and components (C++, Python libraries, web server components). These dependencies may contain known security vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities through the Trick application if dependencies are not properly managed and updated.
Impact: Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, including code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, and more.
Affected Trick Component: Trick Dependencies (Third-party Libraries used by Trick)
Risk Severity: Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, can be High to Critical.
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Maintain an inventory of Trick dependencies.
    * Regularly scan Trick's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    * Update Trick's dependencies to the latest patched versions promptly.
    * Implement a dependency management process to track and update dependencies used by Trick.
