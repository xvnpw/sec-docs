# Project Design Document: NASA Trick Simulation Environment

## 1. Project Overview

**Project Name:** NASA Trick Simulation Environment

**Project Repository:** [https://github.com/nasa/trick](https://github.com/nasa/trick)

**Project Description:** Trick is a general-purpose simulation development toolkit developed by NASA. It provides a robust and flexible framework for building and executing simulations across various domains, including aerospace, robotics, and scientific computing. Trick aims to simplify the simulation development process by offering a common set of capabilities and user interfaces, allowing users to focus on the unique aspects of their specific simulations rather than infrastructure concerns.  It supports features like real-time and faster-than-real-time simulation, parallel execution, data logging, checkpointing, and interactive user interfaces. Trick is designed for extensibility, allowing users to integrate custom models, algorithms, and tools.

**Purpose of this Document:** This document provides a detailed design overview of the Trick Simulation Environment. It is intended to serve as a foundation for subsequent threat modeling activities. By clearly outlining the system architecture, components, data flow, and interactions, this document will enable a comprehensive identification and analysis of potential security vulnerabilities within the Trick framework and simulations built upon it. This document will be used by security experts to perform a comprehensive threat model and identify potential attack vectors and mitigation strategies.

## 2. System Architecture

Trick employs a modular and extensible architecture, centered around a simulation core and various supporting components. The core manages the simulation execution, time progression, and data management.  Simulations are built by defining models and configuring the simulation environment through input files. User interaction is facilitated through command-line interfaces (CLI) and graphical user interfaces (GUI).  The architecture is designed to be flexible, allowing for customization and integration of new functionalities.

The high-level architecture can be visualized as follows:

```

**Key Architectural Components:**

* **Input Files ('S-cards', 'L-cards'):**  Configuration files that define simulation parameters, model parameters, initial conditions, and simulation execution settings. 'S-cards' (Simulation cards) typically define simulation-wide settings, such as simulation duration, time step, and output configurations. 'L-cards' (Load cards) are used to load and configure specific simulation models, specifying model parameters, initial states, and integration methods. These files are typically text-based and human-readable, but their parsing and processing are critical for system security.
* **Input Processor:**  Parses the input files ('S-cards', 'L-cards') and configures the simulation environment and models based on the provided specifications. It translates the declarative input into internal data structures and settings used by the Simulation Core. This component is responsible for validating the input files against a defined schema and ensuring that the provided configurations are consistent and valid. Error handling and robust parsing are crucial in this component to prevent vulnerabilities.
* **Simulation Core:** The heart of the Trick environment. It manages the overall simulation execution, including:
    * **Scheduler:** Controls the order and timing of simulation events and model execution. It determines which models are executed at each simulation step based on defined rates, priorities, and event triggers. The scheduler ensures the correct temporal progression of the simulation.
    * **Integrator:**  Solves the differential equations defined within the simulation models to advance the simulation state over time. Trick supports various numerical integration algorithms, and the integrator applies the chosen algorithm to update the state variables based on model outputs.
    * **Data Recording:**  Manages the collection and storage of simulation data based on user-defined recording specifications. It interacts with the Output Manager to write selected simulation variables to output files at specified frequencies.
    * **Variable Server:** A central repository for all simulation variables. It acts as a shared memory space where all simulation components can access and modify simulation data in a controlled manner. It is the central communication hub of the Trick environment.
* **Models (User-Defined, C/C++):**  Represent the system being simulated. Users develop models in C or C++ to define the behavior and dynamics of the simulated entities. Models interact with the Simulation Core through well-defined interfaces, primarily through the Variable Server. Models encapsulate the mathematical representations and algorithms that describe the simulated system. They are the core logic providers of the simulation.
* **Variable Server:**  Provides a centralized mechanism for accessing and manipulating simulation variables. It acts as an intermediary between models, the Simulation Core, and user interfaces, ensuring data consistency and controlled access. It manages variable registration, access control (potentially), and data type enforcement.  Efficient and secure access to variables is critical for performance and security.
* **Output Manager:**  Handles all aspects of simulation output, including:
    * **Data Logging:**  Writes simulation data to log files in various formats for analysis and visualization.  Supports various output formats (e.g., ASCII, binary, custom formats) and output destinations (files, network sockets).
    * **Checkpointing:**  Saves the simulation state at specific points in time, allowing for later restart and analysis. Checkpoints capture the entire state of the simulation, enabling reproducibility and recovery from interruptions.
* **Output Files (Data Logs, Checkpoints):** Files generated by the Output Manager containing simulation data and checkpoint information. Data logs are typically used for post-simulation analysis, visualization, and validation. Checkpoints enable restarting simulations from a saved state, which is crucial for long-running simulations or for debugging purposes.
* **User Interface (GUI/CLI):** Provides interfaces for users to interact with the running simulation. This includes:
    * **Graphical User Interface (GUI):**  Offers visual tools for monitoring simulation progress, visualizing data in real-time (plots, 3D visualizations), and controlling simulation execution interactively. GUIs provide a user-friendly way to interact with complex simulations.
    * **Command Line Interface (CLI):**  Provides text-based commands for interacting with the simulation, often used for scripting, automation, and batch processing. CLIs are essential for automation and integration into larger workflows.

## 5. Deployment Considerations

Trick is designed to be deployable in various environments, ranging from local workstations to large-scale HPC clusters and cloud platforms. Deployment considerations impact performance, scalability, and security.

* **Local Workstation:** For development, testing, debugging, and smaller, interactive simulations. Deployment is typically straightforward, involving building Trick from source and running simulations directly on the user's machine (Linux, macOS, potentially Windows via WSL or VMs). Security considerations are primarily focused on local user access control and protecting input/output files on the local file system.
* **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Clusters:** For computationally intensive simulations requiring significant processing power and memory. Trick's parallel execution capabilities are leveraged on HPC clusters, often using distributed computing techniques (e.g., MPI, shared memory parallelism). Deployment on HPC clusters involves:
    * **Batch Job Submission:** Simulations are typically submitted as batch jobs to a job scheduler (e.g., Slurm, PBS).
    * **Distributed File Systems:** Input and output files are often stored on shared, high-performance distributed file systems (e.g., Lustre, GPFS).
    * **Resource Management:** HPC resource managers allocate compute nodes and resources to simulation jobs.
    * **Security in HPC:** Security in HPC environments is critical and involves access control to the cluster, secure job submission, data security on shared file systems, and network security within the cluster.
* **Cloud Environments:** Increasingly, simulations are being deployed in cloud environments (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) for scalability, elasticity, and accessibility. Cloud deployment offers on-demand resources and simplifies infrastructure management. Cloud deployment strategies include:
    * **Virtual Machines (VMs):** Deploying Trick on cloud VMs, similar to local workstation or HPC deployments.
    * **Containers (Docker, Kubernetes):** Containerizing Trick for easier deployment, scaling, and management in cloud environments. Kubernetes can be used for orchestrating containerized Trick deployments.
    * **Cloud HPC Services:** Leveraging cloud-based HPC services (e.g., AWS ParallelCluster, Azure CycleCloud, Google Cloud HPC Toolkit) to run large-scale simulations in the cloud.
    * **Serverless Computing (Potentially):** For specific simulation components or workflows, serverless computing could be explored for event-driven simulation tasks.
    * **Security in Cloud:** Cloud security is paramount and involves securing cloud accounts, access control to cloud resources, network security (VPCs, security groups), data encryption in transit and at rest, and compliance with cloud security best practices.

**Deployment Diagram (Conceptual - Cloud Deployment with Containers):**

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Cloud Environment (Kubernetes Cluster)"
    A["User"] --> B["Load Balancer"];
    B --> C("User Interface Pod (Container)");
    C --> D("Simulation Core Pod (Container)");
    D --> E("Variable Server (Shared Volume/Service)");
    D --> F("Output Manager Pod (Container)");
    F --> G["Cloud Storage (Object Storage)"];

    E --> D;
    E --> C;
    end
    style "Cloud Environment (Kubernetes Cluster)" fill:#efe,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

In a cloud deployment using containers and Kubernetes, different Trick components can be deployed as separate containers (Pods) within the Kubernetes cluster.  Communication between containers can occur through Kubernetes services and shared volumes. Input files and output files are often stored in cloud object storage services (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage).  Load balancers can distribute user traffic to UI containers, and Kubernetes manages container orchestration, scaling, and resilience.

## 6. Security Considerations for Threat Modeling

This section outlines key security considerations for threat modeling the Trick Simulation Environment, categorized by potential threat areas.

**6.1 Input Validation and Data Sanitization:**

**6.6 Communication Security:**

* **Threat:** Insecure communication channels between Trick components could be vulnerable to:
    * **Eavesdropping:** Attackers could intercept communication and steal sensitive simulation data.
    * **Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks:** Attackers could intercept and modify communication between components, compromising data integrity or injecting malicious commands.
* **Components Affected:** All components that communicate with each other, especially in distributed deployments (Simulation Core, Variable Server, User Interface, Output Manager).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Encryption:** Encrypt communication channels between components using secure protocols (e.g., TLS/SSL, SSH).
    * **Authentication and Integrity Checks:** Implement authentication and integrity checks for communication channels to verify the identity of communicating parties and detect tampering.
    * **Secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** Use secure IPC mechanisms for communication between components within the same system (e.g., secure sockets, authenticated shared memory).
    * **Network Segmentation:** Segment network communication to isolate Trick components and limit the impact of potential network breaches.

These security considerations provide a starting point for a comprehensive threat model of the NASA Trick Simulation Environment. A detailed threat modeling exercise would involve further analysis of each component, data flow, and potential attack vector to identify specific threats, assess risks, and develop appropriate mitigation strategies.
