## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving NASA Trick

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the NASA Trick library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Trick Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Spoofed Trick Instance Connection** | An attacker sets up a malicious or modified Trick instance on the network and tricks the application into connecting to it instead of the legitimate one. This could be done by DNS spoofing, ARP poisoning, or exploiting misconfigurations in the application's connection logic. | The application receives fabricated simulation data, leading to incorrect decisions, potentially causing harm if the application controls physical systems or processes sensitive data. | Application's Trick Interface (e.g., API calls, network connection logic) | High | - Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for connecting to the Trick instance (e.g., mutual TLS). - Verify the identity of the Trick instance before establishing a connection. - Use a dedicated and isolated network for communication between the application and Trick. - Implement anomaly detection to identify unexpected connections. |
| **Tampered Simulation Input Files** | An attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system where Trick's input files (e.g., `.trick` files, data dictionary files) are stored and modifies them to alter the simulation parameters or initial conditions. | The simulation runs with manipulated parameters, leading to inaccurate results and potentially causing the application to make incorrect decisions based on the flawed simulation. | Input File Parsing Module, Data Dictionary Loading | High | - Implement strict access control on the directories and files containing Trick's input data. - Use file integrity monitoring systems to detect unauthorized modifications. - Store input files in a secure location with appropriate permissions. - Consider using digital signatures to verify the integrity of input files. |
| **Malicious Code Injection via Models** | An attacker crafts malicious code within a simulation model (e.g., in S-functions or other custom code integrated into Trick) that gets executed during the simulation run. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how Trick handles model code or by compromising the development environment where models are created. | The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system running Trick, potentially gaining control of the system, accessing sensitive data, or disrupting the simulation environment. | Model Loading and Execution Engine, S-function Interface | Critical | - Implement rigorous code review processes for all custom models and integrations. - Enforce secure coding practices for model development. - Utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities in model code. - Run Trick in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges. |
| **Crashing Trick via Exploitable Vulnerabilities** | An attacker exploits known or unknown vulnerabilities in Trick's core code or libraries to cause it to crash. This could be achieved through crafted input data, specific simulation scenarios, or by exploiting memory corruption issues. | The simulation terminates unexpectedly, disrupting the application's functionality and potentially leading to data loss or inconsistent state. | Core Simulation Engine, Memory Management | High | - Stay updated with the latest versions of Trick and apply security patches promptly. - Report any potential vulnerabilities found in Trick to the developers. - Implement robust error handling in the application to gracefully handle Trick failures and potentially restart the simulation. - Consider using memory safety tools during Trick development (if applicable). |
