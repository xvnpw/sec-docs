# Attack Surface Analysis for nasa/trick

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Simulation Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_simulation_configuration_files.md)

**Description:**  The application uses configuration files (e.g., `.trickrc`, `.makefile`) to define simulation parameters and execution settings.

**How TRICK Contributes to the Attack Surface:** TRICK relies on these files to set up and run simulations. If these files are not properly validated or are sourced from untrusted locations, they can be manipulated to alter the simulation's behavior in unintended and potentially harmful ways.

**Example:** An attacker could modify a configuration file to point to malicious shared libraries, execute arbitrary commands during simulation setup, or cause resource exhaustion by setting extremely high simulation parameters.

**Impact:**  Denial of service, arbitrary code execution on the server running the simulation, data manipulation, or exfiltration of sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict validation and sanitization of all configuration file inputs.
*   Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted access permissions.
*   Use a well-defined and documented schema for configuration files and enforce it.
*   Consider using digitally signed configuration files to ensure integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of User-Defined Models](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_user-defined_models.md)

**Description:** TRICK allows users to define custom simulation models, often written in C++ or Python.

**How TRICK Contributes to the Attack Surface:** TRICK executes these user-defined models. If these models contain vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs, insecure function calls) or are intentionally malicious, they can be exploited during simulation execution.

**Example:** A malicious user could provide a model with a buffer overflow vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution on the simulation server when TRICK processes it.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potential compromise of the entire system, data corruption, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement sandboxing or containerization to isolate the execution of user-defined models.
*   Enforce secure coding practices for model development and provide guidelines to users.
*   Perform static and dynamic analysis of user-provided models before execution.
*   Limit the privileges of the TRICK process executing user-defined code.
