# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/incubator-brpc

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Authentication (bRPC `Authenticator`)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_authentication__brpc__authenticator__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Strong Authentication using bRPC's `Authenticator` Interface.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create an `Authenticator` Implementation:** Create a new class that implements the `brpc::Authenticator` interface. This interface has a single method, `VerifyCredential`, which takes the authentication string, client address, and an `AuthContext` as input.
    2.  **Implement `VerifyCredential`:** Within the `VerifyCredential` method:
        *   Receive authentication data from the incoming request (typically in the `authentication` field of the request metadata).
        *   Validate the credentials against your chosen authentication system (OAuth 2.0/OIDC, mTLS, custom token).  This part is *not* bRPC-specific, but the *interface* is.
        *   Populate `AuthContext` (if successful) with information about the authenticated user.
        *   Return `0` for success, a non-zero error code for failure.
    3.  **Register the `Authenticator`:** In your bRPC server setup, register your `Authenticator` implementation using `Server::AddService` or `Server::AddProtobufService`, passing an instance of your authenticator.
    4.  **Client-Side Authentication:** On the client-side, include the authentication data in the request metadata using `Controller::set_authentication`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from accessing services without valid credentials.
    *   **Spoofing (Severity: High):** Makes it difficult to impersonate legitimate users/services.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Severity: High):** When combined with TLS (which bRPC supports), prevents interception.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination with proper implementation).
    *   **Spoofing:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **MitM Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (when used with TLS).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Describe where the `Authenticator` is implemented and registered (e.g., "Authenticator in `auth/MyAuthenticator.cpp`, registered in `server/main.cpp`").

*   **Missing Implementation:** Describe where authentication is missing or incomplete (e.g., "Authenticator not registered for all services").

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection and Request Limits (`max_concurrency`)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_and_request_limits___max_concurrency__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure bRPC's `max_concurrency` setting.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Locate Server Configuration:** Find where your bRPC `Server` is being configured (likely in your server's main function or initialization code).
    2.  **Set `max_concurrency`:** Use the `ServerOptions::max_concurrency` member to set the maximum number of concurrent requests the server will handle.  Choose a value appropriate for your server's resources and expected load.  Start conservatively and adjust based on monitoring.  Example: `options.max_concurrency = 100;`

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the server with connections.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Prevents the server from running out of resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Describe where `max_concurrency` is set (e.g., "Set in `server/main.cpp`").

*   **Missing Implementation:** State if `max_concurrency` is not set or is set to an unreasonably high value.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Management (`timeout_ms`)](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_management___timeout_ms__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Set Appropriate Timeouts using `Controller::set_timeout_ms`.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Client-Side Implementation:**  *Before* making a bRPC call, use the `Controller::set_timeout_ms` method to set a timeout (in milliseconds) for the request.  This is done on the *client* side.
    2.  **Choose Appropriate Timeout:** Select a timeout value that is reasonable for the expected response time of the service, plus some buffer for network latency.
    3. **Example:**
    ```c++
    brpc::Controller cntl;
    cntl.set_timeout_ms(5000); // 5-second timeout
    MyService_Stub stub(&channel);
    stub.MyMethod(&cntl, &request, &response, nullptr);
    ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents slow clients from tying up resources.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Prevents long-running requests from consuming resources.
    * **Deadlocks (Severity: Medium):** Helps to prevent deadlocks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced.
    * **Deadlocks:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Describe where `timeout_ms` is set (e.g., "Set in client code for each RPC call").

*   **Missing Implementation:** Describe where timeouts are missing (e.g., "No timeouts set for Service B").

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debugging Endpoints (bvar, /status)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debugging_endpoints__bvar__status_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable or Restrict Access to bRPC's Debugging Endpoints (`/status`, `bvar`).

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Build Configuration:** Determine how bRPC is being built.  Often, debugging features are enabled or disabled through build flags (e.g., CMake options, compiler defines).
    2.  **Disable Debugging Features:**  Modify the build configuration to *disable* the compilation of the debugging endpoints (`/status`, `bvar`) for production builds.  This is the most secure option. The exact method depends on your build system.
    3.  **(Less Preferred) Restrict Access:** If disabling is *absolutely* not possible, use network-level controls (firewalls, reverse proxies, *outside* of bRPC) and bRPC's `Authenticator` (if possible, though this might be tricky for these built-in endpoints) to *strictly* limit access.  This is a *fallback* approach, and disabling is strongly preferred.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from accessing sensitive server information.
    *   **Reconnaissance (Severity: Medium):** Makes it harder for attackers to gather information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Reconnaissance:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Describe how debugging endpoints are handled (e.g., "Disabled via CMake build flags in production builds").

*   **Missing Implementation:** Describe where debugging features are still exposed (e.g., "`/status` endpoint accessible").
