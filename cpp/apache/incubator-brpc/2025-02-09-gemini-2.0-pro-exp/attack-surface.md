# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/incubator-brpc

## Attack Surface: [1. Protocol Parsing and Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/1__protocol_parsing_and_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in how bRPC *itself* parses and handles incoming requests for its supported protocols (bRPC, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, gRPC). This is about vulnerabilities *within* the bRPC protocol implementation.
    *   **incubator-brpc Contribution:** bRPC is *directly* responsible for the implementation and handling of these protocols.  This is the core attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP/2 request with an invalid header frame that triggers a buffer overflow in bRPC's *own* parsing code, leading to a crash or RCE.  A malformed bRPC-specific request exploiting a bug in bRPC's internal handling.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Fuzz Testing (bRPC Core):**  Focus fuzzing efforts *directly* on bRPC's protocol implementations.  This requires understanding bRPC's internal structure and creating targeted fuzzers.
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep bRPC updated to the *absolute latest* version.  Security patches are often released to address protocol-level vulnerabilities.
        *   **Protocol Selection:** If possible, and if security is paramount, favor gRPC or HTTP/2 (with TLS) as they are generally more robustly designed than older protocols.  This reduces the *inherent* protocol risk.
        *   **WAF/Protocol Gateway (Custom Rules):**  If possible, use a WAF or gateway that can be configured with *custom rules* to understand and filter bRPC traffic at a deeper level than generic HTTP filtering.

## Attack Surface: [2. Protobuf Deserialization Exploits (within bRPC)](./attack_surfaces/2__protobuf_deserialization_exploits__within_brpc_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from bRPC's *internal* use and handling of Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for its own operations. This is distinct from the application's *use* of protobuf.
    *   **incubator-brpc Contribution:** bRPC uses protobuf internally.  Vulnerabilities in *this* internal usage are directly attributable to bRPC.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in how bRPC deserializes protobuf messages used for *internal communication* between bRPC components (e.g., for load balancing or service discovery) could be exploited. This is *not* about user-provided protobuf data.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE) (potentially with higher privileges if exploiting internal components).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Protobuf Library Updates (for bRPC):** Ensure that the protobuf library *used by bRPC itself* is always up-to-date. This might involve rebuilding bRPC from source if necessary.
        *   **Code Audits (bRPC Internals):**  Security audits of bRPC's source code, specifically focusing on its internal use of protobuf, are crucial.
        *   **Fuzz Testing (Internal bRPC Communication):** If possible, develop fuzzing strategies that target the internal communication channels of bRPC that use protobuf.

## Attack Surface: [3. Resource Exhaustion (bRPC Core)](./attack_surfaces/3__resource_exhaustion__brpc_core_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can overwhelm *bRPC's internal mechanisms* by sending crafted requests, consuming resources, or exploiting connection management vulnerabilities *within bRPC itself*.
    *   **incubator-brpc Contribution:** bRPC's connection pooling, asynchronous processing, and internal resource management are directly controlled by the framework.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in bRPC's connection handling logic to cause a large number of connections to remain open, exhausting resources even if the *application* has rate limiting.  Another example: triggering excessive memory allocation within bRPC's internal buffers.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-Service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Configuration Tuning (bRPC):**  Carefully review and tune bRPC's configuration options related to connection limits, timeouts, thread pools, and memory allocation.  Use conservative settings.
        *   **Monitoring (bRPC Internals):**  Monitor bRPC's *internal* metrics (if exposed) to detect unusual resource consumption patterns. This might require custom monitoring solutions.
        *   **Code Audits (Resource Management):**  Security audits of bRPC's source code, focusing on its resource management and connection handling, are important.
