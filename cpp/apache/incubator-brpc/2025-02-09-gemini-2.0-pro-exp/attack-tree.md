## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) Branch](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__branch.md)

*   **Vulnerability in Serialization/Deserialization (e.g., Protobuf) [HR][CN]:**
    *   **Description:** This is the most critical vulnerability.  brpc uses Protocol Buffers (protobuf) for data serialization. If the application doesn't *strictly* validate data *before* deserialization, an attacker can craft a malicious protobuf message. When this message is deserialized, it can trigger arbitrary code execution on the server. This is a classic "deserialization vulnerability," and while protobuf itself is designed to be safe, application-level errors can easily introduce this vulnerability.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Deserialization vulnerabilities are frequently found in applications.  The impact (RCE) is the highest possible.
    *   **Why Critical Node:** This is the entry point for a highly impactful attack.  Securing this is paramount.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement extremely rigorous validation of *every* field in *every* protobuf message *before* deserialization.  Validate data types, lengths, ranges, and allowed values. Use a whitelist approach (allow only known-good values).
        *   **Safe Deserialization:** Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible. If unavoidable, use a sandboxed environment or a restricted user account. Consider alternatives to full object deserialization, such as extracting only necessary fields.
        *   **Regular Audits:** Conduct frequent security audits of the code that handles protobuf serialization and deserialization. Pay close attention to any custom `protoc` plugins or extensions.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Keep protobuf and related libraries up-to-date.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzzing to send malformed protobuf messages and observe the application's behavior.

*   **Crafted Protobuf Message [HR][CN]:**
    *   **Description:** This is the actual exploit payload. The attacker crafts a protobuf message that, when deserialized, exploits the vulnerability described above.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** If a deserialization vulnerability exists, crafting a malicious message is highly likely.
    *   **Why Critical Node:** This is the direct exploitation step.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  The mitigation strategies are the same as for the "Vulnerability in Serialization/Deserialization" node, as this is the manifestation of that vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) Branch](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__branch.md)

*   **Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory) [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends requests designed to consume excessive server resources, making the application unresponsive to legitimate users.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Resource exhaustion attacks are relatively easy to launch and can have a significant impact on availability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of requests from a single client or IP address. brpc provides mechanisms for this.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure limits on CPU usage, memory allocation, and the number of bthreads.
        *   **Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for RPC calls to prevent long-running requests from consuming resources.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.

    *   **CPU: Intensive Ops [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends requests that trigger computationally expensive operations on the server, exhausting CPU resources.
        *   **Mitigation:** Same as general Resource Exhaustion.

    *   **Memory: Allocate Large Objects / Leak Memory [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends requests that cause the server to allocate large amounts of memory or trigger memory leaks, eventually leading to a crash or unresponsiveness.
        *   **Mitigation:** Same as general Resource Exhaustion, plus careful memory management in the application code.

*   **Network Flooding [HR][CN]:**
    *   **Description:** The attacker overwhelms the server with a large volume of network traffic, preventing legitimate requests from reaching the application.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Network flooding attacks are very common and easy to execute.
    *   **Why Critical Node:** This is a fundamental attack vector against network services.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network-Level Defenses:** Use firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS), and other network security tools.
        *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute traffic across multiple servers.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** (Also applies here, even at the network level).
        * **Connection Limits:** Limit the maximum number of concurrent connections.

    * **Send Massive Data [HR]:**
        * **Description:** Sending large amounts of data in requests to consume bandwidth and processing resources.
        * **Mitigation:** Input validation to limit request sizes, network-level defenses.
