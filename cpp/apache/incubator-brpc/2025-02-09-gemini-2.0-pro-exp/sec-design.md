Okay, let's create a design document for the Apache bRPC project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a high-performance, low-latency RPC framework.
*   Offer a robust and reliable solution for building distributed systems.
*   Support multiple programming languages (primarily C++, with potential for others).
*   Be easy to use and integrate into existing systems.
*   Maintain an active and supportive open-source community.
*   Reduce development time and operational costs for building distributed applications.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Service disruption or unavailability due to software defects or infrastructure failures.
*   Performance bottlenecks impacting application responsiveness and user experience.
*   Security vulnerabilities leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
*   Complexity hindering adoption and increasing the learning curve for developers.
*   Lack of community support and contribution, leading to project stagnation.
*   Incompatibility with evolving technologies and standards.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project uses CMake for build configuration, which can help manage dependencies and build settings securely. (Described in the build system documentation).
*   security control: The project includes unit tests and continuous integration (CI) to identify and prevent regressions, including potential security flaws. (Described in the testing and CI setup).
*   security control: The documentation provides guidance on safe usage and potential security considerations. (Described in various parts of the official documentation).
*   security control: bRPC uses Protocol Buffers for serialization, which, when used correctly, can help prevent some injection vulnerabilities. (Described in serialization related documentation).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The project relies on third-party libraries (e.g., Protocol Buffers, gflags), which may have their own vulnerabilities. Mitigation is through timely updates and monitoring of these dependencies.
*   accepted risk: The project is primarily focused on performance, and some security features might be optional or require explicit configuration.
*   accepted risk: The project is under active development, and new vulnerabilities might be discovered. The community relies on prompt reporting and patching.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI pipeline to automatically scan for common vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses.
*   security control: Implement a clear vulnerability disclosure and management process.
*   security control: Provide detailed security documentation, including best practices for secure configuration and deployment.
*   security control: Consider adding support for authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., TLS, OAuth, SPIFFE/SPIRE).
*   security control: Implement fuzz testing to identify edge cases and potential vulnerabilities related to input handling.
*   security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The framework should provide mechanisms for authenticating clients and servers. This could include TLS mutual authentication, API keys, or integration with existing identity providers.
*   Authorization:
    *   The framework should support authorization mechanisms to control access to specific services and methods. This could involve role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
*   Input Validation:
    *   All input received from clients should be strictly validated to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities. This includes validating data types, lengths, and formats. Protocol Buffers help with this, but additional checks might be needed.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Sensitive data transmitted between clients and servers should be encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms (e.g., TLS 1.3 or higher).
    *   Cryptographic keys should be managed securely, following best practices for key generation, storage, and rotation.
*   Data validation:
    *   All data should be validated before processing.

    SAST -- "Reports to" --> SecurityDashboard["Security Dashboard"]
    SCAScanner -- "Reports to" --> SecurityDashboard
     UnitTests -- "Reports to" --> TestReport["Test Report"]

```
Build Process Description:

1.  Developers commit code to a Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
2.  A webhook triggers the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI).
3.  The CI/CD pipeline checks out the code.
4.  The CI/CD pipeline runs a linter to enforce code style and identify potential issues.
5.  The CI/CD pipeline runs unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components.
6.  The CI/CD pipeline runs a SAST scanner (e.g., SonarQube, FindBugs) to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
7.  The CI/CD pipeline runs an SCA scanner (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) to identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
8.  If all checks pass, the CI/CD pipeline builds the application (e.g., compiles the code, creates a Docker image).
9.  The build artifact (e.g., Docker image) is pushed to an artifact registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry).
10. SAST and SCA scanners report their findings to a security dashboard for review and remediation.
11. Unit tests report to Test Report dashboard.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Linting: Enforces code style and helps prevent common coding errors that could lead to vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Unit Tests: Verify the functionality of individual components and help prevent regressions.
*   security control: SAST Scanning: Automatically identifies potential security vulnerabilities in the source code.
*   security control: SCA Scanning: Automatically identifies vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   security control: Build Automation: Ensures a consistent and repeatable build process, reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: Artifact Registry: Provides a secure and controlled environment for storing build artifacts.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   RPC communication between services: The core functionality of bRPC is to enable reliable and efficient communication between different services. Disruption of this process would directly impact the functionality of applications built on bRPC.
*   Service availability: Applications relying on bRPC need the services to be available and responsive. Downtime or performance degradation would negatively affect user experience and potentially business operations.

Data Sensitivity:

*   The sensitivity of the data handled by bRPC depends on the specific applications using it.
*   If bRPC is used to transmit sensitive data (e.g., personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, health information), then protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of that data is critical.
*   Even if the data itself is not inherently sensitive, unauthorized access or modification could still disrupt services or lead to other security issues.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific authentication and authorization mechanisms are planned or desired for bRPC?
*   What are the performance requirements and targets for bRPC (e.g., latency, throughput)?
*   What are the expected deployment environments (e.g., cloud providers, on-premises)?
*   What level of logging and monitoring is required for auditing and troubleshooting?
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities discovered in bRPC or its dependencies?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a high-performance RPC framework, with security being a critical but potentially secondary consideration in some design choices.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Basic security practices are followed (e.g., input validation, use of Protocol Buffers), but advanced security features (e.g., authentication, authorization) might not be fully implemented or require explicit configuration.
*   DESIGN: The deployment environment will be containerized (Kubernetes), and the build process will be automated using a CI/CD pipeline. The system will interact with external services and use third-party libraries.
