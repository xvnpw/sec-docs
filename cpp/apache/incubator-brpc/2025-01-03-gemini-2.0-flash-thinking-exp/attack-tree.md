## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Communication Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_communication_weaknesses.md)

Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Sniff Sensitive Data in Transit **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
            * Lack of Encryption (e.g., plain TCP without TLS)
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Modify RPC Messages **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
            * Downgrade Security Protocols (if negotiation exists)
            * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Inject Malicious Payloads **[HIGH-RISK PATH ENDS]**

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Network Communication Weaknesses:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the communication channel between the brpc client and server. This can involve intercepting, eavesdropping on, or manipulating network traffic. Weaknesses like lack of encryption make these attacks significantly easier.

* **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker positions themselves between the client and server, intercepting and potentially altering communication. This requires the attacker to control a network segment or compromise a device along the communication path.

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Sniff Sensitive Data in Transit:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If communication is not encrypted (e.g., using plain TCP), attackers can use network sniffing tools to capture and analyze the data being exchanged, potentially revealing sensitive information like credentials, API keys, or business data.

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Modify RPC Messages:**
    * **Attack Vector:** After successfully performing a MitM attack, an attacker can alter the content of RPC requests or responses. This can be used to change the intended actions, manipulate data, or bypass security checks.

* **Downgrade Security Protocols (if negotiation exists):**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the communication protocol supports negotiation of security features (like encryption), an attacker might try to force the client and server to use weaker or no security measures, making other attacks easier.

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Payloads:**
    * **Attack Vector:** By modifying RPC messages, attackers can inject malicious data or commands into the communication stream. This could exploit vulnerabilities in the server's processing logic or even lead to command execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]** Maliciously Crafted Protobuf/Thrift Messages **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Trigger Buffer Overflows **[HIGH-RISK PATH ENDS]**

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the process of converting data structures into a format suitable for transmission (serialization) and back (deserialization). Vulnerabilities in the serialization libraries (like Protobuf or Thrift) or in the application's handling of serialized data can be exploited.

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Maliciously Crafted Protobuf/Thrift Messages:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers create specially crafted messages that exploit weaknesses in the Protobuf or Thrift libraries. These messages can trigger unexpected behavior during deserialization.

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Trigger Buffer Overflows:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted messages can contain data that exceeds the allocated buffer size during deserialization, potentially overwriting adjacent memory and leading to crashes or, more critically, arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via vulnerable deserialization libraries (if used by brpc or application) **[HIGH-RISK PATH ENDS]**

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Deserialization of Untrusted Data:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application deserializes data from untrusted sources without proper validation, attackers can provide malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code on the server. This is a particularly dangerous class of vulnerability.

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Remote Code Execution (RCE) via vulnerable deserialization libraries (if used by brpc or application):**
    * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the deserialization libraries used by brpc or the application to execute arbitrary code on the server. This often involves crafting specific serialized payloads that trigger the vulnerability during the deserialization process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Service Implementation Vulnerabilities Exposed via brpc](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_service_implementation_vulnerabilities_exposed_via_brpc.md)

Lack of Input Validation in RPC Handlers **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
        * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Command Injection via unchecked inputs **[HIGH-RISK PATH ENDS]**

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Service Implementation Vulnerabilities Exposed via brpc:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers target flaws in the application's code that are exposed through the brpc interface. This often involves sending unexpected or malicious input to RPC methods.

* **Lack of Input Validation in RPC Handlers:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application's RPC handlers do not adequately check and sanitize input parameters received from clients. This allows attackers to send unexpected or malicious data.

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Command Injection via unchecked inputs:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If input parameters received via RPC are used to construct system commands without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands that will be executed on the server with the privileges of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Proper Authentication and Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_proper_authentication_and_authorization.md)

**[CRITICAL NODE]** Bypass Authentication Mechanisms **[HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES]**
    * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Authorization Bypass **[HIGH-RISK PATH ENDS]**

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Lack of Proper Authentication and Authorization:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit weaknesses in the mechanisms used to verify the identity of clients (authentication) and to control what actions they are allowed to perform (authorization).

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Bypass Authentication Mechanisms:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Attackers find ways to circumvent the authentication process, allowing them to access the application without providing valid credentials. This can involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication logic or using known weaknesses like default credentials.

* **[CRITICAL NODE] Authorization Bypass:**
    * **Attack Vector:** Even if an attacker has successfully authenticated, they might be able to access RPC methods or perform actions that they are not authorized to do. This indicates flaws in the authorization checks implemented by the application.
