# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/incubator-brpc

## Attack Surface: [Protocol Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/protocol_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how brpc parses incoming requests based on the chosen protocol (e.g., Baidu RPC, HTTP/2, gRPC). Malformed or unexpected data can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially remote code execution.

**How incubator-brpc contributes:** brpc implements the parsing logic for various RPC protocols. Vulnerabilities within this implementation are directly attributable to brpc.

**Example:** Sending a specially crafted Baidu RPC request with an invalid field type that triggers a buffer overflow in brpc's parsing code.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution on the server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep brpc updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Thoroughly test the application with various malformed and unexpected inputs to identify potential parsing issues.
*   Consider using fuzzing tools to automatically generate and test a wide range of inputs against the brpc endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Protocol Buffer Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/protocol_buffer_deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from the deserialization of Protocol Buffer messages. Maliciously crafted messages can exploit weaknesses in the deserialization process, leading to code execution or other unintended consequences.

**How incubator-brpc contributes:** brpc heavily relies on Protocol Buffers for message serialization and deserialization. brpc's usage and handling of these messages are crucial in preventing exploitation.

**Example:** Sending a protobuf message with deeply nested structures or excessively large string fields that cause excessive memory allocation and lead to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, potential remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use the latest stable version of the Protocol Buffer library and brpc.
*   Define strict message schemas and enforce them on both the client and server sides.
*   Implement size limits for incoming messages to prevent excessive resource consumption during deserialization.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP/2 Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/http2_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** When using the HTTP/2 protocol, brpc can be susceptible to HTTP/2 specific attacks like request smuggling, stream multiplexing issues, and header compression vulnerabilities (e.g., HPACK bombing).

**How incubator-brpc contributes:** brpc's implementation of the HTTP/2 protocol stack introduces this attack surface.

**Example:** Exploiting request smuggling vulnerabilities to bypass security checks or route requests to unintended backend servers.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep brpc updated to benefit from fixes for known HTTP/2 vulnerabilities.
*   Carefully configure brpc's HTTP/2 settings, paying attention to stream limits and header handling.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Debugging/Monitoring Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_debuggingmonitoring_endpoints.md)

**Description:** brpc provides debugging and monitoring endpoints that, if exposed without proper authentication, can leak sensitive information or even allow for remote code execution.

**How incubator-brpc contributes:** brpc provides these endpoints as part of its functionality.

**Example:** An attacker accessing an unprotected brpc status page that reveals internal server information or allows triggering diagnostic commands.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable debugging and monitoring endpoints in production environments if not strictly necessary.
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all debugging and monitoring endpoints.
*   Restrict access to these endpoints to trusted networks or IP addresses.

## Attack Surface: [TLS/SSL Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/tlsssl_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured TLS/SSL settings when using secure communication channels can weaken the security of connections.

**How incubator-brpc contributes:** brpc handles the TLS/SSL configuration for secure communication.

**Example:** Using weak cipher suites or outdated TLS protocols, allowing for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Impact:** Data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce the use of strong cipher suites and the latest TLS protocols.
*   Properly configure certificate validation and revocation mechanisms.
*   Consider enforcing mutual TLS (mTLS) for stronger authentication.
