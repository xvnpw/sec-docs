# Threat Model Analysis for apache/incubator-brpc

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized payload and sends it to a brpc service. The brpc framework, upon deserializing this data without proper validation within its handling mechanisms, executes the attacker's code or triggers unintended actions. This is particularly relevant when using default serialization methods in brpc without implementing custom safeguards.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server hosting the brpc service, leading to full server compromise, data breaches, and service disruption.

**Affected brpc Component:** The serialization/deserialization modules within brpc, such as those handling Protobuf or other supported formats. This directly involves the code responsible for converting network bytes back into objects.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* deserialization within the brpc service handlers.
*   Consider using safer serialization options or custom serialization/deserialization logic that includes security checks.
*   Keep brpc and its serialization library dependencies updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on Unencrypted Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_unencrypted_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between a brpc client and server because brpc is configured to use an unencrypted transport (or encryption is not properly enforced). The attacker can eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted by brpc, potentially including authentication credentials or business data.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach (information disclosure) of data transmitted through brpc. This can lead to exposure of sensitive business information or credentials used to access the brpc service.

**Affected brpc Component:** The transport layer configuration within brpc, specifically the settings for `brpc::Server` and `brpc::Channel` that control whether TLS/SSL is enabled and enforced.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always enable and enforce TLS/SSL for all brpc communication by configuring the `protocol` and related security options in `brpc::Server` and `brpc::Channel`.
*   Use strong ciphers and ensure proper certificate validation is configured within brpc.

## Threat: [Weak or Missing Authentication in brpc Server](./threats/weak_or_missing_authentication_in_brpc_server.md)

**Description:** The brpc server is configured without any authentication mechanism or with a weak one that can be easily bypassed. This allows unauthorized clients to connect to and interact with the brpc service, potentially performing actions they should not be allowed to. This is a direct configuration issue within the brpc server setup.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to brpc services and the data or actions they expose. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, or misuse of application functionality.

**Affected brpc Component:** The authentication mechanisms configured directly within the `brpc::Server`. This involves the use of authentication methods, interceptors, or security policies provided by brpc.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the brpc server using the authentication features provided by brpc (e.g., setting authentication methods, using interceptors for custom authentication).
*   Consider using mutual TLS (mTLS) for client and server authentication within brpc's configuration.
*   Integrate brpc with existing authentication systems if applicable.

## Threat: [Replay Attacks due to Lack of Built-in Protection](./threats/replay_attacks_due_to_lack_of_built-in_protection.md)

**Description:** The brpc framework itself does not provide built-in mechanisms to prevent replay attacks by default. An attacker can capture a valid brpc request and resend it to the server. If the application logic doesn't implement its own replay protection, the server will process the request multiple times.

**Impact:**  Undesired side effects from replayed requests, such as duplicate actions, data manipulation, or resource exhaustion if the replayed requests are resource-intensive.

**Affected brpc Component:** The core request processing pipeline within `brpc::Server`. The absence of a default replay protection mechanism within brpc's core is the relevant factor.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement anti-replay mechanisms within the brpc service handlers or interceptors. This could involve checking for unique request IDs or timestamps.
*   Design brpc services to be idempotent where possible, minimizing the impact of replayed requests.
