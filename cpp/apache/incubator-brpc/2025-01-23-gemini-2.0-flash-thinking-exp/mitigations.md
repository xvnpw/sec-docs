# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/incubator-brpc

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify all `brpc` service methods and their input parameters defined in your `.proto` or `.thrift` files.
*   Step 2: Within your `brpc` service implementation code (e.g., C++, Java, Python), implement validation logic at the beginning of each service method, *before* any business logic or `brpc` calls are made.
*   Step 3: Utilize standard programming language validation techniques and libraries within your `brpc` service code to check data types, ranges, formats, and lengths of input parameters received through `brpc` requests.
*   Step 4: Leverage `brpc`'s logging capabilities to record invalid input attempts for monitoring and security analysis.
*   Step 5: Ensure `brpc` service methods return appropriate error codes and messages when input validation fails, allowing clients to understand and correct their requests.
