# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/incubator-brpc

## Attack Surface: [Protocol Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/protocol_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the code within brpc that parses network protocols (Baidu RPC, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, H2C, Thrift, gRPC).
*   **How incubator-brpc contributes to the attack surface:** brpc's implementation of protocol parsing logic is the direct source of these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow in brpc's HTTP/2 header parsing allows an attacker to send a crafted request leading to remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly update brpc:** Apply security patches and bug fixes by updating to the latest brpc version.
    *   **Fuzzing and Security Audits:** Conduct focused fuzzing and security audits on brpc's protocol parsing implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Serialization/Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/serializationdeserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how brpc handles data serialization and deserialization, especially in its integration with libraries like Protobuf or Thrift.
*   **How incubator-brpc contributes to the attack surface:** brpc's use of serialization libraries and its own serialization/deserialization logic can introduce vulnerabilities if not handled securely.
*   **Example:** Insecure deserialization vulnerability in brpc's Protobuf handling. An attacker sends a malicious serialized Protobuf message that, when deserialized by brpc, leads to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use secure and updated serialization libraries:** Ensure that brpc's dependencies, especially serialization libraries, are up-to-date and known to be secure.
    *   **Input validation (at application level):** While brpc handles deserialization, application-level validation of deserialized data can provide an additional layer of defense.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run brpc services with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential RCE.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP/2 Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/http2_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities specific to the HTTP/2 protocol implementation within brpc.
*   **How incubator-brpc contributes to the attack surface:** If HTTP/2 is enabled, brpc's HTTP/2 implementation becomes a direct part of the attack surface, inheriting the complexities and potential vulnerabilities of HTTP/2.
*   **Example:** HTTP/2 request smuggling vulnerability in brpc. An attacker exploits ambiguities in brpc's HTTP/2 stream handling to smuggle malicious requests, potentially bypassing security controls.
*   **Impact:** Request Smuggling, Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep brpc updated:** Ensure brpc's HTTP/2 implementation is patched against known HTTP/2 vulnerabilities by updating brpc regularly.
    *   **Disable HTTP/2 if not required:** If HTTP/2 is not a necessary protocol for the application, consider disabling it to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF capable of inspecting and filtering HTTP/2 traffic for known attack patterns.

## Attack Surface: [Service Discovery Vulnerabilities (Naming Service Interaction)](./attack_surfaces/service_discovery_vulnerabilities__naming_service_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how brpc interacts with external naming services (like Zookeeper, Consul, etcd) for service registration and discovery.
*   **How incubator-brpc contributes to the attack surface:** brpc's integration logic with naming services can be vulnerable if not implemented securely, or if the naming service itself is compromised.
*   **Example:** Service registration manipulation due to insecure brpc naming service integration. An attacker exploits a flaw in brpc's naming service interaction to register a malicious service, leading to clients being redirected to a compromised endpoint.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks, Denial of Service (DoS), Service Disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Naming Service Access:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for access to the naming service itself.
    *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS) for Service Communication:** Use mTLS to authenticate and encrypt communication between brpc clients and servers, mitigating MitM risks even if service discovery is compromised.
    *   **Service Registration Validation:** Implement validation mechanisms to ensure only authorized and legitimate services are registered through brpc's integration.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Description:** brpc's default configurations might include settings that are insecure for production deployments.
*   **How incubator-brpc contributes to the attack surface:** Out-of-the-box, brpc might have configurations that prioritize ease of use over security, potentially enabling insecure features or disabling security measures by default.
*   **Example:** Disabled authentication by default in brpc. If deployed with default settings and authentication is not explicitly enabled, brpc services become vulnerable to unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized Access, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Review and Harden Configurations:** Thoroughly review brpc's configuration options and harden them for production environments, specifically focusing on security-related settings.
    *   **Enable Authentication and Authorization:** Explicitly enable and configure strong authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by brpc.
    *   **Minimize Enabled Features:** Disable any brpc features that are not strictly necessary to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities present in third-party libraries that brpc depends upon.
*   **How incubator-brpc contributes to the attack surface:** By depending on external libraries, brpc indirectly inherits the attack surface of those dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited through brpc.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of the Protobuf library used by brpc. Applications using brpc with this vulnerable Protobuf version become susceptible to exploits targeting this dependency vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Information Disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Regularly scan brpc's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Update brpc and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use dependency pinning to manage and control dependency versions, facilitating consistent vulnerability management.
