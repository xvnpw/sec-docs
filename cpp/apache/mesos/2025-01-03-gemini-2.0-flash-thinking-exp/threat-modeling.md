# Threat Model Analysis for apache/mesos

## Threat: [Master API Unauthorized Access](./threats/master_api_unauthorized_access.md)

*   **Threat:** Master API Unauthorized Access
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits weak or missing authentication/authorization on the Mesos Master API. They might use stolen credentials or exploit default settings to access sensitive endpoints. This allows them to view cluster state, running tasks, resource allocations, and potentially manipulate the cluster by sending crafted API requests.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure of sensitive cluster data, unauthorized task management (starting, stopping, modifying tasks), potential resource manipulation leading to denial of service for legitimate applications.
    *   **Affected Component:** Mesos Master - specifically the Master API endpoints.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable authentication for the Master API (e.g., using Pluggable Authentication Modules - PAM).
        *   Implement robust authorization mechanisms to control access to specific API endpoints based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication with the Master API, preventing eavesdropping of credentials.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys and credentials used for authentication.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access.

## Threat: [Malicious Task Deployment](./threats/malicious_task_deployment.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Task Deployment
    *   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (or through a compromised framework leveraging Mesos APIs) deploys a malicious task onto the Mesos cluster. This task could be designed to steal data accessible within the cluster, perform denial-of-service attacks on other applications or the Mesos infrastructure itself by consuming excessive resources, or act as a backdoor for further intrusion by exploiting Mesos task execution mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, denial of service, resource exhaustion impacting other applications, compromise of other applications running on the cluster, potential for persistent backdoor access within the Mesos environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Mesos Master (for scheduling), Mesos Agent (for execution), Frameworks (interaction with Mesos for task submission).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control policies for deploying tasks and managing frameworks through Mesos.
        *   Enforce resource quotas and limits at the Mesos level to prevent malicious tasks from consuming excessive resources.
        *   Implement code scanning and vulnerability analysis for task definitions and container images before deployment, integrated with the Mesos deployment pipeline.
        *   Monitor task behavior for suspicious activity (e.g., excessive network traffic, unusual resource consumption) through Mesos monitoring tools.
        *   Utilize container image registries with vulnerability scanning and signing capabilities, enforced by Mesos configuration.

## Threat: [Framework Impersonation](./threats/framework_impersonation.md)

*   **Threat:** Framework Impersonation
    *   **Description:** An attacker spoofs the identity of a legitimate Mesos framework when registering with the Master. This allows them to receive resource offers intended for the legitimate framework from the Mesos Master and potentially launch malicious tasks or interfere with the legitimate framework's operation by manipulating Mesos framework APIs.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized resource allocation by Mesos, potential deployment of malicious tasks via the impersonated framework, denial of service for the legitimate framework by intercepting resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** Mesos Master (framework registration process and resource allocation), Frameworks (interaction with Mesos).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for framework registration with the Master (e.g., using secure secrets or certificates managed by Mesos).
        *   The Master should verify the identity of frameworks before granting resource offers based on secure credentials.
        *   Monitor framework registration events for suspicious activity within the Mesos event stream.

## Threat: [ZooKeeper Compromise](./threats/zookeeper_compromise.md)

*   **Threat:** ZooKeeper Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ZooKeeper ensemble used by Mesos for leader election and state management. This allows them to directly manipulate the cluster's state within ZooKeeper, potentially leading to incorrect leader election by Mesos, data loss related to Mesos metadata, or cluster instability managed by Mesos.
    *   **Impact:** Cluster instability managed by Mesos, data loss of Mesos metadata, potential for complete cluster disruption managed by Mesos.
    *   **Affected Component:** ZooKeeper (critical for Mesos operation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the ZooKeeper ensemble with strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Restrict network access to the ZooKeeper nodes.
        *   Encrypt communication between Mesos and ZooKeeper.
        *   Regularly back up the ZooKeeper data.
        *   Follow ZooKeeper security best practices.
