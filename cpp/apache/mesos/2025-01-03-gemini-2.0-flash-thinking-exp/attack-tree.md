## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Mesos](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_mesos.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means the attacker has achieved unauthorized control over the application, its tasks, and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Mesos Master](./attack_tree_paths/mesos_master.md)

The central control plane of Mesos. Compromise allows the attacker to:
    - Schedule arbitrary tasks.
    - Access sensitive information about the cluster and running applications.
    - Disrupt the operation of the entire cluster.
    - Potentially gain access to the underlying infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Known CVEs in Mesos Master](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_known_cves_in_mesos_master.md)

- Attack Vector: Researching public vulnerability databases for known vulnerabilities in the Mesos Master component.
- How: Using readily available exploit code or techniques to target unpatched Mesos Master instances.
- Why High-Risk: Known vulnerabilities have a higher likelihood of successful exploitation due to public information and tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit default credentials (if any) on Mesos Master](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_any__on_mesos_master.md)

- Attack Vector: Attempting to log in to the Mesos Master using default or commonly known credentials.
- How: Brute-forcing or using known default credentials against the Master's authentication interface.
- Why High-Risk:  A common security oversight, especially in initial deployments or poorly managed environments. Low effort and skill required.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage default or weak configurations of Mesos Master](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_default_or_weak_configurations_of_mesos_master.md)

- Attack Vector: Exploiting insecure default settings or weak configurations in the Mesos Master.
- How: Identifying and leveraging misconfigurations that allow unauthorized access or control, such as open ports, weak authentication settings, or overly permissive authorization rules.
- Why High-Risk: Common misconfigurations are easily discoverable and exploitable, requiring low skill.

## Attack Tree Path: [Mesos Agents](./attack_tree_paths/mesos_agents.md)

Worker nodes in the Mesos cluster that execute tasks. Compromise allows the attacker to:
    - Execute arbitrary code on the agent node.
    - Access data processed by tasks running on the agent.
    - Potentially pivot to other nodes in the network.
    - Disrupt the operation of tasks running on the agent.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in Docker/other container runtime on Mesos Agents](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_dockerother_container_runtime_on_mesos_agents.md)

- Attack Vector: Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the container runtime (e.g., Docker) used by Mesos Agents.
- How: Utilizing container escape techniques or other exploits to gain access to the underlying agent host from within a container.
- Why High-Risk: Container runtime vulnerabilities are relatively common, and successful exploitation can lead to significant control over the agent.

## Attack Tree Path: [Underlying storage used by Mesos (e.g., ZooKeeper)](./attack_tree_paths/underlying_storage_used_by_mesos__e_g___zookeeper_.md)

Stores the state of the Mesos cluster. Compromise allows the attacker to:
    - Manipulate the cluster's state, leading to unpredictable behavior.
    - Disrupt the operation of the cluster.
    - Potentially gain persistent control over the cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in ZooKeeper](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_zookeeper.md)

- Attack Vector: Targeting known vulnerabilities in the ZooKeeper service used by Mesos for state management.
- How: Using exploits to gain unauthorized access or control over the ZooKeeper ensemble.
- Why High-Risk: ZooKeeper vulnerabilities can directly impact the integrity and availability of the Mesos cluster.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain unauthorized access to ZooKeeper data](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_zookeeper_data.md)

- Attack Vector: Bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms to directly access the data stored in ZooKeeper.
- How: Exploiting misconfigurations, weak credentials, or vulnerabilities in ZooKeeper's access control mechanisms.
- Why High-Risk: Direct access to ZooKeeper allows for manipulation of the cluster's state, leading to significant control.
