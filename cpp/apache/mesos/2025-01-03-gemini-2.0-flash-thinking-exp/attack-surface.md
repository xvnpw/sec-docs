# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/mesos

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Mesos Master API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_mesos_master_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Mesos Master API allows interaction with the cluster for tasks like submitting frameworks, managing resources, and retrieving cluster state. If this API is not properly secured with strong authentication and authorization, unauthorized individuals can interact with it.
    *   **How Mesos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mesos provides the Master API as a core component for cluster management. The security posture of this API is directly determined by Mesos configuration.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could use the Mesos API to submit a malicious framework that consumes all cluster resources, effectively causing a denial of service, or to retrieve sensitive information about running applications and their configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Full cluster compromise, denial of service, data exfiltration, unauthorized modification of running applications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Master authentication using supported mechanisms (e.g., Pluggable Authentication Modules - PAM).
        *   Implement authorization using Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict API access based on user or role.
        *   Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication with the Master API, preventing eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated Mesos Agent API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_or_weakly_authenticated_mesos_agent_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** The Mesos Agent API allows interaction with individual agent nodes, enabling actions like executing commands within tasks or retrieving agent status. Lack of proper security exposes this functionality.
    *   **How Mesos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mesos Agents expose an API for management and control. The security of this API is a direct configuration responsibility within Mesos.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could use the Agent API to execute arbitrary commands within a running container, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or escalating privileges within the agent node.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of individual agent nodes, potential lateral movement within the cluster, data access within containers running on the agent.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable Agent authentication using supported mechanisms.
        *   Configure Agent ACLs to restrict access to the Agent API.
        *   Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication with the Agent API.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Mesos Web UI](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_mesos_web_ui.md)

*   **Description:** The Mesos Master provides a web UI for monitoring and managing the cluster. If this UI contains vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), attackers can exploit them.
    *   **How Mesos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mesos includes the web UI as a built-in component, making its security a direct concern for Mesos deployments.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript into the web UI, which would then be executed in the browsers of other users accessing the UI, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise of users accessing the Mesos UI, potential for unauthorized actions to be performed on the cluster through the compromised user's session.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Mesos version up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities in the web UI.
        *   Implement proper input sanitization and output encoding to prevent XSS attacks.
        *   Implement CSRF protection mechanisms (e.g., synchronizer tokens).

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Interaction with ZooKeeper](./attack_surfaces/insecure_interaction_with_zookeeper.md)

*   **Description:** Mesos relies on ZooKeeper for leader election and state management. If the communication between Mesos and ZooKeeper is not secured, or if ZooKeeper itself is compromised, the Mesos cluster's integrity is at risk.
    *   **How Mesos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mesos' core architecture depends on ZooKeeper. The security of this interaction is fundamental to Mesos' stability and security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could perform a man-in-the-middle attack on the communication between Mesos and ZooKeeper, potentially manipulating the cluster state or disrupting leader election. If ZooKeeper is compromised, an attacker could gain full control over the Mesos cluster.
    *   **Impact:** Cluster instability, data corruption, loss of cluster control, potential for complete cluster takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure ZooKeeper itself by implementing authentication and authorization.
        *   Use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication between Mesos Masters and ZooKeeper.

## Attack Surface: [Container Escape Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/container_escape_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Mesos uses containerization technologies (like Docker) to isolate tasks. Vulnerabilities in the container runtime or its configuration could allow attackers to escape the container and gain access to the underlying Agent node.
    *   **How Mesos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mesos' design relies on containerization for task isolation. While the vulnerability might be in the container runtime, Mesos' architecture makes it a relevant attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could exploit a known vulnerability in the Docker runtime to escape the container and gain root access to the Mesos Agent, potentially compromising other tasks running on the same agent.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Agent node, potential for lateral movement, access to sensitive data of other tasks on the same agent.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the container runtime (e.g., Docker) up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Harden the container runtime environment according to security best practices.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion Attacks on Master and Agents](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_attacks_on_master_and_agents.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could attempt to overwhelm the Mesos Master or Agents with excessive requests or resource consumption, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How Mesos Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Mesos is responsible for resource management and scheduling. Exploiting weaknesses in these mechanisms can lead to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could submit a large number of tasks with high resource requirements, overwhelming the Master's scheduling capabilities or exhausting resources on Agent nodes, preventing legitimate tasks from running.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, impacting the availability of applications running on Mesos.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource quotas and limits for frameworks and users.
        *   Configure Mesos Master and Agent to handle a reasonable load and prevent resource starvation.
        *   Implement rate limiting on API requests to prevent abuse.
