### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2] Compromise Master Host System

**[1.1.2] Compromise Master Host System [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]**

*   **Criticality:** Host compromise is indeed a **critical** node. The Mesos Master host is the central control point for the entire Mesos cluster. Compromising it grants an attacker significant control over the cluster's resources, tasks, and data.
*   **High-Risk Path:** This is a **high-risk path** because host systems, especially those exposed to networks, are frequently targeted by attackers. Successful compromise of the Master host can lead to cascading failures and widespread impact across the entire Mesos environment.

**Detailed Analysis of Sub-Nodes:**

#### [1.1.2.1] Exploiting OS Vulnerabilities on Master Host [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]

*   **Attack Vector Description:** This attack vector involves identifying and exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the operating system (OS) running on the Mesos Master host. This could include vulnerabilities in the kernel, system libraries, or installed services. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation, and ultimately, complete host compromise.

*   **Risk Metrics Analysis:**
    *   **Likelihood: Medium** -  OS vulnerabilities are continuously discovered and disclosed. While regular patching reduces the window of opportunity, the complexity of modern operating systems means vulnerabilities are almost inevitable.  The "medium" likelihood is justified because while not guaranteed, it's a realistic threat over time if patching is not diligently maintained.
    *   **Impact: Critical** -  As stated, compromising the Master host is critical. It allows the attacker to:
        *   Gain full control of the Master process and its data.
        *   Manipulate cluster scheduling and resource allocation.
        *   Potentially access sensitive data managed by Mesos.
        *   Disrupt cluster operations and availability.
        *   Use the compromised host as a pivot point to attack other systems within the network.
    *   **Effort: Medium** - The effort required depends on the vulnerability. Exploiting well-known vulnerabilities with readily available exploits is relatively easier. Zero-day exploits require more effort to discover and weaponize.  Automated vulnerability scanners and exploit frameworks lower the effort for attackers.
    *   **Skill Level: Medium** - Exploiting known vulnerabilities often requires intermediate skills in using exploit tools and understanding basic system administration. Developing zero-day exploits requires advanced skills.
    *   **Detection Difficulty: Medium** - Detection can be challenging if vulnerabilities are exploited subtly. However, effective security measures can improve detection:
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scanning the Master host for known vulnerabilities is crucial.
        *   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) / Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS):** Network and host-based IDS/IPS can detect malicious activity associated with exploitation attempts.
        *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Periodic security audits and penetration testing can proactively identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
        *   **System Monitoring and Logging:** Monitoring system logs for suspicious activity, failed login attempts, and unexpected process creation can aid in detection.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Preventative Controls:**
        *   **Regular and Timely Patching:** Implement a robust patch management process to ensure the OS and all installed software are updated with the latest security patches. Prioritize patching critical vulnerabilities on the Master host.
        *   **Minimize Attack Surface:**  Disable unnecessary services and ports on the Master host. Follow the principle of least privilege and only install essential software.
        *   **Hardening the OS:** Implement OS hardening best practices, such as disabling unnecessary features, configuring strong access controls, and using security frameworks (e.g., CIS benchmarks).
        *   **Firewall Configuration:**  Configure firewalls to restrict network access to the Master host, allowing only necessary ports and protocols from trusted sources.
        *   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Implement a SIEM system to aggregate and analyze security logs from the Master host and other relevant systems for anomaly detection.
    *   **Detective Controls:**
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Regular and Automated):**  Automate vulnerability scanning to continuously monitor for new vulnerabilities.
        *   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Deploy and properly configure IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block exploitation attempts.
        *   **Host-Based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS):** Implement HIDS on the Master host to monitor system files, processes, and network activity for malicious behavior.
        *   **Log Monitoring and Analysis:**  Actively monitor and analyze system logs for suspicious events, error messages, and security-related alerts.
        *   **Security Audits and Penetration Testing (Periodic):** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify vulnerabilities and assess the effectiveness of security controls.

#### [1.1.2.2] Credential Compromise (e.g., SSH keys, passwords) for Master Host

*   **Attack Vector Description:** This attack vector focuses on obtaining valid credentials (usernames and passwords, SSH keys, API tokens) that grant access to the Master host.  Attackers can employ various techniques to achieve this, including:
    *   **Phishing:** Deceiving users into revealing their credentials through fake login pages or emails.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Manipulating users into divulging credentials or performing actions that compromise security.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  Attempting to guess passwords through automated trial-and-error.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:**  Using stolen credentials from data breaches on other websites to attempt logins.
    *   **Insider Threats:**  Malicious or negligent actions by authorized users with access to credentials.
    *   **Compromised Workstations:**  Compromising a user's workstation to steal stored credentials or SSH keys.

*   **Risk Metrics Analysis:**
    *   **Likelihood: Medium** - Credential compromise is a common and persistent threat. Human error, weak passwords, and data breaches contribute to the "medium" likelihood.  The prevalence of phishing and social engineering attacks also increases the likelihood.
    *   **Impact: Critical** -  Successful credential compromise provides direct access to the Master host, leading to the same critical impact as exploiting OS vulnerabilities (full host control, Master process compromise, data access, disruption, etc.).
    *   **Effort: Medium** -  The effort varies depending on the chosen technique. Phishing and social engineering can be relatively low effort for attackers. Brute-force attacks might require more resources but are often automated. Obtaining credentials from compromised workstations or insider threats can also be medium effort.
    *   **Skill Level: Medium** -  Many credential compromise techniques, like phishing and using readily available brute-force tools, require intermediate attacker skills. Social engineering can require more sophisticated manipulation skills.
    *   **Detection Difficulty: Medium** - Detecting credential compromise can be challenging, especially if attackers use legitimate credentials. However, effective security measures can improve detection:
        *   **Account Monitoring:** Monitoring user accounts for unusual login activity, failed login attempts, and changes in user behavior.
        *   **Anomaly Detection:**  Using anomaly detection systems to identify deviations from normal user login patterns.
        *   **Log Analysis:**  Analyzing authentication logs for suspicious login attempts, source IPs, and timestamps.
        *   **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA):**  Employing UEBA solutions to detect anomalous user behavior that may indicate compromised accounts.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Preventative Controls:**
        *   **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation) and discourage password reuse.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all access to the Master host, including SSH and any web interfaces. This significantly reduces the risk of credential compromise.
        *   **SSH Key Management:**  Prefer SSH key-based authentication over passwords and implement secure SSH key management practices (key rotation, passphrase protection, authorized_keys management).
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the necessary permissions and access to the Master host.
        *   **Security Awareness Training:**  Conduct regular security awareness training for all users to educate them about phishing, social engineering, and password security best practices.
        *   **Phishing Simulations:**  Conduct periodic phishing simulations to test user awareness and identify areas for improvement.
        *   **Credential Management Solutions:**  Consider using password managers or enterprise credential management solutions to improve password security and reduce reliance on easily compromised passwords.
    *   **Detective Controls:**
        *   **Account Monitoring and Anomaly Detection:**  Implement systems to monitor user account activity and detect anomalous login patterns (e.g., logins from unusual locations, at unusual times).
        *   **Failed Login Attempt Monitoring:**  Monitor and alert on excessive failed login attempts, which could indicate brute-force attacks.
        *   **Log Analysis (Authentication Logs):**  Regularly analyze authentication logs for suspicious activity and potential credential compromise attempts.
        *   **User and Entity Behavior Analytics (UEBA):**  Deploy UEBA solutions to detect anomalous user behavior that might indicate compromised accounts.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic security audits to review access controls, password policies, and authentication mechanisms.

#### [1.1.2.3] Physical Access to Master Host (if applicable)

*   **Attack Vector Description:** This attack vector involves gaining physical access to the Master host machine itself. This is less likely in cloud environments but more relevant in on-premise or hybrid deployments where the Master host is physically located in a data center or office. Physical access allows an attacker to:
    *   Directly access the console and operating system.
    *   Bypass network security controls.
    *   Install malicious software or hardware.
    *   Extract data directly from storage devices.
    *   Reboot or shut down the system.

*   **Risk Metrics Analysis:**
    *   **Likelihood: Low** -  Physical access is generally less likely than remote attacks, especially in well-secured data centers or cloud environments. However, it remains a potential risk in less secure on-premise setups or if physical security is compromised.
    *   **Impact: Critical** - Physical access grants complete control over the Master host, leading to the most severe impact. An attacker with physical access can bypass almost all software-based security controls.
    *   **Effort: High** - Gaining physical access usually requires overcoming physical security measures like locked doors, security guards, surveillance systems, and access control systems. This generally requires higher effort compared to remote attacks.
    *   **Skill Level: Low** -  While bypassing physical security might require some planning and potentially social engineering, the technical skills needed to exploit physical access to a server are relatively low. Basic system administration knowledge is sufficient to leverage physical access for compromise.
    *   **Detection Difficulty: Low** - Physical access attempts and unauthorized physical presence are generally easier to detect with appropriate physical security controls and monitoring.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Preventative Controls:**
        *   **Secure Data Center/Server Room:**  Physically secure the data center or server room where the Master host is located with robust access control systems (biometrics, key cards, security guards).
        *   **Physical Access Logs and Monitoring:**  Maintain logs of physical access to the server room and monitor for unauthorized entries.
        *   **Surveillance Systems (CCTV):**  Implement CCTV surveillance to monitor physical access points and server room activity.
        *   **Server Rack Security:**  Secure server racks with locks to prevent unauthorized physical access to individual servers.
        *   **BIOS/Boot Password:**  Set BIOS/boot passwords to prevent booting from unauthorized media.
        *   **Tamper-Evident Seals:**  Use tamper-evident seals on server cases to detect physical tampering.
    *   **Detective Controls:**
        *   **Physical Security Audits:**  Conduct regular physical security audits to assess the effectiveness of physical security controls.
        *   **Alarm Systems:**  Implement alarm systems to detect unauthorized physical access attempts.
        *   **Regular Review of Access Logs:**  Regularly review physical access logs to identify any anomalies or unauthorized entries.
        *   **Security Personnel Training:**  Train security personnel to identify and respond to physical security threats.
