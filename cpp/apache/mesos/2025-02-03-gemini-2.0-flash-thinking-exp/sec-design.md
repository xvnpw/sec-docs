# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Apache Mesos project aims to provide a distributed systems kernel. It abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines, enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to be easily built and run. The primary business priority is to offer a robust and scalable platform for running diverse workloads efficiently across a cluster of machines. Goals include maximizing resource utilization, enabling application isolation, and simplifying the management of distributed applications.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Risk of system instability or failure due to software bugs or design flaws, leading to service disruptions for applications running on Mesos.
- Risk of resource contention or starvation, where one application negatively impacts the performance or availability of others.
- Risk of security vulnerabilities in Mesos itself or in the applications it manages, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized access.
- Risk of operational complexity in managing and maintaining a Mesos cluster, requiring specialized expertise and potentially leading to misconfigurations or downtime.
- Risk of vendor lock-in if Mesos becomes tightly integrated with specific infrastructure or application stacks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control Access control lists (ACLs) for authorization of operations within Mesos. (Location: Mesos documentation and code)
- security control Authentication mechanisms for Mesos components to verify identities. (Location: Mesos documentation and code)
- security control Resource isolation mechanisms (e.g., Linux containers, namespaces) to prevent applications from interfering with each other. (Location: Mesos documentation and code)
- security control Security audits and vulnerability scanning as part of the development process. (Location: Assumed best practice for open-source projects like Apache Mesos)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk Complexity of security configuration and management in a distributed environment.
- accepted risk Potential for misconfigurations leading to security vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk Reliance on underlying infrastructure security (e.g., operating system, network).

Recommended security controls:
- security control Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring of security-relevant events for auditing and incident response.
- security control Regularly perform penetration testing and security assessments to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- security control Enhance input validation and sanitization across all Mesos components to prevent injection attacks.
- security control Implement encryption for sensitive data in transit and at rest within the Mesos cluster.
- security control Strengthen supply chain security for dependencies and build processes to mitigate risks of compromised components.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: Mesos components (masters, agents, frameworks) must mutually authenticate each other to establish secure communication channels.
    - Requirement: Users and administrators interacting with Mesos should be authenticated to verify their identity.
    - Requirement: Support for industry-standard authentication protocols (e.g., Kerberos, OAuth 2.0, TLS client certificates).
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: Fine-grained authorization mechanisms to control access to Mesos resources and operations based on user roles and permissions.
    - Requirement: Policy enforcement to ensure that only authorized frameworks and users can perform actions like launching tasks, allocating resources, or accessing sensitive data.
    - Requirement: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to simplify management of user permissions.
- Input validation:
    - Requirement: Rigorous input validation and sanitization for all data received by Mesos components to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied at multiple layers, including API endpoints, configuration files, and internal component communication.
    - Requirement: Use of secure coding practices to minimize vulnerabilities related to input handling.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Encryption of sensitive data in transit using TLS/SSL for communication between Mesos components and with external systems.
    - Requirement: Encryption of sensitive data at rest, such as secrets, credentials, and application data stored within Mesos.
    - Requirement: Secure key management practices for cryptographic keys used for encryption and authentication.
    - Requirement: Use of strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and libraries.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Availability and reliability of the Mesos cluster itself, as it underpins all applications running on it.
- Integrity and confidentiality of data processed by applications running on Mesos.
- Performance and efficiency of resource utilization within the cluster.
- Secure and authorized access to Mesos management interfaces and APIs.
- Secure execution of tasks and isolation between applications.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Application data processed by frameworks running on Mesos: Sensitivity depends on the application, can range from public data to highly confidential data (e.g., financial transactions, personal information).
- Mesos cluster state data: Includes metadata about frameworks, tasks, agents, and resource allocations. Sensitivity is moderate, as unauthorized access could lead to cluster disruption or information disclosure about running applications.
- Mesos configuration data: Includes sensitive information like authentication credentials, API keys, and security policies. Sensitivity is high, as compromise could lead to full cluster control.
- Audit logs: Contain records of security-relevant events and user activities. Sensitivity is moderate to high, important for security monitoring and incident response.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What are the specific compliance requirements for the Mesos deployment environment (e.g., PCI DSS, HIPAA, GDPR)?
- What is the expected scale and performance requirements for the Mesos cluster?
- What are the specific types of applications and frameworks that will be running on Mesos?
- What is the organization's risk tolerance and security maturity level?
- Are there any existing security policies or standards that need to be adhered to?
- What is the process for incident response and security monitoring for the Mesos cluster?

Assumptions:
- The organization prioritizes security and availability for the Mesos platform.
- The Mesos cluster will be deployed in a cloud environment (AWS).
- Standard security best practices will be followed for infrastructure and application security.
- The organization has personnel with expertise in cloud infrastructure, distributed systems, and security.
- The project aims for a reasonably secure configuration out-of-the-box, but further hardening and customization might be required based on specific needs and risk assessment.
