# Threat Model Analysis for apache/mesos

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion on Master](./threats/resource_exhaustion_on_master.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Mesos Master with a large number of invalid or resource-intensive requests (e.g., submitting numerous bogus framework registrations or resource offers). This overwhelms the Master's processing capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** The Mesos Master becomes unresponsive, leading to a denial of service for the entire Mesos cluster. New tasks cannot be scheduled, and existing tasks might be affected.
    *   **Affected Mesos Component:** Mesos Master (specifically its API endpoints and resource management modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on Master API endpoints.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization on all requests to the Master.
        *   Monitor Master resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts for anomalies.
        *   Deploy the Master in a highly available configuration with leader election.
        *   Use authentication and authorization to restrict access to Master APIs.

## Threat: [State Corruption on Master (via ZooKeeper)](./threats/state_corruption_on_master__via_zookeeper_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the ZooKeeper ensemble used by the Mesos Master for persistent state storage. They could then manipulate or corrupt the stored data, such as framework registrations, agent information, or resource allocations.
    *   **Impact:**  Inconsistent cluster state, leading to unpredictable behavior, task scheduling failures, data loss, or even complete cluster failure.
    *   **Affected Mesos Component:** Mesos Master (indirectly, through its reliance on ZooKeeper), ZooKeeper.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the ZooKeeper ensemble with strong authentication (e.g., using Kerberos or digest authentication).
        *   Restrict network access to the ZooKeeper nodes.
        *   Implement access controls within ZooKeeper to limit which entities can read and write data.
        *   Regularly back up the ZooKeeper data.
        *   Monitor ZooKeeper logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Master API](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_master_api.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to gain unauthorized access to the Mesos Master's API endpoints. This allows them to perform actions they are not permitted to, such as launching arbitrary tasks, manipulating resource offers, or retrieving sensitive cluster information.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of malicious tasks on the cluster, resource theft, information disclosure about the cluster and running applications, potential compromise of agent nodes.
    *   **Affected Mesos Component:** Mesos Master (API endpoints, authentication/authorization modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong authentication for all Master API requests (e.g., using authentication tokens, client certificates).
        *   Implement fine-grained authorization to control which users or frameworks can perform specific actions.
        *   Disable or restrict access to unnecessary API endpoints.
        *   Regularly audit API access logs.

## Threat: [Agent Impersonation](./threats/agent_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker spoofs the identity of a legitimate Mesos Agent, potentially by manipulating network traffic or exploiting vulnerabilities in the agent registration process. This allows them to register a rogue agent with the Master.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can offer malicious resources to the Master, potentially leading to the scheduling of tasks on compromised infrastructure. They could also disrupt legitimate agent operations.
    *   **Affected Mesos Component:** Mesos Master (agent registration module), Mesos Agent.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement mutual authentication between the Master and Agents (e.g., using TLS client certificates).
        *   Secure the network communication between the Master and Agents.
        *   Implement mechanisms for the Master to verify the identity and integrity of Agents.
        *   Monitor agent registration events for anomalies.

## Threat: [Task Manipulation on Agent](./threats/task_manipulation_on_agent.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Mesos Agent node and manipulates running tasks. This could involve altering the task's execution environment, injecting malicious code, or interfering with its resource allocation.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised application functionality, data breaches, resource abuse on the agent node, potential lateral movement to other systems.
    *   **Affected Mesos Component:** Mesos Agent (task management and execution modules), Mesos Executor.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure access to Agent nodes through strong authentication and authorization.
        *   Implement process isolation and resource limits for tasks running on Agents.
        *   Regularly patch and update the Mesos Agent software.
        *   Monitor task execution for unexpected behavior.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure from Agent](./threats/information_disclosure_from_agent.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a Mesos Agent node and retrieves sensitive information related to running tasks, such as application data, configuration files, or secrets.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential application data, intellectual property theft, compromise of user credentials or other sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Mesos Component:** Mesos Agent (task execution environment), Mesos Executor.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit within the task environment.
        *   Secure access to Agent nodes.
        *   Implement strong access controls within the task environment.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly within task definitions or environment variables if possible; use secrets management solutions.

## Threat: [Malicious Scheduler](./threats/malicious_scheduler.md)

*   **Description:** A compromised or intentionally malicious scheduler registers with the Mesos Master. This scheduler can then request resources and launch tasks with malicious intent.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code on agent nodes, resource theft, denial of service for legitimate applications, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Mesos Component:** Mesos Master (scheduler registration and resource allocation modules), Mesos Scheduler API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for scheduler registration.
        *   Monitor scheduler behavior for suspicious activity (e.g., requesting excessive resources, launching unusual tasks).
        *   Implement mechanisms to isolate and limit the impact of individual schedulers.
        *   Regularly audit the list of registered schedulers.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Communication Channels](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_communication_channels.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts communication between Mesos components (Master, Agents, Schedulers) if the communication channels are not properly secured. They can then eavesdrop on sensitive information or even modify messages.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive data, manipulation of task scheduling or execution, potential compromise of Mesos components.
    *   **Affected Mesos Component:** All Mesos components involved in communication (Master, Agent, Scheduler).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce the use of TLS for all communication between Mesos components.
        *   Verify the authenticity of communicating parties using certificates.
        *   Secure the network infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access and interception.
