# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/mesos

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Mesos Master API](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_mesos_master_api.md)

*   **Description:** The Mesos Master exposes HTTP API endpoints for managing the cluster. Lack of proper authentication and authorization allows unauthorized access and control.
*   **How Mesos Contributes:** Mesos's core functionality relies on these APIs, making the Master a central point of control and a prime target if unsecured.
*   **Example:** An attacker could send unauthorized requests to the `/master/state` endpoint to gather sensitive information or attempt to register a malicious framework.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized task execution, denial of service, potential compromise of the entire Mesos cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce authentication on the Mesos Master API (e.g., Basic Authentication, OAuth 2.0, mutual TLS).
    *   Implement robust authorization policies to control access to API endpoints.
    *   Always use HTTPS (TLS) to encrypt communication with the Master API.
    *   Restrict network access to the Master API to authorized networks.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised ZooKeeper Ensemble](./attack_surfaces/compromised_zookeeper_ensemble.md)

*   **Description:** Mesos relies on ZooKeeper for leader election and state management. Compromise allows manipulation of the cluster's state and behavior.
*   **How Mesos Contributes:** Mesos's architecture is tightly coupled with ZooKeeper; its integrity is crucial for Mesos's security and functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker gaining access to ZooKeeper could manipulate the leader election process, causing a denial of service, or alter the cluster state to execute malicious tasks.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, data corruption, unauthorized task execution, potential compromise of the entire Mesos cluster.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure ZooKeeper authentication using Kerberos or ACLs.
    *   Encrypt communication between Mesos components and ZooKeeper using TLS.
    *   Harden the ZooKeeper nodes and restrict network access.
    *   Regularly monitor ZooKeeper logs for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Mesos Agent API](./attack_surfaces/insecure_mesos_agent_api.md)

*   **Description:** Mesos Agents expose HTTP API endpoints for task management. Lack of security allows unauthorized control over tasks running on the agent.
*   **How Mesos Contributes:** Agents are responsible for executing tasks; compromising an Agent can lead to the compromise of the workloads it hosts.
*   **Example:** An attacker could send unauthorized requests to an Agent API to kill running tasks or potentially exploit vulnerabilities to gain further access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized task management, information disclosure, potential compromise of the Agent node and its workloads.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and enforce authentication on the Mesos Agent API.
    *   Implement authorization policies to control access to Agent API endpoints.
    *   Use HTTPS (TLS) to encrypt communication with the Agent API.
    *   Restrict network access to the Agent API to authorized Mesos Master nodes.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Task Isolation](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_task_isolation.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in container runtime or misconfigurations can lead to container escapes, allowing a malicious task to compromise the Agent node or other containers.
*   **How Mesos Contributes:** Mesos relies on containerization for resource management and isolation. Weaknesses in this isolation directly impact the security of the platform.
*   **Example:** A malicious task could exploit a vulnerability in Docker to escape its container and gain access to the underlying Agent operating system.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of the Agent node, potential compromise of other tasks running on the same Agent, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the container runtime and operating system up-to-date with security patches.
    *   Configure strong container security settings (e.g., security profiles, limiting capabilities).
    *   Regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement resource limits for tasks to prevent resource exhaustion.
