# Threat Model Analysis for apache/mesos

## Threat: [Rogue Framework Registration](./threats/rogue_framework_registration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a malicious framework with the Mesos master. The attacker crafts a framework that appears legitimate but contains malicious code. They then use this framework to request resources and launch tasks that perform unauthorized actions. This directly exploits the Mesos master's framework registration mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary code on Mesos agents.
        *   Data exfiltration.
        *   Resource exhaustion (DoS).
        *   Lateral movement within the cluster.
        *   Compromise of other frameworks or applications.
    *   **Affected Mesos Component:** Mesos Master (`src/master/master.cpp`, specifically the framework registration and resource offer logic). The `Registrar` component is also relevant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authentication:** Enforce strong framework authentication using SASL/CRAM-MD5 or Kerberos.
        *   **Authorization:** Implement strict authorization using Mesos ACLs to control which principals can register frameworks.
        *   **Whitelisting:** Maintain a whitelist of allowed framework principals (if feasible).
        *   **Auditing:** Log all framework registration attempts and regularly audit registered frameworks.

## Threat: [Rogue Agent Registration](./threats/rogue_agent_registration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker registers a compromised or malicious agent with the Mesos master. The attacker might have gained control of an existing host or deployed a new one. This rogue agent then receives resource offers and executes tasks as directed by the master, but the attacker can manipulate these tasks. This directly exploits the Mesos master's agent registration mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary code on the compromised agent.
        *   Data exfiltration from the agent and any tasks running on it.
        *   Disruption of legitimate tasks.
        *   Use of the agent as a launchpad for attacks on other systems.
    *   **Affected Mesos Component:** Mesos Master (`src/master/master.cpp`, agent registration and resource offer logic). The `Registrar` is also involved.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authentication:** Enforce strong agent authentication using SASL/CRAM-MD5 or Kerberos.
        *   **Authorization:** Use Mesos ACLs to control which principals can register agents.
        *   **Whitelisting:** Maintain a whitelist of allowed agent principals (if feasible).
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the Mesos cluster network from untrusted networks.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor agent registration events for anomalies.

        *   **Regular Auditing:** Regularly audit framework activity.

## Threat: [Task Status Update Spoofing](./threats/task_status_update_spoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and modifies task status updates sent from an agent to the Mesos master or directly to a framework. They could forge updates to make a failed task appear successful, or vice-versa, disrupting scheduling and resource allocation. This targets the core communication and state management of Mesos.
    * **Impact:**
        *   Incorrect scheduling decisions.
        *   Resource leaks.
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Potential for data corruption.
    * **Affected Mesos Component:** Communication pathways between Mesos Agent (`src/slave/slave.cpp`) and Mesos Master (`src/master/master.cpp`), and potentially the framework's scheduler. The `protobuf` message handling is a key area.

        *   **Validation:** The master and framework should validate task status updates.

## Threat: [Mesos Configuration Tampering](./threats/mesos_configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Mesos master or agent configuration files (e.g., `mesos-master.conf`, `mesos-agent.conf`) and modifies them. They could disable security features, change resource allocation policies, or introduce malicious settings. This directly targets the configuration of core Mesos components.
    * **Impact:**
        *   Weakening of security controls.
        *   Disruption of cluster operation.
        *   Enabling of malicious features.
        *   Resource misallocation.
