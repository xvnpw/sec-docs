# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a highly available, scalable, and fault-tolerant platform for running distributed applications.
*   Efficiently utilize cluster resources, maximizing resource utilization and minimizing waste.
*   Support a wide variety of workloads, including long-running services, batch jobs, and real-time applications.
*   Enable resource sharing and isolation between different frameworks and applications.
*   Provide a stable and reliable API for application developers and framework authors.
*   Maintain backward compatibility and minimize disruptions during upgrades.
*   Foster an active open-source community and encourage contributions.

Business Risks:

*   System instability or failure leading to application downtime and data loss.
*   Inefficient resource allocation leading to wasted resources and increased costs.
*   Security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious actors.
*   Lack of support for new workloads or technologies, limiting the platform's usefulness.
*   Complexity of the system, making it difficult to deploy, manage, and troubleshoot.
*   Competition from other cluster management solutions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication: Mesos supports authentication of frameworks and operators using SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer). Kerberos and CRAM-MD5 mechanisms are supported. (See `docs/authentication.md`)
*   security control: Authorization: Mesos provides authorization mechanisms to control which frameworks can access which resources. Access control lists (ACLs) can be used to define fine-grained permissions. (See `docs/authorization.md`)
*   security control: Networking: Mesos supports CNI (Container Network Interface) for container networking, allowing for network isolation and security policies.
*   security control: Secrets Management: Mesos supports fetching secrets from various secret stores (e.g., environment variables, files, and external secret management systems) to securely provide sensitive information to tasks. (See `docs/secrets.md`)
*   security control: Containerization: Mesos leverages containerization technologies like Docker and Mesos containerizer to provide isolation between tasks.
*   security control: Resource quotas: Mesos allows setting resource quotas to limit the resources consumed by frameworks.
*   security control: Auditing: Mesos logs various events, which can be used for auditing and security analysis.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The complexity of distributed systems introduces inherent security challenges.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on external components (e.g., ZooKeeper, Docker) introduces dependencies and potential vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: The open-source nature of the project means that vulnerabilities may be discovered and exploited before patches are available.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   security control: Integrate with a centralized logging and monitoring system for improved security visibility.
*   security control: Enforce the principle of least privilege for all users and components.
*   security control: Enable TLS encryption for all communication channels.
*   security control: Implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks.
*   security control: Regularly update all dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Implement a vulnerability management program to track and remediate security issues.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All users and components must be authenticated before accessing the system.
    *   Support for strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
    *   Secure storage and management of credentials.

*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control based on roles and permissions.
    *   The principle of least privilege must be enforced.
    *   Regular review and auditing of access control policies.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All input from external sources must be validated to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Use of whitelisting rather than blacklisting for input validation.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Encryption of data in transit and at rest.

## BUILD

The Apache Mesos build process involves several steps, from compiling the source code to creating distributable packages. The process is automated using a combination of build tools and scripts. Security is a key consideration throughout the build process.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] --> GitRepository["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    GitRepository --> BuildServer["Build Server (e.g., Jenkins)"]
    BuildServer --> Compiler["Compiler (e.g., g++)"]
    Compiler --> Linker["Linker"]
    Linker --> StaticAnalysis["Static Analysis Tools (e.g., Coverity, FindBugs)"]
    StaticAnalysis --> TestSuite["Test Suite"]
    TestSuite --> Packager["Packager (e.g., make package)"]
    Packager --> ArtifactRepository["Artifact Repository (e.g., Apache Artifactory)"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  A build server (e.g., Jenkins) detects the changes and triggers a build.
3.  The build server checks out the source code from the repository.
4.  The compiler (e.g., g++) compiles the source code into object files.
5.  The linker links the object files together to create executables and libraries.
6.  Static analysis tools (e.g., Coverity, FindBugs) are run to identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
7.  A comprehensive test suite is executed to ensure the functionality and stability of the software.
8.  The packager (e.g., `make package`) creates distributable packages (e.g., tarballs, DEB, RPM).
9.  The build artifacts are published to an artifact repository (e.g., Apache Artifactory).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code Review: All code changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged into the main branch.
*   security control: Static Analysis: Static analysis tools are used to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Automated Testing: A comprehensive test suite is run to ensure the software is functioning correctly and securely.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Dependencies are carefully managed and tracked to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Build Automation: The build process is automated to ensure consistency and repeatability.
*   security control: Signed Packages: (Potentially) Build artifacts can be digitally signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Application Deployment and Management: Mesos is critical for deploying and managing applications in a distributed environment.
*   Resource Management: Mesos efficiently manages cluster resources, ensuring optimal utilization.
*   Fault Tolerance: Mesos provides fault tolerance, ensuring applications continue to run even if nodes fail.

Data Sensitivity:

*   Mesos itself does not directly handle sensitive application data. However, it manages the execution of applications that may process sensitive data. The sensitivity of the data depends on the specific applications running on Mesos.
*   Mesos stores configuration data, including secrets (if configured), which should be considered sensitive.
*   Mesos logs may contain sensitive information, depending on the logging level and the applications running on the cluster.
