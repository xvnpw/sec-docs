## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Mesos Master [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_mesos_master__critical_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Gaining control of the Mesos Master grants the attacker complete control over the entire cluster. This is the most critical node in the attack tree.

*   **1.1 Authentication Bypass [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **Description:**  Circumventing the authentication mechanisms of the Mesos Master. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in the authentication process, using default or weak credentials, or disabling authentication altogether.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if authentication is enabled and strong passwords are used) / High (if authentication is disabled or weak passwords are used)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete cluster compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (if authentication is disabled) / Low (if weak passwords are used) / High (if strong authentication is in place and needs to be bypassed)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie (if authentication is disabled or weak passwords are used) / Intermediate (to bypass stronger authentication)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (failed login attempts are typically logged) / Medium (if the attacker uses a slow, distributed brute-force attack)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Enforce strong authentication: Always enable authentication.
        *   Use strong, unique passwords or integrate with a robust identity provider (e.g., Kerberos, LDAP).
        *   Regularly audit authentication settings.
        *   Monitor authentication logs.

*   **1.3 Misconfiguration [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **Description:**  Exploiting incorrectly configured settings on the Mesos Master that expose it to attack. This includes exposing the API to the public internet, using default ports, disabling security features, or having overly permissive ACLs.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (common mistakes can lead to misconfigurations)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (depending on the specific misconfiguration)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (depending on the specific misconfiguration)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (some misconfigurations are easily detectable with configuration audits; others might be more subtle)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   Use a secure configuration template.
        *   Regularly review and audit the configuration.
        *   Network segmentation: Isolate the Mesos Master on a private network.
        * Implement robust input validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Mesos Framework/Scheduler](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_mesos_frameworkscheduler.md)

*    **Overall Description:** This branch focuses on attacking the application-specific logic (framework/scheduler) that interacts with Mesos.

*   **3.2 Vulnerability Exploitation (in Framework) [HIGH-RISK]**

    *   **Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities within a legitimate framework running on Mesos. This targets the *application's* code, but the attack is facilitated by the Mesos environment. Examples include SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or remote code execution (RCE) vulnerabilities within the framework.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (depends on the security of the framework code)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (depends on the specific vulnerability and the framework's capabilities; could lead to data breaches, service disruption, or even gaining control over the framework's resources within the cluster)
    *   **Effort:** Low to High (depends on the complexity of the vulnerability)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Expert (depends on the complexity of the vulnerability)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (requires monitoring framework behavior and application logs)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Secure coding practices: Framework developers must follow secure coding practices.
        *   Regular security testing: Perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning on the framework itself.
        *   Input validation and output encoding: Sanitize all inputs and encode all outputs to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Web Application Firewall (WAF): Although this is a general web application security measure, a WAF can help protect against common web-based attacks targeting the framework.
