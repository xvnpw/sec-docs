# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/mesos

## Attack Surface: [1. Unauthenticated Access to Mesos Master/Agent API](./attack_surfaces/1__unauthenticated_access_to_mesos_masteragent_api.md)

*Description:* The Mesos Master and Agent APIs provide control over the cluster.  If these APIs are accessible without authentication, an attacker can gain complete control.
*Mesos Contribution:* Mesos exposes these APIs by default, and authentication is not enabled unless explicitly configured.  This is a *direct* Mesos responsibility.
*Example:* An attacker sends a request to the `/master/shutdown` endpoint on an unauthenticated Master, causing the entire cluster to shut down.  Or, an attacker uses the Agent API to launch a malicious container.
*Impact:* Complete cluster compromise, data loss, denial of service, arbitrary code execution.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Enable Authentication:** Configure Mesos to require authentication for all API access (e.g., using HTTP Basic Auth, Kerberos, or a custom authentication module).
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Restrict network access to the Master and Agent API endpoints using firewalls, security groups, or network policies.  Only allow access from authorized clients and networks.
    *   **TLS Encryption:** Always use HTTPS with valid, trusted certificates to protect communication from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Periodically review authentication and network access configurations.

## Attack Surface: [2. Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/2__weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*Description:* Even with authentication enabled, using weak, default, or easily guessable credentials allows attackers to bypass authentication.
*Mesos Contribution:* While Mesos itself doesn't *enforce* weak credentials, the *responsibility* for setting strong credentials for Mesos components (Master, Agent, frameworks interacting with Mesos) falls directly within the Mesos deployment configuration.
*Example:* An attacker uses a common username/password combination (e.g., "admin/admin") to gain access to the Mesos Master.
*Impact:* Cluster compromise, data loss, denial of service, arbitrary code execution.
*Risk Severity:* **Critical**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies for all Mesos-related accounts (including framework credentials).
    *   **No Default Credentials:** Ensure that Mesos is not deployed with any default credentials.  Change all default settings immediately after installation.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Consider implementing MFA for critical accounts, especially for the Mesos Master.
    *   **Credential Rotation:** Regularly rotate credentials to minimize the impact of compromised credentials.

## Attack Surface: [3. Resource Exhaustion (DoS) - *Mesos-Managed Resources*](./attack_surfaces/3__resource_exhaustion__dos__-_mesos-managed_resources.md)

*Description:* A malicious or buggy task (or framework) can consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, disk, network) *that are managed by Mesos*, causing a denial of service for other tasks or the entire cluster.  This is distinct from a general DoS on the host; it's specifically about resources Mesos allocates.
*Mesos Contribution:* Mesos is *directly* responsible for resource allocation and scheduling.  Without proper limits configured *within Mesos*, it can allow tasks to consume all available resources *it manages*.
*Example:* A framework submits a large number of tasks that consume all available memory *as reported to and managed by Mesos* on the Mesos Agents, preventing other tasks from running.
*Impact:* Denial of service, performance degradation, cluster instability.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Resource Quotas:** Use Mesos's resource limiting features (cgroups, etc.) to enforce resource quotas for each task and framework.  Define strict limits on CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network bandwidth *within the Mesos configuration*.
    *   **Framework Roles and Weights:** Use Mesos roles and weights to prioritize resource allocation among different frameworks.
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting *specifically for Mesos-managed resource utilization* to detect exhaustion and take corrective action.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Master):** Implement rate limiting on the Mesos Master API to prevent attackers from flooding it with requests.

## Attack Surface: [4. Misconfigured ACLs (Access Control Lists)](./attack_surfaces/4__misconfigured_acls__access_control_lists_.md)

*Description:* Mesos ACLs control which principals (users, frameworks) can perform which actions (e.g., register a framework, launch tasks, access resources).  Misconfigured ACLs can grant excessive permissions, leading to unauthorized access or actions.
*Mesos Contribution:* Mesos *provides* and *relies on* ACLs as its *primary* authorization mechanism.  Their configuration is entirely within Mesos's control.
*Example:* An ACL is configured to allow any framework to launch tasks on any Agent, allowing a compromised framework to take over the entire cluster.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access to resources, data breaches, privilege escalation, cluster compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design and implement ACLs following the principle of least privilege.  Grant only the minimum necessary permissions to each principal.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly review and audit ACL configurations to ensure they are correct and up-to-date.
    *   **Testing:** Thoroughly test ACL configurations to verify that they enforce the intended access controls.
    *   **Documentation:** Clearly document ACL configurations and the rationale behind them.

## Attack Surface: [5. Vulnerable Dependencies (Mesos, Libprocess, *Directly Used by Mesos*)](./attack_surfaces/5__vulnerable_dependencies__mesos__libprocess__directly_used_by_mesos_.md)

*Description:* Mesos itself, and the libraries it *directly* depends on and includes (e.g., libprocess), may have vulnerabilities that can be exploited remotely.  This excludes dependencies of *container runtimes* (covered separately) and focuses on components *bundled with or directly required by* Mesos.
*Mesos Contribution:* Mesos *directly incorporates* and relies on these components.  Their security is inseparable from Mesos's own security.
*Example:* A vulnerability in libprocess allows an attacker to send a crafted message to the Mesos Master, causing it to crash or execute arbitrary code.
*Impact:* Remote code execution, denial of service, cluster compromise.
*Risk Severity:* **High** (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Mesos and all its *directly included* dependencies (including libprocess) updated to the latest stable versions.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a vulnerability scanner to identify known vulnerabilities in Mesos and its *direct* dependencies.
    *   **Security Advisories:** Monitor security advisories for Mesos and related projects (Apache, libprocess).
    *   **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system to track and manage *Mesos's own* dependencies, making it easier to update them.

## Attack Surface: [6. Unencrypted Communication (HTTP instead of HTTPS) - *Within Mesos*](./attack_surfaces/6__unencrypted_communication__http_instead_of_https__-_within_mesos.md)

*Description:* Using HTTP instead of HTTPS for communication *between Mesos components* (Master, Agents, and frameworks *communicating with the Mesos API*) allows attackers to eavesdrop on traffic and potentially steal credentials or sensitive data.
*Mesos Contribution:* Mesos *supports* both HTTP and HTTPS, but it's the user's responsibility *within the Mesos configuration* to configure HTTPS. This is a *direct* configuration choice within Mesos.
*Example:* An attacker on the same network as the Mesos Master uses a packet sniffer to capture HTTP traffic to the Mesos API, revealing framework authentication credentials.
*Impact:* Credential theft, data breaches, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*Risk Severity:* **High**
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:** Configure Mesos to use HTTPS for *all* communication between its components. Disable HTTP access entirely.
    *   **Valid Certificates:** Use valid, trusted TLS certificates issued by a reputable certificate authority (CA).
    *   **Strong Ciphers:** Configure Mesos to use strong TLS ciphers and protocols. Avoid weak or outdated ciphers.
