# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/mesos

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Authentication for Mesos Master and Agents](./mitigation_strategies/enable_authentication_for_mesos_master_and_agents.md)

**Description:**
1.  Choose a Mesos-supported authentication mechanism (e.g., Pluggable Authentication Modules - PAM, or custom authentication modules).
2.  Configure the Mesos Master by setting `authenticate_agents=true` and specifying the chosen authentication mechanism in `mesos-master.conf` or command-line options. For example, for PAM, ensure `authentication_provider=pam`.
3.  Configure Mesos Agents by setting `authenticatees_master=true` and specifying the same authentication mechanism in `mesos-agent.conf` or command-line options.  For PAM, ensure `authentication_provider=pam`.
4.  Distribute necessary authentication credentials (e.g., PAM configuration files, Kerberos keytabs, or custom credentials as required by the chosen mechanism) to Mesos Agents.
5.  Restart Mesos Master and Agents to activate the authentication configuration.
6.  Test authentication by attempting to interact with the Mesos Master API or submit tasks from an unauthenticated source and verify access is denied.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Unauthorized Access to Mesos Cluster APIs (High Severity): External entities or rogue frameworks gaining control of the Mesos cluster through unauthenticated API access, allowing them to deploy malicious tasks, steal cluster information, or disrupt services.
*   Agent Spoofing (Medium Severity): Malicious actors deploying rogue Mesos Agents that could register with the Master and potentially be used to execute unauthorized tasks or disrupt resource allocation.
**Impact:**
*   Unauthorized Access to Mesos Cluster APIs: High Risk Reduction
*   Agent Spoofing: Medium Risk Reduction
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, PAM authentication is enabled for Master and Agents in the staging environment. Configuration files are located in `/etc/mesos/`.
**Missing Implementation:** Authentication is not yet enabled in the production environment. Production Mesos Master and Agent configurations need to be updated to enable PAM authentication by setting `authenticate_agents=true` and `authenticatees_master=true` respectively, and ensuring `authentication_provider=pam` is configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Mesos Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__for_mesos_authorization.md)

**Description:**
1.  Define roles relevant to Mesos operations (e.g., `framework_developer`, `operator`, `cluster_admin`).
2.  Identify specific Mesos API actions and resources each role should be authorized to access (e.g., `createFramework`, `getAgent`, `updateFramework`). Consult Mesos authorization documentation for available actions.
3.  Configure Mesos authorization rules using the Mesos authorization framework, typically through a JSON file specified by the `--authorizers` flag in `mesos-master.conf` or command-line options.
4.  Define policies within the JSON file to map roles to allowed actions and resources. Policies can be based on user principals, framework IDs, or other attributes.
5.  Test RBAC by attempting Mesos API calls with different user principals or framework identities and verifying that authorization decisions are enforced according to the defined policies.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Privilege Escalation within Mesos (High Severity): Users or frameworks with limited permissions gaining unauthorized access to sensitive Mesos APIs or resources, potentially leading to cluster compromise or disruption.
*   Framework Resource Abuse (Medium Severity): Frameworks exceeding their intended operational scope by accessing APIs or resources they should not be authorized to use, potentially impacting other frameworks or cluster stability.
**Impact:**
*   Privilege Escalation within Mesos: High Risk Reduction
*   Framework Resource Abuse: Medium Risk Reduction
**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic authorization is enabled, but fine-grained RBAC rules are not yet fully defined and enforced. Initial configuration is in `mesos-master.conf` using JSON based authorization.
**Missing Implementation:**  Detailed RBAC policies need to be defined in the JSON authorization configuration file for all relevant roles and Mesos API actions. The current JSON authorization configuration needs to be expanded to cover all necessary permissions and roles.  This needs to be implemented in both staging and production environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS/SSL Encryption for Mesos Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tlsssl_encryption_for_mesos_communication.md)

**Description:**
1.  Generate TLS certificates and private keys for Mesos Master and Agents. Ensure certificates are properly signed and valid.
2.  Configure Mesos Master to enable TLS by setting flags like `--ssl_enabled=true`, `--ssl_cert_file=<master_cert_path>`, and `--ssl_key_file=<master_key_path>` in `mesos-master.conf` or command-line options.
3.  Configure Mesos Agents to enable TLS and trust the Master's certificate by setting flags like `--ssl_enabled=true`, `--ssl_cert_file=<agent_cert_path>`, `--ssl_key_file=<agent_key_path>`, and `--ssl_ca_cert_file=<master_cert_path>` in `mesos-agent.conf` or command-line options.
4.  Restart Mesos Master and Agents to activate TLS encryption.
5.  Verify TLS encryption by inspecting network traffic between Mesos components using tools like `tcpdump` or `Wireshark` and confirming encrypted communication. Check Mesos Master and Agent logs for TLS related messages.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Mesos Communication Channels (High Severity): Interception of sensitive data transmitted between Mesos Master and Agents, or between frameworks and the Master, potentially exposing task data, framework credentials, or cluster configuration.
*   Data Eavesdropping on Mesos Network Traffic (Medium Severity): Unauthorized monitoring of network communication to gain access to sensitive information exchanged within the Mesos cluster, such as task status updates, resource offers, or framework messages.
**Impact:**
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Mesos Communication Channels: High Risk Reduction
*   Data Eavesdropping on Mesos Network Traffic: Medium Risk Reduction
**Currently Implemented:** Yes, TLS is enabled for communication between Mesos Master and Agents in both staging and production environments. Certificates are managed using a basic script and stored locally on servers.
**Missing Implementation:** TLS encryption is not yet enabled for communication with ZooKeeper, which Mesos relies on for state management. ZooKeeper configuration needs to be updated to enforce TLS for client and server communication. Certificate management process needs to be improved with automated rotation and potentially using a dedicated certificate management system for Mesos components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Resource Limits and Quotas within Mesos](./mitigation_strategies/implement_resource_limits_and_quotas_within_mesos.md)

**Description:**
1.  Define appropriate resource limits (CPU, memory, disk I/O, GPUs) for tasks within framework definitions. Frameworks should specify `resources` constraints when launching tasks.
2.  Utilize Mesos resource quotas to limit the total resources that can be consumed by each framework. Configure quotas using the Mesos quota API or command-line tools like `mesos-quota`.
3.  Monitor resource usage per framework and overall cluster resource utilization using Mesos monitoring tools or external monitoring systems.
4.  Adjust resource limits and quotas based on application needs and cluster capacity to prevent resource exhaustion and ensure fair resource allocation across frameworks.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Mesos Cluster Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion (High Severity): Malicious or misbehaving frameworks or tasks consuming excessive resources, leading to resource starvation for other frameworks and tasks, and potentially causing cluster instability or failure.
*   Resource Hogging by Runaway Tasks (Medium Severity):  Unintentional resource overconsumption by poorly configured or buggy tasks impacting the performance and availability of other tasks running on the same Mesos Agents.
**Impact:**
*   Mesos Cluster Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion: High Risk Reduction
*   Resource Hogging by Runaway Tasks: Medium Risk Reduction
**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Resource limits are defined at the framework level in some cases, but are not consistently applied to all tasks. Resource quotas are not currently implemented.
**Missing Implementation:**  Resource limits need to be consistently enforced for all tasks by frameworks. Resource quotas should be implemented using the Mesos quota API to manage resource allocation across different frameworks. Monitoring and alerting for resource quota breaches and excessive resource consumption by frameworks should also be set up within the Mesos monitoring system.
