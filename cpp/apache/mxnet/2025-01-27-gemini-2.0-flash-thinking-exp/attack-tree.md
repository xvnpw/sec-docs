                    *   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the model repository and replaces legitimate models with malicious ones, leading to model poisoning when the application loads these tampered models.
                    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on storage security)
                    *   **Impact:** High (Model poisoning, business logic compromise, potentially code execution if malicious models are crafted)

                *   **Attack Vector:** The application loads model files without verifying their integrity (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures). This allows for easy tampering if model storage is compromised or if an attacker can intercept model delivery.
                *   **4.1.2.1. [CRITICAL HIGH RISK PATH] Application Loads Models Without Verifying Integrity (e.g., Checksums, Signatures), Allowing for Tampering [CRITICAL HIGH RISK PATH]**
                    *   **Description:** The application's failure to validate model integrity makes it highly vulnerable to model poisoning. If an attacker can modify the model files in storage or during transit, the application will unknowingly load and use a malicious model.

                *   **Attack Vector:** Lack of proper sandboxing or isolation for the MXNet process. If the process runs with high privileges, a successful exploit within MXNet can escalate to system-level compromise.
                *   **4.2.2.1. [HIGH RISK PATH] MXNet Process Runs with Excessive Privileges, Allowing for System-Level Compromise if Exploited [HIGH RISK PATH]**
                    *   **Description:** The MXNet process is not sufficiently isolated and runs with unnecessary privileges. If an attacker manages to exploit a vulnerability in MXNet, they can leverage these excessive privileges to gain control over the underlying system.
