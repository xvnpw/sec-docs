## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization (CRITICAL)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical attack vector due to the inherent dangers of deserializing untrusted data. MXNet, like many ML frameworks, uses serialization for saving and loading models and data.
*   **High-Risk Paths:**
    *   **(CR) Exploit Deserialization -> Pickle/JSON Deserialization -> Untrusted Source:** This is the *most critical* path.
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a maliciously crafted serialized object (using `pickle` or a vulnerable JSON format) from an untrusted source (e.g., a file upload, an external API). When the application deserializes this object using `pickle.load()` or an insecure JSON parser, arbitrary code embedded within the object is executed.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** High (Complete system compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Readily available exploits for `pickle`)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **(HR) Exploit Deserialization -> Custom Operator Deserialization -> Crafted Code:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If a custom MXNet operator has flawed serialization/deserialization logic, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized object. When deserialized, this object executes arbitrary code. This is particularly dangerous if the custom operator is loaded from an untrusted source or if its `load`/`save` methods don't perform proper input validation.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Complete system compromise)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Medium-High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit MXNet Runtime/Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mxnet_runtimedependencies.md)

*    **Description:** Vulnerabilities in MXNet's core C++ code or its dependencies (BLAS, CUDA libraries, etc.) can be exploited.
*   **High-Risk Paths:**
    *   **(HR) Exploit MXNet Runtime/Dependencies -> Buffer Overflow:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in MXNet's C++ code or a dependency allows an attacker to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This can be triggered by carefully crafted input data or model definitions.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low-Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Complete system compromise)
        *   **Effort:** High
        *   **Skill Level:** High
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** High
    *   **(CR) Exploit MXNet Runtime/Dependencies -> Dependency Vulnerability (Known CVE):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** A known vulnerability (CVE) exists in one of MXNet's dependencies (e.g., a BLAS library). An attacker leverages this vulnerability, potentially using a publicly available exploit, to compromise the system.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Can range from DoS to arbitrary code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low-Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes Summary](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes_summary.md)

*   **Exploit Deserialization:** The overarching category of deserialization attacks.
*   **Pickle/JSON Deserialization (Untrusted Source):** The most dangerous specific instance of deserialization vulnerability.
*   **Dependency Vulnerability (Known CVE):** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*  **Untrusted Source:** Source of malicious input.
