# Threat Model Analysis for apache/mxnet

## Threat: [Malicious Model Substitution (Spoofing)](./threats/malicious_model_substitution__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces a legitimate, serialized MXNet model file (`.params` or `.json`) with a crafted malicious one. The attacker might gain access to the file system, intercept model downloads, or exploit application vulnerabilities.  The malicious model could produce incorrect results, exfiltrate data, or potentially lead to code execution (in combination with other vulnerabilities).
*   **Impact:** Loss of model integrity, incorrect predictions, potential data breaches, potential system compromise (if combined with other vulnerabilities).
*   **MXNet Component Affected:** `mxnet.mod.Module.load_checkpoint`, `mxnet.gluon.nn.SymbolBlock.imports`, `mxnet.gluon.model_zoo`, any custom code that loads models from files or network locations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Model Integrity Verification:** Before loading, verify the model's cryptographic hash (SHA-256 or stronger) against a known-good value. Store the hash securely.
    *   **Digital Signatures:** Sign the model file and verify the signature before loading. Protect the private key rigorously.
    *   **Secure Model Storage:** Store models in a secure location with strict access controls.
    *   **Secure Model Download:** Use HTTPS with certificate pinning for model downloads.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review model loading code for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Adversarial Example Input (Tampering)](./threats/adversarial_example_input__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a small, often imperceptible, perturbation to a valid input that causes the MXNet model to misclassify it or produce an incorrect output. The attacker doesn't modify the model itself, only the input.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect model predictions, potentially leading to incorrect decisions or actions by the application.
*   **MXNet Component Affected:** Any component that performs inference: `mxnet.mod.Module.predict`, `mxnet.gluon.Block.forward`, custom inference code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the application)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Adversarial Training:** Train the model on both clean and adversarially perturbed examples. Use MXNet's tools for generating adversarial examples.
    *   **Input Sanitization/Preprocessing:** Apply techniques like smoothing, quantization, or dimensionality reduction.
    *   **Defensive Distillation:** Train a second model to mimic the first.
    *   **Gradient Masking/Regularization:** Penalize large input gradients.
    *   **Input Validation:** Enforce strict input validation.

## Threat: [Model Poisoning via Training Data (Tampering)](./threats/model_poisoning_via_training_data__tampering_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious data points into the training dataset, causing the trained MXNet model to behave incorrectly or have a backdoor. This requires compromising the data source or data ingestion pipeline.
*   **Impact:** Compromised model accuracy, biased predictions, potential backdoors.
*   **MXNet Component Affected:** `mxnet.gluon.Trainer`, `mxnet.io.DataIter`, `mxnet.recordio`, custom data loading and training code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Sanitization and Validation:** Rigorous data validation and cleaning.
    *   **Data Provenance:** Track the origin and history of training data.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Identify and remove anomalous data points.
    *   **Robust Training Algorithms:** Explore algorithms resistant to poisoning.
    *   **Differential Privacy:** Limit the influence of individual data points.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Audit training data and the training process.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends many inference requests or crafts computationally expensive inputs, causing MXNet to consume excessive CPU, GPU, or memory, making the model unavailable.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, service unavailability.
*   **MXNet Component Affected:** `mxnet.mod.Module.predict`, `mxnet.gluon.Block.forward`, inference components, MXNet runtime (especially with GPUs).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Set limits on CPU, GPU, and memory consumption.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Limit requests per user/IP.
    *   **Input Validation:** Reject excessively large or complex inputs.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute requests across multiple instances.
    *   **Auto-Scaling:** Dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
    *   **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for inference requests.

## Threat: [Exploitation of MXNet Vulnerabilities (Denial of Service, potentially others)](./threats/exploitation_of_mxnet_vulnerabilities__denial_of_service__potentially_others_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within* the MXNet library (e.g., buffer overflow, format string vulnerability) to cause a denial of service, gain code execution, or leak information.  This requires crafted input to the vulnerable component.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, potential system compromise, potential data breaches.
*   **MXNet Component Affected:** Potentially *any* MXNet component, depending on the vulnerability. This could include data loading, model serialization, operator implementations, or the runtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep MXNet Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version. Subscribe to security announcements.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use a scanner to identify issues in MXNet and dependencies.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Strict input validation *before* passing data to MXNet functions.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Test MXNet components with a wide range of inputs.
    *   **Code Audits:** Regularly audit application and relevant MXNet code.
