# Threat Model Analysis for apache/thrift

## Threat: [Malicious IDL Injection](./threats/malicious_idl_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide a crafted Thrift IDL file that, when processed by the Thrift compiler, generates vulnerable code. This could involve injecting malicious code snippets or defining overly complex structures that lead to vulnerabilities in the generated code.

**Impact:** The generated code could contain vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, or logic errors, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service when the application uses this generated code.

**Affected Thrift Component:** Thrift Compiler (IDL Parser and Code Generators)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly control access to the Thrift IDL files and the environment where the Thrift compiler is executed.
*   Implement a code review process for any changes to the IDL files before compilation.
*   Use a trusted and up-to-date version of the Thrift compiler.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on the generated code to detect potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends maliciously crafted Thrift messages to the application. When the application attempts to deserialize this data, vulnerabilities in the deserialization logic or the underlying protocol implementation can be exploited. This could involve manipulating data types, sizes, or structure to trigger errors.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, data corruption, or information disclosure depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Thrift Component:** Thrift Protocols (e.g., `TBinaryProtocol`, `TCompactProtocol`, `TJSONProtocol`) and generated deserialization code.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always validate the structure and content of incoming Thrift data before deserialization.
*   Implement strict schema validation based on the defined IDL.
*   Use safe deserialization practices specific to the chosen protocol.
*   Consider using a schema registry for managing and enforcing data contracts.
*   Implement input sanitization and validation based on the expected data types.

## Threat: [Type Confusion Attacks](./threats/type_confusion_attacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends Thrift messages where the data types do not match the expected types defined in the IDL. This can exploit weaknesses in the deserialization process where the application incorrectly handles the mismatched types.

**Impact:** Unexpected behavior, application crashes, potential memory corruption, or information disclosure.

**Affected Thrift Component:** Thrift Protocols and generated deserialization code.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure robust type checking during deserialization on the server-side.
*   Strictly adhere to the data types defined in the IDL on both the client and server.
*   Implement checks to verify the integrity of data types during deserialization.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow during Serialization/Deserialization](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_during_serializationdeserialization.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends messages with integer values that are designed to cause an overflow or underflow when the application serializes or deserializes them. This can lead to incorrect calculations or buffer overflows.

**Impact:** Incorrect application logic, potential buffer overflows leading to crashes or remote code execution.

**Affected Thrift Component:** Thrift Protocols and generated serialization/deserialization code handling integer types.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Validate integer inputs to ensure they are within the expected range before serialization and after deserialization.
*   Use appropriate data types with sufficient size to prevent overflows and underflows.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion through Large Payloads](./threats/resource_exhaustion_through_large_payloads.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends excessively large Thrift messages to the server. The server may allocate significant resources (memory, CPU) to process these messages, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Impact:** Server slowdowns, service unavailability, and potential crashes.

**Affected Thrift Component:** Thrift Transports (e.g., `TBufferedTransport`, `TFramedTransport`) and server-side processing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the maximum size of incoming Thrift messages.
*   Configure appropriate timeouts for processing Thrift requests.
*   Use framed transports (`TFramedTransport`) to better manage message boundaries and prevent processing of incomplete messages.
*   Implement resource quotas and monitoring on the server.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Lack of Encryption)](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attacks__lack_of_encryption_.md)

**Description:** If Thrift communication is not encrypted (e.g., using `TSocket` without TLS/SSL), an attacker can intercept the network traffic between the client and server, potentially eavesdropping on sensitive data or modifying messages in transit.

**Impact:** Confidential data breaches, data integrity compromise, and potential for unauthorized actions.

**Affected Thrift Component:** Thrift Transports (e.g., `TSocket`)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always use secure transports like `TSSLSocket` for sensitive communication.
*   Properly configure and enforce TLS/SSL on both the client and server sides.
*   Ensure that the TLS/SSL implementation is up-to-date and uses strong cryptographic algorithms.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist in the Thrift library itself or in its dependencies. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated or vulnerable version of Thrift.

**Impact:** Various security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

**Affected Thrift Component:** The entire Thrift library and its dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Thrift library and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis tools.
*   Subscribe to security advisories for the Thrift project and its dependencies.
