## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Serialization/Deserialization Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_serializationdeserialization_flaws.md)

*   **Goal:** Corrupt data or execute arbitrary code by manipulating the serialization and deserialization process.
    *   This path is high risk due to the potential for severe consequences like arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Deserialization of Untrusted Data (Object Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__deserialization_of_untrusted_data__object_injection_.md)

*   **Method:** Send a malicious payload embedded within a seemingly legitimate Thrift structure that, when deserialized, leads to the execution of arbitrary code. This is similar to Java deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   **Send Malicious Payload within Thrift Structure:** Craft a Thrift message containing serialized objects that exploit vulnerabilities in the application's class structure or libraries used during deserialization.
            *   Actionable Insight: Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources without careful scrutiny. Implement secure deserialization practices, potentially using allow-lists for allowed object types.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Trigger Execution of Arbitrary Code:** Upon deserialization, the malicious payload triggers the execution of attacker-controlled code on the server.
            *   Actionable Insight: Regularly update dependencies and libraries to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities. Implement security measures like sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of successful exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Trigger Execution of Arbitrary Code](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__trigger_execution_of_arbitrary_code.md)

Upon deserialization, the malicious payload triggers the execution of attacker-controlled code on the server.
            *   Actionable Insight: Regularly update dependencies and libraries to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities. Implement security measures like sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of successful exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit RPC Mechanism Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_rpc_mechanism_weaknesses.md)

*   **Goal:** Intercept, manipulate, or disrupt communication between Thrift clients and servers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Thrift Communication](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_thrift_communication.md)

*   **Method:** Intercept and potentially modify Thrift messages exchanged between the client and server.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Intercept and Modify Thrift Messages:** Position an attacker between the client and server to eavesdrop and alter communication.
            *   Actionable Insight: Always use secure transports like `TSSLSocket` (Thrift over SSL/TLS) to encrypt communication and prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Lack of Encryption (e.g., using TSocket without TLS):** The application uses an unencrypted transport, making communication vulnerable to interception.
            *   Actionable Insight: Enforce the use of encrypted transports for all Thrift communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Intercept and Modify Thrift Messages](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__intercept_and_modify_thrift_messages.md)

Position an attacker between the client and server to eavesdrop and alter communication.
            *   Actionable Insight: Always use secure transports like `TSSLSocket` (Thrift over SSL/TLS) to encrypt communication and prevent eavesdropping and tampering.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Lack of Encryption (e.g., using TSocket without TLS)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__lack_of_encryption__e_g___using_tsocket_without_tls_.md)

The application uses an unencrypted transport, making communication vulnerable to interception.
            *   Actionable Insight: Enforce the use of encrypted transports for all Thrift communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Denial of Service (DoS) via RPC Overload](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__denial_of_service__dos__via_rpc_overload.md)

*   **Method:** Flood the Thrift server with a large number of requests to exhaust its resources and make it unavailable.
        *   **Send a Large Number of Thrift Requests:** Launch a coordinated attack sending a high volume of requests.
            *   Actionable Insight: Implement rate limiting and request throttling on the server-side to prevent resource exhaustion from excessive requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Configuration and Deployment Issues](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_configuration_and_deployment_issues.md)

*   **Goal:** Exploit insecure configurations or deployment practices related to Thrift.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Transport Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__insecure_transport_configuration.md)

*   **Method:** Exploit the use of unencrypted transport protocols for Thrift communication.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Using Unencrypted Transports (TSocket):** The application is configured to use `TSocket` without SSL/TLS encryption.
            *   Actionable Insight: Always configure Thrift to use secure transports like `TSSLSocket` for production environments.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Expose Sensitive Data in Transit:** Communication is vulnerable to eavesdropping and data interception.
            *   Actionable Insight: Encrypt all sensitive data transmitted over the network, including data exchanged via Thrift.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Using Unencrypted Transports (TSocket)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__using_unencrypted_transports__tsocket_.md)

The application is configured to use `TSocket` without SSL/TLS encryption.
            *   Actionable Insight: Always configure Thrift to use secure transports like `TSSLSocket` for production environments.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Expose Sensitive Data in Transit](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__expose_sensitive_data_in_transit.md)

Communication is vulnerable to eavesdropping and data interception.
            *   Actionable Insight: Encrypt all sensitive data transmitted over the network, including data exchanged via Thrift.
