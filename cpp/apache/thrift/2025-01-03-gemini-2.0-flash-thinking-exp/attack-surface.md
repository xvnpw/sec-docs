# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/thrift

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Transport Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_transport_configuration.md)

**Description:** Data transmitted between the client and server is not encrypted, making it vulnerable to eavesdropping and manipulation.

**How Thrift Contributes:** Thrift offers various transport layers, including insecure options like plain `TSocket`. The choice of transport directly impacts the security of the communication channel.

**Example:** A Thrift client and server communicate using `TSocket` without TLS enabled. An attacker on the network can intercept and read the data being exchanged, potentially including sensitive information like user credentials or business data.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data integrity compromise, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Always use secure transports:**  Utilize `TSSLSocket` for direct socket communication or tunnel Thrift communication over TLS/SSL (e.g., via HTTPS for `THttpTransport`).
*   **Enforce secure transport usage:** Configure the server and client to only accept or initiate connections over secure transports.
*   **Regularly review transport configurations:** Ensure that secure transport settings are maintained and haven't been inadvertently disabled.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  The process of converting serialized data back into objects can be exploited by sending maliciously crafted messages, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.

**How Thrift Contributes:** Thrift's various protocols (e.g., `TBinaryProtocol`, `TCompactProtocol`, `TJSONProtocol`) handle serialization and deserialization. Vulnerabilities in these protocols or their implementations can be exploited.

**Example:** A malicious client sends a specially crafted message using `TBinaryProtocol` that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the server's deserialization logic, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. Another example is sending a message with deeply nested or recursive structures, causing excessive resource consumption on the server.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, application crash.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Keep Thrift libraries up-to-date:** Regularly update the Thrift library to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Implement input validation:**  Validate all data received from clients *after* deserialization to ensure it conforms to expected types and constraints.
*   **Consider using safer serialization formats:** While Thrift protocols are generally safe when used correctly, be aware of potential vulnerabilities in specific implementations and consider alternatives if necessary and feasible.
*   **Implement resource limits:**  Set limits on the size and complexity of incoming messages to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Server Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/server_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** A malicious client can send a large number of requests or requests with large payloads to overwhelm the server's resources, leading to a denial of service.

**How Thrift Contributes:** Thrift defines the communication protocol, and if not implemented carefully on the server-side, it can be susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks.

**Example:** A malicious client repeatedly calls a Thrift service with extremely large data payloads, consuming excessive memory and CPU resources on the server, eventually causing it to become unresponsive to legitimate requests. Another example is a flood of connection requests exhausting available network resources.

**Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement rate limiting and throttling:** Limit the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame.
*   **Set connection limits:** Restrict the number of concurrent connections the server can handle.
*   **Implement request size limits:**  Limit the maximum size of incoming requests to prevent large payload attacks.
*   **Use asynchronous processing:**  Handle requests asynchronously to avoid blocking the main server thread and improve responsiveness under load.
*   **Monitor server resources:**  Continuously monitor CPU, memory, and network usage to detect and respond to potential resource exhaustion attacks.
