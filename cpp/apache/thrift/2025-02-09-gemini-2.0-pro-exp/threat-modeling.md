# Threat Model Analysis for apache/thrift

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious serialized Thrift payload.  When the Thrift application deserializes this payload (e.g., upon receiving data from a client), the attacker-controlled data triggers unintended code execution. This leverages vulnerabilities *within Thrift's deserialization process* or exploits how the deserialized data is subsequently (mis)handled by the application due to type confusion or unsafe deserialization practices in the target language *triggered by the Thrift deserialization*.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or client, leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Thrift serialization/deserialization libraries (e.g., `TBinaryProtocol`, `TCompactProtocol`, `TJSONProtocol`).  The vulnerability lies in how these protocols handle potentially malicious input *and* how the application interacts with the deserialized objects. Specific vulnerable functions depend on the language and Thrift library version.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** *After* Thrift deserialization, *thoroughly* validate *all* fields of the deserialized object against a strict, predefined schema. Verify data types, lengths, ranges, and allowed values.  Do *not* rely solely on Thrift's type system.
    *   **Safe Deserialization Practices:** Employ language-specific safe deserialization techniques.  In Java, avoid `ObjectInputStream` or use a whitelist-based approach. In Python, avoid `pickle` if possible, or use a safer alternative. This is crucial because Thrift's deserialization might create objects that are then processed by these potentially unsafe mechanisms.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run Thrift services with the minimum necessary operating system privileges.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Deserialization:** If the data structure is known at compile time, avoid dynamic deserialization features that might be more exploitable.
    *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Consider running the deserialization process in a sandboxed environment.

## Threat: [Transport Layer Eavesdropping and Tampering (Without TLS)](./threats/transport_layer_eavesdropping_and_tampering__without_tls_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between a Thrift client and server when TLS is *not* used.  The attacker can passively eavesdrop (reading sensitive data transmitted via Thrift) or actively modify Thrift messages in transit (data tampering, injecting malicious commands). This is a direct threat because Thrift's transport layer *itself* is insecure without TLS.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (confidentiality loss), data corruption (integrity loss), potentially leading to incorrect application behavior or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Thrift transport layer (e.g., `TSocket`, `TServerSocket`, `TFramedTransport`, `THttpTransport` *when explicitly configured without TLS*). The core issue is the lack of encryption and integrity protection provided by these transports by default.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory TLS:** Enforce the use of TLS (Transport Layer Security) for *all* Thrift communication.  Configure both the Thrift client and server to use TLS, and ensure proper certificate validation is performed by the client. This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Strong Ciphers:** Use strong, modern TLS cipher suites.
    *   **Certificate Pinning (Advanced):** Consider certificate pinning.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Client Access (to Thrift Server)](./threats/unauthenticated_client_access__to_thrift_server_.md)

*   **Description:** A Thrift server is configured without any authentication mechanism. Any client that can reach the server's network endpoint can connect and invoke *Thrift methods*, potentially accessing sensitive data or performing unauthorized actions. This is a direct threat because it's a failure of the Thrift service configuration itself.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, unauthorized execution of Thrift service methods, potential for data modification or deletion, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Thrift server implementation (specifically, the lack of authentication logic in the Thrift processor or transport layer). The `TProcessor` implementation and how it's used with the `TServer`, and the chosen `TTransport`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Authentication:** Integrate a robust authentication mechanism *within the Thrift service*. Options include:
        *   **TLS Client Certificates:** Require clients to present valid TLS certificates (leveraging TLS for authentication).
        *   **Token-Based Authentication:** Implement a custom authentication protocol using tokens (e.g., JWT), integrated into the Thrift service logic.
        *   **SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer):** Utilize Thrift's support for SASL, which provides a framework for various authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Place Thrift servers on a restricted network segment (this is a supporting control, not a primary mitigation for the *Thrift-specific* threat).
