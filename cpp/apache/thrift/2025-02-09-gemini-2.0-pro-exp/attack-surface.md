# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/thrift

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

*Description:* Processing of serialized data from untrusted sources via Thrift's serialization mechanism, allowing attackers to potentially inject malicious payloads.
*Thrift Contribution:* Thrift's core serialization/deserialization process is the direct attack vector.  The binary protocols, while efficient, can be less transparent, making manual inspection and validation more challenging.  Thrift's type system is *not* a sufficient security control.
*Example:* An attacker sends a crafted Thrift message containing a serialized object that, when deserialized by the Thrift runtime, triggers a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability due to unsafe handling of object instantiation or a vulnerable library used in conjunction with Thrift.
*Impact:* Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate *all* incoming data *before* it reaches the Thrift deserialization layer.  Check types, lengths, ranges, and allowed values.  Use a whitelist approach for allowed data structures, *not* just relying on Thrift's type definitions.
    *   **Avoid Arbitrary Object Deserialization:** Do *not* deserialize arbitrary objects from untrusted sources via Thrift.  Define specific, expected data structures in the Thrift IDL and enforce their use.
    *   **Safe Deserialization Libraries:** If custom deserialization logic is absolutely necessary, use libraries specifically designed to be secure against deserialization attacks.  Do *not* assume standard object deserialization is safe.
    *   **Sandboxing (If Feasible):** Consider running Thrift deserialization logic in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential exploits, although this can add significant complexity.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for deserialization vulnerabilities using both static and dynamic analysis tools, specifically targeting the Thrift-related code.

## Attack Surface: [Protocol Confusion / Downgrade](./attack_surfaces/protocol_confusion__downgrade.md)

*Description:* Exploiting differences in how Thrift's various protocols (TBinaryProtocol, TCompactProtocol, TJSONProtocol) handle data, or forcing the server to use a less secure protocol supported by Thrift.
*Thrift Contribution:* Thrift's support for multiple serialization protocols is the direct source of this risk.  The different protocols have different parsing and handling characteristics.
*Example:* A server accepts both TBinaryProtocol and TJSONProtocol. An attacker sends a carefully crafted JSON payload to an endpoint expecting binary data, hoping to trigger an error or unexpected behavior within the Thrift parsing logic that reveals information or allows for further exploitation.  This leverages differences in how Thrift handles the different formats.
*Impact:* Information disclosure, denial of service, potentially leading to further attacks (depending on the specific vulnerability triggered).
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Protocol Enforcement:** Configure the Thrift server to accept *only* the intended protocol(s).  Disable *all* unused protocols.  Do *not* allow automatic protocol negotiation.
    *   **Consistent Protocol Usage:** Ensure that clients and servers *always* use the same, explicitly configured Thrift protocol.
    *   **Input Validation (Again):** Validate the structure and content of messages *according to the expected Thrift protocol*, even after protocol negotiation.  This validation should occur *before* any significant processing by the Thrift framework.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Authentication/Authorization (Thrift's Role)](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_authenticationauthorization__thrift's_role_.md)

*Description:* Failure to properly authenticate and authorize clients accessing Thrift services, relying solely on Thrift for security.
*Thrift Contribution:* Thrift itself does *not* provide built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms *within the IDL or core protocol*. It relies on the underlying transport and application logic, making it easy to overlook these critical security aspects. This is a *direct* contribution because the lack of built-in features necessitates external security measures.
*Example:* An attacker directly connects to a Thrift service port without providing any credentials and is able to invoke methods that should be restricted, because the application relies solely on the (non-existent) security features of the Thrift protocol itself.
*Impact:* Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Transport-Level Security (TLS/SSL):** *Always* use TLS/SSL to encrypt communication and provide client authentication (mutual TLS is strongly recommended).  This is the *foundation* for securing Thrift communication.
    *   **Application-Level Authentication/Authorization:** Implement robust authentication and authorization *within the application logic* that handles Thrift requests. Use tokens, API keys, or other appropriate mechanisms.  This is *essential* and cannot be omitted.
    *   **Context Propagation:** Ensure authentication and authorization context is correctly passed between services in a distributed system that uses Thrift for inter-service communication.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users and services only the minimum necessary permissions, enforced *within the application logic*, not relying on any perceived security from Thrift itself.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Thrift Library/Dependencies (Direct Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/outdated_thrift_librarydependencies__direct_vulnerabilities_.md)

*Description:* Using an outdated version of the Apache Thrift library itself, which contains known vulnerabilities *within the Thrift code*.
*Thrift Contribution:* This is a *direct* vulnerability because the flaw exists within the Thrift library's code (e.g., in the protocol implementations, code generation, or transport handling).
*Example:* An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of the Thrift library's TBinaryProtocol implementation to cause a denial of service or, in a worse case, achieve remote code execution.
*Impact:* Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from denial of service to remote code execution (RCE).
*Risk Severity:* High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Apache Thrift library itself updated to the *latest stable version*. This is the most direct mitigation.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to specifically identify known vulnerabilities in the Thrift library and its *direct* dependencies.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to Apache Thrift to be immediately notified of new vulnerabilities.
