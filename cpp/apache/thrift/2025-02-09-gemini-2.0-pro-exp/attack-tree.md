## Attack Tree Path: [1. Deserialization Vulnerabilities via Untrusted Data (==HIGH RISK==> to TBinaryProtocol):](./attack_tree_paths/1__deserialization_vulnerabilities_via_untrusted_data__==high_risk==_to_tbinaryprotocol_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most critical and likely path to RCE. It exploits the fundamental process of deserialization, where data received from a client is converted back into objects on the server. If the server deserializes data from *untrusted* sources (e.g., any client) without rigorous validation, an attacker can craft malicious payloads that execute arbitrary code during the deserialization process.
*   **[CRITICAL] Node: Untrusted Data:** The presence of untrusted data being deserialized is the *root cause* of this vulnerability.
*   **[CRITICAL] Condition: (If untrusted data is deserialized):** This highlights the conditional nature of the criticality. If *no* untrusted data is ever deserialized, this path is mitigated. However, in most real-world scenarios, some form of client input is processed.
*   **==HIGH RISK==> Path to TBinaryProtocol:** The `TBinaryProtocol` (and similarly, `TCompactProtocol`) are particularly susceptible because they are binary formats. This makes it easier for attackers to craft exploits that manipulate the raw bytes of the serialized data, bypassing any superficial checks.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  The attacker sends a specially crafted message to the Thrift service. This message contains serialized data that, when deserialized, will trigger unintended behavior.
    2.  The Thrift service, using `TBinaryProtocol` (or similar), receives the message and begins the deserialization process.
    3.  Due to the lack of proper input validation, the malicious payload is processed.
    4.  The payload exploits a vulnerability in the deserialization logic (e.g., type confusion, object injection, or a known vulnerability in a specific library used by Thrift).
    5.  This exploitation leads to the execution of arbitrary code on the server, giving the attacker control.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Rigorous Input Validation:** *Before* deserialization, implement extremely strict input validation. Validate *every* field, *every* type, *every* length, and *every* constraint. Use a whitelist approach (allow only known-good values).
    *   **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:** If possible, redesign the application to avoid deserializing data directly from untrusted clients. Consider using a trusted intermediary or a different data exchange format.
    *   **Safe Deserialization Libraries:** If using custom deserialization logic or third-party libraries, ensure they are secure and up-to-date.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Thrift service with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Protocol Bypass via Missing Authentication Checks ([CRITICAL]):](./attack_tree_paths/2__protocol_bypass_via_missing_authentication_checks___critical__.md)

*   **Description:** This vulnerability stems from a fundamental lack of authentication. If the Thrift service does not authenticate clients, *any* attacker can connect and invoke methods.
*   **[CRITICAL] Node: Missing Auth Checks:** This is the core issue. The absence of authentication is a critical security flaw.
*   **How it works:**
    1.  The attacker connects to the Thrift service without providing any credentials.
    2.  Because authentication is not enforced, the connection is accepted.
    3.  The attacker can now call any exposed Thrift method.
    4.  This can lead to:
        *   **Data Disclosure:** Reading sensitive data.
        *   **Data Modification:** Altering or deleting data.
        *   **Further Exploitation:** Triggering other vulnerabilities, potentially leading to RCE (e.g., if an unauthenticated user can call a method that is vulnerable to a deserialization attack).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement Authentication:** Integrate a robust authentication mechanism (e.g., OAuth 2.0, mutual TLS, API keys with proper management).
    *   **Enforce Authentication on *Every* Method:** Ensure that *every* Thrift method requires authentication. Do not leave any methods unprotected.
    *   **Authorization:** Implement authorization checks *after* authentication to control which users/clients can access specific methods and data.
