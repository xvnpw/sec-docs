# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/thrift

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Thrift-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization__thrift-specific_aspects_.md)

1.  **Precise IDL Types:** Utilize Thrift's IDL to define data structures and service methods with the *most specific* data types possible.  Avoid `string` when `i32`, `bool`, a custom `struct`, or an `enum` is more appropriate.  Use `list`, `set`, and `map` with well-defined element types.
2.  **Reject Unknown Fields:** Configure the Thrift server (using the appropriate server implementation and configuration options for your language) to *reject* any incoming request that contains fields *not* defined in the IDL. This is a crucial defense against attackers sending unexpected data.
3.  **Custom `struct` Validation (within handlers):** Even with strict IDL types, implement additional validation *within your service handlers*. This is your last line of defense.  This includes:
    *   **Length Checks:**  Enforce maximum lengths for `string` and `list` types.
    *   **Range Checks:**  Enforce minimum and maximum values for numeric types (`i32`, `i64`, `double`).
    *   **Regular Expressions:** Validate `string` fields that should conform to specific patterns.
    *   **Whitelisting:** If possible, use whitelists (allowed values) for fields, especially for `enum` types or fields with a limited set of valid inputs.
4. **Recursive Structure Depth Limits:** If your IDL contains recursive data structures (e.g., a `Comment` struct that can contain a list of `Comment` replies), implement explicit checks *within your service handlers* to limit the depth of recursion. This prevents stack overflow vulnerabilities.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Injection Attacks (Critical):**  Limits the scope of what can be injected through Thrift interfaces.
*   **Buffer Overflows (Critical):**  Length checks prevent writing beyond allocated buffers.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):**  Prevents excessively large or deeply nested structures from consuming resources.
*   **Data Corruption (High):**  Ensures only valid data, as defined by the IDL and handler logic, is processed.
*   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium):** Reduces the likelihood of unexpected behavior due to invalid input.

**Impact:**
*   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Negligible).
*   **Buffer Overflows:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Negligible).
*   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Medium/Low).
*   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low).
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk reduced significantly (from Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   IDL definitions use specific types in some areas.
*   Basic length checks are present in one service handler.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive validation (range checks, regular expressions, whitelisting) is missing in most service handlers.
*   **Unknown field rejection is not configured.** This is a critical missing piece.
*   Recursive structure depth limits are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Transport Layer Security (TLS/SSL) - Thrift Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/transport_layer_security__tlsssl__-_thrift_configuration.md)

1.  **`TSSLSocketFactory` (Server):** Configure the Thrift *server* to use `TSSLSocketFactory` (or the equivalent class for your programming language) to enable TLS.  Provide the server's TLS certificate and private key.
2.  **`TSSLSocket` (Client):** Configure the Thrift *client* to use `TSSLSocket` (or equivalent) to connect to the server over TLS.
3.  **Certificate Validation (Client):**  Crucially, configure the client to *validate* the server's TLS certificate.  This usually involves providing the CA certificate or a certificate bundle.  Do *not* disable certificate validation.
4.  **(Optional) Mutual TLS (mTLS):**  For strong client authentication, configure both the server (using `TSSLSocketFactory`) and the client (using `TSSLSocket`) to use *mutual TLS*.  This requires both the server and the client to present valid certificates.  The server must be configured to request and verify client certificates.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Eavesdropping (Critical):**  TLS encrypts the communication, preventing eavesdropping.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (Critical):**  Certificate validation prevents MITM attacks.  mTLS further strengthens this.
*   **Data Tampering (High):**  TLS ensures data integrity, preventing modification in transit.

**Impact:**
*   **Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Negligible).
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Negligible/Low, depending on mTLS).
*   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Negligible/Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   TLS is enabled on the server, but with a self-signed certificate.
*   Clients connect using TLS, but *certificate validation is disabled*.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A valid certificate from a trusted CA is needed.
*   **Client-side certificate validation must be enabled.** This is a critical vulnerability.
*   Mutual TLS (mTLS) is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Protocol and Serialization (Thrift-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/protocol_and_serialization__thrift-specific_.md)

1.  **`TBinaryProtocol` (Strongly Recommended):** Use the `TBinaryProtocol` for serialization.  This is generally more efficient and less susceptible to parsing vulnerabilities than text-based protocols like `TJSONProtocol`.
2.  **`TCompactProtocol` (Consider Carefully):** If bandwidth is a *critical* constraint, *consider* `TCompactProtocol`, which is even more compact.  However, thoroughly test any protocol changes, as they can introduce subtle bugs.  Prioritize security over minor performance gains.
3. **Avoid Text-Based Protocols:** Avoid using text based protocols like `TJSONProtocol`

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Parsing Vulnerabilities (Medium):** Binary protocols are less prone to parsing errors than text-based protocols.
*   **Performance Degradation (Low):** Binary protocols are generally more efficient.

**Impact:**
*   **Parsing Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
*   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduced (from Low to Negligible).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `TBinaryProtocol` is currently used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   None, assuming `TBinaryProtocol` is sufficient.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Exception Handling (Thrift-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_exception_handling__thrift-specific_.md)

1.  **Custom Thrift Exceptions:** Define custom exception types in your Thrift IDL (`.thrift` file) to represent specific error conditions that your service might encounter.  This allows for more granular error handling.
2.  **Catch `TException` and Custom Exceptions:** In your service handlers, ensure you catch *all* Thrift exceptions, including the base `TException` and any custom exceptions you've defined.
3.  **Generic Error Responses:**  When a Thrift exception is caught, return a *generic* error message to the client.  Do *not* include any sensitive information, such as stack traces or internal implementation details, in the error message sent to the client.
4.  **Log Details Internally:** Log the full exception details (including stack traces) *internally* for debugging and auditing.  This internal logging is separate from the response sent to the client.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Information Leakage (Medium):** Prevents attackers from learning about your internal implementation through exception details.

**Impact:**
*   **Information Leakage:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic exception handling exists, but may leak stack traces in some cases.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of custom Thrift exceptions is missing.
*   A centralized exception handling mechanism to ensure consistent, generic error responses is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Configuration (Thrift-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_configuration__thrift-specific_.md)

*   Use the `TConfiguration` object (or the equivalent mechanism in your language binding) to set appropriate timeouts for Thrift operations. This prevents slow clients or malicious actors from tying up server resources indefinitely. Set timeouts for:
    *   **Connect Timeout:** The time allowed to establish a connection.
    *   **Read Timeout:** The time allowed to read data from the socket.
    *   **Write Timeout:** The time allowed to write data to the socket.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Prevents slow clients or attackers from consuming resources.
*   **Impact:**
*    **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Medium/Low).
*   **Currently Implemented:**
*    Basic timeouts are configured, but they may not be optimal or consistently applied.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
*   Review and optimize timeout values based on expected network conditions and service behavior. Ensure timeouts are consistently applied across all Thrift clients and servers.
