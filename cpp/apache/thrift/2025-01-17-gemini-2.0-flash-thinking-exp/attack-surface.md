# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/thrift

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Transport](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_transport.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between Thrift clients and servers occurs without encryption.
    *   **How Thrift Contributes:** Thrift allows the use of plain TCP sockets (`TSocket`) and buffered transports (`TBufferedTransport`) without enforcing encryption. Developers must explicitly choose and configure secure transports.
    *   **Example:** An attacker eavesdropping on network traffic can intercept sensitive data being exchanged between a client and server using `TSocket`.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data interception, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks to modify data in transit.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement TLS/SSL:**  Use `TSSLSocket` or `TServerSocket` with TLS/SSL enabled for all Thrift communication. Configure appropriate certificates and key management.
        *   **Secure Network Infrastructure:** Ensure the network itself is secured, but relying solely on network security is not sufficient.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in the deserialization process of Thrift protocols can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or cause denial-of-service.
    *   **How Thrift Contributes:** Thrift protocols like `TBinaryProtocol` and `TCompactProtocol` deserialize data structures. If not implemented carefully, vulnerabilities in the deserialization logic (either in the Thrift library itself or in the generated code) can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A malicious client sends a crafted message that, when deserialized by the server using a vulnerable Thrift protocol implementation, triggers a buffer overflow leading to remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Safe Deserialization Practices:** Keep Thrift libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities. Be cautious about deserializing data from untrusted sources.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate the structure and content of incoming Thrift messages before deserialization to prevent unexpected data from triggering vulnerabilities.
        *   **Consider Schema Validation:** If possible, implement schema validation to ensure incoming data conforms to the expected structure.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of Authentication/Authorization at the Thrift Layer](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_authenticationauthorization_at_the_thrift_layer.md)

*   **Description:**  Thrift itself doesn't enforce authentication or authorization.
    *   **How Thrift Contributes:** Thrift provides the framework for communication but leaves the implementation of authentication and authorization to the developers. If not implemented correctly, any client can potentially access the server's services.
    *   **Example:** A public-facing Thrift service allows any client to call its methods without verifying their identity or permissions, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionality, potential for data breaches or manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Authentication Mechanisms:** Integrate authentication mechanisms (e.g., using tokens, certificates, or username/password) within the Thrift service implementation.
        *   **Implement Authorization Checks:**  Enforce authorization rules within the service handlers to ensure that only authorized clients can access specific methods or data.
        *   **Consider Transport-Level Security:** While not a replacement for application-level authentication, TLS/SSL can provide mutual authentication using client certificates.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers can send requests that consume excessive server resources, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How Thrift Contributes:**  Thrift servers process incoming requests. If not designed to handle malicious or excessive requests, they can be overwhelmed. This can be exacerbated by large data payloads or computationally intensive service methods.
    *   **Example:** A malicious client repeatedly sends requests with extremely large data payloads, causing the server to consume excessive memory and eventually crash.
    *   **Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of requests a client can make within a specific time frame.
        *   **Request Size Limits:**  Enforce limits on the size of incoming Thrift messages.
        *   **Resource Management:**  Implement proper resource management within the service handlers to prevent excessive consumption of CPU, memory, or other resources.
        *   **Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for Thrift operations to prevent long-running requests from tying up resources indefinitely.
