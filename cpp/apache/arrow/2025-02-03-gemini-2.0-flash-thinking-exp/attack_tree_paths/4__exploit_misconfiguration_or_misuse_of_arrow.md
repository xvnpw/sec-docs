#### 4.2.5. Real-World Examples/Scenarios (Hypothetical)

*   **Scenario 1: Deserialization RCE in Analytics Application:** An analytics application receives Arrow data streams from various data sources for processing. A malicious data source injects a crafted Arrow stream that exploits a deserialization vulnerability in the application's Arrow processing logic. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the analytics server, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or disrupting operations.

*   **Scenario 2: SQL Injection in Flight SQL Dashboard:** A web-based dashboard uses Arrow Flight SQL to query a database and display data based on user-selected filters.  The dashboard developers fail to properly sanitize user inputs used to construct SQL queries. An attacker injects malicious SQL code through a filter input field, allowing them to bypass access controls and exfiltrate sensitive data from the database.

*   **Scenario 3: DoS Attack on Data Ingestion Pipeline:** A data ingestion pipeline processes large Arrow datasets uploaded by external partners. An attacker uploads a maliciously crafted Arrow file with deeply nested structures that triggers inefficient processing logic in the pipeline. This causes the pipeline to consume excessive memory and CPU resources, leading to a denial of service and preventing legitimate data ingestion.

#### 4.2.6. Risk Assessment

*   **Likelihood:** **Medium to High**. Developer errors in API usage are common, especially with complex libraries like Apache Arrow. The "High-Risk Path" designation in the attack tree further emphasizes the elevated likelihood. The complexity of Arrow APIs and the potential for subtle misconfigurations increase the probability of misuse.
