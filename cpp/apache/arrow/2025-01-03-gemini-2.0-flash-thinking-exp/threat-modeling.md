# Threat Model Analysis for apache/arrow

## Threat: [Integer Overflow Exploitation in Array Operations](./threats/integer_overflow_exploitation_in_array_operations.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides input data that, when processed by Arrow array operations (e.g., addition, multiplication) without sufficient bounds checking, leads to an integer overflow. This can cause incorrect calculation results, potentially leading to logical errors in the application's behavior or even memory corruption if the overflowed value is used for memory access.
*   **Impact:** Application logic errors, potential data corruption, possible denial of service or even code execution if the overflow leads to memory safety issues.
*   **Affected Component:** Arrow Compute module (specifically arithmetic kernels on numeric arrays).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation to ensure data falls within expected ranges before performing arithmetic operations.
    *   Utilize Arrow's saturating arithmetic functions or perform explicit checks for potential overflows before calculations.
    *   Consider using larger integer types when dealing with potentially large values.

## Threat: [Deserialization of Maliciously Crafted Arrow IPC Messages](./threats/deserialization_of_maliciously_crafted_arrow_ipc_messages.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted Arrow IPC message to the application. This message exploits vulnerabilities in the Arrow IPC deserialization process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server or client processing the message. The attacker could manipulate metadata or data within the IPC stream to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the affected process, data exfiltration, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Arrow IPC module (specifically the deserialization routines for the IPC format).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Treat all incoming Arrow IPC data from untrusted sources as potentially malicious.
    *   Implement strict validation and sanitization of deserialized data, especially metadata.
    *   Ensure the application is using the latest version of Apache Arrow with all security patches applied.
    *   Consider using secure communication channels (e.g., TLS) for Arrow IPC to prevent message tampering.
    *   Explore sandboxing or isolating the process responsible for deserializing Arrow IPC messages.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Extension Type Implementations](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_extension_type_implementations.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides data containing a custom Arrow extension type. If the implementation of this extension type (either developed in-house or by a third party *as part of the Arrow usage*) contains vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, logic errors), the attacker can trigger these vulnerabilities by providing specific data that exploits the flaw during deserialization or processing of the extension type.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability in the extension type implementation, ranging from denial of service and data corruption to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** Arrow Extension Type API and the specific implementation of the vulnerable extension type.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet and audit any third-party extension types before using them.
    *   Apply secure coding practices when developing custom extension types, including rigorous input validation and memory safety.
    *   Implement safeguards to prevent the loading or processing of unexpected or unknown extension types.
    *   Regularly review and update custom extension type implementations.
