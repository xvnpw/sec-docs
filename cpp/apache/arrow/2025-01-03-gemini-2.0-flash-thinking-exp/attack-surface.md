# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/arrow

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption via Malicious Data](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_via_malicious_data.md)

*   **Memory Corruption via Malicious Data**
    *   Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities in Arrow's memory management or data handling logic by providing crafted or unexpected data structures.
    *   How Arrow Contributes to the Attack Surface: Arrow defines specific in-memory data layouts. Incorrect handling of size information, offsets, or data types within these layouts can lead to buffer overflows, out-of-bounds reads/writes, or other memory corruption issues when processing untrusted data.
    *   Example: An attacker sends a crafted Arrow IPC message with an invalid array length, causing the receiving application using Arrow to allocate an insufficient buffer and subsequently write beyond its boundaries.
    *   Impact: Code execution, denial-of-service, information disclosure, application crash.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Implement strict input validation on all data received from untrusted sources before processing it with Arrow. This includes validating array lengths, data types, and schema information.
        *   Keep the Arrow library updated to the latest version, as security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases.
        *   Utilize memory-safe programming practices in the application code that interacts with Arrow, such as bounds checking and careful memory management.
        *   Consider using AddressSanitizer (ASan) or MemorySanitizer (MSan) during development and testing to detect memory errors.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization of Untrusted Arrow Data](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_of_untrusted_arrow_data.md)

*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Arrow Data**
    *   Description: Exploiting vulnerabilities during the process of converting serialized Arrow data (e.g., IPC messages, Feather files) back into in-memory Arrow structures.
    *   How Arrow Contributes to the Attack Surface: Arrow provides mechanisms for serializing and deserializing data. Vulnerabilities in the deserialization logic can be exploited by providing maliciously crafted serialized data, potentially leading to code execution or other unintended consequences.
    *   Example: An attacker provides a crafted Feather file that, when read using Arrow, exploits a vulnerability in the file format parser, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   Impact: Code execution, denial-of-service, data corruption, information disclosure.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Avoid deserializing Arrow data from untrusted or unauthenticated sources.
        *   Implement strict validation of the schema and metadata of deserialized Arrow data.
        *   If possible, use signed or encrypted Arrow data to ensure integrity and authenticity.
        *   Keep the Arrow library updated to patch any deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Arrow File Format Readers/Writers](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_arrow_file_format_readerswriters.md)

*   **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Arrow File Format Readers/Writers**
    *   Description: Leveraging vulnerabilities in the code that handles reading and writing specific Arrow-supported file formats like Parquet, Feather, or others.
    *   How Arrow Contributes to the Attack Surface: Arrow provides implementations for reading and writing various columnar file formats. Bugs or vulnerabilities within these implementations can be exploited by providing malicious files.
    *   Example: An attacker provides a specially crafted Parquet file that, when opened using Arrow, triggers a buffer overflow in the Parquet reader, leading to a crash or potential code execution.
    *   Impact: Code execution, denial-of-service, data corruption, information disclosure.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Sanitize or validate files from untrusted sources before processing them with Arrow's file format readers.
        *   Keep the Arrow library updated to benefit from fixes for known vulnerabilities in file format handling.
        *   Consider using alternative, more secure methods for data exchange if file format vulnerabilities are a significant concern.
