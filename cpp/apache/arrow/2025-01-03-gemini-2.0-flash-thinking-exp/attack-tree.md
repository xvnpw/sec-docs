## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Arrow Library](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_arrow_library.md)

Attack Vector: Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical Node)
        - Description: Attackers aim to execute arbitrary code on the application server by exploiting vulnerabilities within the core Apache Arrow library. This often involves identifying memory corruption bugs (buffer overflows, integer overflows, format string bugs) in Arrow's native code or language bindings. Once identified, specially crafted Arrow data or API calls are used to trigger the vulnerability, allowing the attacker to inject and execute malicious code.
        - Risk Factors: High Impact (full system compromise), Medium Likelihood (if vulnerabilities exist), Medium to High Effort (depending on vulnerability complexity), Intermediate to Advanced Skill Level.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Arrow Bindings (Specific Language Bindings)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_arrow_bindings__specific_language_bindings_.md)

Attack Vector: Memory Corruption in Bindings (Critical Node)
        - Description: This path focuses on vulnerabilities present in the language-specific bindings of Apache Arrow (e.g., Python, Java, C++). Attackers target flaws in how these bindings interact with the core Arrow library, potentially leading to memory corruption. By exploiting these vulnerabilities through specific interactions with the bindings, attackers can achieve remote code execution or denial of service.
        - Risk Factors: High Impact, Low to Medium Likelihood (depending on binding quality), Medium to High Effort, Advanced Skill Level.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies of Arrow](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies_of_arrow.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies
        - Description: Apache Arrow relies on various third-party libraries for functionalities like compression or serialization. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies by crafting Arrow data or triggering Arrow features that utilize the vulnerable components. Successful exploitation can lead to a range of impacts, including remote code execution or denial of service.
        - Risk Factors: Impact varies (can be High), Medium Likelihood (due to common dependency vulnerabilities), Low to Medium Effort (for known vulnerabilities), Low to Intermediate Skill Level (for known vulnerabilities).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Improper Handling of Arrow Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_improper_handling_of_arrow_data.md)

Attack Vector: Vulnerable Deserialization of Arrow Data (Critical Node)
        - Description: If an application receives Arrow data from untrusted sources and deserializes it without proper validation, attackers can inject malicious payloads within the data. Exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's deserialization logic or in Arrow itself during deserialization can lead to arbitrary code execution or other harmful outcomes.
        - Risk Factors: High Impact, Medium Likelihood (if deserialization is not secured), Medium to High Effort, Intermediate to Advanced Skill Level.
    - Attack Vector: Injection Attacks via Arrow Data
        - Description: Attackers inject malicious payloads within the fields of Arrow data structures. If the application subsequently uses this data in contexts where it is interpreted as code or commands (e.g., constructing SQL queries, shell commands), it can lead to injection vulnerabilities like SQL injection or command injection, resulting in code execution or other malicious actions.
        - Risk Factors: Impact varies (can be High), Medium Likelihood (if data is not sanitized), Low to Medium Effort, Low to Intermediate Skill Level.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Features Specific to Arrow's Usage in the Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_features_specific_to_arrow's_usage_in_the_application.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting Arrow Flight (if used)
        - Description: If the application utilizes Arrow Flight for data transfer, attackers can target weaknesses in the application's implementation of Arrow Flight. This includes attempting to bypass authentication/authorization, injecting or manipulating data during transfer, or causing a denial of service by overwhelming the Flight server.
        - Risk Factors: Impact varies (can be High), Medium Likelihood (implementation flaws are common), Medium Effort, Intermediate Skill Level.
    - Attack Vector: Exploiting Arrow File Formats (Parquet, Feather, etc.)
        - Description: Applications reading or writing Arrow file formats (like Parquet or Feather) can be vulnerable to attacks involving maliciously crafted files. Attackers can provide files with corrupted metadata or data that exploit vulnerabilities in the application's file reading logic or the Arrow library's parsing of these formats. This can lead to various impacts, including code execution, data exfiltration, or resource exhaustion.
        - Risk Factors: Impact varies (can be High), Medium Likelihood (if processing untrusted files), Low to Medium Effort, Intermediate Skill Level.
