# Threat Model Analysis for apache/arrow

## Threat: [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](./threats/deserialization_of_untrusted_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious Arrow data and provides it as input to an application that deserializes it. This could involve manipulating the serialized representation to exploit vulnerabilities in the deserialization logic. The attacker might aim to trigger arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, or denial of service.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or client, leading to full system compromise. Denial of service by crashing the application. Information disclosure by exploiting memory corruption to leak sensitive data.

**Affected Component:**  Arrow's serialization/deserialization logic, specifically within language bindings like `pyarrow.ipc.read_message`, `arrow::ipc::ReadProperties`, or similar functions in other languages.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Validate the source of Arrow data: Only deserialize data from trusted sources.
*   Implement schema validation: Before deserialization, validate the schema of the incoming data against an expected schema.
*   Use secure serialization formats: If possible, consider using more secure serialization formats or adding layers of security around Arrow's serialization.
*   Keep Arrow library updated: Regularly update the Arrow library to benefit from security patches.

## Threat: [Schema Poisoning](./threats/schema_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the schema information embedded within the Arrow data stream. This could involve altering data types, field names, or metadata to cause the application to misinterpret the data. The attacker might aim to bypass validation checks, cause incorrect data processing, or trigger application errors.

**Impact:** Data corruption leading to incorrect application behavior. Denial of service by causing the application to crash due to unexpected data structures. Potential for exploitation if downstream logic relies on the poisoned schema.

**Affected Component:** Arrow's schema representation and handling within the `arrow::Schema` class and related functions in different language bindings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Validate the schema against an expected schema:  Compare the received schema with a predefined, trusted schema.
*   Enforce schema immutability:  Where possible, ensure that the schema cannot be modified after it's defined.
*   Sanitize or filter schema information:  Remove or modify potentially dangerous schema elements if necessary.

## Threat: [IPC Data Tampering/Injection](./threats/ipc_data_tamperinginjection.md)

**Description:** If an application uses Arrow's Inter-Process Communication (IPC) mechanisms (e.g., Flight RPC) without proper security, an attacker could intercept and modify Arrow data in transit or inject malicious Arrow messages. This could lead to the receiving process operating on tampered data or executing unintended actions.

**Impact:** Data corruption, leading to incorrect application state or behavior. Unauthorized actions performed by the receiving process. Potential for remote code execution if injected messages exploit vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Arrow's IPC modules, such as `arrow::flight` and related classes and functions in different language bindings (e.g., `pyarrow.flight`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use secure communication channels: Implement TLS/SSL encryption for all IPC communication.
*   Implement authentication and authorization: Verify the identity of communicating processes and control access to IPC endpoints.
*   Validate data received over IPC:  Treat data received over IPC as potentially untrusted and validate its integrity and schema.

## Threat: [Unauthorized IPC Access](./threats/unauthorized_ipc_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Arrow IPC endpoints (e.g., Flight servers) without proper authentication. This allows them to send arbitrary requests, potentially reading sensitive data or triggering actions they are not authorized to perform.

**Impact:** Information disclosure by accessing sensitive data served via IPC. Unauthorized modification of data or system state. Denial of service by overwhelming the IPC endpoint with requests.

**Affected Component:** Arrow's IPC modules, such as `arrow::flight` and related classes and functions in different language bindings (e.g., `pyarrow.flight.FlightServer`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms: Use methods like mutual TLS, API keys, or OAuth 2.0 to verify the identity of clients connecting to IPC endpoints.
*   Implement authorization controls: Define and enforce access policies to restrict which clients can access specific resources or perform certain actions.
*   Secure IPC endpoint configuration: Ensure that IPC endpoints are not publicly accessible without proper authentication.

## Threat: [Language Binding Memory Corruption](./threats/language_binding_memory_corruption.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in specific language bindings for Arrow (e.g., pyarrow, arrow-rs) could lead to memory corruption issues when handling Arrow data. An attacker might craft specific Arrow data or trigger certain operations that exploit these vulnerabilities, leading to crashes or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Impact:** Denial of service due to application crashes. Potential for arbitrary code execution if memory corruption can be controlled.

**Affected Component:** Specific language bindings for Arrow (e.g., `pyarrow`, `arrow-rs`, `arrow-cpp` JNI bindings).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep language bindings updated: Regularly update the Arrow language bindings to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Follow secure coding practices: Be mindful of memory management and potential vulnerabilities when using the Arrow bindings.
*   Utilize memory safety features: If the language provides memory safety features, leverage them when working with Arrow data.
