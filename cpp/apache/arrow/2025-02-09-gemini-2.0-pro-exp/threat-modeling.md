# Threat Model Analysis for apache/arrow

## Threat: [Malicious Arrow Data Injection (Spoofing)](./threats/malicious_arrow_data_injection__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious Arrow IPC stream or file that impersonates a legitimate data source. They forge metadata, schema information, or the data itself, creating a file that appears valid but contains manipulated data, or injecting a malicious stream into an Arrow Flight RPC connection.
    *   **Impact:** The application processes fabricated data, leading to incorrect results, corrupted data stores, potentially triggering vulnerabilities in downstream systems, or enabling other attacks. The application might make incorrect decisions based on the false data.
    *   **Affected Arrow Component:** Arrow IPC (Inter-Process Communication) format (streaming and file formats), Arrow Flight (RPC framework), potentially any component that reads Arrow data from external sources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on data sensitivity and application role).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Authenticate data sources using strong cryptographic methods (e.g., mutual TLS with client certificates for Arrow Flight).
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Sign Arrow data (batches or entire files) using a trusted key. Verify signatures before processing. This could involve signing the Arrow metadata or using a separate signature mechanism.
        *   **Data Provenance Tracking:** Implement a system to track the origin and lineage of Arrow data, potentially using Arrow metadata.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Rigorously validate the schema of incoming Arrow data against a predefined, trusted schema. Reject non-conforming data.

## Threat: [Arrow Data Tampering in Transit](./threats/arrow_data_tampering_in_transit.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts an Arrow IPC stream or modifies an Arrow file in transit (e.g., on a network, during transfer). They alter data values, insert/delete records, or modify the schema.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect results, data corruption, and potential downstream vulnerabilities. Data integrity is compromised.
    *   **Affected Arrow Component:** Arrow IPC (streaming and file formats), Arrow Flight, any component transmitting or receiving Arrow data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Transport Layer Security (TLS):** Use TLS for all Arrow data transmission (especially Arrow Flight). *Note: TLS protects the channel, not the data itself.*
        *   **Data Integrity Checks:** Calculate and verify checksums or cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256) for Arrow data batches/files. Store checksums separately or in Arrow metadata. Reject data with mismatched checksums.
        *   **End-to-End Encryption:** If TLS termination occurs before the Arrow processing component, consider end-to-end encryption of the Arrow data.

## Threat: [Dictionary Encoding DoS Attack](./threats/dictionary_encoding_dos_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts an Arrow IPC message/file with a maliciously constructed dictionary encoding: a very large dictionary, many duplicate entries, or one designed for worst-case decoding performance.
    *   **Impact:** Excessive memory consumption or CPU usage during decoding, leading to denial of service. The application may become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Affected Arrow Component:** `arrow::ipc::RecordBatchReader`, `arrow::ipc::RecordBatchFileReader`, `arrow::ipc::RecordBatchStreamReader`, specifically the dictionary decoding logic. Also potentially affects compute functions on dictionary-encoded data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Limit the maximum size of dictionaries in incoming Arrow data. Reject data with excessively large dictionaries.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set memory and CPU time limits for Arrow decoding operations.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Perform fuzz testing on Arrow dictionary decoding components.
        *   **Code Auditing:** Review dictionary decoding code for performance bottlenecks or vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Large Allocation DoS Attack](./threats/large_allocation_dos_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends Arrow data with extremely large arrays (e.g., a string array with billions of empty strings, or a very large numeric array) or deeply nested list/struct arrays.
    *   **Impact:** The application attempts massive memory allocation, leading to memory exhaustion and denial of service (crash or unresponsiveness).
    *   **Affected Arrow Component:** `arrow::MemoryPool`, array builders (e.g., `arrow::StringBuilder`, `arrow::Int64Builder`), any component allocating memory for Arrow arrays.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Enforce strict limits on the maximum size and nesting depth of arrays in incoming Arrow data. Reject exceeding data.
        *   **Memory Limits:** Set overall memory limits for the application and individual Arrow operations.
        *   **Streaming Processing:** Where possible, process Arrow data in a streaming fashion (using `RecordBatchReader`) instead of loading everything at once.

## Threat: [Zero-Copy Misuse Leading to Data Corruption or DoS](./threats/zero-copy_misuse_leading_to_data_corruption_or_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits improper use of Arrow's zero-copy features (e.g., sharing memory between processes without proper synchronization or lifetime management). This could involve concurrent modification/reading, or accessing freed memory.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, application crashes, potential denial of service.
    *   **Affected Arrow Component:** Components using zero-copy sharing (e.g., `arrow::ipc::RecordBatchReader` with shared memory, custom implementations using `arrow::Buffer` and shared memory).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Synchronization:** Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, semaphores) when sharing Arrow data.
        *   **Careful Lifetime Management:** Ensure shared memory regions aren't freed while in use. Use reference counting or other techniques.
        *   **Avoid Unnecessary Sharing:** Only use zero-copy sharing when the performance benefits outweigh the risks. Consider copying if it simplifies code and reduces risk.
        *   **Documentation and Training:** Ensure developers understand the correct and safe use of Arrow's zero-copy features.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Arrow C++ Implementation (Buffer Overflow)](./threats/vulnerability_in_arrow_c++_implementation__buffer_overflow_.md)

*   **Description:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a specific version of the Arrow C++ library (e.g., in a compute kernel or IPC handling). An attacker crafts malicious input to trigger it.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution, giving the attacker control of the application or system.
    *   **Affected Arrow Component:** Specific vulnerable component within the Arrow C++ library (any module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update Arrow:** Keep the Arrow library up to date with the latest security patches. Monitor security advisories.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Arrow and its dependencies.
        *   **Memory Safety:** If developing custom Arrow extensions in C++, use memory safety techniques (smart pointers, bounds checking) to prevent overflows.
