# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a high-performance, cross-language, and cross-platform data layer for in-memory analytics.
*   Enable efficient data interchange between different systems and programming languages.
*   Minimize data serialization and deserialization overhead.
*   Support a wide range of data types and analytical operations.
*   Foster a collaborative open-source community.
*   Maintain compatibility with various hardware architectures.
*   Provide language bindings for many popular programming languages.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data corruption or loss due to software bugs or vulnerabilities.
*   Performance degradation impacting the usability of analytical systems.
*   Incompatibility with key systems or languages, limiting adoption.
*   Security vulnerabilities leading to unauthorized data access or modification.
*   Lack of community engagement hindering long-term development.
*   Failure to keep up with evolving hardware and software landscapes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews (mentioned throughout the repository and contribution guidelines).
*   security control: Static analysis (integrated into CI pipelines, as seen in various build scripts).
*   security control: Fuzz testing (mentioned in documentation and test suites).
*   security control: Use of memory-safe languages like Rust for critical components (evident in the codebase).
*   security control: Continuous integration (CI) pipelines (GitHub Actions, Travis CI, etc., are extensively used).
*   security control: Community vulnerability reporting process (implied by the open-source nature and security guidelines).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries (inherent in any large project, mitigated by careful selection and updates).
*   accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities (inherent in any software, mitigated by ongoing security efforts).
*   accepted risk: Performance trade-offs for certain security features (a common consideration in high-performance systems).

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management system to track all dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing by independent security experts.
*   security control: Establish a formal security vulnerability disclosure program with clear guidelines and response procedures.
*   security control: Integrate dynamic analysis tools (e.g., sanitizers) into the CI pipeline.
*   security control: Implement regular security training for developers.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the core Arrow library, as it primarily deals with data representation and transport. Authentication is typically handled by the systems using Arrow.
*   Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is typically handled by the systems using Arrow. However, Arrow could potentially support metadata for carrying authorization tokens or policies.
*   Input Validation: Crucial for preventing data corruption and vulnerabilities. Arrow should rigorously validate data against its schema and reject invalid or malformed data. This is partially addressed by existing fuzzing and testing, but should be a continuous focus.
*   Cryptography: Arrow supports encrypted data transport through integration with libraries like OpenSSL.  It should ensure that cryptographic operations are performed correctly and securely, using well-vetted libraries and algorithms.  Specific areas to consider:
    *   Data at rest encryption: If Arrow data is stored, consider encryption options.
    *   Data in transit encryption: Ensure secure communication channels when Arrow data is transmitted.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   **Data Processing Pipeline:** Ensuring the integrity and reliability of data processing pipelines that rely on Arrow.
*   **Data Interchange:** Protecting the secure and efficient exchange of data between different systems using Arrow.
