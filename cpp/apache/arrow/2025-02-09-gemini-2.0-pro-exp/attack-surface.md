## Attack Surface: [1. Deserialization of Untrusted Arrow Data](./attack_surfaces/1__deserialization_of_untrusted_arrow_data.md)

*   **1. Deserialization of Untrusted Arrow Data**

    *   **Description:**  Processing Arrow data (IPC, Flight, or file formats) from an untrusted source without proper validation. This is the most significant direct risk.
    *   **How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow's serialization format is complex and performance-optimized.  This complexity, combined with potential implementation bugs, makes it susceptible to crafted malicious inputs that can exploit vulnerabilities during deserialization.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted Arrow IPC message with a malicious schema designed to cause excessive memory allocation (DoS).  A more severe example is a crafted message with invalid offsets or lengths that triggers a buffer overflow or out-of-bounds read/write during deserialization, potentially leading to RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible) or High (for DoS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Schema Whitelisting:** *Only* accept data conforming to a predefined, rigorously vetted set of schemas. Reject any unknown or overly complex schemas. This is the most important mitigation.
        *   **Comprehensive Input Validation:** Perform thorough validation of *both* the schema and the data against that schema.  Verify lengths, offsets, data types, and nested structure depths.  Don't assume any input is valid.
        *   **Hardened Resource Limits:** Enforce strict, non-negotiable limits on memory allocation, batch sizes, and the complexity of nested data structures.
        *   **Extensive Fuzz Testing:** Continuously fuzz test Arrow's deserialization routines with a wide range of malformed and edge-case inputs.
        *   **Memory-Safe Language Usage:** Prioritize the use of memory-safe languages (e.g., Rust) for the core deserialization logic to prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [2. Unsafe Extension Type Handling](./attack_surfaces/2__unsafe_extension_type_handling.md)

*   **2. Unsafe Extension Type Handling**

    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from insecurely implemented or improperly used Arrow extension types.
    *   **How Arrow Contributes:** Arrow's extensibility mechanism allows users to define custom data types and associated logic (serialization, deserialization, computation). This flexibility directly introduces a risk if extensions are not developed and used with extreme care.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides data that uses a custom extension type. This extension type has a vulnerability in its deserialization logic, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code (RCE). Another example is an extension that leaks sensitive information during its processing.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible) or High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Extension Whitelisting:** *Only* allow a predefined, thoroughly vetted set of extension types to be loaded and used.  This is crucial.
        *   **Mandatory Secure Coding Practices:** Enforce rigorous secure coding practices when developing extension types, with a particular focus on secure deserialization and preventing any form of untrusted code execution.
        *   **Mandatory Sandboxing:** If an extension type *must* execute user-provided code (highly discouraged), run it in a strictly sandboxed environment with severely restricted privileges.
        *   **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Require thorough, independent code reviews of *all* extension type implementations before deployment or use.

## Attack Surface: [3. Algorithmic Complexity Attacks on Compute Kernels](./attack_surfaces/3__algorithmic_complexity_attacks_on_compute_kernels.md)

*   **3. Algorithmic Complexity Attacks on Compute Kernels**
    *   **Description:** Exploiting worst-case performance scenarios of Arrow's compute kernels (sorting, filtering, aggregation, etc.) with crafted input.
    *   **How Arrow Contributes:** While Arrow kernels are optimized, some may have algorithmic weaknesses that can be triggered by specific input patterns. This is a direct consequence of Arrow's computational capabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides input to a sorting kernel that forces it into its worst-case O(n^2) behavior, consuming excessive CPU and causing a DoS. Another example is crafting input to trigger excessive hash collisions in a hash-based aggregation.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Data Profiling and Limits:** Analyze expected input data characteristics. Set limits on data size and complexity that could trigger worst-case scenarios.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Throttling:** Continuously monitor CPU and memory usage of kernels. Terminate or throttle operations exceeding predefined limits.
        *   **Kernel Auditing:** Regularly audit kernel implementations for potential algorithmic complexity vulnerabilities, especially for operations with known worst-case scenarios.
        *   **Input Sanitization (where feasible):** If possible, pre-process or sanitize input to mitigate known worst-case triggers (e.g., limiting unique values).
        * **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which data can be processed by specific kernels.
