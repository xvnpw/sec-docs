# Threat Model Analysis for ossrs/srs

## Threat: [RTMP Stream Spoofing](./threats/rtmp_stream_spoofing.md)

*   **Threat:** RTMP Stream Spoofing
    *   **Description:** An attacker could impersonate a legitimate RTMP publisher and send fabricated or malicious streams directly to the SRS server. This exploits the lack of robust authentication at the RTMP protocol level within SRS.
    *   **Impact:** Subscribers could receive misleading, inappropriate, or harmful content. This could damage the reputation of the service, spread misinformation, or even deliver malicious payloads if the client application is vulnerable.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** RTMP Ingest (specifically the handshake and stream publishing logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for RTMP publishers *external to SRS*. SRS itself has limited built-in authentication for RTMP. This often involves a separate authentication service that publishers must interact with before connecting to SRS.
        *   Consider using secure protocols like RTMPS (RTMP over TLS) to encrypt the communication channel and prevent eavesdropping or tampering. While this doesn't prevent spoofing, it protects the content in transit.
        *   Implement stream signing or watermarking techniques *at the application level* to verify the origin and integrity of the stream after it's ingested by SRS.
        *   Monitor publishing activity for suspicious patterns or unauthorized sources *using external monitoring tools or application logic*.

## Threat: [WebRTC Identity Spoofing](./threats/webrtc_identity_spoofing.md)

*   **Threat:** WebRTC Identity Spoofing
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the WebRTC signaling process to impersonate a legitimate peer *before* the connection is established through SRS. This exploits vulnerabilities in the signaling mechanism used in conjunction with SRS, not necessarily within SRS's core media handling.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to private streams or communication channels managed by SRS. Potential for data breaches, privacy violations, or disruption of real-time interactions.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** WebRTC Media Channels (the vulnerability lies in the signaling process *leading up to* the SRS media connection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for WebRTC peers *at the signaling server level*, before they interact with SRS.
        *   Use secure signaling protocols (e.g., over HTTPS with proper authentication) for the signaling server.
        *   Verify peer identities during the signaling process *before allowing media negotiation with SRS*.
        *   Consider using a trusted signaling server and secure session management *external to SRS*.

## Threat: [SRS API Spoofing and Abuse](./threats/srs_api_spoofing_and_abuse.md)

*   **Threat:** SRS API Spoofing and Abuse
    *   **Description:** If the SRS HTTP API is exposed without proper authentication and authorization, an attacker could send malicious requests directly to SRS to control the server's behavior. This is a direct vulnerability within the SRS control plane.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the SRS server, leading to service disruption, data breaches (e.g., access to stream metadata or configurations), or the ability to manipulate streams and configurations.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** HTTP API (all endpoints related to management and control).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all SRS API endpoints. Use API keys, OAuth 2.0, or other secure authentication methods *configured within SRS or an external authentication proxy*.
        *   Restrict access to the API to authorized users or services only *using firewall rules or access control lists*.
        *   Rate-limit API requests *using SRS's built-in rate limiting features or an external proxy* to prevent brute-force attacks or denial-of-service attempts.
        *   Regularly audit API access logs *generated by SRS or an external logging system* for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [SRS Configuration Tampering](./threats/srs_configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** SRS Configuration Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the SRS configuration files (e.g., `srs.conf`) could directly modify settings within SRS to disrupt service, redirect streams managed by SRS, expose sensitive information handled by SRS, or introduce malicious configurations affecting SRS's behavior.
    *   **Impact:** Service outage of the SRS server, redirection of streams to malicious destinations controlled by SRS, exposure of credentials or internal network information used by SRS, and potential for further exploitation of the SRS instance.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** Configuration Loading and Management within SRS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the SRS configuration files with appropriate file system permissions, restricting access to only the necessary user accounts *on the server hosting SRS*.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the configuration files. Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions *that SRS can access*.
        *   Implement monitoring for changes to the configuration files *on the server hosting SRS* and alert on unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Exploiting SRS Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_srs_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting SRS Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities within the SRS codebase itself could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access *to the SRS server*, execute arbitrary code *on the SRS server*, or cause denial of service *of the SRS service*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the SRS server, data breaches related to SRS managed data, service disruption of SRS, and potential for further exploitation of connected systems *through the compromised SRS instance*.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** Potentially any part of the SRS codebase depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the SRS server updated to the latest stable version, which includes security patches *provided by the SRS project*.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to SRS *to be informed of known vulnerabilities*.
        *   Implement a vulnerability management process to identify and address potential weaknesses *in the deployed SRS instance*.
        *   Consider using static and dynamic code analysis tools *on the SRS codebase itself* to identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via RTMP Ingest Overload](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_rtmp_ingest_overload.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via RTMP Ingest Overload
    *   **Description:** An attacker could flood the SRS server directly with a large number of connection requests or invalid RTMP streams, overwhelming its resources and preventing legitimate publishers from connecting to SRS. This directly targets SRS's ability to handle incoming RTMP streams.
    *   **Impact:** Inability for legitimate publishers to stream content through SRS, leading to service disruption.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** RTMP Ingest (connection handling and stream processing within SRS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement connection limits and rate limiting for RTMP ingest *using SRS's built-in features or an external load balancer*.
        *   Use firewalls or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to filter malicious traffic *before it reaches the SRS server*.
        *   Monitor server resource usage *of the SRS server* and implement alerts for unusual activity.
        *   Consider using a CDN with DDoS protection capabilities *in front of the SRS server*.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via HLS/HTTP-FLV Request Flood](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_hlshttp-flv_request_flood.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via HLS/HTTP-FLV Request Flood
    *   **Description:** An attacker could generate a large number of requests directly to the SRS server for HLS/HTTP-FLV segments, overwhelming its bandwidth and processing capacity, making the streams served by SRS unavailable to legitimate viewers.
    *   **Impact:** Inability for viewers to access streams served by SRS, leading to service disruption.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** HLS/HTTP-FLV Delivery (request handling within SRS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting for HLS/HTTP-FLV requests *using SRS's built-in features or an external proxy*.
        *   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute the load and provide caching *in front of the SRS server*.
        *   Implement caching mechanisms on the SRS server itself.
        *   Use firewalls or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to filter malicious traffic *before it reaches the SRS server*.
