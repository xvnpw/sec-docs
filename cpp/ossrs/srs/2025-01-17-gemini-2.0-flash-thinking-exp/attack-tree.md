## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malformed RTMP Packets (L: Medium, I: High, E: Medium, S: Intermediate, DD: Medium) **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/send_malformed_rtmp_packets__l_medium__i_high__e_medium__s_intermediate__dd_medium___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts and sends RTMP packets with unexpected or invalid data structures, sizes, or types.
**Potential Impact:** This can trigger parsing errors, unexpected behavior, or even crashes within the SRS RTMP handling logic. In some cases, it could lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflows in RTMP Handling (L: Medium, I: Critical, E: High, S: Advanced, DD: Low) **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflows_in_rtmp_handling__l_medium__i_critical__e_high__s_advanced__dd_low___critic_e606d44d.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends RTMP packets with data exceeding the allocated buffer size in SRS's memory.
**Potential Impact:** This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially leading to crashes, denial of service, or, in the worst case, arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerabilities in FFmpeg (or other used library) (L: Medium, I: High, E: Medium, S: Intermediate, DD: Low) **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerabilities_in_ffmpeg__or_other_used_library___l_medium__i_high__e_medium__s_intermediat_b826365b.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker publishes a stream that, when processed by the SRS transcoding engine (which often uses FFmpeg), triggers a known vulnerability within the FFmpeg library itself.
**Potential Impact:** This can range from crashes and denial of service to remote code execution on the server, depending on the specific vulnerability in FFmpeg.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Malicious Input Streams to Exploit Transcoding Bugs (L: Medium, I: Critical, E: High, S: Advanced, DD: Low) **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/craft_malicious_input_streams_to_exploit_transcoding_bugs__l_medium__i_critical__e_high__s_advanced__6309f6ae.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker creates a video or audio stream with specific characteristics designed to exploit weaknesses or bugs in the SRS transcoding logic or the underlying libraries. This might involve malformed headers, unexpected codec combinations, or other carefully crafted elements.
**Potential Impact:** Similar to exploiting FFmpeg vulnerabilities, this can lead to crashes, denial of service, or remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attempt Authentication Bypass on SRS API (L: Medium, I: High, E: Low, S: Beginner, DD: Medium) **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/attempt_authentication_bypass_on_srs_api__l_medium__i_high__e_low__s_beginner__dd_medium___high-risk_d6dbf3f8.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker tries to circumvent the authentication mechanisms protecting the SRS API. This could involve exploiting default credentials, using known vulnerabilities in the authentication process, or employing brute-force or credential stuffing techniques.
**Potential Impact:** Successful bypass allows the attacker to access and manipulate the SRS server configuration, potentially disrupting service, redirecting streams, or gaining access to sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Endpoints with Insufficient Input Validation (L: Medium, I: High, E: Medium, S: Intermediate, DD: Medium) **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_endpoints_with_insufficient_input_validation__l_medium__i_high__e_medium__s_intermediate_2296c436.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker sends malicious input to API endpoints that lack proper validation and sanitization. This could include injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection if the API interacts with a database), path traversal attempts, or other forms of malicious data.
**Potential Impact:** This can lead to various outcomes, including unauthorized data access, modification of server settings, or even execution of arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Configuration Files (L: Low, I: High, E: Medium, S: Intermediate, DD: Low) **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_configuration_files__l_low__i_high__e_medium__s_intermediate__dd_low___c_cad54eda.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker finds a way to access the SRS configuration files directly. This could be due to insecure file permissions, vulnerabilities in the web server hosting the files (if applicable), or through exploiting other vulnerabilities on the server.
**Potential Impact:** Access to configuration files allows the attacker to view sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, and server settings. They can also modify these files to alter the server's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Configuration Directives (L: Low, I: Critical, E: Medium, S: Intermediate, DD: Low) **[CRITICAL NODE]**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration_directives__l_low__i_critical__e_medium__s_intermediate__dd_low___cri_8ffe7853.md)

**Attack Vector:** Once an attacker has access to the configuration files, they can insert malicious directives or modify existing ones.
**Potential Impact:** This can have a wide range of critical impacts, including redirecting streams to malicious destinations, disabling security features, creating backdoors, or even gaining command execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities (L: Medium, I: Critical, E: Low, S: Beginner, DD: High) **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_publicly_disclosed_vulnerabilities__l_medium__i_critical__e_low__s_beginner__dd_high___crit_c7b004a5.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in specific versions of SRS that have been publicly disclosed and for which patches might be available but not yet applied.
**Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but it can range from denial of service and information disclosure to remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by SRS (L: Medium, I: Critical, E: Medium, S: Intermediate, DD: Low) **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_used_by_srs__l_medium__i_critical__e_medium__s_intermediate__dd_0a8dffe3.md)

**Attack Vector:** SRS relies on various third-party libraries. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these libraries.
**Potential Impact:** Similar to exploiting vulnerabilities in SRS itself, this can lead to various levels of compromise, including denial of service, information disclosure, or remote code execution.
