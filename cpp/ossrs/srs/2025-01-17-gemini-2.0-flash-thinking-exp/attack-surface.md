# Attack Surface Analysis for ossrs/srs

## Attack Surface: [Default Credentials for HTTP API/Web UI](./attack_surfaces/default_credentials_for_http_apiweb_ui.md)

*   **Description:** SRS, by default, may have easily guessable or well-known credentials for its administrative interfaces (HTTP API or Web UI).
    *   **How SRS Contributes:** SRS provides these interfaces for management and monitoring, and if default credentials are not changed, they become a direct entry point.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses "admin/12345" (a common default) to log into the SRS Web UI and gains full control.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the SRS instance, allowing manipulation of streams, configuration changes, and potentially access to the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change default credentials upon installation and use strong, unique passwords.
        *   Consider disabling the Web UI if it's not required.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication if supported by SRS or through reverse proxy solutions.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured HTTP API Access](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_http_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** The SRS HTTP API, used for management and control, might be accessible without proper authentication or authorization.
    *   **How SRS Contributes:** SRS exposes this API for external interaction, and if not secured, it allows unauthorized access to its functionalities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends API requests to create new streams or modify server settings without providing valid credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized control over SRS, potentially leading to service disruption, data manipulation, or unauthorized access to streams.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the HTTP API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Enforce authorization checks to ensure only authorized users can perform specific actions.
        *   Restrict access to the API based on IP address or network segments if possible.
        *   Use HTTPS (TLS/SSL) to encrypt communication with the API.

## Attack Surface: [Lack of TLS/SSL for Media Streams and Management Interfaces](./attack_surfaces/lack_of_tlsssl_for_media_streams_and_management_interfaces.md)

*   **Description:** Communication with the SRS server, including media streams (RTMP, WebRTC, HLS) and management interfaces, is not encrypted using TLS/SSL.
    *   **How SRS Contributes:** SRS handles these communication protocols, and if TLS/SSL is not configured, data is transmitted in plaintext.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts RTMP traffic and eavesdrops on the media stream or captures API keys being transmitted.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, including media content, API keys, and potentially user credentials. Man-in-the-middle attacks become possible.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable and properly configure TLS/SSL for all relevant SRS ports and protocols.
        *   Force HTTPS for the Web UI and HTTP API.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management and renewal.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Media Processing Libraries (e.g., FFmpeg)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_media_processing_libraries__e_g___ffmpeg_.md)

*   **Description:** SRS relies on external libraries like FFmpeg for media encoding and decoding. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be exploited through SRS.
    *   **How SRS Contributes:** SRS integrates and utilizes these libraries to process media streams, making it susceptible to their vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted RTMP stream exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in FFmpeg, leading to a crash or remote code execution on the SRS server.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, remote code execution on the server hosting SRS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep SRS and all its dependencies, including FFmpeg, updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in used libraries.
        *   Consider using a containerized environment to isolate SRS and its dependencies.
