## 4. Detailed Design

### 4.1. Components

*   **Core Server ('```main```'):**
    *   **Responsibility:** The central control unit of SRS. It manages the lifecycle of streams, client sessions, and the overall server operation. It handles stream routing between different handlers and enforces server-level configurations.
    *   **Inputs:** Incoming connections from protocol handlers, configuration settings from the Configuration Manager, API requests from the HTTP API Handler.
    *   **Outputs:** Stream data to protocol handlers, commands to other components, log messages to the Logging System, metrics to the Statistics Collector.
    *   **Dependencies:** Configuration Manager, Logging System, Statistics Collector, all protocol handlers.

*   **RTMP Handler:**
    *   **Responsibility:** Manages RTMP client connections for both publishing (encoders) and subscribing (players). It handles the RTMP handshake, message parsing, and stream multiplexing/demultiplexing.
    *   **Inputs:** RTMP control messages and media packets from publishers and players.
    *   **Outputs:** Raw audio/video stream data to the Core Server, RTMP messages to players.
    *   **Dependencies:** Core Server.

*   **HLS Handler:**
    *   **Responsibility:**  Generates and serves HLS manifests (.m3u8 playlists) and media segments (.ts files) to clients. It segments the live stream into smaller chunks for HTTP-based delivery.
    *   **Inputs:** Raw stream data from the Core Server.
    *   **Outputs:** HLS manifests and media segments served over HTTP.
    *   **Dependencies:** Core Server, HTTP server functionality within SRS.

### 4.3. Component Interactions

*   **Client Connection Handling:** When a client connects, the appropriate protocol handler takes over, managing the initial handshake and protocol-specific communication.
*   **Stream Registration and Routing:** Protocol handlers register new published streams with the Core Server. The Core Server then manages the routing of this stream data to other interested handlers or subscribers.
*   **Configuration Retrieval:** Components retrieve their configuration parameters from the Configuration Manager during initialization or when configuration changes occur.
*   **API Command Execution:** The HTTP API Handler translates API requests into commands that are executed by the Core Server, which then orchestrates the necessary actions.
*   **Logging and Monitoring Data Flow:** Components generate log messages and metrics, which are then sent to the Logging System and Statistics Collector, respectively.

## 5. Security Considerations (Detailed)

This section expands on the initial security considerations, providing more specific potential threats and areas of concern for threat modeling.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized publishing of streams, unauthorized viewing of private streams, account hijacking.
    *   **Considerations:** How are publishers authenticated (e.g., username/password, tokens)? How is authorization enforced to control who can publish or subscribe to specific streams? Are there mechanisms to prevent replay attacks on authentication credentials?
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Threats:** Buffer overflows, command injection, cross-site scripting (if web interfaces are involved).
    *   **Considerations:** How rigorously does each handler validate incoming data (e.g., RTMP commands, SDP messages, HTTP API requests)? Are there proper checks for data types, lengths, and formats?
*   **Secure Communication:**
    *   **Threats:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive data.
    *   **Considerations:** Is communication between clients and the server encrypted using protocols like RTMPS (RTMP over TLS), HTTPS for HLS and HTTP-FLV, and DTLS for WebRTC? Are secure ciphers used? How are TLS certificates managed?
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Threats:** Server overload, resource exhaustion.
    *   **Considerations:** How does SRS handle a large number of concurrent connections or malicious traffic? Are there rate limiting mechanisms in place for different protocols and the API? How are resources like memory and network bandwidth managed under stress?
*   **Configuration Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Exposure of sensitive credentials (e.g., API keys, database passwords), unauthorized modification of server settings.
    *   **Considerations:** How is the `srs.conf` file protected? Are there options for encrypting sensitive data within the configuration? Are there access controls on the configuration file?
*   **WebRTC Security:**
    *   **Threats:** ICE candidate leaks, SDP manipulation, unauthorized access to media streams.
    *   **Considerations:** How are ICE candidates securely exchanged and validated? Is signaling traffic encrypted? Are there mechanisms to prevent unauthorized peers from joining WebRTC sessions?
*   **HTTP API Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions, data breaches through API endpoints.
    *   **Considerations:** Is the HTTP API protected by authentication and authorization? Are there measures to prevent common web application vulnerabilities like SQL injection or cross-site request forgery (CSRF)?
*   **Logging Security:**
    *   **Threats:** Information leakage through overly verbose logs, tampering with log files.
    *   **Considerations:** What information is logged? Are sensitive data redacted from logs? Are log files protected from unauthorized access and modification?

## 6. Deployment Considerations

Secure deployment of SRS requires careful consideration of the environment and potential threats.

*   **Network Segmentation:** Deploy SRS within a segmented network to limit the impact of a potential breach.
*   **Firewall Configuration:** Configure firewalls to allow only necessary traffic to and from the SRS server, restricting access to specific ports for each protocol.
*   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Implement ACLs to control which clients or networks can connect to the SRS server.
*   **Secure Configuration Management:** Store and manage the `srs.conf` file securely, limiting access and potentially encrypting sensitive information.
*   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep the SRS software and the underlying operating system updated with the latest security patches.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring systems to detect suspicious activity and alert administrators to potential security incidents.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the SRS process with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a compromise.

## 7. Future Considerations

*   **Advanced Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:** Implementing more sophisticated authentication methods like OAuth 2.0 and fine-grained authorization policies.
*   **Enhanced Transcoding Capabilities:** Integrating with more powerful transcoding libraries for better format adaptation and bitrate control.
*   **Clustering and High Availability:** Designing for horizontal scalability and redundancy to ensure continuous service availability.
*   **Integration with Content Delivery Networks (CDNs):**  Improving integration with CDNs for efficient distribution of streams to a large audience.
*   **Improved Monitoring and Observability:**  Adding more detailed metrics and tracing capabilities for better insights into server performance and potential issues.

This enhanced design document provides a more detailed and comprehensive understanding of the SRS architecture, crucial for conducting thorough threat modeling and implementing robust security measures.
