## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Ingest Functionality:**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_ingest_functionality.md)

*   **Malicious Stream Injection:** Attackers aim to insert harmful content into the live streams.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit RTMP Ingest:** Focuses on vulnerabilities in how SRS handles RTMP streams.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Stream Hijacking/Spoofing:** Attackers impersonate legitimate publishers to inject malicious content or take over existing streams. This often exploits weak or missing authentication mechanisms.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Resource Exhaustion (Ingest):** Overwhelming the SRS server with ingest traffic to cause denial of service.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Send Excessive Streams:**  Attackers initiate a large number of concurrent streams to exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, network).
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Send High Bitrate Streams:** Attackers push streams with extremely high bitrates, consuming network bandwidth and processing power.
        *   **Exploit Protocol-Specific Weaknesses for DoS:** Leveraging specific vulnerabilities in the RTMP, WebRTC, or other ingest protocol implementations to cause crashes or resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Egress/Delivery Functionality:**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_egressdelivery_functionality.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Unauthorized Stream Access:** Gaining access to streams without proper authorization.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Weak or Missing Authentication:** Exploiting the absence or weakness of authentication mechanisms for viewers, allowing unauthorized access to stream content.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Resource Exhaustion (Egress):** Overwhelming the SRS server with viewer requests to cause denial of service for legitimate viewers.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Excessive Viewer Requests:** Attackers simulate a large number of viewers requesting streams, overwhelming server resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Control Plane (HTTP API):**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_control_plane__http_api_.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Authentication and Authorization Bypass:** Gaining unauthorized access to the SRS control panel and its functionalities.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Default Credentials:** Exploiting the failure to change default usernames and passwords for the SRS administrative interface.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerabilities in API Implementation:** Exploiting software flaws in the SRS HTTP API.
            *   **SQL Injection (if database is used for control):** Injecting malicious SQL code into API requests to manipulate or extract data from the control panel database.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Command Injection:** Injecting malicious commands into API requests that are then executed by the server operating system.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Lack of Input Validation:** Exploiting insufficient validation of user-supplied input to the control plane.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Manipulating Configuration:**  Using API endpoints to modify SRS configuration settings in a malicious way, potentially disabling security features or creating backdoors.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Server Environment Running SRS:**](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_server_environment_running_srs.md)

*   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Vulnerabilities in Underlying Operating System:** Exploiting known security flaws in the operating system where SRS is installed.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:** Exploiting known security flaws in third-party libraries and software components used by SRS.
    *   **Misconfiguration of Server:**
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Weak Firewall Rules:** Exploiting overly permissive firewall configurations that allow unauthorized network access to the SRS server and its services.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Exploit Specific SRS Features/Plugins:**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_specific_srs_featuresplugins.md)

*   **[CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerabilities in Specific SRS Modules:** Exploiting security vulnerabilities within specific features or plugins of SRS, such as transcoding modules, edge server functionalities, or custom plugins.
