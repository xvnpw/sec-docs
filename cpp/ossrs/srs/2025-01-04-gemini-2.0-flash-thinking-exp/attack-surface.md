# Attack Surface Analysis for ossrs/srs

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized RTMP Stream Publishing](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_rtmp_stream_publishing.md)

**Description:** Attackers gain the ability to publish streams to the SRS server without proper authorization.

**How SRS Contributes:** SRS, by default, listens for RTMP connections on a specific port (typically 1935). If not properly secured, this port is open for anyone to attempt publishing.

**Example:** An attacker uses a standard RTMP client to connect to the SRS server and starts pushing a malicious or unwanted video stream.

**Impact:** Resource exhaustion on the server (bandwidth, CPU), disruption of legitimate streaming services, potential injection of inappropriate content, reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement Stream Keys: Configure SRS to require a specific key for publishing streams. Only clients with the correct key can publish.
* Use HTTP Authentication for RTMP Publishing: Configure SRS to authenticate publishing requests via HTTP callbacks to your application's backend.
* Restrict Access at the Network Level: Use firewalls or network segmentation to limit access to the RTMP port only to authorized IP addresses or networks.
* Rate Limiting: Configure SRS to limit the rate of incoming RTMP connections or data per connection to mitigate DoS attempts.

## Attack Surface: [WebRTC Signaling and Media Interception](./attack_surfaces/webrtc_signaling_and_media_interception.md)

**Description:** Attackers can intercept or manipulate WebRTC signaling or media streams if the connection is not properly secured.

**How SRS Contributes:** SRS handles WebRTC signaling and media relay. Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in its WebRTC implementation can expose these streams.

**Example:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the signaling channel to intercept session descriptions and potentially eavesdrop on the media stream.

**Impact:** Privacy breaches, eavesdropping on real-time communication, potential injection of malicious content into the stream.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce Secure Signaling (HTTPS/WSS): Ensure that all WebRTC signaling communication between clients and SRS is encrypted using HTTPS or WSS (WebSocket Secure).
* Utilize DTLS for Media Encryption:** WebRTC inherently uses DTLS for media encryption. Ensure SRS is configured correctly to enforce DTLS.
* Secure ICE Candidate Exchange:** Implement secure mechanisms for exchanging ICE candidates to prevent attackers from injecting their own candidates.
* Regularly Update SRS: Keep SRS updated to patch any known vulnerabilities in its WebRTC implementation.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of SRS HTTP API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_srs_http_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the SRS HTTP API to gain unauthorized access or control over the server.

**How SRS Contributes:** SRS exposes an HTTP API for management and monitoring. Vulnerabilities in this API can be directly exploited.

**Example:** An attacker exploits an unauthenticated API endpoint to retrieve sensitive server configuration information or trigger a server restart.

**Impact:** Server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, ability to manipulate streaming configurations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Disable Unnecessary API Endpoints: Only enable the API endpoints that are absolutely required for your application's functionality.
* Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization: Secure all API endpoints with robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) and enforce proper authorization checks.
* Input Validation and Sanitization: Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input received by the API endpoints to prevent injection attacks.
* Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the SRS HTTP API.
* Keep SRS Updated: Ensure SRS is running the latest version to patch known API vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [SRT Ingestion Without Proper Authorization](./attack_surfaces/srt_ingestion_without_proper_authorization.md)

**Description:** Attackers can publish streams using the SRT protocol without proper authorization.

**How SRS Contributes:** SRS listens for SRT connections on a specified port. If not secured, anyone can attempt to publish.

**Example:** An attacker uses an SRT client to connect to the SRS server and starts pushing unwanted content, bypassing intended authorization mechanisms.

**Impact:** Resource exhaustion, disruption of legitimate streaming, injection of malicious content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* SRT Passphrase/Key: Utilize SRT's built-in passphrase or key mechanism to authenticate publishers. Configure SRS to require the correct passphrase.
* Network-Level Restrictions: Limit access to the SRT port to trusted IP addresses or networks using firewalls.
* Integration with Backend Authentication:  Potentially integrate SRT publishing with your application's backend for more sophisticated authorization checks, although direct integration can be complex.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Mismanagement](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_mismanagement.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities arise from misconfigured or insecurely stored SRS configuration files (`srs.conf`).

**How SRS Contributes:** SRS relies on the `srs.conf` file for its configuration. Incorrect settings can directly lead to security weaknesses.

**Example:** The `srs.conf` file contains default or weak passwords for administrative interfaces or stream keys, which are easily discovered by attackers.

**Impact:** Server compromise, unauthorized access to streams, ability to manipulate server settings.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure Configuration Practices: Follow security best practices when configuring SRS. Use strong, unique passwords for any authentication mechanisms.
* Restrict Access to Configuration Files: Ensure that the `srs.conf` file is only readable by the user running the SRS process and authorized administrators.
* Avoid Storing Secrets in Plain Text:** If possible, explore options for securely managing secrets (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secret management tools).
* Regularly Review Configuration: Periodically review the `srs.conf` file to ensure it aligns with security best practices and your application's requirements.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the third-party libraries and dependencies used by SRS.

**How SRS Contributes:** SRS relies on external libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, SRS becomes susceptible.

**Example:** A vulnerability in a specific version of a networking library used by SRS allows for remote code execution.

**Impact:** Server compromise, potential for widespread impact depending on the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly Update SRS: Keeping SRS updated often includes updates to its dependencies, patching known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor Security Advisories: Stay informed about security advisories related to SRS and its dependencies.
* Consider Using a Vulnerability Scanner: Employ vulnerability scanning tools to identify potential weaknesses in the SRS installation.
