# Threat Model Analysis for ossrs/srs

## Threat: [SRS Configuration Tampering via Exposed HTTP API](./threats/srs_configuration_tampering_via_exposed_http_api.md)

* **Threat:** SRS Configuration Tampering via Exposed HTTP API
    * **Description:** If the SRS HTTP API for management is not properly secured (e.g., weak or default credentials, exposed to the public internet without authentication), an attacker could gain unauthorized access and modify SRS configurations.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the SRS server, disruption of service, manipulation of stream behavior, potential for further attacks on the underlying system.
    * **Affected SRS Component:** HTTP API Module
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization for the SRS HTTP API.
        * Restrict access to the HTTP API to trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
        * Change default API credentials immediately upon installation.
        * Consider disabling the HTTP API if not required or exposing it only over a secure internal network.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via RTMP Connection Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_rtmp_connection_flooding.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via RTMP Connection Flooding
    * **Description:** An attacker could flood the SRS server with a large number of RTMP connection requests, exhausting server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and preventing legitimate users from connecting or streaming.
    * **Impact:** Service unavailability, disruption of live streams, negative user experience.
    * **Affected SRS Component:** RTMP Ingestion Module, Network Listener
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement connection rate limiting within SRS configuration.
        * Utilize network firewalls or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to detect and block malicious connection attempts.
        * Consider using a CDN to distribute the load and absorb some of the attack traffic.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed RTMP Packets](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_malformed_rtmp_packets.md)

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed RTMP Packets
    * **Description:** An attacker could send specially crafted, malformed RTMP packets designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the SRS RTMP parsing logic, potentially causing the server to crash or become unresponsive.
    * **Impact:** Service interruption, potential data corruption, server instability.
    * **Affected SRS Component:** RTMP Demuxer, RTMP Ingestion Module
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep SRS updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Implement input validation and sanitization on incoming RTMP data (though this is primarily the responsibility of the SRS developers).
        * Utilize network firewalls or IPS to potentially detect and block suspicious RTMP traffic patterns.

## Threat: [WebRTC Vulnerabilities (if using WebRTC features)](./threats/webrtc_vulnerabilities__if_using_webrtc_features_.md)

* **Threat:** WebRTC Vulnerabilities (if using WebRTC features)
    * **Description:** If the application utilizes SRS's WebRTC capabilities, vulnerabilities in the WebRTC implementation within SRS or related libraries could be exploited by attackers. This could include issues with signaling, ICE negotiation, or media processing.
    * **Impact:** Potential for remote code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, or manipulation of WebRTC sessions.
    * **Affected SRS Component:** WebRTC Module, Signaling Server
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep SRS updated to the latest version to patch known WebRTC vulnerabilities.
        * Secure the signaling channel used for WebRTC connections.
        * Follow secure WebRTC development practices.
