## Deep Dive Analysis: SRS Configuration Tampering via Exposed HTTP API

This document provides a detailed analysis of the "SRS Configuration Tampering via Exposed HTTP API" threat for the SRS (Simple Realtime Server) application. We will dissect the threat, explore potential attack vectors, delve into the technical implications, and expand on the recommended mitigation strategies.

**1. Threat Breakdown and Elaboration:**

* **Threat:** SRS Configuration Tampering via Exposed HTTP API
    * **Elaboration:** This threat hinges on the fact that SRS provides an HTTP API for managing its configuration and operational aspects. If this API is accessible without proper security measures, unauthorized individuals can interact with it to alter the server's behavior. This is not just about changing cosmetic settings; it can involve modifying critical parameters that directly impact the server's functionality, security, and performance.

* **Description:** If the SRS HTTP API for management is not properly secured (e.g., weak or default credentials, exposed to the public internet without authentication), an attacker could gain unauthorized access and modify SRS configurations.
    * **Elaboration:** The core vulnerability lies in the lack of robust access control for the HTTP API. This can manifest in several ways:
        * **Default Credentials:**  Using the default username and password provided by SRS without changing them.
        * **Weak Credentials:** Employing easily guessable passwords.
        * **Lack of Authentication:**  The API endpoints are accessible without requiring any form of authentication.
        * **Insufficient Authorization:**  Even with authentication, the system might not properly differentiate between user roles, allowing low-privileged users to make administrative changes.
        * **Public Exposure:**  The API is accessible from the public internet without any network-level restrictions.

* **Impact:** Complete compromise of the SRS server, disruption of service, manipulation of stream behavior, potential for further attacks on the underlying system.
    * **Elaboration:** The impact of this threat can be severe and multifaceted:
        * **Complete Compromise:** Attackers can gain full control over the SRS instance. This includes the ability to stop or restart the server, modify its core functionalities, and potentially execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system depending on the API's capabilities and any vulnerabilities in the SRS software itself.
        * **Disruption of Service:**  Attackers can modify configurations to cause service outages. This could involve disabling key features, misconfiguring network settings, or overloading the server with malicious requests. This directly impacts users relying on the SRS for streaming.
        * **Manipulation of Stream Behavior:**  Attackers can alter stream settings, potentially redirecting streams to malicious destinations, injecting unwanted content, or degrading the quality of service. This can have significant consequences for content providers and viewers.
        * **Further Attacks:** A compromised SRS server can be a stepping stone for further attacks on the underlying system or network. Attackers could use it to pivot to other internal resources, launch denial-of-service attacks, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
        * **Data Breach:** Depending on the SRS configuration and connected services, attackers might be able to access or manipulate stored stream data or related user information.
        * **Reputational Damage:**  Service disruptions and manipulated streams can severely damage the reputation of the organization using the SRS.

* **Affected SRS Component:** HTTP API Module
    * **Elaboration:**  This specifically targets the component responsible for handling HTTP requests related to server management and configuration. Understanding the specific endpoints and functionalities exposed by this module is crucial for effective mitigation. We need to identify which API calls are particularly sensitive and require stringent protection.

* **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Justification:** The potential for complete server compromise, service disruption, and further attacks justifies the "Critical" severity. The ease with which this vulnerability can be exploited if basic security measures are not in place further elevates the risk. The impact on business continuity and potential for significant financial and reputational damage is substantial.

**2. Potential Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

* **Brute-Force Attacks on Default Credentials:** Attackers might attempt to log in using well-known default credentials for SRS.
* **Dictionary Attacks:** Using lists of common passwords to guess the API credentials.
* **Exploiting Publicly Exposed API:** If the API is accessible over the internet without authentication, attackers can directly interact with it.
* **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders with access to the network could exploit the API.
* **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** If the API doesn't implement proper CSRF protection, attackers could trick authenticated users into making unintended configuration changes.
* **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the API Implementation:**  Potential bugs or security flaws within the HTTP API module itself could be exploited.

**Example Attack Scenario:**

1. An attacker scans the internet for publicly accessible SRS instances.
2. They identify an instance with the default API credentials still in place.
3. Using these credentials, they authenticate to the API.
4. They use API calls to:
    *  Redirect all incoming streams to a server under their control.
    *  Disable authentication for all streams, making them publicly accessible.
    *  Modify server settings to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service.
    *  Gain information about connected clients or stream sources.

**3. Technical Deep Dive into the HTTP API Module (Based on SRS Documentation):**

To effectively analyze this threat, we need to understand the functionalities offered by the SRS HTTP API. Based on the SRS documentation (which should be consulted directly for the most accurate information), common API endpoints related to configuration include:

* **`/api/v1/config`:**  Likely used to retrieve and potentially modify the server's configuration file (`srs.conf`). This is a highly sensitive endpoint.
* **`/api/v1/reload`:**  Used to reload the server configuration without restarting, potentially applying malicious changes quickly.
* **`/api/v1/streams`:**  Might allow manipulation of individual stream settings, such as source and destination URLs.
* **`/api/v1/vhosts`:**  Could allow adding or modifying virtual host configurations, potentially redirecting traffic or creating malicious virtual hosts.
* **`/api/v1/security`:**  Potentially manages security settings, which could be disabled or weakened by an attacker.

**Understanding the Authentication Mechanisms (or lack thereof) is crucial:**

* **Default Credentials:**  Knowing the default username and password (if any) is the first step in securing the API.
* **API Keys:**  SRS might support the use of API keys for authentication. The generation, storage, and management of these keys are critical.
* **Basic Authentication:**  While simple, Basic Authentication over HTTP is vulnerable if not used over HTTPS.
* **Token-Based Authentication (e.g., JWT):**  A more secure approach where tokens are exchanged for authentication.
* **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Ensuring different users have different levels of access to API functionalities.

**4. Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies (Expanding on the Provided List):**

* **Implement Strong Authentication and Authorization for the SRS HTTP API:**
    * **Change Default Credentials Immediately:** This is the most basic and crucial step. Force users to change default credentials upon initial setup.
    * **Enforce Strong Password Policies:**  Mandate complex passwords with a mix of characters, and consider regular password rotation.
    * **Implement API Keys:** Generate unique, long, and random API keys for authentication. Securely store and manage these keys.
    * **Consider Token-Based Authentication (JWT, OAuth 2.0):**  This provides a more robust and scalable authentication mechanism.
    * **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Define different roles with specific permissions for accessing and modifying configurations. Ensure the principle of least privilege is applied.

* **Restrict Access to the HTTP API to Trusted Networks or Specific IP Addresses:**
    * **Firewall Rules:** Configure firewall rules on the server and network to allow access to the API only from trusted IP addresses or networks.
    * **Virtual Private Network (VPN):** Require administrators to connect through a VPN to access the API.
    * **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  Utilize ACLs on network devices to restrict access.

* **Change Default API Credentials Immediately Upon Installation:** (Already covered above, but emphasizes its importance).

* **Consider Disabling the HTTP API if Not Required or Exposing it Only Over a Secure Internal Network:**
    * **Disable the API:** If the management API is not actively used, the safest approach is to disable it entirely. Check the SRS configuration file for options to disable the HTTP API module.
    * **Internal Network Exposure:** If the API is necessary, ensure it is only accessible from within a secure internal network, isolated from the public internet.

**Additional Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Enable HTTPS for the API:**  Encrypt all communication between clients and the API server to protect credentials and sensitive data in transit. Obtain and configure a valid SSL/TLS certificate.
* **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Protect against brute-force attacks by limiting the number of API requests from a single IP address within a given timeframe.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate all input to the API endpoints to prevent injection attacks.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities in the API and its configuration.
* **Keep SRS Updated:**  Apply the latest security patches and updates released by the SRS developers to address known vulnerabilities.
* **Implement Logging and Monitoring:**  Enable detailed logging of API access attempts, configuration changes, and errors. Monitor these logs for suspicious activity. Set up alerts for failed login attempts, unauthorized access, or unusual configuration changes.
* **Implement CSRF Protection:**  Use techniques like synchronizer tokens to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery attacks.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to users and applications interacting with the API.
* **Secure Configuration Management:**  Store API credentials and configuration settings securely, avoiding storing them in plain text.

**5. Detection and Monitoring:**

* **Monitor API Access Logs:** Regularly review logs for unusual access patterns, failed login attempts, access from unexpected IP addresses, or requests to sensitive endpoints.
* **Track Configuration Changes:** Implement a system to track all modifications made through the API, including who made the change and when.
* **Set Up Alerts for Suspicious Activity:** Configure alerts for events like multiple failed login attempts, access to critical API endpoints from unauthorized sources, or significant configuration changes.
* **Monitor Server Performance:**  Sudden changes in server resource consumption or network activity could indicate a compromise.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**  Deploy network-based or host-based IDS/IPS to detect and potentially block malicious API requests.

**6. Prevention Best Practices:**

* **Security by Design:**  Incorporate security considerations from the initial design and development phases.
