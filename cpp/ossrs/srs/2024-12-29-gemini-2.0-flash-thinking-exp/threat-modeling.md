*   **Threat:** Configuration File Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the SRS server's file system could modify the `srs.conf` file. This could allow them to change critical settings, such as enabling insecure features, redirecting streams, or gaining access to sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the SRS server, potential for data breaches, redirection of media streams to malicious destinations, denial of service.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** Configuration Loading and Management
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file system permissions for the `srs.conf` file, ensuring only the SRS process user has write access.
        *   Run the SRS process with a dedicated, least-privileged user account.
        *   Regularly audit file system permissions.

*   **Threat:** Insecure API Exposure
    *   **Description:** If the SRS API is enabled and not properly secured (e.g., lacking authentication or authorization), an attacker could use it to perform unauthorized actions, such as modifying server settings, accessing stream statistics, or even shutting down the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of server functionality, potential for data leaks, denial of service.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** SRS API (if enabled)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for the SRS API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
        *   Use HTTPS for all API communication to protect against eavesdropping.
        *   Carefully review and restrict the API endpoints exposed and the permissions required for each.

*   **Threat:** Transcoding Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** If SRS is configured to perform transcoding, vulnerabilities in the underlying transcoding libraries (like FFmpeg) could be exploited by an attacker providing specially crafted media streams. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the SRS server, potential for data breaches and further attacks on the infrastructure.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** Transcoding Module (using FFmpeg or similar)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep SRS and its dependencies (including FFmpeg) updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Carefully review and sanitize input media streams before transcoding.
        *   Consider running the transcoding process in a sandboxed environment.

*   **Threat:** RTMP Connection Flooding (DoS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker could flood the SRS server with a large number of RTMP connection requests, overwhelming its resources and causing a denial of service for legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:**  Inability for legitimate publishers and viewers to connect to the SRS server, disruption of media streaming services.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** RTMP Connection Handling
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement connection limits and rate limiting for RTMP connections within SRS configuration.
        *   Consider using network-level protection mechanisms like firewalls or intrusion prevention systems to filter malicious traffic.

*   **Threat:** Default Credentials or Weak Passwords
    *   **Description:** If any administrative interfaces or features of SRS rely on default credentials or weak passwords, attackers could easily gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the SRS server and its functionalities.
    *   **Affected SRS Component:** Any administrative interfaces or features requiring authentication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all default credentials are changed immediately upon installation.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for any user accounts associated with SRS.
        *   Disable or remove any unnecessary administrative interfaces.
