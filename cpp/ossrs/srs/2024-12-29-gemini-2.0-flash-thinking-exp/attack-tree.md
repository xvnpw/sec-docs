## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using SRS - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain Unauthorized Access and Control of the Application or its Data via SRS.

**High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using SRS [CRITICAL]
    * Exploit Ingestion [CRITICAL]
        * Malicious Stream Injection *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
            * Malformed RTMP Packets
    * Exploit Management Interface [CRITICAL] *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***
        * Default Credentials *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. Compromise Application Using SRS (Critical Node):**

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the culmination of any successful attack against the SRS instance and the application it supports.
* Achieving this could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in any part of the SRS system or its integration with the application.
* Success at this level means the attacker has gained unauthorized access and control, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other malicious activities.

**2. Exploit Ingestion (Critical Node):**

* This attack vector focuses on manipulating the process of feeding media streams into the SRS server.
* Successful exploitation here can disrupt the service, introduce malicious content, or potentially lead to server compromise.

**3. Malicious Stream Injection (High-Risk Path):**

* This involves sending crafted or malicious data through the streaming protocols (like RTMP) to the SRS server.
* Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in how SRS parses or processes incoming stream data.
* This can lead to buffer overflows, denial-of-service, or even remote code execution if the server is not properly handling malformed input.

    * **Malformed RTMP Packets:**
        * Attackers craft RTMP packets with unexpected structures, sizes, or values.
        * This can trigger errors or vulnerabilities in the SRS server's parsing logic.
        * Consequences can range from crashing the server to potentially exploiting memory corruption issues.

**4. Exploit Management Interface (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**

* SRS provides a management interface (often web-based or accessible via an API) for configuration and control.
* Exploiting this interface grants significant privileges to the attacker, allowing them to manipulate the server's behavior.

**5. Default Credentials (High-Risk Path):**

* Many systems, including SRS, are initially configured with default usernames and passwords.
* If these credentials are not changed, attackers can easily gain administrative access to the SRS server.
* This provides a direct path to full control, allowing for configuration changes, service disruption, and potentially further exploitation of the underlying system.
