# Attack Surface Analysis for ossrs/srs

## Attack Surface: [1. RTMP Malformed Packet Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/1__rtmp_malformed_packet_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft specially designed, invalid RTMP packets to trigger vulnerabilities in SRS's RTMP parsing and processing code.
*   **SRS Contribution:** SRS's core function is to parse and process RTMP streams; its RTMP handling logic is a *direct* target.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends an RTMP packet with an overly large chunk size field, aiming to cause a buffer overflow in SRS's memory allocation routines.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for DoS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for *all* RTMP packet fields. Use memory-safe programming techniques (e.g., bounds checking, safe string handling). Employ fuzz testing specifically targeting the RTMP parsing logic. Consider using a memory-safe language or runtime protections.
    *   **Users:** Keep SRS updated to the latest version. Monitor server logs for unusual RTMP activity.  (Network filtering is helpful but doesn't address the *direct* SRS vulnerability).

## Attack Surface: [2. RTMP/HTTP-FLV/WebRTC Command/SDP Injection (within SRS processing)](./attack_surfaces/2__rtmphttp-flvwebrtc_commandsdp_injection__within_srs_processing_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands or parameters into RTMP commands, HTTP-FLV requests, or WebRTC SDP offers/answers, exploiting vulnerabilities in how SRS *internally* handles these inputs *before* potentially passing them to hooks or other components.  This focuses on the *direct* handling within SRS, not just the presence of hooks.
*   **SRS Contribution:** SRS *must* parse and process these commands and data; the internal handling logic is the direct vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects a specially crafted string into an RTMP `connect` command's application name parameter that, *even before* any hook is called, causes an internal buffer overflow within SRS's string handling.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to streams (if authentication is bypassed internally), server configuration modification (if internal settings are affected), RCE (if internal processing leads to code execution), DoS.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for unauthorized access/modification).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Strictly validate and sanitize all user-supplied input within RTMP commands, HTTP parameters, and SDP data *at the point of parsing and internal use*.  Avoid using user-supplied data directly in *any* internal logic that could lead to unintended behavior. Implement strict input length limits.
    *   **Users:** Keep SRS updated. (While hook script security is important, this item focuses on vulnerabilities *before* hooks are even involved).

## Attack Surface: [3. Authentication Bypass (within SRS's core logic)](./attack_surfaces/3__authentication_bypass__within_srs's_core_logic_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers bypass SRS's *internal* authentication mechanisms for RTMP, the HTTP API, or WebRTC, gaining unauthorized access. This focuses on flaws in SRS's *own* authentication code, not just misconfigured hooks.
*   **SRS Contribution:** SRS implements authentication; flaws in *this implementation* are direct vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A logic error in SRS's RTMP authentication code allows an attacker to skip a crucial validation step, granting access without valid credentials.  Or, a vulnerability in the HTTP API's authentication handling allows bypassing the password check.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to streams, server control (via API), data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for API access), High (for stream access).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strong authentication mechanisms with secure password hashing and storage *within the core SRS code*. Use well-vetted authentication libraries. Thoroughly test authentication logic, including edge cases and bypass attempts.  Ensure that authentication checks are performed *before* any potentially dangerous actions.
    *   **Users:** Keep SRS updated. (While strong passwords are important, this focuses on vulnerabilities in SRS's *own* authentication handling).

## Attack Surface: [4. Resource Exhaustion (DoS) - Direct SRS Handling](./attack_surfaces/4__resource_exhaustion__dos__-_direct_srs_handling.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood SRS with connection requests, stream requests, or data, overwhelming server resources and causing a denial of service. This focuses on SRS's *ability to handle* these requests, not just the presence of limits.
*   **SRS Contribution:** SRS's primary function is to handle connections and streams; its efficiency and robustness in handling these are directly related to its vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker initiates thousands of simultaneous RTMP connection attempts, and even with connection limits configured, a vulnerability in SRS's connection handling code causes excessive memory allocation, leading to a crash.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Optimize code for performance and resource efficiency *in handling connections and streams*. Implement robust error handling and resource management.  Ensure that resource limits are *effectively enforced* by the core code, not just configured.
    *   **Users:** Keep SRS updated. (While configuration limits are important, this focuses on SRS's *inherent* ability to handle load).

## Attack Surface: [5. SRT/WebRTC Protocol-Specific Attacks (DTLS, SRTP, ICE) - Direct Implementation](./attack_surfaces/5__srtwebrtc_protocol-specific_attacks__dtls__srtp__ice__-_direct_implementation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities specific to the SRT or WebRTC protocols *within SRS's implementation* of DTLS, SRTP, ICE, etc.
*   **SRS Contribution:** SRS *implements* these protocols; vulnerabilities in its implementation are direct attack vectors.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in SRS's DTLS handshake implementation to perform a denial-of-service attack against WebRTC clients.  This is a flaw in SRS's *code*, not just a misconfiguration.
*   **Impact:** DoS, eavesdropping, data modification, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Follow best practices for secure implementation of these protocols. Use well-vetted libraries for DTLS, SRTP, and ICE. Stay up-to-date with security advisories related to these protocols. Perform thorough security testing, including fuzzing and penetration testing, *specifically targeting the protocol implementations*.
    *   **Users:** Keep SRS updated.

## Attack Surface: [6. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Impacting SRS Directly)](./attack_surfaces/6__dependency_vulnerabilities__impacting_srs_directly_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in libraries that SRS depends on (e.g., ST, libsrt, OpenSSL) are exploited, *directly affecting SRS's operation*.
*   **SRS Contribution:** SRS *relies* on these libraries; their vulnerabilities become part of SRS's *direct* attack surface.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in libsrt allows an attacker to cause a denial of service by sending malformed SRT packets, *crashing SRS*.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from DoS to RCE.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (Critical to High), depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions. Monitor security advisories for all dependencies. Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerable libraries.
    *   **Users:** Keep SRS updated to the latest version, as updates often include security fixes for dependencies.
