# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Resource Exhaustion (DoS/DDoS) against SRS

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Resource Exhaustion" attack path within the "Disrupt Service" sub-goal of the attack tree, focusing on vulnerabilities within the SRS (Simple Realtime Server) and the application utilizing it.  The goal is to identify specific attack vectors, assess their feasibility and impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  This analysis will inform the development team about critical security considerations and guide the implementation of robust defenses.

**Scope:** This analysis focuses exclusively on the following attack tree path:

*   **Sub-Goal 1:** Disrupt Service (DoS/DDoS)
    *   **High-Risk Path:** 1.1 Resource Exhaustion
        *   **1.1.1 CPU Flood**
        *   **1.1.2 Memory Flood**
        *   **1.1.3 Connection Flood**

The analysis will consider:

*   The SRS server itself (version considerations will be included where relevant).
*   The application's configuration and usage of SRS.
*   Network-level interactions related to the attack path.
*   Common attack tools and techniques used for resource exhaustion.
*   The operating system and underlying infrastructure *only* in the context of how they interact with SRS and the specific attack vectors.  (A full OS/infrastructure security audit is out of scope).

**Methodology:**

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will examine known vulnerabilities in SRS (CVEs, bug reports, community discussions) related to resource exhaustion.  We will also consider potential vulnerabilities based on SRS's architecture and common attack patterns.
2.  **Code Review (Conceptual):** While a full code review of SRS is beyond the scope, we will conceptually analyze SRS's code structure (based on the public repository) to identify potential areas of concern related to resource handling.
3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will model the attacker's perspective, considering their motivations, capabilities, and likely attack methods.
4.  **Mitigation Analysis:** For each identified vulnerability and attack vector, we will propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies.  These will include configuration changes, code modifications (if applicable to the application layer), and network-level defenses.
5.  **Prioritization:** We will prioritize mitigation strategies based on their effectiveness, ease of implementation, and impact on the system's performance.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

### 2.1.  [[1.1.1 CPU Flood]]

**Description:**  Attackers overwhelm the SRS server's CPU, preventing it from processing legitimate requests.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Transcoding:** SRS's transcoding capabilities are a prime target.  An attacker could request multiple simultaneous transcodes with high bitrates and complex codecs (e.g., H.265, VP9).  Even without full transcoding, requesting different output formats (e.g., HLS, DASH, RTMP simultaneously) can consume significant CPU.
*   **Complex Handshakes:**  Repeatedly initiating connections with complex cryptographic handshakes (especially if using older, less efficient ciphers) can consume CPU.  This is less likely with modern TLS configurations, but still a potential vector.
*   **Protocol-Specific Attacks:**  Certain RTMP or WebRTC features, if misconfigured or vulnerable, might allow for CPU-intensive operations.  For example, a malformed RTMP message could trigger excessive parsing or error handling.
*   **SRS Configuration:**  Misconfigured or overly permissive settings related to the number of allowed clients, streams, or transcoding processes can exacerbate the impact of a CPU flood.
*   **Application Logic:** If the application using SRS has logic that triggers CPU-intensive operations on the server based on client requests (e.g., custom filters, on-the-fly video processing), this could be exploited.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Limit Transcoding:**
    *   Restrict the number of simultaneous transcodes per client and globally.
    *   Disable or limit the use of computationally expensive codecs.
    *   Implement a queueing system for transcoding requests.
    *   Use hardware acceleration (e.g., GPU transcoding) if available and properly configured.
*   **Rate Limiting:**
    *   Implement strict rate limiting on connection attempts and requests for CPU-intensive operations.  This should be done at both the network level (e.g., firewall, load balancer) and within the application logic.
    *   Use techniques like token buckets or leaky buckets to control the rate of requests.
*   **Connection Limits:**
    *   Configure SRS to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections.
    *   Implement connection timeouts to prevent idle connections from consuming resources.
*   **TLS Optimization:**
    *   Use modern, efficient TLS cipher suites.
    *   Enable TLS session resumption to reduce the overhead of repeated handshakes.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Strictly validate all client input to prevent malformed requests from triggering excessive CPU usage.
    *   Implement robust error handling to prevent crashes or infinite loops.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   Monitor CPU usage and set up alerts for unusually high load.
    *   Use tools like `top`, `htop`, or dedicated monitoring solutions to identify the processes consuming the most CPU.
* **Resource Quotas:** Implement resource quotas at the operating system level to limit the CPU time available to the SRS process. This can prevent a complete system-wide denial of service.

### 2.2.  [[1.1.2 Memory Flood]]

**Description:** Attackers consume all available memory on the SRS server, causing it to crash or become unresponsive.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **Large Payloads:**  Attackers could send large amounts of data in requests, attempting to fill buffers or allocate excessive memory.  This could involve uploading large files (if enabled), sending large RTMP messages, or exploiting vulnerabilities in how SRS handles large data chunks.
*   **Connection Leaks:**  If SRS or the application has bugs that prevent connections from being properly closed and their associated memory released, this can lead to a gradual memory leak, eventually exhausting available memory.
*   **Memory Allocation Bugs:**  Vulnerabilities in SRS's memory management (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free errors) could be exploited to allocate excessive memory or cause memory corruption.
*   **Cache Poisoning (if applicable):** If SRS uses caching, an attacker might be able to manipulate the cache to store excessive or unnecessary data, consuming memory.
*   **Protocol-Specific Attacks:**  Specific protocols (e.g., WebRTC) might have features or vulnerabilities that allow for memory exhaustion attacks.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Input Size Limits:**
    *   Enforce strict limits on the size of client requests and data payloads.
    *   Implement checks to prevent the allocation of excessively large buffers.
*   **Connection Management:**
    *   Implement robust connection handling to ensure that connections are properly closed and their associated memory is released.
    *   Use connection timeouts to prevent idle connections from consuming memory.
*   **Memory Leak Detection:**
    *   Use memory profiling tools (e.g., Valgrind, AddressSanitizer) during development and testing to identify and fix memory leaks.
    *   Monitor memory usage in production and set up alerts for unusual growth.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:**
    *   Regularly scan SRS and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities, including memory-related issues.
    *   Keep SRS and its dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches.
*   **Cache Management (if applicable):**
    *   Implement appropriate cache limits and eviction policies.
    *   Validate cache keys and data to prevent cache poisoning attacks.
*   **Resource Quotas:** Implement resource quotas at the operating system level to limit the memory available to the SRS process.
* **WebRTC Specific:** If using WebRTC, carefully review and configure the ICE and DTLS settings to prevent potential memory exhaustion vulnerabilities related to connection establishment and media handling.

### 2.3.  [[1.1.3 Connection Flood]]

**Description:** Attackers establish a large number of connections to the SRS server, exhausting its connection pool and preventing legitimate users from connecting.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **SYN Flood:**  A classic TCP SYN flood attack can overwhelm the server's ability to handle new connection requests.  This is a network-level attack, but SRS is the target.
*   **Slowloris:**  This attack involves establishing many connections and keeping them open by sending partial HTTP requests.  While SRS primarily deals with RTMP and WebRTC, it might have HTTP interfaces (e.g., for management or statistics) that could be vulnerable.
*   **Application-Layer Connection Exhaustion:**  Even if the underlying TCP connection handling is robust, the application layer within SRS might have limits on the number of concurrent clients or streams it can handle.  An attacker could exploit this by creating many valid connections, even if they don't send much data.
*   **WebRTC-Specific:**  WebRTC uses UDP, which is connectionless.  However, the signaling process (typically over WebSockets) and the establishment of ICE candidates can still be used to exhaust resources.  An attacker could initiate many WebRTC connection attempts without completing them.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **SYN Cookies:**  Enable SYN cookies on the server's TCP stack to mitigate SYN flood attacks.  This allows the server to handle a large number of connection requests without allocating resources until a full connection is established.
*   **Firewall Rules:**
    *   Implement firewall rules to limit the number of connections from a single IP address or network.
    *   Use stateful firewalls to track connection states and block invalid or incomplete connections.
*   **Load Balancer:**
    *   Use a load balancer to distribute incoming connections across multiple SRS servers.
    *   Configure the load balancer to handle connection limiting and rate limiting.
*   **Connection Timeouts:**
    *   Implement aggressive connection timeouts to close idle or incomplete connections quickly.
    *   Configure SRS to limit the duration of connections.
*   **Application-Layer Limits:**
    *   Configure SRS to limit the maximum number of concurrent clients, streams, and connections.
    *   Implement authentication and authorization to prevent unauthorized users from establishing connections.
*   **WebRTC-Specific:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on WebRTC signaling messages.
    *   Use STUN/TURN servers with appropriate security configurations.
    *   Monitor the number of active WebRTC connections and set alerts for unusual spikes.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):** Deploy an IDS/IPS to detect and block connection flood attacks.
