# Deep Analysis: Resource Exhaustion (DoS) - Direct SRS Handling in SRS

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify and evaluate vulnerabilities within the SRS codebase (https://github.com/ossrs/srs) that could lead to resource exhaustion and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks, even when standard configuration-based limits are in place.  This analysis focuses specifically on SRS's *internal handling* of connections, streams, and data, rather than simply relying on external configuration.  We aim to pinpoint areas where inefficient code, inadequate error handling, or flawed resource management could be exploited, even under seemingly "protected" configurations.

## 2. Scope

This analysis will focus on the following aspects of the SRS codebase:

*   **Core Connection Handling:**  Modules and functions responsible for accepting, processing, and terminating network connections (RTMP, HTTP-FLV, WebRTC, etc.).  This includes examining the lifecycle of a connection within SRS.
*   **Stream Management:**  Code related to creating, managing, and destroying media streams.  This includes analyzing how stream metadata is handled, how buffers are allocated and managed, and how stream multiplexing/demultiplexing is performed.
*   **Data Processing:**  Functions that handle incoming and outgoing data packets, including parsing, buffering, and forwarding.  This includes examining how different codecs and protocols are handled.
*   **Error Handling:**  Specifically, how SRS responds to unexpected input, malformed packets, connection errors, and resource allocation failures.  We'll look for potential "fail-open" scenarios or situations where errors lead to resource leaks.
*   **Resource Allocation and Deallocation:**  How memory, file descriptors, threads, and other system resources are acquired and released throughout the connection and streaming lifecycle.  We'll look for potential leaks, excessive allocation, and inefficient use of resources.
*   **Concurrency Model:** How SRS handles multiple concurrent connections and streams. This includes examining the use of threads, processes, or asynchronous I/O, and identifying potential race conditions or deadlocks that could be triggered by an attacker.

**Out of Scope:**

*   External dependencies (e.g., operating system kernel, network stack) are considered out of scope, *except* where SRS interacts with them in a way that could exacerbate resource exhaustion.
*   Configuration-based limits (e.g., `max_connections` in the SRS configuration file) are considered secondary.  We are primarily concerned with vulnerabilities *within* SRS's handling, even if limits are set.
*   Attacks that rely solely on network-level flooding (e.g., SYN floods) are out of scope, as these are typically mitigated at the network layer, not within SRS itself.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Static Code Analysis:**  Manual review of the SRS source code, focusing on the areas identified in the Scope section.  We will use code search tools (e.g., `grep`, `rg`, code editors with semantic understanding) to identify relevant code sections.  We will look for patterns known to be associated with resource exhaustion vulnerabilities, such as:
    *   Unbounded loops or recursion.
    *   Large memory allocations based on untrusted input.
    *   Missing or inadequate error handling.
    *   Resource leaks (memory, file descriptors, etc.).
    *   Inefficient algorithms (e.g., O(n^2) algorithms processing large inputs).
    *   Improper use of synchronization primitives (leading to deadlocks or race conditions).
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  We will use fuzzing tools (e.g., AFL++, libFuzzer) to generate malformed or unexpected input and observe SRS's behavior.  This will help identify vulnerabilities that might be missed during static analysis.  Fuzzing will target:
    *   RTMP connection establishment and handshake.
    *   Stream publishing and playback requests.
    *   Data packets with various codecs and payloads.
    *   Edge cases and boundary conditions in input data.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Stress Testing):**  We will use load testing tools (e.g., `wrk`, custom scripts) to simulate high numbers of concurrent connections and streams.  We will monitor SRS's resource usage (CPU, memory, file descriptors, network I/O) during these tests to identify potential bottlenecks and resource exhaustion points.  This will differ from fuzzing by using *valid* but high-volume input.
*   **Review of Existing Issues and CVEs:**  We will examine the SRS issue tracker and publicly available CVE databases to identify any previously reported vulnerabilities related to resource exhaustion.  This will help us understand known attack vectors and ensure that our analysis covers them.
*   **Code Profiling:** Using tools like `gprof` or `perf` to identify performance bottlenecks and areas of high resource consumption within the SRS codebase under load. This will help pinpoint specific functions or code paths that are contributing to resource exhaustion.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

This section details the specific areas of concern within the SRS codebase, based on the attack surface description and the methodology outlined above.

**4.1. Connection Handling (RTMP, HTTP-FLV, WebRTC, etc.)**

*   **`srs_kernel_listener.cpp` and related files:**  This is a critical area, as it handles the initial connection acceptance.  We need to examine:
    *   How new connections are accepted (e.g., `accept()` calls).  Are there any potential race conditions or resource leaks if `accept()` fails repeatedly?
    *   How connection objects are created and managed.  Is there a limit on the number of active connection objects, and is this limit enforced *before* significant resources are allocated?
    *   How connection handshakes are handled (e.g., RTMP handshake).  Are there any vulnerabilities in the handshake parsing logic that could lead to excessive resource consumption or denial of service?  Fuzzing the handshake is crucial.
    *   How timeouts are implemented for connection establishment.  Are slowloris-style attacks possible, where an attacker keeps a connection open in the handshake phase for an extended period?
    *   How different protocols (RTMP, HTTP-FLV, WebRTC) are handled.  Are there any protocol-specific vulnerabilities that could lead to resource exhaustion?

*   **`srs_protocol_stack.cpp` and related files:** This area handles the protocol-specific logic for each connection.  We need to examine:
    *   How different message types are parsed and processed.  Are there any vulnerabilities in the parsing logic that could lead to excessive memory allocation or CPU consumption?
    *   How data buffers are managed.  Are there any potential buffer overflows or leaks?
    *   How errors are handled.  Do errors lead to proper cleanup of resources, or are there potential resource leaks?

**4.2. Stream Management**

*   **`srs_app_source.cpp` and `srs_app_forward.cpp`:** These files handle the creation, management, and destruction of media streams.  Key areas to examine:
    *   How stream objects are created and managed.  Is there a limit on the number of active streams, and is this limit enforced effectively?
    *   How stream metadata is handled.  Is there any potential for attackers to inject large amounts of metadata, leading to excessive memory allocation?
    *   How stream multiplexing/demultiplexing is performed.  Are there any inefficiencies or vulnerabilities in this process that could be exploited?
    *   How stream transitions (e.g., publishing, unpublishing, playing, pausing) are handled.  Are there any potential race conditions or resource leaks during these transitions?

*   **`srs_kernel_buffer.cpp`:** This file manages the buffers used for media data.  We need to examine:
    *   How buffers are allocated and deallocated.  Are there any potential buffer overflows or leaks?
    *   How buffer sizes are determined.  Are they based on untrusted input, potentially leading to excessive memory allocation?
    *   How buffers are shared between different components (e.g., source, forwarder, consumer).  Are there any potential race conditions or memory corruption issues?

**4.3. Data Processing**

*   **`srs_protocol_rtmp_stack.cpp`, `srs_protocol_http_stack.cpp`, `srs_app_st.cpp` (and related files for other protocols):** These files handle the parsing and processing of data packets for different protocols.  Key areas to examine:
    *   How different message types and codecs are handled.  Are there any vulnerabilities in the parsing logic that could lead to excessive resource consumption?  Fuzzing different codecs is crucial.
    *   How data is buffered and forwarded.  Are there any potential buffer overflows or leaks?
    *   How errors are handled.  Do errors lead to proper cleanup of resources?

**4.4. Error Handling**

*   **Throughout the codebase:**  We need to examine how SRS handles errors in various situations, including:
    *   Network errors (e.g., connection refused, connection reset, timeout).
    *   Protocol errors (e.g., malformed packets, invalid message types).
    *   Resource allocation failures (e.g., `malloc()` failure, file descriptor exhaustion).
    *   Unexpected input (e.g., invalid parameters, out-of-bounds values).

    We need to ensure that errors are handled gracefully and that resources are properly released in all error scenarios.  We should look for:
    *   Missing error checks (e.g., not checking the return value of `malloc()`).
    *   Inadequate error handling (e.g., simply logging an error and continuing without releasing resources).
    *   "Fail-open" scenarios (e.g., continuing to process data even after a critical error has occurred).

**4.5. Resource Allocation and Deallocation**

*   **Throughout the codebase:**  We need to examine how SRS allocates and deallocates various system resources, including:
    *   Memory (using `malloc()`, `new`, etc.).
    *   File descriptors (using `open()`, `socket()`, etc.).
    *   Threads (using `pthread_create()`, etc.).
    *   Other system resources (e.g., semaphores, mutexes).

    We should look for:
    *   Memory leaks (allocating memory without freeing it).
    *   File descriptor leaks (opening file descriptors without closing them).
    *   Thread leaks (creating threads without joining or detaching them).
    *   Excessive resource allocation (e.g., allocating large amounts of memory based on untrusted input).
    *   Inefficient resource usage (e.g., holding onto resources for longer than necessary).

**4.6 Concurrency Model**

*   **`srs_app_st.cpp` and related threading/coroutine files:** SRS uses state threads (st) for concurrency.  We need to examine:
    *   How st threads are created and managed.  Are there any potential race conditions or deadlocks?
    *   How shared resources are accessed and protected.  Are appropriate synchronization primitives (e.g., mutexes, semaphores) used correctly?
    *   How errors are handled in a multi-threaded environment.  Do errors in one thread affect other threads?
    *   The potential for thread exhaustion if an attacker can trigger the creation of many threads.

**4.7 Specific Attack Scenarios**

Based on the above analysis, we can identify several specific attack scenarios that could lead to resource exhaustion:

*   **Slowloris Attack:**  An attacker slowly sends HTTP headers or RTMP handshake data, keeping connections open in the handshake phase for an extended period.  This could exhaust connection slots or other resources.
*   **Large Metadata Attack:**  An attacker sends a stream with a large amount of metadata, causing SRS to allocate excessive memory to store the metadata.
*   **Malformed Packet Attack:**  An attacker sends malformed RTMP, HTTP-FLV, or WebRTC packets that trigger vulnerabilities in the parsing logic, leading to excessive CPU consumption or memory allocation.
*   **Connection Flood Attack:**  An attacker initiates a large number of simultaneous connection attempts, overwhelming SRS's ability to accept and process new connections, even if `max_connections` is configured. This tests the *efficiency* of the connection handling code.
*   **Stream Flood Attack:** An attacker rapidly creates and destroys streams, potentially exploiting race conditions or resource leaks in the stream management code.
*   **Codec-Specific Attacks:**  An attacker sends specially crafted data using a specific codec (e.g., H.264, AAC) that triggers vulnerabilities in the codec parsing or decoding logic, leading to excessive resource consumption.

## 5. Next Steps

The next steps involve:

1.  **Prioritization:**  Based on the analysis above, prioritize the areas of the codebase that are most likely to be vulnerable to resource exhaustion attacks.
2.  **Targeted Code Review:**  Conduct a detailed code review of the prioritized areas, focusing on the specific concerns identified in Section 4.
3.  **Fuzzing and Stress Testing:**  Develop and execute fuzzing and stress testing campaigns targeting the prioritized areas.
4.  **Vulnerability Remediation:**  If vulnerabilities are found, develop and implement patches to address them.
5.  **Documentation:**  Document the findings of the analysis, including any identified vulnerabilities, remediation steps, and recommendations for future development.
6.  **Continuous Monitoring:** Implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines that include automated security testing (e.g., fuzzing, static analysis) to prevent regressions and detect new vulnerabilities.

This deep analysis provides a comprehensive framework for identifying and mitigating resource exhaustion vulnerabilities in SRS. By combining static code analysis, dynamic analysis, and a thorough understanding of the SRS architecture, we can significantly improve the resilience of SRS against DoS attacks.
