## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Stream Names and Paths (SRS Context)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_stream_names_and_paths__srs_context_.md)

Mitigation Strategy: SRS Stream Name and Path Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize SRS's Lua Plugin for Custom Validation (Advanced):** If SRS's built-in validation is insufficient, develop a Lua plugin for SRS to implement custom validation logic for stream names and paths. This plugin can intercept stream creation requests and enforce stricter validation rules.
    2.  **Configure SRS to Reject Invalid Names (Basic):** While SRS might not have granular validation configuration, ensure that your application logic interacting with SRS generates stream names and paths that adhere to a defined safe format. Document these format requirements for developers.
    3.  **Sanitize Input in Application Layer Before SRS:**  Implement input sanitization in the application layer *before* passing stream names and paths to SRS for publishing or playback. This ensures that only validated and sanitized names reach SRS.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Path Traversal (High Severity):** Attackers could potentially access or manipulate files outside of the intended stream directory by crafting malicious stream paths passed to SRS.
    *   **Command Injection (Medium Severity):** If stream names or paths are used in system commands by SRS (less likely directly by SRS core, more likely in custom extensions), attackers might inject malicious commands.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Malformed stream names could potentially cause errors or crashes in SRS processing logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** High risk reduction. Effectively prevents path traversal attacks related to stream names processed by SRS.
    *   **Command Injection:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface for command injection via stream names handled by SRS.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium risk reduction. Prevents DoS caused by trivially malformed stream names processed by SRS.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Unknown. Needs to be checked if any custom Lua plugins for validation are in place or if application layer sanitization is implemented before interacting with SRS.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if relying solely on default SRS behavior without explicit validation either in a Lua plugin or in the application layer before SRS interaction.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Command Validation for HTTP APIs (SRS Context)](./mitigation_strategies/control_command_validation_for_http_apis__srs_context_.md)

Mitigation Strategy: SRS HTTP API Input Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review SRS API Documentation:** Thoroughly review the SRS HTTP API documentation to understand the expected input parameters, data types, and formats for each API endpoint.
    2.  **Implement Validation in API Clients:**  In your application code that interacts with SRS HTTP APIs, implement validation logic to ensure that all API requests sent to SRS conform to the documented specifications.
    3.  **Utilize SRS Authentication for API Access:** Secure SRS HTTP APIs with strong authentication (see dedicated mitigation strategy below) to limit access to authorized users and reduce the risk of malicious API requests.
    4.  **Monitor SRS API Logs:** Monitor SRS API access logs for any unusual or suspicious API requests that might indicate attempted exploitation or misuse.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Attackers could inject malicious commands through API parameters if SRS API handlers are vulnerable and input is not validated.
    *   **Server Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):**  Invalid API input could potentially lead to unintended SRS server misconfigurations if validation is lacking in API clients or SRS itself.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Malformed API requests could cause errors or resource exhaustion in SRS, leading to DoS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** High risk reduction. Effectively prevents command injection through SRS API parameters if client-side validation is robust and SRS API is secure.
    *   **Server Misconfiguration:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the risk of misconfiguration via SRS API, relying on client-side validation and secure API access.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium risk reduction. Mitigates DoS from malformed SRS API requests through client-side validation and monitoring.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  Relies on the security of SRS's API implementation itself. Client-side validation in applications using SRS APIs might be missing or incomplete.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing robust client-side validation in applications that interact with SRS HTTP APIs. Focus on implementing validation in API clients and monitoring SRS API logs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Exposed Ports (SRS Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_exposed_ports__srs_configuration_.md)

Mitigation Strategy: SRS Port Minimization
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required SRS Ports:** Determine the specific ports required for the streaming protocols you are actively using with SRS (e.g., RTMP, HTTP-FLV, HLS, WebRTC). Consult SRS documentation for default port assignments.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary SRS Listeners:** In the SRS configuration file (`srs.conf`), disable listeners for protocols and ports that are not required for your application. For example, if you only use HLS, disable RTMP and HTTP-FLV listeners by commenting out or removing their respective `listen` directives.
    3.  **Verify SRS Port Configuration:** Double-check the SRS configuration to ensure only the necessary ports are configured to listen for connections.
    4.  **Document Required SRS Ports:** Document the minimal set of ports required for SRS operation in your application's deployment documentation.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Broad Attack Surface (Medium Severity):** Reducing exposed SRS ports minimizes potential entry points for attackers targeting vulnerabilities in SRS or related services listening on those ports.
    *   **Unnecessary Service Exposure (Medium Severity):** Disabling unused SRS protocols and ports prevents attackers from targeting services within SRS that are not actually needed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Broad Attack Surface:** Medium risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface of the SRS instance by limiting exposed ports.
    *   **Unnecessary Service Exposure:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents exploitation of vulnerabilities in unused SRS services.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Default SRS configuration might expose more ports than necessary. Explicit port minimization in SRS configuration might be missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if relying on default SRS port configurations without explicitly disabling unnecessary listeners in `srs.conf`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Connection Limits (SRS Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_connection_limits__srs_configuration_.md)

Mitigation Strategy: SRS Connection and Rate Limiting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Connection Limits in SRS:** In the SRS configuration file (`srs.conf`), set appropriate limits for the maximum number of concurrent connections. Configure both global connection limits and per-IP address connection limits to prevent abuse from single sources. Use configuration directives like `max_connections` and potentially per-vhost connection limits.
    2.  **Configure Rate Limiting in SRS:**  Implement rate limiting within SRS configuration to control the rate at which publishers can send data and potentially subscribers can receive data. Use SRS rate limiting features like `in_bytes_limit` and `out_bytes_limit` within `vhost` configurations.
    3.  **Tune Limits Based on Expected Traffic:**  Carefully tune connection and rate limits based on your application's expected traffic patterns and server capacity. Avoid setting limits too low, which could impact legitimate users.
    4.  **Monitor SRS Metrics for Limit Breaches:** Monitor SRS metrics related to connection counts and traffic rates to detect potential DoS attacks or situations where configured limits are being reached.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** SRS connection and rate limiting can effectively mitigate many types of DoS attacks that aim to overwhelm the SRS server.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion on the SRS server due to excessive connections or traffic, ensuring stability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** High risk reduction. Significantly reduces the impact of many DoS attacks targeting SRS.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium risk reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion on the SRS server and improves stability under load.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. SRS might have default connection limits. However, explicit and tuned rate limiting and connection limits in `srs.conf` might be missing or not optimally configured.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if relying on default SRS configurations without explicitly configuring and tuning connection limits and rate limiting in `srs.conf` to match application needs and server capacity.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS/HTTPS Encryption (SRS Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/tlshttps_encryption__srs_configuration_.md)

Mitigation Strategy: SRS TLS/HTTPS Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS Certificates for SRS:** Obtain valid TLS/SSL certificates for your SRS server's domain or IP address.
    2.  **Configure TLS for HTTPS in SRS:** In the SRS configuration file (`srs.conf`), configure TLS certificates for HTTPS listeners. Specify the paths to your SSL certificate (`ssl_cert`) and private key (`ssl_key`) files within the `http_api` and `http_server` sections of your `vhost` configuration. Enable HTTPS by setting the `https_port` directive.
    3.  **Configure TLS for RTMPS in SRS (If Used):** If you use RTMPS, configure TLS certificates for secure RTMP connections in the `rtmp` section of your `vhost` configuration, similar to HTTPS configuration.
    4.  **Enforce HTTPS for Web Interfaces and APIs:** Ensure that all web interfaces and API access to SRS are served over HTTPS by configuring SRS and any reverse proxies or load balancers accordingly.
    5.  **Regularly Renew TLS Certificates:** Implement a process for regularly renewing TLS certificates before they expire to maintain continuous encryption for SRS.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data in Transit Interception (High Severity):** SRS TLS/HTTPS encryption prevents eavesdropping on network traffic and intercepting sensitive data transmitted to and from SRS over HTTP-based protocols.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Encryption protects against MitM attacks targeting communication with SRS over HTTP.
    *   **Credential Theft (Medium Severity):** Encrypting communication channels with SRS protects credentials transmitted during authentication processes over HTTP.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data in Transit Interception:** High risk reduction. Effectively prevents eavesdropping on HTTP-based communication with SRS.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** High risk reduction. Prevents MitM attacks targeting HTTP communication with SRS.
    *   **Credential Theft:** Medium risk reduction. Protects credentials transmitted over HTTP to SRS.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. HTTPS might be enabled for some SRS components, but TLS might not be fully configured for all relevant HTTP-based protocols or RTMPS if used. Self-signed certificates might be in use.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Likely missing if TLS/HTTPS is not enabled for all HTTP-based protocols and RTMPS in SRS configuration, or if valid certificates from trusted CAs are not used in production SRS deployments. Focus on complete TLS/HTTPS configuration in `srs.conf` and proper certificate management.
