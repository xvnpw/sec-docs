# Project Design Document: SRS (Simple Realtime Server) for Threat Modeling - Improved

## 1. Introduction

This document provides an enhanced design overview of the Simple Realtime Server (SRS), an open-source live streaming server, specifically tailored for threat modeling and security analysis. Building upon the initial design, this version offers more refined details and clarifies critical aspects for security assessment. It outlines the system's architecture, components, data flow, and external interfaces with a stronger focus on security implications. This document is intended to be a robust foundation for identifying potential security vulnerabilities and developing comprehensive mitigation strategies. The design is based on the understanding of SRS as described in the project's GitHub repository: [https://github.com/ossrs/srs](https://github.com/ossrs/srs).

## 2. System Overview

SRS is a versatile, high-performance, open-source real-time streaming server engineered for simplicity, robustness, and efficiency in building live streaming applications. It supports a wide array of protocols, including RTMP, WebRTC, HLS, and HTTP-FLV, catering to diverse streaming needs.

**Core Functionalities:**

* **Ingest (Publishing):**  Accepts live audio and video streams from encoders and publishers using protocols like RTMP and WebRTC. This is the entry point for content into the SRS ecosystem.
* **Processing & Management:**  Manages and processes incoming streams. This includes core functionalities like session management, stream routing, and optional features such as transcoding, recording, and stream forwarding.
* **Delivery (Playback):** Distributes live streams to viewers and players via protocols like HTTP-FLV, HLS, and WebRTC. This is the content distribution mechanism to end-users.
* **Control Plane (Management & Monitoring):** Provides HTTP-based APIs and interfaces for server management, configuration, monitoring, and operational control.

**Target Audience:**

This document is primarily for security engineers, cybersecurity analysts, developers, and operations teams involved in threat modeling, security architecture review, and security testing of systems that incorporate SRS.

**Data Flow - Scenarios:**

1. **RTMP Publish & HLS Playback:**
    * **Publish:** Publisher (P) -> RTMP Handler (NI1) -> Session Manager (CL1) -> Stream Router (CL2).
    * **Process:** Stream Router (CL2) -> HLS Muxer (AS5) -> HTTP Handler (NI3) -> Data Storage Layer (DS2 - for segments).
    * **Playback:** Viewer (V) -> HTTP Handler (NI3) -> HLS Muxer (AS5) -> Stream Router (CL2). HTTP Handler serves HLS manifest and segments from AS5/DS2.

        * **Data Retention Policies:**  Lack of proper data retention policies for recorded content, potentially leading to data breaches or compliance issues.
        * **Encryption at Rest:**  Recorded files are typically not encrypted at rest, posing a risk if storage is compromised.

## 5. External Interfaces (Security Perspective)

This section re-examines external interfaces with a focus on security implications for each interaction point.

* **Publishers (Encoders):**
    * **Protocols:** RTMP, WebRTC.
    * **Security Perspective:**  Publishers are the primary content providers. Compromised publishers or insecure publishing channels can inject malicious content or disrupt service. Strong authentication and authorization are crucial. Input validation of incoming streams is essential to prevent injection attacks.

* **Viewers (Players):**
    * **Protocols:** HTTP-FLV, HLS, WebRTC.
    * **Security Perspective:** Viewers consume content. Security concerns are primarily around access control (preventing unauthorized viewing) and protecting viewers from potentially malicious content (though SRS primarily streams live content, not user-generated content in the typical sense).

* **Management Clients (HTTP API):**
    * **Protocol:** HTTP (HTTPS recommended).
    * **Security Perspective:** Management clients have administrative control over the SRS server. API security is paramount. Strong authentication, authorization, input validation, and secure communication (HTTPS) are mandatory.

* **External Transcoding Engines (e.g., FFmpeg):**
    * **Protocol:** Inter-process communication.
    * **Security Perspective:**  External processes introduce security risks. Input to FFmpeg must be carefully sanitized to prevent command injection. Monitor resource consumption of transcoding processes to prevent DoS.

* **External Forwarding Destinations (Other Servers, CDNs):**
    * **Protocols:** RTMP, etc.
    * **Security Perspective:**  Forwarding to untrusted destinations can expose streams to unauthorized parties. Secure communication channels for forwarding are recommended. Verify the security posture of forwarding destinations.

* **STUN/TURN Servers (for WebRTC):**
    * **Protocols:** STUN/TURN.
    * **Security Perspective:**  Reliance on external STUN/TURN servers introduces trust dependencies. Ensure communication with STUN/TURN servers is secure and that these services are reliable and trustworthy.

## 6. Threat Modeling Guidance & Security Considerations (Categorized)

This document is designed to be used for threat modeling. Here's how to leverage it and a categorized list of security considerations to guide the process, potentially using a methodology like STRIDE:

**How to Use this Document for Threat Modeling:**

1. **Component-Based Threat Modeling:**  Use Section 4 (Component Descriptions) to analyze each component individually. For each component, consider the STRIDE categories (Spoofing, Tampering, Repudiation, Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Elevation of Privilege) and identify potential threats.
2. **Data Flow Diagram Analysis:**  Use the Mermaid diagram in Section 3 to trace data flows (e.g., publish, playback, management API). For each data flow, consider potential threats at each stage of the flow.
3. **External Interface Analysis:**  Use Section 5 (External Interfaces) to analyze interactions with external entities. Consider threats arising from each external interface and the security measures needed to mitigate them.
4. **Scenario-Based Threat Modeling:**  Develop specific use cases or scenarios (e.g., "Unauthorized user attempts to publish a stream," "Attacker tries to take down the server"). Use the design document to analyze these scenarios and identify potential vulnerabilities and attack paths.

**Categorized Security Considerations (STRIDE-aligned):**

* **Spoofing (Authentication):**
    * Weak or missing authentication for publishers, viewers, and management API.
    * Vulnerabilities in RTMP handshake or WebRTC signaling that could allow spoofing identities.
