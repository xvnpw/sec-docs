### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Physical Access -> Direct Server Access (4.3.1)

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Gaining Physical Access

**Detailed Breakdown:**

*   **Initial Access Point: Physical Location of SRS Server:** The attacker must first identify the physical location of the server hosting the SRS instance. This could involve reconnaissance through various means:
    *   **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT):**  Searching for publicly available information about the organization or service using SRS, potentially revealing data center locations or office addresses.
    *   **Social Engineering:**  Tricking employees or contractors into revealing server locations.
    *   **Physical Reconnaissance:**  Observing the target organization's facilities to identify potential server rooms or data centers.

*   **Bypassing Physical Security Controls:** Once the location is identified, the attacker needs to overcome physical security measures to gain entry. This could involve:
    *   **Unauthorized Entry:**  "Tailgating" authorized personnel, exploiting weak access control systems, or finding unsecured entry points (e.g., unlocked doors, windows).
    *   **Social Engineering (Physical):**  Impersonating maintenance staff, delivery personnel, or other authorized individuals to gain access.
    *   **Forced Entry:**  In more sophisticated scenarios, attackers might attempt to physically breach doors, walls, or security barriers.
    *   **Exploiting Insider Threats:**  Colluding with or coercing individuals with legitimate physical access.

*   **Reaching the Server Hardware:** After gaining entry to the facility, the attacker needs to locate the specific server hosting SRS. This might involve navigating through server rooms or data centers, potentially bypassing further internal security layers.

*   **Direct Server Access:** Once physically at the server, the attacker has direct access to the hardware. This bypasses all network-based security controls like firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and network segmentation.

**Attack Scenarios:**

*   **Data Center Breach:**  Targeting a professional data center. This is typically more challenging due to robust security, but high-value targets might warrant sophisticated attacks.
*   **Office Server Room Breach:**  Targeting a server room within an office building. Security levels can vary greatly, making this a potentially easier target than a dedicated data center.
*   **On-Premise Server in Less Secure Location:**  In some deployments, SRS might be running on a server in a less secure location (e.g., a small office, a home lab, or even a publicly accessible location if misconfigured). This significantly increases the risk of physical access.

#### 4.2. Impact: Full System Compromise and Data Breach

**Detailed Impact on SRS and Associated Data:**

*   **Data Confidentiality Breach:**
    *   **Access to Live Stream Data:**  An attacker can intercept and record live streams being processed by SRS. This could include sensitive content depending on the application (e.g., surveillance feeds, private events, confidential meetings if SRS is used for such purposes).
    *   **Access to Recorded Streams:**  If SRS is configured to record streams, the attacker can access and exfiltrate these recordings. This could contain valuable or sensitive historical data.
    *   **Access to Configuration Files:**  SRS configuration files (e.g., `srs.conf`) contain sensitive information such as:
        *   **Administrative Credentials:**  Potentially stored in plaintext or easily reversible formats, allowing the attacker to gain administrative access to the SRS web interface or management APIs (if enabled).
        *   **Database Credentials:** If SRS integrates with a database for user management or other features, credentials might be exposed.
        *   **Encryption Keys/Certificates:**  If SRS uses TLS/SSL for secure streaming, private keys and certificates could be compromised, allowing decryption of past and future encrypted communications.
        *   **API Keys/Secrets:**  If SRS interacts with other services or APIs, exposed keys could grant access to those external systems.
    *   **Operating System Files and Data:**  Access to any data stored on the server's file system, including logs, temporary files, and potentially data from other applications running on the same server.

*   **Data Integrity Compromise:**
    *   **Malware Installation:**  The attacker can install malware, backdoors, rootkits, or keyloggers on the server. This allows for persistent access, data exfiltration, and further malicious activities.
    *   **System Configuration Modification:**  The attacker can modify the SRS configuration, operating system settings, or network configurations. This can disrupt services, redirect streams, or create vulnerabilities for future attacks.
    *   **Data Manipulation:**  In theory, an attacker could manipulate recorded streams or even inject malicious content into live streams, although this is more complex and less likely to be the primary goal of physical access.

*   **Service Availability Disruption:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can intentionally crash the SRS server, shut it down, or overload its resources, causing service outages.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:**  Malware installed by the attacker could consume server resources, degrading performance and potentially leading to service instability.
    *   **Hardware Damage/Theft:**  In extreme cases, the attacker could physically damage or steal the server hardware, causing a complete and prolonged service outage.

*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful physical access attack and subsequent data breach or service disruption can severely damage the reputation of the organization using SRS, especially if sensitive data is compromised or services are publicly facing.

#### 4.3. Mitigation: Layered Physical and Hardware Security

**Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies:**

Mitigation should be implemented in layers, following a defense-in-depth approach.

**4.3.1. Physical Security Measures (Perimeter and Facility Level):**

*   **Strong Perimeter Security:**
    *   **Physical Barriers:** Fencing, walls, and secure doors to deter unauthorized entry to the facility.
    *   **Security Personnel:**  Trained security guards or reception staff to control access and monitor the premises.
    *   **Surveillance Systems:**  CCTV cameras covering entrances, exits, server rooms, and critical areas, with recording and monitoring capabilities.
    *   **Alarm Systems:**  Intrusion detection systems with alarms triggered by unauthorized entry attempts.

*   **Access Control Systems:**
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (Physical):**  Implement access control systems requiring multiple factors for entry, such as:
        *   **Key Cards/Fobs:**  Proximity cards or key fobs for initial access.
        *   **Biometrics:**  Fingerprint scanners, retina scans, or facial recognition for higher security areas like server rooms.
        *   **PIN Codes:**  In combination with cards or biometrics.
    *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  Restrict physical access to server rooms and data centers to only authorized personnel based on their roles and responsibilities. Regularly review and update ACLs.
    *   **Visitor Management System:**  Implement a system for logging and tracking visitors, requiring identification and authorization before granting access.

*   **Environmental Controls:**
    *   **Secure Server Room/Data Center:**  Dedicated, physically secured rooms or data centers with reinforced doors, limited windows, and environmental controls (temperature, humidity).
    *   **Rack Security:**  Secure server racks with locks to prevent unauthorized access to individual servers within the room.

**4.3.2. Hardware Security Measures (Server Level):**

*   **BIOS/UEFI Security:**
    *   **BIOS/UEFI Passwords:**  Set strong passwords for BIOS/UEFI access to prevent unauthorized booting from external media or modification of boot settings.
    *   **Secure Boot:**  Enable Secure Boot to prevent loading of unauthorized operating systems or bootloaders.

*   **Disk Encryption:**
    *   **Full Disk Encryption (FDE):**  Encrypt the entire server hard drive(s) using technologies like LUKS (Linux), BitLocker (Windows), or hardware-based encryption. This protects data at rest if the server is stolen or disks are removed.  **Crucial for mitigating data breach even if physical access is gained.**

*   **Tamper-Evident Seals:**  Apply tamper-evident seals to server chassis to detect physical tampering.

*   **Physical Security Modules (TPM/HSM):**  Utilize Trusted Platform Modules (TPM) or Hardware Security Modules (HSM) to securely store encryption keys and other sensitive data, enhancing hardware-based security.

**4.3.3. Operational Security Measures:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege (Physical Access):**  Grant physical access only to personnel who absolutely require it for their job functions.
*   **Background Checks:**  Conduct thorough background checks on personnel with physical access to server locations.
*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Regularly train personnel on physical security procedures, social engineering awareness, and reporting suspicious activities.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct periodic physical security audits to identify weaknesses and vulnerabilities in access control, surveillance, and procedures.
*   **Incident Response Plan:**  Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for physical security breaches, including procedures for containment, investigation, and recovery.

**4.3.4. Monitoring and Logging:**

*   **Physical Access Logs:**  Maintain detailed logs of all physical access events, including who accessed which areas and when. Regularly review these logs for anomalies.
*   **CCTV Monitoring and Recording:**  Actively monitor CCTV feeds and retain recordings for a sufficient period to aid in incident investigation.
*   **Environmental Monitoring:**  Monitor environmental conditions (temperature, humidity) in server rooms and data centers to detect anomalies that could indicate physical intrusion or equipment malfunction.
*   **System Logs:**  Regularly monitor server system logs for unusual activity that might be a consequence of physical access (e.g., unexpected reboots, changes in user accounts, unusual network traffic after a potential physical breach).

**Conclusion:**

The "Physical Access -> Direct Server Access" attack path, while seemingly straightforward, poses a significant threat to SRS deployments.  A successful physical breach completely bypasses network-based defenses and grants the attacker extensive control over the server and its data.  Robust mitigation requires a layered approach encompassing strong physical security measures, hardware-level security controls, sound operational practices, and continuous monitoring.  Prioritizing physical security is paramount for protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of SRS and the services it provides. For SRS deployments handling sensitive or critical streaming data, investing in comprehensive physical security is not just recommended, but essential.
