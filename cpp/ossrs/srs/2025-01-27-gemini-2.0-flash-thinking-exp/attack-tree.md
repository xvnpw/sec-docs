## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit SRS Ingest Functionality -> Overload Ingest Resources (1.1.3)](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_srs_ingest_functionality_-_overload_ingest_resources__1_1_3_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker sends a large number of stream requests to the SRS server.
    *   These requests can be legitimate stream publishing requests or crafted to maximize resource consumption.
    *   The goal is to overwhelm the server's capacity to ingest and process streams.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - The SRS server becomes unresponsive or crashes, disrupting media streaming services.
    *   Legitimate users are unable to publish or consume streams.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on stream ingest requests.
    *   Configure resource limits for stream processing (e.g., maximum streams, bandwidth limits).
    *   Monitor server resource utilization (CPU, memory, network) and set up alerts for anomalies.
    *   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to distribute load and absorb some of the attack traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit SRS Control Plane (API/Management) -> API Vulnerabilities -> Authentication Bypass (2.1.1)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_srs_control_plane__apimanagement__-_api_vulnerabilities_-_authentication_bypass__2_1_1_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker attempts to bypass the authentication mechanisms protecting the SRS API.
    *   This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the authentication logic itself (e.g., flaws in token validation, session management).
    *   It could also involve exploiting default or weak credentials if they are used for API access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to the SRS control plane.
    *   Attacker can perform administrative actions, such as:
        *   Modifying server configuration.
        *   Stopping or restarting services.
        *   Accessing sensitive data exposed through the API.
        *   Potentially gaining code execution on the server depending on API functionality.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement strong and secure authentication mechanisms for the API (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0).
    *   Enforce strong password policies and avoid default credentials.
    *   Regularly audit and test API authentication logic for vulnerabilities.
    *   Use HTTPS to encrypt API communication and protect credentials in transit.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit SRS Control Plane (API/Management) -> API Vulnerabilities -> Command Injection (2.1.3.1)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_srs_control_plane__apimanagement__-_api_vulnerabilities_-_command_injection__2_1_3_1_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker identifies API endpoints that take user-supplied input and use it to construct system commands.
    *   By crafting malicious input, the attacker injects arbitrary commands into the system command execution.
    *   This allows the attacker to execute commands directly on the SRS server's operating system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Full server compromise.
    *   Attacker can:
        *   Gain complete control over the SRS server and the underlying operating system.
        *   Install malware, backdoors, or rootkits.
        *   Steal sensitive data.
        *   Disrupt services.
        *   Use the compromised server as a launchpad for further attacks.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Never use user-supplied input directly in system commands.
    *   If system commands are absolutely necessary, use secure alternatives to `system()` or `exec()`, if available in the programming language.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent command injection.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege - run SRS processes with minimal necessary permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit SRS Control Plane (API/Management) -> API Vulnerabilities -> Other Injection Types (2.1.3.3) - Specifically SQL Injection (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_srs_control_plane__apimanagement__-_api_vulnerabilities_-_other_injection_types__2_1_3_3__72aeae05.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   If SRS or its extensions use a database for configuration or data storage, and the API interacts with this database without proper input sanitization.
    *   Attacker crafts malicious SQL queries within API parameters.
    *   These malicious queries are injected into the database queries executed by the SRS application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Database compromise.
    *   Attacker can:
        *   Access, modify, or delete sensitive data stored in the database.
        *   Potentially gain control over the SRS application if database access is critical.
        *   In some cases, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain code execution on the database server or even the SRS server.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions. This prevents SQL injection by separating SQL code from user input.
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data that is used in database queries.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege - grant database access only to necessary SRS components and with minimal required permissions.
    *   Regularly audit and test database interactions for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit SRS Control Plane (API/Management) -> Configuration Vulnerabilities -> Insecure Default Configuration (2.2.1)](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_srs_control_plane__apimanagement__-_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_insecure_default_conf_1e8f0294.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   SRS is deployed with default configurations that are insecure.
    *   Examples include:
        *   Default administrative passwords.
        *   Exposed management ports or interfaces.
        *   Insecure default settings for access control or security features.
    *   Attacker exploits these default settings to gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Depending on the insecure default, impact can range from:
        *   Unauthorized access to management interfaces.
        *   Ability to modify server configuration.
        *   Full server compromise if default credentials provide administrative access.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Immediately change all default passwords upon deployment.**
    *   Review and harden all default configuration settings.
    *   Disable or restrict access to unnecessary features or ports.
    *   Regularly review and update security configurations.
    *   Use configuration management tools to enforce secure configurations consistently.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Server Software Vulnerabilities -> Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (3.1) - Buffer Overflows (3.1.1) and Use-After-Free (3.1.2)](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_server_software_vulnerabilities_-_memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__3_1__-_buffer_overfl_44fe03d9.md)

*   **Attack Vector (Buffer Overflow):**
    *   Attacker sends input to SRS (e.g., via stream metadata, protocol messages, API requests) that exceeds the allocated buffer size.
    *   This overwrites adjacent memory regions, potentially corrupting data or control flow.
    *   If control flow is overwritten, the attacker can redirect execution to malicious code.
*   **Attack Vector (Use-After-Free):**
    *   Attacker triggers a condition where memory that has been freed is accessed again by SRS code.
    *   This can lead to crashes, unexpected behavior, or potentially code execution if the freed memory has been reallocated for malicious purposes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Memory corruption vulnerabilities can lead to:
        *   Denial of Service (crashes).
        *   Code execution - Attacker gains control over the SRS server process.
        *   Information disclosure - Memory corruption can sometimes leak sensitive data.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Employ secure coding practices to prevent memory corruption vulnerabilities:
        *   Strict bounds checking for buffer operations.
        *   Proper memory management and resource handling.
        *   Use memory-safe programming languages or libraries where possible.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits to identify potential memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    *   Use memory sanitizers and fuzzing tools during development and testing to detect memory errors.
    *   Apply operating system-level protections like Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP).

    *   These libraries may contain known vulnerabilities.
    *   Attacker exploits these known vulnerabilities in the libraries used by SRS.
    *   Exploits for common library vulnerabilities are often publicly available.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the library, but can range from:
        *   Denial of Service.
        *   Information disclosure.
        *   Code execution - Leading to server compromise.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Maintain a comprehensive inventory of all third-party libraries used by SRS.
    *   Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known vulnerabilities in these libraries.
    *   Promptly update vulnerable libraries to patched versions.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to automate vulnerability detection in dependencies.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in library usage within SRS code.

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The operating system kernel on which SRS is running contains vulnerabilities.
    *   Attacker exploits these kernel vulnerabilities to gain elevated privileges or code execution at the kernel level.
    *   Kernel exploits are often more complex but provide the highest level of control.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Full system compromise.
    *   Attacker gains complete control over the entire server, including all processes and data.
    *   Can bypass all security measures implemented at the application level.
*   **Mitigation:**

        *   Stream content (audio and video).
        *   API credentials if transmitted in plaintext.
        *   Other sensitive data exchanged between clients and the SRS server.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Enforce encryption for all sensitive communication channels.**
        *   Use HTTPS for API access.
        *   Use secure streaming protocols where available (e.g., WebRTC with DTLS/SRTP).
    *   Secure the network infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access and sniffing.
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate the SRS server and limit the impact of network compromise.
    *   Use network intrusion detection systems to detect suspicious network activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Exploit Deployment Environment -> Physical Access (if applicable) -> Direct Server Access (4.3.1)](./attack_tree_paths/10__exploit_deployment_environment_-_physical_access__if_applicable__-_direct_server_access__4_3_1_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker gains physical access to the server hardware where SRS is running.
