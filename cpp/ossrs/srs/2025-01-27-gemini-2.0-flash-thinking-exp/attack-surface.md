# Attack Surface Analysis for ossrs/srs

## Attack Surface: [Exposed RTMP Port (TCP 1935)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_rtmp_port__tcp_1935_.md)

*   **Description:** SRS exposes TCP port 1935 for RTMP streaming, making it a direct entry point for network-based attacks targeting RTMP protocol vulnerabilities *within SRS*.
*   **SRS Contribution:** SRS *requires* this port to be open for RTMP streaming functionality, a core feature. Vulnerabilities in SRS's RTMP implementation directly contribute to the attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends specially crafted RTMP packets to port 1935 exploiting a buffer overflow vulnerability in **SRS's RTMP handling code**, leading to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Data Breach (if stream data is compromised).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep SRS Updated:** Regularly update SRS to the latest version to patch known RTMP vulnerabilities in SRS code.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the SRS server in a network segment with restricted access, limiting exposure to untrusted networks.
    *   **RTMP over TLS (RTMPS):**  Enable RTMPS to encrypt RTMP communication, protecting against eavesdropping and MITM attacks. Configure SRS and clients to use RTMPS.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP API Vulnerabilities (TCP 8080)](./attack_surfaces/http_api_vulnerabilities__tcp_8080_.md)

*   **Description:** SRS provides an HTTP API on TCP port 8080 for management and control. Vulnerabilities in *SRS's HTTP API implementation* can lead to unauthorized access and control of the SRS server.
*   **SRS Contribution:** SRS *implements* this HTTP API as a core management interface. Vulnerabilities in the API code are directly part of SRS's attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a command injection vulnerability in **SRS's HTTP API code** by sending a malicious request that executes arbitrary commands on the SRS server's operating system.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution, Server Takeover, Data Manipulation, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:**  Enable and enforce strong authentication and authorization for the HTTP API provided by SRS.
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Carefully sanitize all user inputs to the HTTP API *handled by SRS* to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant API access only to authorized users and applications with the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **HTTPS Only:**  Enforce HTTPS for all HTTP API communication to protect credentials and data in transit.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the HTTP API *provided by SRS*.

## Attack Surface: [Media Stream Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/media_stream_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** SRS processes incoming media streams. Malformed or malicious streams can exploit vulnerabilities in *SRS's media processing pipeline*.
*   **SRS Contribution:** SRS's *core function* is to process media streams. Vulnerabilities in how SRS handles and processes media data are a direct attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker streams a specially crafted RTMP stream containing malformed media data that triggers a buffer overflow in **SRS's media demuxing library *used by SRS***, leading to a crash or remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Remote Code Execution, Server Instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits within SRS (if available) to prevent malicious streams from consuming excessive resources and causing DoS.
    *   **Keep SRS Updated:** Regularly update SRS to benefit from patches for media processing vulnerabilities *within SRS and its dependencies*.
    *   **Consider Media Stream Sanitization/Transcoding (external to SRS):**  In some scenarios, consider using a separate media processing service to sanitize or transcode incoming streams *before* they are ingested by SRS, adding a layer of defense.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** SRS relies on third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited *through SRS*.
*   **SRS Contribution:** SRS *uses* external libraries (like FFmpeg, OpenSSL, etc.) for media processing and other functionalities. SRS's choice and integration of these dependencies directly contributes to its attack surface if those dependencies are vulnerable.
*   **Example:** SRS uses an outdated version of OpenSSL with a known vulnerability. An attacker exploits this OpenSSL vulnerability through a connection to SRS, gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the dependency vulnerability, including Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan SRS and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   **Dependency Updates:**  Keep SRS and its dependencies updated to the latest versions, including security patches.
    *   **Dependency Management:**  Use a robust dependency management system to track and manage SRS's dependencies.
    *   **Vendor Security Advisories:**  Monitor security advisories from SRS developers and the vendors of its dependencies.
