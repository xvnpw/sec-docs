# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ossrs/srs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Stream Name Validation](./mitigation_strategies/strict_stream_name_validation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Stream Name Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed Characters:**  Establish a strict whitelist of characters permitted in stream names within your application that will be passed to SRS. For example, allow only alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores.
    2.  **Implement Validation Logic (Application Level):** In your application's backend code, *before* interacting with SRS, create a function to validate incoming stream names against this whitelist.
    3.  **Enforce Length Limits (Application Level):** Set a maximum length for stream names in your application to prevent excessively long or crafted names being sent to SRS.
    4.  **Reject Invalid Names (Application Level):** If a stream name fails validation in your application, reject the request and do not pass it to SRS. Return an error to the user or client.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting shell commands via stream names that could be processed by SRS or backend systems if stream names are not properly sanitized before use in system commands (though SRS itself is designed to avoid direct shell command execution based on stream names, downstream systems interacting with SRS might be vulnerable).
    *   **Path Traversal (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers attempting to use special characters in stream names to manipulate file paths if stream names are used in file system operations by SRS plugins or integrated applications.
    *   **Input Fuzzing/Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):**  Invalid characters can cause unexpected behavior within SRS or integrated systems if not handled correctly, potentially leading to vulnerabilities or instability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Command Injection:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Path Traversal:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Input Fuzzing/Unexpected Behavior:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented in the backend API endpoint that handles stream creation and publishing requests. Validation logic is in the `StreamNameValidator` class in the `api/validators.py` file, *before* any interaction with SRS.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Client-side validation in the web application frontend is missing. While backend validation is crucial, client-side validation would provide immediate feedback to users and reduce unnecessary requests to the backend and SRS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Media Format and Codec Validation](./mitigation_strategies/media_format_and_codec_validation.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Media Format and Codec Validation
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Allowed Media Types:** Determine the specific media formats (e.g., H.264, VP9 for video; AAC, Opus for audio) and codecs that your application and SRS are designed to handle.
    2.  **Implement Validation at Encoding Stage (Application Level):** If your application controls media encoding *before* sending to SRS, integrate validation logic into your encoding pipeline to ensure only allowed formats and codecs are used.
    3.  **Verify Media Headers (If Possible - Application Level or SRS Plugin):**  Ideally, implement a mechanism (either in your application or as an SRS plugin if feasible) to inspect media stream headers to confirm the declared format and codec match the expected types *before* SRS fully processes the stream.
    4.  **Reject Invalid Media (Application Level or SRS Plugin):** If the media format or codec is not on the allowed list, reject the stream *before* or as early as possible in SRS processing and log the event.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Media Processing Vulnerabilities (High to Medium Severity):**  Processing unexpected or malformed media formats could potentially trigger vulnerabilities in SRS's media processing libraries or underlying codecs. While SRS is designed to be robust, unexpected inputs can always introduce risks.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Processing computationally expensive or unusual media formats could lead to excessive resource consumption on the SRS server, impacting performance and potentially leading to denial of service.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Sending streams with formats that SRS cannot handle efficiently or are designed to exploit processing weaknesses could be used to overload the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Media Processing Vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Validation is performed at the encoding stage for video streams using our custom encoding service *before* sending to SRS. However, audio codec validation at the encoding stage and validation at the SRS ingress point are not yet implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Audio codec validation needs to be added to the encoding service.  Crucially, implement validation *at the SRS ingress point*. This could be achieved through:
    *   Developing a custom SRS plugin to inspect media headers upon stream reception.
    *   Using SRS's HTTP callback features (`publish_auth`) to perform format validation in your application before allowing SRS to accept the stream.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure SRS Control API Access](./mitigation_strategies/secure_srs_control_api_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure SRS Control API Access
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement API Key Authentication (SRS Configuration & Reverse Proxy):** Configure a reverse proxy (like Nginx) in front of SRS to handle authentication.  Generate unique API keys for authorized services or users that need to access the SRS HTTP API. Configure the reverse proxy to verify API keys before forwarding requests to SRS.
    2.  **Enforce API Key Verification (Reverse Proxy):**  Configure the reverse proxy to require a valid API key in headers or query parameters for all requests to the SRS API endpoints.
    3.  **Use HTTPS (SRS Configuration & Reverse Proxy):** Ensure both the reverse proxy and SRS are configured to use HTTPS for all API communication to protect API keys and sensitive data in transit. Configure SRS to listen on HTTPS for API if directly exposed, or ensure the reverse proxy handles HTTPS termination.
    4.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Application Level & Reverse Proxy Configuration):** Grant API access only to the specific SRS API endpoints and actions required for each service or user. Configure the reverse proxy to restrict access based on API keys to specific API paths if possible. Avoid giving broad administrative access unnecessarily.
    5.  **Regularly Rotate API Keys (Application Level):** Implement a process in your application for periodically rotating API keys to limit the impact of compromised keys.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to SRS Management (High Severity):**  Without proper authentication on the SRS API, attackers could gain access to SRS's control API and perform administrative actions, potentially leading to complete server compromise or service disruption.
    *   **Data Breaches (Medium Severity):**  If the API is used to retrieve sensitive information about streams or server configuration, unauthorized access could lead to data breaches.
    *   **Configuration Tampering (High Severity):**  Attackers could modify SRS configuration through the API, leading to security vulnerabilities or service instability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to SRS Management:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Configuration Tampering:** High Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, API key authentication is implemented using a reverse proxy (Nginx) in front of SRS.  HTTPS is enforced for all API traffic through the reverse proxy and SRS is configured for HTTPS API.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  API key rotation is not yet automated and is a manual process.  Granular access control based on specific API endpoints via the reverse proxy based on API keys is not fully implemented; currently, API keys provide access to all API endpoints behind the proxy.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stream Publishing and Playback Authentication](./mitigation_strategies/stream_publishing_and_playback_authentication.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Stream Publishing and Playback Authentication
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Authentication Method (SRS Configuration):** Select an appropriate authentication method supported by SRS, such as token-based authentication or HTTP callback authentication.
    2.  **Configure SRS Authentication (`srs.conf`):**  Enable and configure the chosen authentication method in SRS's configuration file (`srs.conf`).
        *   **Token-based:** Set `token_verify_key` and `token_client_id` in `srs.conf`.
        *   **HTTP Callback:** Configure `publish_auth` and `play_auth` directives in `srs.conf` to point to your application's authentication endpoints.
    3.  **Implement Authentication Logic in Application (Application Level):**
        *   **Token-based:** Generate tokens in your application's backend when a user is authorized to publish or play a stream. Pass the token to the client, which then includes it in the stream URL.
        *   **HTTP Callback:** Create API endpoints in your application that SRS will call (via HTTP requests) to authenticate publish and play requests. Implement your authorization logic in these endpoints.
    4.  **Enforce Authentication (SRS Configuration):** Ensure that SRS is configured to reject publish and play requests that do not pass authentication according to the configured method.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Stream Publishing (High Severity):**  Without authentication in SRS, anyone could publish streams to your SRS server, potentially injecting malicious content, disrupting service, or using your infrastructure for illegal activities.
    *   **Unauthorized Stream Playback (Medium Severity):**  If streams contain sensitive content, unauthorized playback through SRS could lead to data leaks or privacy violations.
    *   **Resource Abuse (Medium Severity):**  Unauthorized publishing and playback can consume SRS server resources and bandwidth, leading to performance degradation or increased costs.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Stream Publishing:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Unauthorized Stream Playback:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Resource Abuse:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, token-based authentication is implemented for both publishing and playback in SRS using `token_verify_key` and `token_client_id` in `srs.conf`. Tokens are generated by our backend service upon successful user authentication and appended to stream URLs.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  HTTP callback authentication is not implemented, which would allow for more complex and dynamic authorization logic directly integrated with our application's user management system and stream permission models. Token expiration and revocation mechanisms within SRS or integrated with our token generation are also not fully implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary SRS Features and Protocols](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_srs_features_and_protocols.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Unnecessary SRS Features and Protocols
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Required Protocols and Features (Application Requirements):** Analyze your application's requirements and determine the specific streaming protocols (e.g., WebRTC, HLS, RTMP) and SRS features that are actually needed.
    2.  **Disable Unused Protocols in `srs.conf` (SRS Configuration):**  Open `srs.conf` and comment out or remove configurations for protocols that are not required. For example, if only using WebRTC, disable RTMP and HLS sections.
    3.  **Disable Unused Modules in `srs.conf` (SRS Configuration):** If SRS modules (like HTTP-FLV, HTTP-TS, etc.) are not needed, disable them by commenting out or removing their configurations in `srs.conf`.
    4.  **Minimize Enabled Features in `srs.conf` (SRS Configuration):** Review all enabled features in `srs.conf` and disable any that are not essential for your application's functionality. This includes less commonly used features or experimental modules if not explicitly required.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface (Medium Severity):**  Disabling unused features and protocols in SRS reduces the overall attack surface of the SRS server by eliminating potential vulnerabilities in those components that are not actively used and maintained in your specific deployment context.
    *   **Complexity Reduction (Low Severity):**  Simplifying the SRS configuration makes it easier to manage, audit for security issues, and understand the running services, reducing potential misconfigurations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Complexity Reduction:** Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. RTMP protocol is disabled in `srs.conf` as it's not used in our application. HLS is enabled in `srs.conf` for potential future use but is currently not actively used.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  HLS protocol should be disabled in `srs.conf` if it's not actively planned for immediate use.  A thorough review of all enabled SRS modules and features in `srs.conf` is needed to identify and disable any other unnecessary components to further minimize the attack surface.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Access to SRS Management Ports](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_access_to_srs_management_ports.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Access to SRS Management Ports
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify SRS Management Ports (SRS Documentation):** Determine the ports used by SRS for management interfaces. By default, the HTTP API port is 8080. Check SRS documentation for other management or monitoring ports if enabled.
    2.  **Implement Firewall Rules (Operating System or Network Firewall):** Configure a firewall (e.g., `iptables` on the SRS server OS, cloud provider firewalls, network security groups) to restrict access to these identified SRS management ports.
    3.  **Whitelist Trusted Networks/IPs (Firewall Configuration):**  Allow access to SRS management ports only from trusted networks or specific IP addresses that require administrative access. This should typically be your internal network or specific administrator's IP addresses.
    4.  **Block Public Access (Firewall Configuration):**  Ensure that SRS management ports are *not* directly accessible from the public internet by default in your firewall rules.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to SRS Management (High Severity):**  If SRS management ports are publicly accessible, attackers could attempt to access the SRS API or other management interfaces without authentication (or exploit weak authentication if present).
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):**  Exposed SRS management interfaces might reveal sensitive information about the SRS server configuration, running streams, or internal status, even without successful authentication bypass.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to SRS Management:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, firewall rules are in place at the cloud provider level to restrict access to the SRS HTTP API port (8080) and other potentially sensitive ports. Access is only allowed from our internal network and specific administrator IPs.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Regularly review and audit firewall rules to ensure they remain correctly configured and that the whitelist of trusted IPs is up-to-date. Consider implementing network segmentation to further isolate the SRS server within a dedicated security zone, limiting even internal network access to only necessary systems.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure SRS Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/configure_srs_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure SRS Rate Limiting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Traffic Patterns (Application & SRS Usage):**  Understand your expected traffic volume and connection patterns to SRS. Consider peak usage, typical client behavior, and server capacity.
    2.  **Set `max_connections` in `srs.conf` (SRS Configuration):**  Configure the `max_connections` directive in `srs.conf` to limit the maximum number of concurrent connections SRS will accept globally. Set this value based on your server capacity and expected legitimate load, leaving some headroom for traffic spikes but preventing overload.
    3.  **Set `max_streams_per_client` in `srs.conf` (SRS Configuration):** Configure `max_streams_per_client` in `srs.conf` to limit the number of streams a single client (identified by IP address) can publish or play concurrently. This is crucial to prevent abuse from a single compromised client or malicious actor attempting to exhaust resources.
    4.  **Tune Limits Gradually (Monitoring & Testing):** Start with conservative rate limits in `srs.conf` and gradually adjust them upwards based on monitoring SRS performance, observing legitimate user traffic, and conducting load/performance testing to find optimal values that balance security and usability.
    5.  **Monitor Rate Limiting Effectiveness (SRS Logs & Monitoring):** Monitor SRS logs and metrics (e.g., connection rejections, error rates) to ensure rate limiting is functioning as expected and is effectively mitigating potential DoS attempts without impacting legitimate users.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium to High Severity):**  SRS rate limiting can mitigate certain types of DoS attacks that attempt to overwhelm the server with excessive connection requests or stream creation attempts by limiting the server's acceptance rate.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Limiting connections and streams helps prevent resource exhaustion on the SRS server caused by legitimate but excessive traffic spikes or abusive clients attempting to consume disproportionate resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, `max_connections` and `max_streams_per_client` are configured in `srs.conf` with values based on initial capacity planning and estimations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Rate limiting configuration in `srs.conf` needs to be dynamically adjusted based on real-time server load and observed traffic patterns. Currently, the limits are static. More granular rate limiting within SRS, potentially based on specific client IPs, stream types, or authentication status, could be considered for enhanced DoS protection but may require custom SRS plugin development or advanced configuration not readily available out-of-the-box.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Monitoring and Alerting (SRS Specific Metrics)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_monitoring_and_alerting__srs_specific_metrics_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Monitoring and Alerting (SRS Specific Metrics)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Monitoring Tools (General Monitoring Infrastructure):** Utilize monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, or cloud provider monitoring solutions) that can track SRS server resources (CPU, memory, network, disk I/O) *and* SRS-specific metrics exposed by SRS itself (connections, streams, errors, API request latency, etc.).
    2.  **Configure Monitoring Agents (SRS Server):** Install monitoring agents on the SRS server to collect both system-level resource metrics and SRS-specific metrics. SRS often exposes metrics via HTTP endpoints (e.g., Prometheus exporter).
    3.  **Set Up Dashboards (Monitoring Tool):** Create dashboards in your monitoring tool to visualize SRS resource usage and key performance indicators (KPIs), including both system resources and SRS internal metrics. Focus on metrics relevant to security and performance.
    4.  **Define Alert Thresholds (Monitoring Tool):**  Establish thresholds for both system resource usage (e.g., CPU > 90%, memory > 80%) *and* SRS-specific metrics (e.g., sudden spikes in connection attempts, stream errors exceeding a rate, API error rate increase) that indicate potential issues, attacks, or performance degradation.
    5.  **Configure Alert Notifications (Monitoring Tool):** Set up alerts in your monitoring tool to automatically notify administrators (via email, SMS, or other channels) when defined thresholds are breached for both system and SRS-specific metrics.
    6.  **Regularly Review Monitoring Data (Operational Process):**  Periodically review monitoring data and dashboards to identify trends, performance bottlenecks, and potential security incidents. Pay attention to both system resource trends and SRS-specific metric anomalies.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Early detection of resource exhaustion on the SRS server or unusual activity patterns (e.g., connection spikes) through monitoring and alerting allows for timely manual intervention to mitigate DoS attacks or investigate suspicious behavior.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Low Severity):**  Monitoring SRS performance metrics helps identify performance bottlenecks within SRS itself or related to resource constraints, allowing for proactive optimization of SRS configuration or server resources and preventing service degradation.
    *   **System Instability (Low Severity):**  Monitoring can detect resource issues or internal SRS errors that could lead to system instability or crashes, enabling preventative maintenance or configuration adjustments.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Medium Risk Reduction (Improved Response Time)
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Low Risk Reduction (Improved Uptime and Performance)
    *   **System Instability:** Low Risk Reduction (Improved Uptime)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, we use Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring SRS server resources. Dashboards are set up, and basic alerts are configured for high CPU and memory usage. We also monitor some basic SRS connection metrics.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Alerting for *SRS-specific security-relevant metrics* (e.g., sudden spikes in connection attempts, stream errors, API errors, authentication failures) is not yet fully implemented.  We need to expand monitoring to include more detailed SRS internal metrics and configure alerts specifically for security-related anomalies within SRS activity.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular SRS Updates and Patching](./mitigation_strategies/regular_srs_updates_and_patching.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular SRS Updates and Patching
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor SRS Release Notes (SRS GitHub & Community Channels):**  Actively monitor SRS release announcements, security advisories, and changelogs. Subscribe to SRS GitHub releases, community mailing lists, or forums to stay informed about new versions, feature updates, *and especially security updates and patches*.
    2.  **Establish Update Schedule (Operational Process):**  Define a regular schedule for reviewing and applying SRS updates and patches. A monthly or quarterly review cycle is recommended, but critical security patches should be applied *immediately* upon release.
    3.  **Test Updates in Staging (Pre-Production Environment):**  *Before* applying any SRS updates or patches to production servers, thoroughly test them in a dedicated staging environment that mirrors your production setup as closely as possible. This testing should include functional testing of your application with the updated SRS version and performance/stability testing.
    4.  **Apply Updates Promptly (Operational Process):**  Apply security patches and updates to production SRS servers as soon as possible after they are released and successfully tested in staging, especially for vulnerabilities classified as critical or high severity.
    5.  **Document Update Process (Operational Documentation):**  Document the SRS update process step-by-step for consistency, repeatability, and to ensure all necessary steps (staging testing, backup procedures, rollback plans) are followed during each update cycle.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Regular SRS updates and patching directly address known security vulnerabilities within the SRS codebase. Failing to update leaves your SRS server vulnerable to exploits for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity - Reduced Exposure):**  While updates cannot prevent zero-day vulnerabilities, staying up-to-date with the latest SRS version and security practices reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered zero-day vulnerabilities before patches become available.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Medium Risk Reduction (Reduced Exposure Time)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We monitor SRS releases on GitHub but the update process is currently manual and not consistently followed on a regular schedule. Testing in staging is performed, but not always comprehensively before production updates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Automate the SRS update process as much as possible. This could involve scripting the update process, including automated testing in staging and streamlined deployment to production.  Establish a clear and *enforced* schedule for regular SRS updates and patching, especially for security releases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize SRS Installation Footprint](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_srs_installation_footprint.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Minimize SRS Installation Footprint
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install Only Necessary Components (SRS Installation Process):** When initially installing SRS, carefully select and install *only* the core components, modules, and dependencies that are strictly required for your application's specific functionality. Avoid installing optional or unnecessary features, protocols, or modules that you do not intend to use.
    2.  **Remove Unnecessary Files (Post-Installation Hardening):** After the initial SRS installation, review the installation directory and remove any unnecessary files, documentation, example configurations, or development tools that are not needed for production operation.
    3.  **Disable Unused Services (Operating System Level):** Ensure that any system services or daemons that were installed as dependencies of SRS or are part of the base OS but are not required for SRS to function (or for other essential services on the server) are disabled at the operating system level.
    4.  **Regularly Review Installation (Periodic Security Review):** Periodically (e.g., during security audits or update cycles) review the SRS installation and server environment to identify and remove any unnecessary files, components, or services that may have been added unintentionally over time or are no longer required.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface (Medium Severity):**  Minimizing the SRS installation footprint directly reduces the attack surface of the SRS server. By removing unnecessary components, you eliminate potential entry points for attackers and reduce the number of code paths that could contain vulnerabilities.
    *   **Complexity Reduction (Low Severity):**  A smaller and more streamlined SRS installation is inherently easier to manage, audit for security issues, and understand. This reduces the likelihood of misconfigurations and simplifies security maintenance.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Reduced Attack Surface:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Complexity Reduction:** Low Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We generally aim to install only the core SRS components during initial setup. However, a formal, documented process for systematically minimizing the installation footprint and regularly reviewing it for unnecessary components is not currently in place.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Develop a detailed checklist or procedure for minimizing the SRS installation footprint during initial setup and for periodic review. This checklist should include specific files, directories, modules, and services that can be safely removed or disabled based on our application's requirements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (SRS Focused)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_audits_and_penetration_testing__srs_focused_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing (SRS Focused)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule Regular Audits/Tests (Security Program):**  Plan and schedule periodic security audits and penetration testing exercises that are *specifically focused* on your SRS deployment and its integration with your application. These should be conducted at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes are made to the SRS infrastructure or application.
    2.  **Define Scope (Audit/Test Planning):**  Clearly define the scope of each security audit and penetration test to *specifically include* the SRS server itself, its configuration, all exposed SRS APIs (control API, streaming protocols), authentication mechanisms, and the interaction between SRS and your application.
    3.  **Engage Security Professionals (External Expertise):**  Consider engaging external cybersecurity professionals or specialized security firms to conduct these SRS-focused audits and penetration tests. External experts bring an independent and unbiased perspective and specialized skills in identifying streaming server vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Address Findings (Remediation Process):**  Establish a clear process for promptly addressing vulnerabilities and weaknesses identified during security audits and penetration tests. Prioritize remediation based on the severity of the findings and the potential impact on your application and users.
    5.  **Retest After Remediation (Verification):**  After implementing remediation measures to address identified vulnerabilities, conduct retesting (either internally or by the external security professionals) to verify the effectiveness of the fixes and ensure that the vulnerabilities have been properly resolved.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Undiscovered Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  SRS-focused security audits and penetration testing can proactively identify vulnerabilities in the SRS server, its configuration, or its integration with your application that may have been missed during development, deployment, or standard security practices.
    *   **Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):**  Security assessments can uncover misconfigurations within SRS or related infrastructure that could inadvertently introduce security vulnerabilities or weaken existing security controls.
    *   **Weaknesses in Security Controls (Medium Severity):**  Audits can specifically evaluate the effectiveness of implemented security controls around SRS (authentication, authorization, access controls, rate limiting, etc.) and identify any weaknesses or bypasses.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Undiscovered Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Configuration Errors:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Weaknesses in Security Controls:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, regular security audits and penetration testing *specifically targeting our SRS deployment* are not currently performed. General application security audits are conducted, but SRS-specific aspects are not deeply and systematically assessed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Establish a formal program for regular, SRS-focused security audits and penetration testing of our SRS infrastructure and application integration. Allocate budget and resources for engaging security professionals with expertise in streaming server security and for systematically addressing and verifying the findings from these assessments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Comprehensive SRS Logging](./mitigation_strategies/enable_comprehensive_srs_logging.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Comprehensive SRS Logging
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Logging Levels in `srs.conf` (SRS Configuration):**  Set appropriate logging levels in `srs.conf` to ensure SRS logs capture a comprehensive range of events.  Use logging levels like `trace`, `debug`, `info`, `warn`, `error`, and `fatal` strategically to capture sufficient detail without overwhelming logs. For security purposes, ensure at least `info` level logging is enabled, and consider `debug` or `trace` for specific security-sensitive components or during troubleshooting.
    2.  **Log to Files or Syslog (`srs.conf` Configuration):**  Configure SRS to log to appropriate destinations. Logging to files on the SRS server is common, but for centralized log management and security analysis, configure SRS to log to syslog. Syslog allows forwarding logs to a dedicated log management system.
    3.  **Include Relevant Information (SRS Configuration & Logging Format):**  Ensure SRS logs include sufficient detail for security analysis, incident response, and troubleshooting. Logs should include timestamps, client IPs, stream names, user identifiers (if applicable through authentication), error codes, request URIs, and any security-related events (authentication attempts, authorization failures, etc.). Customize the SRS log format if necessary to include all relevant fields.
    4.  **Rotate Logs (`srs.conf` or OS Level):**  Implement log rotation for SRS logs to prevent log files from growing excessively large and consuming disk space. SRS itself has built-in log rotation options in `srs.conf`. Alternatively, use OS-level log rotation tools (like `logrotate` on Linux) for more advanced rotation and compression policies.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Incident Detection (Medium Severity):**  Comprehensive SRS logging is essential for detecting security incidents. Detailed logs provide the necessary information to identify unauthorized access attempts, attacks, suspicious activity patterns, and security breaches.
    *   **Forensics and Incident Response (Medium Severity):**  Detailed SRS logs are crucial for forensic analysis and effective incident response after a security breach or suspected attack. Logs provide a historical record of events, allowing security teams to reconstruct attack timelines, identify affected systems, and understand the scope of the incident.
    *   **Troubleshooting and Debugging (Low Severity):**  While primarily for security, comprehensive logs are also invaluable for troubleshooting operational issues, debugging problems with SRS configuration, and diagnosing streaming errors.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Incident Detection:** Medium Risk Reduction (Improved Detection Capability)
    *   **Forensics and Incident Response:** Medium Risk Reduction (Improved Incident Response)
    *   **Troubleshooting and Debugging:** Low Risk Reduction (Improved Operational Efficiency)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, SRS logging is enabled and configured to log to files on the SRS server. Basic logging levels are set in `srs.conf`, but the level of detail and the specific events logged may not be fully comprehensive for security monitoring. Log rotation is implemented using SRS's built-in rotation features.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Review and enhance SRS logging configuration in `srs.conf` to ensure comprehensive logging of *security-relevant events*. This includes logging authentication attempts (successes and failures), authorization decisions, API access logs, and any security-related errors or warnings generated by SRS. Consider configuring SRS to log to syslog for centralized log management instead of just local files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Centralized Log Management and Analysis (SRS Logs)](./mitigation_strategies/centralized_log_management_and_analysis__srs_logs_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Centralized Log Management and Analysis (SRS Logs)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Log Management System (Security Infrastructure):** Select a centralized log management system (e.g., ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana), Splunk, Graylog, cloud-based SIEM solutions) to collect, store, index, and analyze SRS logs from all SRS servers in your deployment.
    2.  **Configure Log Forwarding (SRS Configuration & Log Shippers):** Configure SRS to forward its logs to the chosen log management system. If using syslog, SRS can directly forward logs. For file-based logs, deploy log shippers (e.g., Filebeat, Fluentd) on each SRS server to collect and forward log files to the central system.
    3.  **Implement Log Parsing and Indexing (Log Management System Configuration):** Configure the log management system to properly parse and index SRS logs. Define parsing rules to extract relevant fields from SRS log messages (timestamps, IPs, stream names, event types, error codes) to make logs searchable and analyzable.
    4.  **Create Dashboards and Visualizations (Log Management System):**  Build dashboards and visualizations within the log management system specifically for SRS logs. Create dashboards to monitor SRS activity, track key metrics, visualize security-relevant events, identify trends, and detect anomalies in SRS behavior.
    5.  **Set Up Automated Alerts (Log Management System):**  Configure automated alerts within the log management system to proactively notify administrators of suspicious patterns or security incidents detected in SRS logs. Define alert rules based on log patterns indicative of attacks, unauthorized access, errors, or performance issues. Examples include alerts for repeated authentication failures, unusual API access patterns, or spikes in error logs.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Security Incident Detection (High Severity):**  Centralized log management and analysis of SRS logs enables proactive and timely detection of security incidents and attacks targeting SRS. By analyzing aggregated logs from all SRS servers, you can identify suspicious patterns and anomalies that might be missed in individual server logs.
    *   **Faster Incident Response (Medium Severity):**  Centralized logs and analysis tools significantly facilitate faster and more efficient incident response. Security teams can quickly access and search through consolidated SRS logs to investigate security alerts, reconstruct attack timelines, and identify the scope of security incidents.
    *   **Improved Security Monitoring (Medium Severity):**  Centralized log analysis provides ongoing security monitoring and enhanced visibility into SRS activity across your entire deployment. This allows for continuous improvement of your security posture by identifying trends, detecting emerging threats, and proactively addressing potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Security Incident Detection:** High Risk Reduction (Proactive Detection)
    *   **Faster Incident Response:** Medium Risk Reduction (Improved Response Time)
    *   **Improved Security Monitoring:** Medium Risk Reduction (Continuous Improvement)
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, centralized log management for SRS logs is not currently implemented. SRS logs are stored locally on each SRS server and are not aggregated or actively analyzed in a central system.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement a centralized log management system and configure SRS to forward its logs to it (ideally via syslog). Develop log parsing rules, indexing configurations, security-focused dashboards, visualizations, and automated alerts within the log management system specifically for SRS logs to enable proactive security monitoring and incident detection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Real-time Monitoring of SRS Activity (Security Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/real-time_monitoring_of_srs_activity__security_focus_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Real-time Monitoring of SRS Activity (Security Focus)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Monitoring Tools (Same as Resource Monitoring, but Security Focused):** Leverage the same monitoring tools used for resource monitoring (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) but focus on tracking *real-time SRS activity metrics that are relevant to security*. This includes metrics like:
        *   Number of active connections (monitor for sudden spikes).
        *   Number of active streams (monitor for unusual increases).
        *   Authentication success and failure rates (monitor for high failure rates indicating brute-force attempts).
        *   API request rates and error rates (monitor for unusual API activity or errors).
        *   Stream error rates (monitor for potential stream manipulation or DoS attempts).
    2.  **Create Real-time Security Dashboards (Monitoring Tool):**  Build dedicated real-time dashboards in your monitoring tool specifically designed to visualize these security-relevant SRS activity metrics. Design dashboards to highlight anomalies and suspicious patterns.
    3.  **Set Up Real-time Security Alerts (Monitoring Tool):**  Configure real-time alerts to immediately notify administrators when suspicious activity is detected based on these security-focused SRS metrics. Define alert thresholds for:
        *   Sudden spikes in connection attempts or active connections.
        *   High rates of authentication failures.
        *   Unusual API request patterns or error rates.
        *   Elevated stream error rates.
    4.  **Integrate with SIEM (Optional but Recommended - Security Infrastructure):**  Consider integrating real-time SRS monitoring data with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system. SIEM systems can correlate real-time SRS activity with security events from other systems (firewalls, intrusion detection, application logs) to provide broader security context and enable more sophisticated threat detection and incident response.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Active Attack Detection (High Severity):**  Real-time monitoring of security-relevant SRS activity metrics enables immediate detection of active attacks or ongoing security incidents targeting SRS. This allows for rapid response and mitigation efforts while an attack is in progress.
    *   **Rapid Incident Response (High Severity):**  Real-time security alerts triggered by suspicious SRS activity facilitate rapid incident response. Administrators can be immediately notified of potential attacks and take action to investigate and contain the incident.
    *   **Proactive Threat Detection (Medium Severity):**  Analyzing real-time SRS activity patterns can help identify potential threats or vulnerabilities *before* they are fully exploited. For example, detecting a sudden increase in authentication failures might indicate a brute-force attack in progress, allowing for proactive blocking or mitigation measures.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Active Attack Detection:** High Risk Reduction (Immediate Detection)
    *   **Rapid Incident Response:** High Risk Reduction (Faster Response Time)
    *   **Proactive Threat Detection:** Medium Risk Reduction (Early Warning)
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We have real-time dashboards for basic SRS resource metrics and some basic connection metrics. Real-time monitoring of *security-specific SRS activity metrics* (authentication failures, API error rates, stream error rates) is not fully implemented. Basic alerts are in place for resource thresholds, but security-focused real-time alerts are missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Enhance real-time monitoring to specifically include SRS-specific activity metrics that are critical for security monitoring (authentication, API, stream errors). Develop real-time security alerts based on these metrics to proactively detect and respond to suspicious activity and potential attacks targeting SRS in real-time. Explore integration with a SIEM system for enhanced correlation and broader security context.
