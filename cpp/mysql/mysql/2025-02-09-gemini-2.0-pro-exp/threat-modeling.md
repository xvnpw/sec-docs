# Threat Model Analysis for mysql/mysql

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Network Eavesdropping](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_network_eavesdropping.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker on the same network segment as the client or server, or with access to network infrastructure, uses packet sniffing to capture unencrypted MySQL traffic, including usernames, passwords, and query data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of database credentials and data.  Attacker can read, modify, or delete data.
    *   **MySQL Component Affected:** Network communication layer (primarily the MySQL client/server protocol).  This affects all components that rely on network communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory TLS/SSL Encryption:** Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for *all* MySQL connections.  Configure both the server and clients to require encrypted connections.  Verify server certificates on the client side.  Use strong cipher suites.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the database server on a separate, secure network segment to limit exposure to eavesdropping.
        *   **VPN/SSH Tunneling:** If TLS/SSL is not feasible (e.g., legacy applications), use a VPN or SSH tunnel to encrypt the connection between the client and server.

## Threat: [Brute-Force Authentication Attack](./threats/brute-force_authentication_attack.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess MySQL user credentials by repeatedly trying different username/password combinations.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database with the privileges of the compromised account.
    *   **MySQL Component Affected:** Authentication system (specifically, the `mysql_native_password`, `caching_sha2_password`, or other authentication plugins).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce strong password policies (length, complexity, regular changes).
        *   **Account Lockout:** Implement account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts (using a plugin or external mechanism).
        *   **Connection Limits:** Limit the number of connections per user and per IP address to slow down brute-force attempts.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all MySQL user accounts, especially privileged accounts.
        *   **Monitor Logs:** Regularly monitor MySQL logs for failed login attempts and suspicious IP addresses.

## Threat: [SQL Injection (Targeting MySQL Itself)](./threats/sql_injection__targeting_mysql_itself_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities *within MySQL itself* could allow an attacker with *some* database access (even limited) to inject malicious SQL code that exploits a bug in the server. This is distinct from application-level SQLi.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution on the database server, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **MySQL Component Affected:** SQL parser, query execution engine, stored procedure/function handling, specific vulnerable functions or modules (depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Patching:** Keep MySQL server updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities. This is the *primary* defense.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary privileges.  Avoid granting `SUPER` or other powerful privileges unnecessarily.
        *   **Input Validation (Server-Side):** While primarily an application-level concern, any server-side code (e.g., stored procedures) should also validate input.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the MySQL server for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Connections)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__connections_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker opens a large number of connections to the MySQL server, exceeding the configured limits and preventing legitimate users from connecting.
    *   **Impact:** Database service becomes unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **MySQL Component Affected:** Connection handling (`max_connections` system variable, thread management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Connection Limits:** Configure appropriate values for `max_connections` (global) and per-user connection limits.
        *   **Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for idle connections (`wait_timeout`, `interactive_timeout`).
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor the number of active connections and set alerts for unusual spikes.
        *   **Firewall:** Restrict access to the MySQL port (default 3306) to only authorized IP addresses.
        *   **Load Balancer:** Use a load balancer to distribute connections across multiple MySQL servers (if applicable).

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Memory/CPU)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__memorycpu_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends complex or malicious queries designed to consume excessive CPU or memory resources, causing the server to slow down or crash.
    *   **Impact:** Database service becomes slow or unavailable.
    *   **MySQL Component Affected:** Query optimizer, query execution engine, memory allocation, storage engine (e.g., InnoDB buffer pool).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Query Optimization:** Review and optimize application queries to avoid resource-intensive operations.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Configure resource limits (e.g., `max_execution_time`, memory limits for specific operations) to prevent runaway queries.
        *   **Slow Query Log:** Enable the slow query log to identify and analyze queries that consume excessive resources.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor CPU and memory usage and set alerts for high utilization.
        *   **Prepared Statements:** Use prepared statements to reduce parsing overhead and prevent certain types of malicious queries.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Misconfigured Stored Routines](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_misconfigured_stored_routines.md)

*   **Description:** A stored procedure or function is created with `SQL SECURITY DEFINER`, and the definer has high privileges. An attacker who can execute this routine gains the definer's privileges, even if the attacker's own account has limited access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and potential for further privilege escalation.
    *   **MySQL Component Affected:** Stored procedure/function execution, `SQL SECURITY` attribute.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`SQL SECURITY INVOKER`:** Use `SQL SECURITY INVOKER` instead of `SQL SECURITY DEFINER` whenever possible. This ensures the routine executes with the caller's privileges.
        *   **Least Privilege (Definer):** If `SQL SECURITY DEFINER` is absolutely necessary, ensure the definer account has the *absolute minimum* privileges required for the routine to function.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review the code of stored routines to ensure they do not contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited.
        *   **Restricted Creation:** Limit the users who have the privilege to create stored routines.

## Threat: [Data Corruption via Storage Engine Bugs](./threats/data_corruption_via_storage_engine_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** A bug in the storage engine (e.g., InnoDB, MyISAM) could lead to data corruption or loss, either due to a specific query, a crash, or other circumstances.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data inconsistency, database unavailability.
    *   **MySQL Component Affected:** Storage engine (InnoDB, MyISAM, etc.), data files, transaction logs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Patching:** Keep MySQL server updated to the latest version to patch known storage engine bugs.
        *   **Backups:** Implement a robust backup and recovery strategy, including regular backups and verification of backup integrity.
        *   **RAID:** Use RAID for data redundancy at the hardware level.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor server logs for errors related to the storage engine.
        *   **`innodb_force_recovery` (InnoDB):** Understand and use `innodb_force_recovery` options appropriately in case of InnoDB corruption (but only as a last resort).

## Threat: [Binary Log Manipulation](./threats/binary_log_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (e.g., FILE privilege or OS-level access) modifies or deletes binary log files to cover their tracks after a malicious action.
    * **Impact:** Loss of audit trail, making it difficult or impossible to investigate security incidents.
    * **MySQL Component Affected:** Binary logging (`log_bin` option), file system permissions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Remote Logging:** Configure MySQL to write binary logs to a remote, secure server.
        * **File Permissions:** Restrict file system access to the binary log files to only the `mysql` user.
        * **Checksums:** Use a mechanism to generate and verify checksums of the binary log files to detect tampering.
        * **Monitoring:** Monitor the integrity and size of the binary log files for unexpected changes.
        * **Least Privilege:** Avoid granting the FILE privilege unnecessarily.
