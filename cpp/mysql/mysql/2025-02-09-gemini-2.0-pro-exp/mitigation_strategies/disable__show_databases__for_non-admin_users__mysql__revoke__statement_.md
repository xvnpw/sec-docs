Okay, let's create a deep analysis of the proposed mitigation strategy.

## Deep Analysis: Disable `SHOW DATABASES` for Non-Admin Users (MySQL)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness, potential drawbacks, and implementation considerations of revoking the `SHOW DATABASES` privilege from non-administrative users in a MySQL database environment.  We aim to determine if this mitigation strategy is appropriate for our application and to provide clear guidance on its implementation and ongoing maintenance.  We will also consider alternative or complementary strategies.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the `SHOW DATABASES` privilege within MySQL.  It considers:

*   The threat of information disclosure related to database names.
*   The impact of revoking this privilege on legitimate user workflows.
*   The technical steps required for implementation.
*   Potential edge cases and exceptions.
*   The interaction with other security measures.
*   MySQL versions 5.7, 8.0, and later (as these are the most common in modern deployments).
*   The context of a web application interacting with the MySQL database.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other database systems (e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB).
*   Network-level security (e.g., firewalls, VPNs).  While important, these are outside the scope of this specific privilege analysis.
*   Application-level vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection) that could bypass this mitigation.  We assume other security measures address those.

**Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Refine the understanding of the specific threat being mitigated.  Consider the attacker's capabilities and motivations.
2.  **Impact Assessment:**  Analyze the potential impact on both security and functionality.  Identify any legitimate use cases that might be affected.
3.  **Implementation Review:**  Examine the proposed implementation steps for correctness and completeness.  Identify any potential pitfalls.
4.  **Alternative Consideration:**  Explore alternative or complementary mitigation strategies.
5.  **Recommendation:**  Provide a clear recommendation on whether to implement the strategy, along with any necessary modifications or caveats.
6.  **Monitoring and Maintenance:** Outline how to monitor the effectiveness of the mitigation and maintain it over time.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Mitigation Strategy

**2.1 Threat Modeling:**

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure (Database Enumeration).
*   **Attacker:** An attacker with limited access to the database (e.g., a compromised application user account, an attacker who has gained access through a separate vulnerability).
*   **Attacker's Goal:** To discover the names of all databases on the server.  This information can be used to:
    *   Identify potentially sensitive databases (e.g., `customer_data`, `financial_records`).
    *   Plan further attacks (e.g., targeting specific databases with known vulnerabilities).
    *   Gain a better understanding of the application's architecture.
*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker uses the `SHOW DATABASES` command (either directly through a compromised MySQL client or indirectly through an application feature that exposes this functionality).
*   **Severity:**  While generally considered "Low," the severity can increase depending on the sensitivity of the database names themselves.  If database names reveal sensitive information (e.g., client names, project codes), the severity is higher.

**2.2 Impact Assessment:**

*   **Security Impact (Positive):**
    *   Reduces the attack surface by limiting the information available to an attacker.
    *   Makes it more difficult for an attacker to enumerate databases.
    *   Forces attackers to use more sophisticated techniques (e.g., blind SQL injection, brute-forcing database names), which are more likely to be detected.

*   **Functional Impact (Potential Negative):**
    *   **Application Functionality:**  If the application relies on `SHOW DATABASES` for legitimate functionality (e.g., allowing users to select a database from a list), this functionality will be broken.  This is the *most critical* consideration.
    *   **Developer/DBA Tools:**  Some database management tools might use `SHOW DATABASES` internally.  While DBAs should have administrative accounts, developers might need to be granted the privilege selectively or use alternative methods.
    *   **Monitoring Tools:**  Some monitoring tools might rely on `SHOW DATABASES` to gather database statistics.  This needs to be investigated and addressed.

**2.3 Implementation Review:**

The proposed implementation steps are generally correct:

1.  **`Connect to MySQL:`**  As an administrative user (e.g., `root`).  This is essential.
2.  **`Identify Non-Admin Users:`**  This is crucial.  A systematic approach is needed:
    *   `SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user WHERE Super_priv != 'Y';`  (MySQL 8.0+)  This query identifies users *without* the `SUPER` privilege, which is a good starting point for identifying non-admin users.  However, be careful: some users might have other global privileges that effectively make them administrators.  Careful review is needed.
    *   `SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user WHERE Select_priv != 'Y' OR Insert_priv != 'Y' OR Update_priv != 'Y' OR Delete_priv != 'Y' OR Create_priv != 'Y' OR Drop_priv != 'Y' OR Reload_priv != 'Y' OR Shutdown_priv != 'Y' OR Process_priv != 'Y' OR File_priv != 'Y' OR Grant_priv != 'Y' OR References_priv != 'Y' OR Index_priv != 'Y' OR Alter_priv != 'Y' OR Show_db_priv != 'Y' OR Super_priv != 'Y' OR Create_tmp_table_priv != 'Y' OR Lock_tables_priv != 'Y' OR Execute_priv != 'Y' OR Repl_slave_priv != 'Y' OR Repl_client_priv != 'Y' OR Create_view_priv != 'Y' OR Show_view_priv != 'Y' OR Create_routine_priv != 'Y' OR Alter_routine_priv != 'Y' OR Create_user_priv != 'Y' OR Event_priv != 'Y' OR Trigger_priv != 'Y' OR Create_tablespace_priv != 'Y' OR Delete_history_priv != 'Y';` (MySQL 5.7) This is more verbose but necessary for older versions.  Again, careful review is essential.
    *   **Examine Application Code:**  The *best* way to identify non-admin users is to understand how the application connects to the database.  Review connection strings and user configurations.
3.  **`REVOKE SHOW DATABASES ON *.* FROM 'user'@'host';`**  This is the correct syntax.  The `*.*` specifies that the privilege is revoked for all databases and tables.  It's important to revoke it globally to prevent accidental exposure.  It is recommended to use a script to automate this for all identified users.
4.  **`FLUSH PRIVILEGES;`**  This is essential to ensure that the changes take effect immediately.  Without this, the revoked privileges might still be active for existing connections.

**2.4 Alternative/Complementary Strategies:**

*   **Least Privilege Principle:**  This is the *foundation* of database security.  Ensure that *all* users have only the minimum necessary privileges.  Don't just focus on `SHOW DATABASES`.  Review `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, `DROP`, etc., privileges.
*   **Database Naming Conventions:**  Avoid using descriptive or sensitive names for databases.  Use abstract names or codes that don't reveal information about the contents.  This reduces the impact of information disclosure even if `SHOW DATABASES` is compromised.
*   **Application-Level Controls:**  If the application *needs* to provide a list of databases to users, implement this functionality at the application level, using a predefined list or a query that only returns authorized databases.  *Never* rely on `SHOW DATABASES` directly in the application code exposed to users.
*   **Monitoring and Auditing:**  Enable MySQL's audit logging to track all database access, including attempts to use `SHOW DATABASES`.  This can help detect and respond to potential attacks.  Use a tool like `pt-audit-log-parser` to analyze the audit logs.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  An IDS can be configured to detect and alert on suspicious database activity, including attempts to enumerate databases.
* **MySQL Enterprise Firewall:** If using MySQL Enterprise Edition, consider using the MySQL Enterprise Firewall to create whitelists of allowed SQL statements, preventing unauthorized `SHOW DATABASES` queries.

**2.5 Recommendation:**

**Implement the mitigation strategy, but with careful planning and consideration of the functional impact.**

1.  **Thoroughly Audit Application Code:**  Before revoking the privilege, *absolutely ensure* that the application does not rely on `SHOW DATABASES` for any user-facing functionality.  If it does, refactor the application to use a more secure approach (as described in Alternative Strategies).
2.  **Identify Non-Admin Users Accurately:**  Use a combination of SQL queries and application code review to identify all non-admin users.  Document this process.
3.  **Automate the Revocation:**  Create a script to revoke the `SHOW DATABASES` privilege from all identified users.  This ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:**  After implementing the change, thoroughly test the application to ensure that all functionality works as expected.  Pay close attention to any features that involve database selection or listing.
5.  **Implement Complementary Strategies:**  Don't rely solely on revoking `SHOW DATABASES`.  Implement the other strategies mentioned above (least privilege, database naming conventions, application-level controls, monitoring, auditing) to create a layered defense.

**2.6 Monitoring and Maintenance:**

*   **Regularly Review User Privileges:**  Periodically (e.g., every 3-6 months) review user privileges to ensure that they are still appropriate.  This is especially important as the application evolves and new users are added.
*   **Monitor Audit Logs:**  Regularly review MySQL's audit logs for any attempts to use `SHOW DATABASES` by unauthorized users.
*   **Automated Checks:**  Consider implementing automated checks to verify that the `SHOW DATABASES` privilege is not granted to non-admin users.  This can be part of a security scanning process.
*   **Stay Updated:**  Keep MySQL updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and improvements.

By following these steps, you can effectively mitigate the threat of database enumeration while minimizing the impact on legitimate users and application functionality. The key is to be thorough, methodical, and to prioritize the principle of least privilege.
