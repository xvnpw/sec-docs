# Deep Analysis: MySQL Weak/Default Credentials Attack Path

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Weak/Default Credentials" attack path within the context of a MySQL database server.  This includes understanding the vulnerabilities, potential attack vectors, impact, mitigation strategies, and detection methods.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to eliminate this critical vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Target System:**  Applications utilizing the MySQL database server (https://github.com/mysql/mysql).  This includes any version of MySQL, but particular attention will be paid to common default configurations and known vulnerabilities related to credentials.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploitation of weak or default credentials used for MySQL user accounts, including the `root` account and any application-specific database users.
*   **Exclusions:** This analysis *does not* cover other attack vectors against MySQL (e.g., SQL injection, denial-of-service), except where they might be facilitated by compromised credentials.  It also does not cover vulnerabilities in the application layer itself, *unless* those vulnerabilities directly lead to the exposure or misuse of database credentials.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Review of publicly available information, including:
    *   MySQL documentation (especially security best practices and default configurations).
    *   Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database entries related to default or weak credentials in MySQL.
    *   Security advisories and blog posts from reputable sources.
    *   Penetration testing reports and findings (if available).
2.  **Attack Scenario Definition:**  Construction of realistic attack scenarios that demonstrate how an attacker might exploit weak or default credentials.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  Detailed evaluation of the potential consequences of successful credential compromise, considering data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Identification of specific, actionable steps to prevent, detect, and respond to this vulnerability.
5.  **Detection Method Analysis:**  Examination of techniques for identifying instances of weak or default credentials, both proactively and reactively.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.5 Weak/Default Credentials [CRITICAL]

### 4.1. Vulnerability Description

This vulnerability arises when a MySQL server is deployed or maintained with:

*   **Default Credentials:**  The `root` account (or other accounts) retains its default password (which may be blank, a well-known default, or easily guessable).  Older MySQL versions often had a blank root password by default.
*   **Weak Passwords:**  User accounts (including `root` and application-specific users) are configured with passwords that are easily guessable, such as:
    *   Short passwords (e.g., fewer than 12 characters).
    *   Dictionary words.
    *   Common password patterns (e.g., "password123", "qwerty").
    *   Personal information (e.g., birthdays, names).
* **No Password:** User accounts are configured without password.

### 4.2. Attack Scenarios

Several attack scenarios are possible:

*   **Scenario 1: External Attack (Internet-Facing Server):**
    *   An attacker scans the internet for MySQL servers listening on the default port (3306).
    *   The attacker attempts to connect to the discovered server using the default `root` credentials (e.g., username: `root`, password: `''` or a known default).
    *   If successful, the attacker gains full administrative access to the database.

*   **Scenario 2: Internal Attack (Compromised Host):**
    *   An attacker gains access to a machine within the same network as the MySQL server (e.g., through phishing, malware, or another vulnerability).
    *   The attacker uses network scanning tools to identify the MySQL server.
    *   The attacker attempts to connect using default or weak credentials, potentially leveraging information gathered from the compromised host (e.g., configuration files, environment variables).

*   **Scenario 3: Brute-Force/Dictionary Attack:**
    *   An attacker targets a specific MySQL server (either externally or internally).
    *   The attacker uses automated tools to try a large number of common passwords (dictionary attack) or systematically generate all possible password combinations (brute-force attack) for known usernames.
    *   If a weak password is used, the attacker gains access.

* **Scenario 4: Credential Stuffing:**
    * An attacker uses credentials obtained from data breaches of other services.
    * The attacker uses automated tools to try these credentials on MySQL server.
    * If user reused password, the attacker gains access.

### 4.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of successful credential compromise is **Very High**:

*   **Data Confidentiality Breach:**  The attacker can read, copy, or exfiltrate all data stored in the database.  This could include sensitive customer information, financial records, intellectual property, or other confidential data.
*   **Data Integrity Violation:**  The attacker can modify or delete data in the database, potentially causing data corruption, business disruption, or reputational damage.
*   **Data Availability Loss:**  The attacker can shut down the database server, delete databases, or otherwise disrupt access to the data, leading to service outages.
*   **System Compromise:**  The attacker may be able to use the compromised MySQL server as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.  MySQL's `LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE` feature, if enabled and misconfigured, could be abused to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem.  User-Defined Functions (UDFs) could be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Regulatory Non-Compliance:**  Data breaches resulting from weak credentials can lead to violations of regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and others, resulting in significant fines and legal liabilities.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are **essential** and should be implemented immediately:

*   **Strong Password Policy Enforcement:**
    *   **Mandatory Strong Passwords:**  Enforce a strong password policy for *all* MySQL user accounts, including `root`.  This policy should require:
        *   Minimum password length (at least 12 characters, preferably 16+).
        *   A mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.
        *   No dictionary words or easily guessable patterns.
    *   **Password Complexity Tools:**  Utilize MySQL's built-in password validation plugins (e.g., `validate_password`) to enforce password complexity rules.
    *   **Regular Password Changes:**  Implement a policy requiring periodic password changes (e.g., every 90 days) for all accounts, especially privileged accounts.
    * **Password Managers:** Encourage or require the use of password managers to generate and store strong, unique passwords.

*   **Secure Initial Configuration:**
    *   **Run `mysql_secure_installation`:**  Immediately after installing MySQL, run the `mysql_secure_installation` script.  This script:
        *   Sets a strong password for the `root` account.
        *   Removes anonymous user accounts.
        *   Disables remote `root` login (recommended).
        *   Removes the test database (if present).
    *   **Automated Deployment:**  Use configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Terraform) to automate the secure deployment of MySQL servers, ensuring consistent and secure configurations.  *Never* hardcode credentials in deployment scripts.

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Application-Specific Users:**  Create dedicated user accounts for each application that needs to access the database.  Grant these users *only* the necessary privileges (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) on the specific databases and tables they require.  *Never* grant application users `SUPER` or other administrative privileges.
    *   **Avoid `root` for Applications:**  Applications should *never* connect to the database using the `root` account.

*   **Network Security:**
    *   **Firewall Rules:**  Restrict access to the MySQL server (port 3306) to only authorized hosts using firewall rules.  If possible, avoid exposing the MySQL server directly to the internet.
    *   **VPN/SSH Tunneling:**  If remote access is required, use a secure VPN or SSH tunnel to encrypt the connection.

*   **Monitoring and Auditing:**
    *   **Enable Audit Logging:**  Enable MySQL's audit logging feature to track all database activity, including successful and failed login attempts.  Regularly review these logs for suspicious activity.
    *   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns, such as brute-force attempts against the MySQL server.
    * **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Integrate MySQL logs with a SIEM system for centralized log analysis and alerting.

* **Regular Security Updates:**
    *   **Patching:**  Apply security patches and updates for MySQL promptly to address any known vulnerabilities.
    * **Version Upgrade:** Keep MySQL version up to date.

### 4.5. Detection Methods

*   **Proactive Detection:**
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS) to identify MySQL servers with default or weak credentials.
    *   **Password Auditing Tools:**  Use password auditing tools (e.g., John the Ripper, Hashcat) to test the strength of MySQL user passwords.  This should be done *offline* using a copy of the `mysql.user` table (or a similar method that doesn't expose live credentials).
    *   **Configuration Review:**  Regularly review the MySQL server configuration (`my.cnf` or `my.ini`) and user accounts to ensure that security best practices are being followed.
    * **Automated Checks:** Implement automated scripts or tools to regularly check for default credentials and weak passwords.

*   **Reactive Detection:**
    *   **Log Analysis:**  Monitor MySQL logs (especially error logs and audit logs) for failed login attempts, suspicious IP addresses, and unusual database activity.
    *   **IDS/IPS Alerts:**  Configure intrusion detection/prevention systems to alert on brute-force attacks and other suspicious network activity targeting the MySQL server.
    *   **SIEM Alerts:**  Configure SIEM rules to trigger alerts based on suspicious login patterns or credential-related events.

## 5. Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Action:**  Immediately change the `root` password and any other default or weak passwords on all MySQL servers.
2.  **Policy Enforcement:**  Implement and enforce a strong password policy for all MySQL user accounts.
3.  **Secure Configuration:**  Ensure that all MySQL servers are deployed and configured securely, following the mitigation strategies outlined above.
4.  **Regular Auditing:**  Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability scans to identify and address any weaknesses.
5.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Implement robust monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to potential attacks.
6.  **Training:**  Provide training to developers and database administrators on secure MySQL configuration and best practices.
7. **Automated Deployment:** Use configuration management tools to automate secure deployment.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of a successful attack exploiting weak or default credentials, protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored in the MySQL database.
