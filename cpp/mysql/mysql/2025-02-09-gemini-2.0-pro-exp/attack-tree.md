```

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Brute Force Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_brute_force_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess usernames and passwords through repeated login attempts.
*   **High-Risk Path:** ***Brute Force Creds*** -> Data Compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (High if weak passwords, Low if strong passwords and lockout are in place)
*   **Impact:** High (potential for complete data compromise)
*   **Effort:** Low (automated tools are readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (detectable through failed login logs, but can be obfuscated)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit_known_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific MySQL versions.
*   **High-Risk Path:** ***Exploit Known Vuln. (CVEs)*** -> Data Compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on patching frequency)
*   **Impact:** Very High (potential for complete system compromise)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (requires finding and adapting exploit code)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (IDS/IPS can detect some)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Misconfigured Permissions [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_misconfigured_permissions__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Overly permissive user accounts or roles within MySQL.
*   **High-Risk Path:** ***Misconfigured Permissions [CRITICAL]*** -> Data Compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (common in poorly managed environments)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the misconfiguration)
*   **Effort:** Low (attacker only needs to discover the misconfiguration)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (detectable through audits)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.5 Weak/Default Credentials. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_5_weakdefault_credentials___critical_.md)

* **Description:** The MySQL server is installed with default credentials, or weak passwords are used.
    * **High-Risk Path:** ***Weak/Default Credentials [CRITICAL]*** -> Data Compromise.
    * **Likelihood:** Low (should be addressed immediately; higher in neglected systems)
    * **Impact:** Very High (immediate and complete compromise)
    * **Effort:** Very Low
    * **Skill Level:** Novice
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Network-Level DoS (e.g., TCP SYN Flood)](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_network-level_dos__e_g___tcp_syn_flood_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the MySQL server with TCP SYN packets.
*   **High-Risk Path:** ***Network-Level DoS (e.g., TCP SYN Flood)*** -> Service Disruption.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (common attack vector)
*   **Impact:** High (can completely disrupt network connectivity)
*   **Effort:** Low (automated tools are readily available)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (detectable by network monitoring)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3 Exploit MySQL Server Vulnerability (CVEs) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_exploit_mysql_server_vulnerability__cves___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in the MySQL server code allows crashing the server.
*   **High-Risk Path:** ***Exploit MySQL Server Vulnerability (CVEs) [CRITICAL]*** -> Service Disruption.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (depends on patching)
*   **Impact:** High (can crash the server)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (requires finding exploit code)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (IDS/IPS can detect some)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Exploit MySQL Server Vulnerability (CVEs) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_exploit_mysql_server_vulnerability__cves___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability allows a user with limited privileges to gain higher privileges.
*   **High-Risk Path:** ***Exploit MySQL Server Vulnerability (CVEs) [CRITICAL]*** -> Full Database Control.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (requires a specific, unpatched vulnerability)
*   **Impact:** Very High (attacker gains full control)
*   **Effort:** High (requires finding exploit code)
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires advanced intrusion detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3 Misconfigured Grants/Roles [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_misconfigured_grantsroles__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly configured `GRANT` statements or roles give a user more privileges than intended.
*   **High-Risk Path:** ***Misconfigured Grants/Roles [CRITICAL]*** -> Full Database Control.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (common in poorly managed environments)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the misconfiguration)
*   **Effort:** Low (attacker only needs to discover it)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (detectable through audits)
