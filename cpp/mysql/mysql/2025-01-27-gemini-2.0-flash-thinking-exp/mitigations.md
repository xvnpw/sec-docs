# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mysql/mysql

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_database_users.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all application components** that interact with the MySQL database.
    2.  **Create dedicated MySQL user accounts** *within MySQL* for each application component or service needing database access.
    3.  **Grant only the minimum necessary privileges** *within MySQL* to each user account using `GRANT` statements. For example:
        *   Web application user: `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON application_db.* TO 'webapp_user'@'localhost';`
        *   Reporting service user: `GRANT SELECT ON reporting_db.* TO 'reporting_user'@'reporting_server_ip';`
        *   Administrative tasks user: `GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP, RELOAD, ... ON *.* TO 'admin_user'@'admin_host' WITH GRANT OPTION;` (use sparingly and only for admin users).
    4.  **Avoid granting `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES`** *in MySQL* to application users.
    5.  **Regularly review and audit** user privileges *within MySQL* using `SHOW GRANTS FOR 'username'@'host';` to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege. Revoke unnecessary privileges using `REVOKE`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Severity):** Limits the scope of damage if an application vulnerability is exploited. An attacker with limited database privileges can do less harm than one with full privileges *within the MySQL database*.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** Restricts an attacker's ability to move laterally *within the MySQL database system* if they compromise an application component.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Medium Impact):** Reduces the potential impact of unauthorized access *within MySQL* by limiting the attacker's capabilities.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Impact):** Makes lateral movement *within MySQL* more difficult and less impactful.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented for the main web application user, which has restricted privileges *defined in MySQL*. Separate user for read-only access for reporting is also implemented *within MySQL*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Background job processes and administrative scripts might be using overly permissive database users *defined in MySQL*. Need to review and create dedicated users with minimal privileges for these tasks *within MySQL*. Development and testing environments might still use overly permissive users for convenience, which should be addressed for security parity with production *by configuring MySQL users appropriately*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce SSL/TLS Encryption for Database Connections](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_ssltls_encryption_for_database_connections.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce SSL/TLS Encryption for Database Connections
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain or generate SSL/TLS certificates** for the MySQL server.
    2.  **Configure MySQL server to enable SSL/TLS.** This involves setting parameters in the `my.cnf` or `my.ini` configuration file, specifying paths to certificate files (e.g., `ssl-cert`, `ssl-key`, `ssl-ca`) and enabling SSL (`ssl=1` or `require_ssl`).
    3.  **Enforce SSL/TLS requirement on the MySQL server.** Configure the server to reject connections that do not use SSL/TLS by setting `require_secure_transport=ON` or using `GRANT USAGE ON *.* TO 'user'@'host' REQUIRE SSL;` for specific users.
    4.  **Configure the application to connect to MySQL using SSL/TLS.**  Specify SSL/TLS parameters in the database connection string or configuration within the application code (application-side configuration is not directly MySQL, but necessary to utilize MySQL's SSL/TLS).
    5.  **Verify SSL/TLS connections** by monitoring MySQL server logs and connection status (e.g., using `SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Ssl_cipher';`) to ensure encryption is active *on the MySQL server side*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from eavesdropping on or intercepting communication between the application and the MySQL server, protecting sensitive data like credentials and application data in transit *at the MySQL connection level*.
    *   **Data Breach during Transmission (High Severity):**  Protects sensitive data from being exposed if network traffic is intercepted *between the application and MySQL*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **MITM Attacks (High Impact):**  Effectively mitigates MITM attacks on database connections *secured by MySQL*.
    *   **Data Breach during Transmission (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of data breaches during transmission *to and from MySQL*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   SSL/TLS is enabled on the MySQL server in production and staging environments *via MySQL configuration*. Application is configured to connect using SSL/TLS in these environments (application-side config).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   SSL/TLS might not be consistently enforced in development and testing environments *at the MySQL server level*. Developers might be connecting without SSL/TLS for easier debugging. Need to enforce SSL/TLS in all environments *by configuring MySQL server to require it* to maintain consistent security posture and prevent accidental exposure in lower environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Updates and Patching of MySQL Server](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_updates_and_patching_of_mysql_server.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Security Updates and Patching of MySQL Server
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a process for monitoring MySQL security announcements and vulnerability disclosures.** Subscribe to MySQL security mailing lists, follow security blogs, and monitor relevant security websites (Oracle Security Alerts).
    2.  **Regularly check for and apply security updates and patches** released by Oracle *specifically for MySQL*.
    3.  **Test patches in a staging or testing environment** before applying them to production *on the MySQL server* to ensure compatibility and avoid unexpected issues.
    4.  **Automate the patching process** where possible to ensure timely application of updates *to the MySQL server*. Use configuration management tools or package managers to streamline patching *of MySQL*.
    5.  **Maintain an inventory of MySQL servers** and their versions to track patching status and identify systems that need updates *of MySQL*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Protects against attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated MySQL versions, which could lead to server compromise, data breaches, or denial of service *at the MySQL server level*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Impact):**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities *in MySQL* by eliminating them through patching.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Automated patching process is in place for operating system level patches on servers. MySQL updates are currently done manually during maintenance windows *on the MySQL server*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to automate MySQL server patching process as well. Explore using configuration management tools to automate MySQL updates and restarts *specifically for MySQL*. Improve monitoring of MySQL version and patch status across all environments *for the MySQL server*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Anonymous MySQL User Accounts](./mitigation_strategies/disable_anonymous_mysql_user_accounts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable Anonymous MySQL User Accounts
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Connect to the MySQL server as a privileged user** (e.g., root or a user with `CREATE USER` and `DROP USER` privileges).
    2.  **Query the `mysql.user` table** *within MySQL* to identify anonymous user accounts. These accounts typically have a `User` value of '' (empty string) or 'root'@'localhost' without a password. `SELECT User, Host FROM mysql.user WHERE User='';`
    3.  **Remove anonymous user accounts** *within MySQL* using the `DROP USER` SQL command. For example: `DROP USER ''@'localhost';` and `DROP USER ''@'hostname';` (replace 'hostname' with the server's hostname if applicable).
    4.  **Flush privileges** *in MySQL* using `FLUSH PRIVILEGES;` to apply the changes immediately *within MySQL*.
    5.  **Verify that anonymous user accounts are removed** by querying the `mysql.user` table again *in MySQL*.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access through default anonymous user accounts that often have no password or weak default passwords, potentially allowing attackers to gain initial access to the database server *via MySQL's default accounts*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Medium Impact):**  Reduces the risk of unauthorized access through easily exploitable default accounts *provided by default MySQL setup*.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Anonymous user accounts were removed during the initial MySQL server setup in production and staging environments *by following MySQL hardening steps*.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Need to verify that anonymous user accounts are consistently removed in all new MySQL server deployments, including development and testing environments *as part of MySQL server provisioning*. Include this step in the server provisioning and hardening scripts *for MySQL*. Regularly audit for the presence of anonymous accounts as part of security checks *on MySQL*.
