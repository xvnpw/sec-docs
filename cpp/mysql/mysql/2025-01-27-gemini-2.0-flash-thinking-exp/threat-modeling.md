# Threat Model Analysis for mysql/mysql

## Threat: [SQL Injection (SQLi)](./threats/sql_injection__sqli_.md)

Description: Attacker injects malicious SQL code into application inputs, which is executed by the MySQL database due to lack of proper input handling. This allows direct interaction with the database, bypassing application logic.
Impact:
*   Unauthorized data access (reading, modification, deletion).
*   Data breach and exfiltration of sensitive information.
*   Potential command execution on the database server in advanced cases.
MySQL Component Affected: MySQL Server (SQL Parser, Query Executor)
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Use Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements) for all database interactions.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization as a secondary defense.
*   Apply the Principle of Least Privilege for database user accounts.
*   Deploy a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to detect and block SQLi attempts.
*   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Weak MySQL Authentication](./threats/weak_mysql_authentication.md)

Description: Attacker gains unauthorized access to the MySQL database due to weak, default, or compromised authentication credentials. This can be through brute-force, credential stuffing, or leaked credentials.
Impact:
*   Unauthorized database access and control.
*   Data breach and exfiltration.
*   Data manipulation and deletion.
*   Denial of service by disrupting database operations.
MySQL Component Affected: MySQL Server (Authentication Module)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation).
*   Securely store database credentials (avoid plain text, use secret management).
*   Apply the Principle of Least Privilege for database users.
*   Restrict network access to the MySQL server using firewalls.
*   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for administrative access.
*   Regularly audit user accounts and privileges.

## Threat: [MySQL Server Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/mysql_server_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

Description: Attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the MySQL server software itself to gain unauthorized access, execute code, or cause denial of service.
Impact:
*   Server compromise and full control.
*   Remote code execution on the database server.
*   Data breach and exfiltration.
*   Denial of service and application downtime.
MySQL Component Affected: MySQL Server (Core Components, Network Stack, Vulnerable Modules)
Risk Severity: Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Keep MySQL Server updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
*   Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
*   Deploy Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS).
*   Disable unnecessary features and modules to reduce the attack surface.
*   Implement security hardening measures for MySQL server configuration.

## Threat: [Data Exfiltration via MySQL Features](./threats/data_exfiltration_via_mysql_features.md)

Description: Attacker leverages MySQL features, often in conjunction with SQL injection, to extract data from the database. This can involve using functions like `LOAD DATA INFILE` or `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`.
Impact:
*   Data breach and exfiltration of sensitive information.
*   Loss of confidentiality and reputational damage.
MySQL Component Affected: MySQL Server (File Handling Functions, Query Executor)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Disable `LOAD DATA INFILE` if not required.
*   Restrict the `FILE` privilege to only necessary users.
*   Sanitize and validate output data to prevent information leakage.
*   Securely store and encrypt database backups.
*   Monitor database activity for unusual data access patterns.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within MySQL](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_mysql.md)

Description: Attacker with initial limited access to MySQL attempts to escalate their privileges to gain higher levels of access, potentially reaching administrative or `root` level within MySQL.
Impact:
*   Full control over the MySQL database.
*   Data manipulation, deletion, and exfiltration.
*   Potential server compromise.
MySQL Component Affected: MySQL Server (Privilege System, User Management)
Risk Severity: High to Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Strictly apply the Principle of Least Privilege for users and roles.
*   Disable stored procedure/function creation if not necessary.
*   Securely develop stored procedures and functions if used.
*   Regularly audit user privileges.
*   Monitor for privilege escalation attempts in database logs.
