**Title:** Threat Model: Compromising Application via MySQL - Attack Tree Analysis

**Objective:** Compromise application using vulnerabilities or weaknesses within the MySQL database system.

**Sub-Tree with High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

*   Compromise Application via MySQL
    *   Bypass Authentication **CRITICAL NODE**
        *   Exploit Default Credentials ***HIGH-RISK PATH START***
            *   Use well-known default username/password combinations
        *   Credential Stuffing/Brute Force ***HIGH-RISK PATH START***
            *   Attempt to guess or systematically try common passwords
        *   Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (MySQL) **CRITICAL NODE**
            *   Leverage known bugs in MySQL's authentication process
    *   Exploit MySQL Server Vulnerabilities **CRITICAL NODE**
        *   Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) ***HIGH-RISK PATH START***
            *   Leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific MySQL versions
    *   Data Manipulation & Injection **CRITICAL NODE**
        *   SQL Injection (Direct) ***HIGH-RISK PATH START*** **CRITICAL NODE**
            *   Inject malicious SQL code through application inputs to directly interact with MySQL
        *   SQL Injection (Second-Order) ***HIGH-RISK PATH START***
            *   Inject malicious SQL code that is stored in the database and executed later

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Bypass Authentication (CRITICAL NODE):**

*   **Exploit Default Credentials (***HIGH-RISK PATH START***):**
    *   Use well-known default username/password combinations
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Common misconfiguration, especially in development/testing)
        *   Impact: Critical (Full database access)
        *   Effort: Minimal (Requires a list of default credentials)
        *   Skill Level: Novice
        *   Detection Difficulty: Easy (Failed login attempts with default credentials)
*   **Credential Stuffing/Brute Force (***HIGH-RISK PATH START***):**
    *   Attempt to guess or systematically try common passwords
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Depends on password complexity and rate limiting)
        *   Impact: Critical (Full database access)
        *   Effort: Medium (Requires password lists and tools)
        *   Skill Level: Beginner
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (High volume of failed login attempts from a single source)
*   **Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (MySQL) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   Leverage known bugs in MySQL's authentication process
        *   Likelihood: Low (Requires specific vulnerable MySQL versions)
        *   Impact: Critical (Full database access)
        *   Effort: Medium (Requires finding and exploiting specific vulnerabilities)
        *   Skill Level: Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Difficult (May appear as legitimate connections)

**Exploit MySQL Server Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**

*   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) (***HIGH-RISK PATH START***):**
    *   Leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific MySQL versions
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Depends on the age and patching status of the MySQL server)
        *   Impact: Critical (Remote code execution, data breach, DoS)
        *   Effort: Medium (Requires finding relevant exploits and adapting them)
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate/Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Depends on the nature of the exploit and monitoring capabilities)

**Data Manipulation & Injection (CRITICAL NODE):**

*   **SQL Injection (Direct) (***HIGH-RISK PATH START***) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    *   Inject malicious SQL code through application inputs to directly interact with MySQL
        *   Likelihood: High (Common vulnerability in web applications)
        *   Impact: Critical (Data breach, modification, deletion, potential for remote code execution)
        *   Effort: Low (Many automated tools available)
        *   Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Can be obfuscated, but common patterns exist)
*   **SQL Injection (Second-Order) (***HIGH-RISK PATH START***):**
    *   Inject malicious SQL code that is stored in the database and executed later
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Requires understanding of application logic and data flow)
        *   Impact: Critical (Similar to direct SQL injection)
        *   Effort: Medium (Requires more analysis of the application)
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Difficult (The injection point and execution point are separated)
