Here's an updated list of high and critical threats directly involving the MySQL codebase (https://github.com/mysql/mysql):

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation within MySQL
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within the MySQL server software (codebase) to elevate their privileges from a lower-privileged account to a higher-privileged one (e.g., from a regular user to a `SUPER` user). This directly involves flaws in the authentication and authorization logic within the MySQL code.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the database server, ability to access and modify any data, potentially compromise the underlying operating system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication and authorization modules within `mysqld` (code within the GitHub repository).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the MySQL server software up-to-date with the latest security patches released by the MySQL development team (available through the GitHub repository and official channels).
        *   Follow security best practices for MySQL server configuration, limiting the use of powerful privileges like `SUPER`.
        *   Regularly audit user privileges and access controls.

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (within Stored Procedures)
    *   **Description:** While SQL injection often stems from application code, vulnerabilities can exist within the code of stored procedures that are part of the MySQL codebase itself or extensions. Attackers exploit these flaws to execute arbitrary SQL code within the database context.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, potential execution of unauthorized commands within the database.
    *   **Affected Component:** Stored procedure engine within `mysqld` (code within the GitHub repository).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely develop and review stored procedures, applying the same security principles as application code. This includes reviewing code contributions to the MySQL project.
        *   Use parameterized inputs within stored procedures.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to stored procedure execution permissions.

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption due to MySQL Bugs
    *   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within the core MySQL server software (codebase) can lead to data corruption or inconsistencies. This involves flaws in the data storage mechanisms, transaction handling, or other core functionalities implemented in the MySQL code.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity, application malfunction, potential data loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various storage engines (e.g., InnoDB, MyISAM), core modules of `mysqld` (code within the GitHub repository).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use stable and well-tested versions of MySQL.
        *   Keep the MySQL server software up-to-date with the latest security patches and bug fixes released by the MySQL development team.
        *   Implement regular database backups and recovery procedures.
        *   Monitor database health and integrity.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks against MySQL (due to Code Vulnerabilities)
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit specific vulnerabilities within the MySQL server's code that allow them to trigger resource exhaustion or crashes with specially crafted requests or data. This is distinct from network-level DoS and focuses on flaws in the MySQL software itself.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network listener and connection handler within `mysqld`, query processing engine (code within the GitHub repository).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the MySQL server software up-to-date with the latest security patches that address known DoS vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement appropriate resource limits and timeouts within MySQL configuration.

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities in MySQL
    *   **Description:** Security flaws within the MySQL authentication mechanisms (codebase) could potentially allow attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access without valid credentials. This directly involves vulnerabilities in the login process implemented in the MySQL code.
    *   **Impact:** Direct unauthorized access to the database, leading to data breaches, data modification, or deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication module of `mysqld` (code within the GitHub repository).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the MySQL server software up-to-date with the latest security patches that address authentication bypass vulnerabilities.
        *   Enforce strong password policies and consider multi-factor authentication where supported.
