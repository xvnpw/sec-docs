## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit MySQL Server Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_mysql_server_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the MySQL server software itself.
    * This can include buffer overflows, integer overflows, or other memory corruption issues in the server's code.
    * Success can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Remote Code Execution (RCE) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__remote_code_execution__rce___high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Leveraging vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands or code on the MySQL server.
    * This can be achieved through various means, including exploiting server bugs, vulnerable stored procedures, or user-defined functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Unauthenticated RCE (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__unauthenticated_rce__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the MySQL server that do not require any prior authentication.
    * This is often due to flaws in the network listening service or initial connection handling.
    * A successful attack grants immediate and complete control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Authenticated RCE (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__authenticated_rce__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities after successfully authenticating to the MySQL server.
    * This often involves leveraging flaws in stored procedures, user-defined functions, or specific SQL commands that can be abused to execute arbitrary code.
    * Requires valid database credentials, which can be obtained through other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Application's Interaction with MySQL (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_application's_interaction_with_mysql__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Targeting vulnerabilities in the application code that interacts with the MySQL database.
    * This often involves insecure handling of user input when constructing SQL queries.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] SQL Injection (SQLi) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__sql_injection__sqli___high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Injecting malicious SQL code into application queries through user-supplied input.
    * This can allow attackers to bypass security checks, access unauthorized data, modify or delete data, or even execute operating system commands on the database server (depending on database configuration and privileges).
    * Different types of SQL injection exist, including:
        * In-band SQLi (error-based, boolean-based, time-based):  Attackers receive feedback directly through the application's responses.
        * Out-of-band SQLi: Attackers rely on external channels (like DNS lookups or HTTP requests) to confirm exploitation.
        * Blind SQLi: Attackers infer information based on the application's behavior without direct error messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit MySQL Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_mysql_authenticationauthorization_mechanisms__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Bypassing or subverting the mechanisms designed to verify the identity of users and control their access to the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Brute-force Attacks on MySQL Accounts (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__brute-force_attacks_on_mysql_accounts__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Systematically trying different username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to MySQL accounts.
    * This is particularly effective against accounts with weak or default passwords.
    * Automated tools are commonly used to perform these attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Network Communication with MySQL (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_network_communication_with_mysql__high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Intercepting and manipulating the communication between the application and the MySQL database.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (No TLS/SSL) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__no_tlsssl___high_risk_path_.md)

Attack Vectors:
    * Intercepting network traffic between the application and the MySQL server when encryption (like TLS/SSL) is not used.
    * This allows attackers to eavesdrop on the communication, potentially capturing database credentials or sensitive data being exchanged.
    * Attackers can also modify the data in transit.
