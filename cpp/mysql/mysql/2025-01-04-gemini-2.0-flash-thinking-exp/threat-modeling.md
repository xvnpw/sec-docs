# Threat Model Analysis for mysql/mysql

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious SQL queries by manipulating input fields or other data sources that are directly incorporated into SQL statements. This allows them to execute arbitrary SQL code on the database server. They might read sensitive data, modify existing data, delete data, or even execute operating system commands if database user privileges allow.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches (confidentiality loss), data manipulation (integrity loss), data deletion, potential server compromise (availability loss, integrity loss).
    *   **Affected Component:** `sql/sql_parse.cc` (SQL Parser module), `sql/sql_prepare.cc` (Prepared Statement handling, if not used correctly).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all user-provided data before incorporating it into SQL queries.
        *   Employ an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) that handles SQL escaping and parameterization.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for database users. The database user used by the application should only have the necessary permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit SQL queries for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass](./threats/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in the application's authentication logic related to the database connection. This could involve exploiting default credentials, weak password policies, or vulnerabilities in how the application manages database connection strings. The attacker could gain unauthorized access to the database without valid credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential for complete database compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `sql/auth/sql_authentication.cc` (Authentication modules), `sql/mysqld.cc` (Server startup and authentication handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never use default database credentials. Change them immediately upon installation.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for database users.
        *   Securely store database credentials outside of the application code (e.g., using environment variables or dedicated secrets management).
        *   Implement robust authentication mechanisms for database connections.
        *   Regularly review and audit database user accounts and permissions.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation](./threats/privilege_escalation.md)

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation
    *   **Description:** An attacker with limited database privileges exploits vulnerabilities in the MySQL privilege system or the application's logic to gain higher privileges. This could involve manipulating SQL statements or exploiting flaws in stored procedures or functions. They could then perform actions they are not normally authorized to do.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential for administrative control over the database.
    *   **Affected Component:** `sql/privilege.cc` (Privilege management module), `sql/sql_acl.cc` (Access control list handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere strictly to the principle of least privilege when granting database permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit database user permissions and roles.
        *   Avoid granting excessive privileges to application database users.
        *   Carefully review and secure stored procedures and functions.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Direct Database Access (if server is compromised)](./threats/data_tampering_via_direct_database_access__if_server_is_compromised_.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering via Direct Database Access (if server is compromised)
    *   **Description:** If the underlying server hosting the MySQL instance is compromised, an attacker could gain direct access to the database files or the MySQL server process. They could then bypass application-level security controls and directly modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity loss, data loss, potential compromise of the entire application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `storage/` (Storage engine modules like InnoDB, MyISAM), file system access related to database files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Harden the operating system hosting the MySQL server.
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for accessing the database server itself.
        *   Regularly audit database server access logs.
        *   Consider using database activity monitoring tools.
        *   Implement file system permissions to restrict access to database files.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known MySQL Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_known_mysql_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Known MySQL Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in specific versions of the MySQL server software. This could involve sending specially crafted network packets or SQL queries that trigger a bug in the MySQL code, potentially leading to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including data breaches, remote code execution, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability. Could affect any module within the MySQL codebase. Security advisories from the MySQL team will detail affected components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the MySQL server software up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to MySQL.
        *   Regularly scan the MySQL server for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanners.
