## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit MySQL Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mysql_server_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the MySQL server software.
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Known MySQL Vulnerabilities (CVEs):** Attackers identify the specific version of MySQL running and search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities affecting that version.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   Identify Vulnerable MySQL Version: Attackers use various techniques (e.g., banner grabbing, error messages) to determine the MySQL version.
        *   Utilize Publicly Available Exploit: If a suitable exploit exists, attackers use it to gain unauthorized access or execute code.
    *   **Risk:** High likelihood due to the existence of readily available exploits and the potential for critical impact (full server compromise).

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse MySQL Features for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_mysql_features_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Attack Vector:** Leveraging legitimate MySQL features in unintended and harmful ways.
    *   **Critical Node: Leverage User-Defined Functions (UDFs):** Attackers exploit the ability to create and execute custom functions within MySQL.
        *   **Critical Node: Gain 'FILE' Privilege:** Attackers attempt to gain the `FILE` privilege, which allows reading and writing files on the server's file system.
            *   Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerability: Exploiting vulnerabilities within MySQL to elevate privileges.
            *   Compromise Admin Account: Obtaining credentials of an administrative user.
        *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious UDF Code:** Once `FILE` privilege is obtained, attackers inject malicious code disguised as a UDF.
        *   **Critical Node: Execute Arbitrary Code on Server:** Executing the injected malicious UDF, leading to command execution on the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Abusing the `LOAD DATA INFILE` statement.
        *   **Critical Node: Gain 'FILE' Privilege:** Similar to UDF abuse, gaining `FILE` privilege is often a prerequisite.
            *   Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
            *   Compromise Admin Account
        *   Inject Malicious Data File: Loading a specially crafted data file that could exploit vulnerabilities or inject malicious content.
        *   Achieve Remote Code Execution (if enabled and accessible): In specific configurations, this can lead to code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in stored procedures.
        *   Inject Malicious Code into Stored Procedure: Modifying existing stored procedures to include malicious logic.
        *   Execute Stored Procedure with Elevated Privileges: Executing a compromised stored procedure with higher privileges than the attacker's current user.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Abusing the Event Scheduler.
        *   **Critical Node: Gain 'EVENT' Privilege:** Obtaining the necessary privilege to create and manage scheduled events.
            *   Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
            *   Compromise Admin Account
        *   Create Malicious Event: Creating a scheduled event that executes malicious SQL queries or system commands.
        *   Execute Arbitrary SQL or System Commands: The scheduled event executes the attacker's commands.
    *   **Risk:** High likelihood if MySQL is not properly configured and privileges are not strictly managed. Impact can be critical, leading to code execution and data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in MySQL Configuration or Deployment](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_mysql_configuration_or_deployment.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting insecure default settings or misconfigurations.
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Default Credentials:** Using default usernames and passwords that were not changed after installation.
        *   Access MySQL Server with Default Credentials: Gaining immediate access with default credentials.
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Weak Passwords:** Guessing or cracking weak passwords used for MySQL accounts.
        *   Brute-Force Attack: Systematically trying different password combinations.
        *   Dictionary Attack: Using a list of common passwords.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting improperly configured access controls.
        *   Access MySQL Server from Unauthorized Network: Connecting to the MySQL server from a network that should be restricted.
        *   Access Sensitive Databases or Tables with Insufficient Permissions: Accessing data that the attacker's user should not have access to due to misconfigured grants.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting insecure file system permissions.
        *   Access MySQL Configuration Files (e.g., my.cnf): Reading sensitive configuration files to obtain credentials or other sensitive information.
        *   Modify MySQL Binaries or Libraries: Replacing legitimate MySQL files with malicious ones.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting disabled security features.
        *   Leverage Disabled Features for Malicious Activities: Taking advantage of disabled security features to perform actions that would otherwise be restricted.
    *   **Risk:** High likelihood due to common misconfigurations and the ease of exploiting default or weak credentials. Impact can be critical, leading to full database access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Interaction with MySQL](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_interaction_with_mysql.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application constructs and executes SQL queries.
    *   **Critical Node: SQL Injection (Specific to MySQL Features):** Injecting malicious SQL code through application inputs, specifically targeting MySQL-specific syntax or functions.
        *   Exploit MySQL-Specific Syntax or Functions:
            *   Utilize `LOAD_FILE()` for File Access: Using SQL injection to read files from the server.
            *   Utilize `INTO OUTFILE` for File Writing: Using SQL injection to write files to the server (potentially a web shell).
            *   Utilize Stored Procedure Calls for Privilege Escalation: Injecting calls to stored procedures that might have elevated privileges.
        *   Bypass Input Validation Specific to MySQL Data Types: Crafting inputs that bypass application-level validation due to a misunderstanding of MySQL's data type handling.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Time-Based Blind SQL Injection (Leveraging MySQL Functions).
        *   Utilize `BENCHMARK()` or `SLEEP()` functions: Using MySQL-specific functions to infer information about the database structure by observing response times.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Second-Order SQL Injection (Exploiting Data Stored in MySQL).
        *   Inject Malicious Data that is Later Executed: Injecting malicious code into the database that is not immediately executed but is later retrieved and executed by the application.
    *   **Risk:** High likelihood due to the prevalence of SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications. Impact can be critical, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and potentially remote code execution.
