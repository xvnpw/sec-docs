# Threat Model Analysis for mysql/mysql

## Threat: [Weak MySQL User Credentials](./threats/weak_mysql_user_credentials.md)

**Threat:** Weak MySQL User Credentials

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to guess or brute-force default or weak passwords for MySQL user accounts. If successful, they can gain unauthorized access to the database. This directly involves the MySQL authentication mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Full database compromise, including data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Potential for denial of service by locking or crashing the database.
*   **Affected Component:** MySQL Authentication System, User Management.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies requiring complexity, length, and regular rotation within MySQL.
    *   Disable or rename default administrative accounts within MySQL.
    *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts within MySQL.
    *   Consider using authentication plugins or external authentication mechanisms supported by MySQL.

## Threat: [SQL Injection](./threats/sql_injection.md)

**Threat:** SQL Injection

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user input that is not properly sanitized or parameterized, allowing them to inject arbitrary SQL commands into database queries. This exploits how MySQL parses and executes SQL.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation (insertion, update, deletion), potential for privilege escalation within the database, and in some cases, command execution on the database server.
*   **Affected Component:** MySQL Query Parser, Query Execution Engine, potentially specific functions used in queries within MySQL.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements)** for all database interactions. This is a fundamental mitigation against how MySQL interprets SQL.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization as a defense-in-depth measure, but do not rely on it as the primary protection against SQL injection when interacting with MySQL.
    *   Adopt an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) that handles query construction securely for MySQL.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege for MySQL database users, limiting their access to only necessary data and operations within MySQL.

## Threat: [Blind SQL Injection](./threats/blind_sql_injection.md)

**Threat:** Blind SQL Injection

*   **Description:** Similar to SQL injection, but the attacker does not receive direct error messages or data output from MySQL. Instead, they infer information about the database structure and data by observing the application's response time or behavior to different injected SQL queries processed by MySQL.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, information gathering about the database schema and data managed by MySQL, potentially leading to further exploitation.
*   **Affected Component:** MySQL Query Parser, Query Execution Engine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement consistent error handling within the application to avoid revealing MySQL-specific information.
    *   Monitor application behavior for unusual response times or patterns that might indicate blind SQL injection attempts targeting MySQL.
    *   Use parameterized queries to prevent the underlying vulnerability in MySQL query processing.
    *   Employ web application firewalls (WAFs) with rules to detect and block suspicious SQL injection patterns targeting MySQL.

## Threat: [Insecure Connection Protocols (No TLS/SSL)](./threats/insecure_connection_protocols__no_tlsssl_.md)

**Threat:** Insecure Connection Protocols (No TLS/SSL)

*   **Description:** If the connection between the application and the MySQL server is not encrypted using TLS/SSL, an attacker eavesdropping on the network can intercept sensitive data, including database credentials and query results being transmitted to and from MySQL.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of MySQL database credentials, sensitive data breaches originating from the MySQL database, potential for man-in-the-middle attacks to modify data in transit to or from MySQL.
*   **Affected Component:** MySQL Network Protocol, MySQL Server Configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all connections to the MySQL server.** This is a configuration within MySQL.
    *   Configure the MySQL server to require secure connections.
    *   Ensure that client applications are configured to use TLS/SSL when connecting to MySQL.

## Threat: [Exploiting `LOAD DATA INFILE`](./threats/exploiting__load_data_infile_.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting `LOAD DATA INFILE`

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to specify file paths for the `LOAD DATA INFILE` statement without proper validation, an attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the database server's file system, leveraging a specific MySQL command.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files on the database server where MySQL is running, potential for further system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** MySQL `LOAD DATA INFILE` statement processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable the `LOAD DATA INFILE` functionality in MySQL if it's not required.**
    *   If required, strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided file paths to prevent access to unauthorized locations within the context of the MySQL server.
    *   Run the MySQL server process with minimal privileges.

## Threat: [Exploiting `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`](./threats/exploiting__select_____into_outfile_.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`

*   **Description:** If the application allows users to control the output file path for `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` statements, an attacker could potentially write arbitrary data to files on the database server's file system, leveraging a specific MySQL command.
*   **Impact:** Overwriting critical system files on the MySQL server, injecting malicious code into accessible locations, potential for further system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** MySQL `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` statement processing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable the `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` functionality in MySQL if it's not required.**
    *   If required, strictly control and validate the output file paths within the context of the MySQL server.
    *   Run the MySQL server process with minimal privileges.

## Threat: [Abuse of User-Defined Functions (UDFs)](./threats/abuse_of_user-defined_functions__udfs_.md)

**Threat:** Abuse of User-Defined Functions (UDFs)

*   **Description:** If the application allows the creation or use of User-Defined Functions (UDFs) without proper control, an attacker with sufficient privileges within MySQL could create and execute malicious UDFs, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the database server. This is a direct feature of MySQL.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the database server, potential for lateral movement within the network.
*   **Affected Component:** MySQL UDF Management, Plugin System.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict the ability to create and execute UDFs to only highly trusted administrators within MySQL.**
    *   Regularly audit existing UDFs within MySQL.
    *   Consider disabling UDF functionality in MySQL if it's not essential.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in MySQL Server Software](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_mysql_server_software.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerabilities in MySQL Server Software

*   **Description:** Unpatched vulnerabilities in the MySQL server software itself can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code within the MySQL process, or cause a denial of service of the MySQL service.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from data breaches and remote code execution on the database server to denial of service of the MySQL database.
*   **Affected Component:** Various components of the MySQL server software.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep the MySQL server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.**
