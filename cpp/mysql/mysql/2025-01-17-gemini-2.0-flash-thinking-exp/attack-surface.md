# Attack Surface Analysis for mysql/mysql

## Attack Surface: [Direct Exposure of MySQL Port](./attack_surfaces/direct_exposure_of_mysql_port.md)

*   **Description:** The MySQL server's port (default 3306) is directly accessible from the internet or untrusted networks.
    *   **How MySQL Contributes:** MySQL listens on a specific network port for incoming connections.
    *   **Example:** A cloud server hosting MySQL has its port 3306 open to the public internet without any firewall restrictions.
    *   **Impact:** Allows attackers to directly attempt to connect to the MySQL server, potentially leading to brute-force attacks, exploitation of MySQL vulnerabilities, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Configure firewalls (host-based or network-based) to restrict access to the MySQL port to only authorized IP addresses or networks. Use a private network or VPN for database access. Ensure the MySQL server is bound to a specific internal IP address rather than listening on all interfaces (0.0.0.0).

## Attack Surface: [Weak MySQL User Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_mysql_user_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** MySQL user accounts have weak, default, or easily guessable passwords.
    *   **How MySQL Contributes:** MySQL relies on username/password authentication for access control.
    *   **Example:** The `root` user has a default password or a simple password like "password123".
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Enforce strong password policies for all MySQL users, including minimum length, complexity requirements, and regular password changes. Avoid using default credentials. Implement multi-factor authentication if supported by the MySQL version and connection method.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize user input when constructing SQL queries.
    *   **How MySQL Contributes:** MySQL executes the SQL queries provided by the application. If these queries contain malicious code injected by an attacker, MySQL will execute it.
    *   **Example:** A web form takes user input for a search query and directly embeds it into a SQL `WHERE` clause without sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject `'; DROP TABLE users; --`.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, privilege escalation within the database, or even remote code execution on the database server in some scenarios.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  **Always use parameterized queries (prepared statements)** for database interactions. This prevents user input from being interpreted as SQL code. Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side, but rely primarily on parameterized queries for security. Follow the principle of least privilege when granting database permissions to application users.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure MySQL Server Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_mysql_server_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The MySQL server is configured with insecure default settings or has been misconfigured.
    *   **How MySQL Contributes:** MySQL's configuration determines its security posture and available features. Insecure settings can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** The `skip-networking` option is not enabled when the MySQL server only needs to accept local connections, leaving it exposed on the network. Remote root access is enabled. The `secure-file-priv` option is not properly configured, allowing file manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data breaches, or the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Follow security hardening guidelines for MySQL. Disable unnecessary features and plugins. Ensure the `skip-networking` option is enabled if only local connections are required. Properly configure the `secure-file-priv` option. Regularly review and audit the MySQL configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Using an Outdated and Vulnerable MySQL Version](./attack_surfaces/using_an_outdated_and_vulnerable_mysql_version.md)

*   **Description:** The application is using an outdated version of MySQL that contains known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How MySQL Contributes:** Older versions of software often have publicly disclosed vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
    *   **Example:** The application is running MySQL 5.5, which has several known and patched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers can exploit these known vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code, or cause denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Regularly update the MySQL server to the latest stable and supported version. Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor for security advisories related to MySQL. Implement a patch management process.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of MySQL Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_mysql_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The application stores MySQL credentials insecurely.
    *   **How MySQL Contributes:** Applications need credentials to connect to the MySQL database. If these credentials are compromised, attackers can directly access the database.
    *   **Example:** MySQL credentials are stored in plain text in a configuration file within the application's codebase or in environment variables without proper protection.
    *   **Impact:** Attackers who gain access to the application's files or environment can easily retrieve the database credentials and gain unauthorized access to the MySQL server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Avoid storing credentials directly in code or configuration files. Use secure credential management techniques such as environment variables with restricted access, dedicated secrets management services (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager), or operating system-level credential storage mechanisms. Encrypt sensitive configuration data.
