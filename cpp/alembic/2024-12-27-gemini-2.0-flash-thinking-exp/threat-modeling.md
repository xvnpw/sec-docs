| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Alembic Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Migration Script Execution** | An attacker with access to modify migration scripts injects malicious SQL or code that is executed during `alembic upgrade`. This could involve data manipulation, backdoor creation, or privilege escalation within the database. | - Data corruption or loss. - Introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors in the database schema. - Unauthorized access to data. - Application instability. | - Migration Scripts (`.py` files in the `versions` directory) - `alembic upgrade` command | **Critical** | - **Code Review for Migrations:** Implement mandatory code reviews for all migration scripts before they are applied. - **Static Analysis of Migrations:** Use static analysis tools to scan migration scripts for potentially dangerous SQL or code patterns. - **Principle of Least Privilege for Migrations:** Ensure migrations only perform necessary schema changes and avoid granting excessive privileges. - **Secure Development Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding practices for database migrations. - **Version Control for Migrations:** Store migration scripts in a version control system and track changes. |
| **Alembic Configuration Tampering** | An attacker gains access to the `alembic.ini` file and modifies connection strings to point to a malicious database, alters logging configurations, or changes other critical settings. | - Connection to an attacker-controlled database, leading to data exfiltration or manipulation. - Disabling or manipulating logging, hindering incident response. - Application malfunction due to incorrect configuration. | - `alembic.ini` configuration file | **High** | - **Secure File Permissions:** Restrict access to the `alembic.ini` file to authorized users and processes only. - **Immutable Infrastructure:**  Deploy Alembic configurations as part of immutable infrastructure to prevent runtime modifications. - **Configuration Management:** Use secure configuration management tools to manage and deploy `alembic.ini`. - **Regular Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the `alembic.ini` file. |
| **Manipulation of `alembic_version` Table** | An attacker directly modifies the `alembic_version` table in the database to trick Alembic into believing certain migrations have been applied or not. This can lead to skipping necessary migrations or attempting to apply already applied migrations, causing inconsistencies or errors. | - Database schema inconsistencies. - Application errors and unexpected behavior. - Difficulty in rolling back changes. | - `alembic_version` database table | **High** | - **Restrict Direct Database Access:** Limit direct access to the database, especially for modification of system tables like `alembic_version`. - **Enforce Alembic for Migrations:** Strictly enforce the use of Alembic commands for managing migrations and discourage manual modifications to the `alembic_version` table. - **Database Auditing:** Implement database auditing to track modifications to the `alembic_version` table. |
| **Unauthorized Execution of Alembic Commands** | An attacker gains access to the server or environment where Alembic commands are executed and runs commands like `alembic upgrade` or `alembic downgrade` without proper authorization. | - Unauthorized database schema changes. - Potential data loss or corruption due to unintended downgrades. - Application downtime. | - Alembic CLI (`alembic` command) | **High** | - **Strong Authentication and Authorization:** Implement robust access control for the server and environments where Alembic commands are executed. Use separate accounts with limited privileges. - **Secure CI/CD Pipelines:** Secure the CI/CD pipeline to prevent unauthorized execution of Alembic commands. - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC to control who can execute specific Alembic commands. |
| **Privilege Escalation via Migration Scripts** | An attacker crafts a migration script that grants elevated privileges to a specific user or role in the database, potentially allowing them to bypass application-level security controls. | - Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities within the database. - Potential for further malicious actions within the database. | - Migration Scripts (`.py` files in the `versions` directory) | **High** | - **Principle of Least Privilege for Migrations:** Ensure migration scripts only grant the necessary privileges for the intended schema changes. Avoid granting broad or unnecessary permissions. - **Review of Privilege Granting Statements:** Carefully review any SQL statements within migration scripts that grant or modify database privileges. - **Database Security Best Practices:** Follow general database security best practices regarding user and role management. |
