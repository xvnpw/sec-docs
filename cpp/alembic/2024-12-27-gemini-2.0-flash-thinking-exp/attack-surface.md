Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Alembic, with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Malicious Migration Scripts**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject or modify migration scripts to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic directly executes Python code within migration scripts, providing a mechanism for code execution.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies a migration script to include code that reads sensitive environment variables and sends them to an external server.
    *   **Impact:** Critical - Full system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control to the directory containing migration scripts.
        *   Enforce mandatory code review for all migration scripts before they are applied.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan migration scripts for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for signing or verifying the integrity of migration scripts.

*   **Compromised Alembic Configuration**
    *   **Description:** Attackers gain access to the `alembic.ini` file, which often contains database connection strings, potentially including credentials.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic relies on this configuration file to connect to the database for migration operations.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains read access to `alembic.ini` and retrieves the database username and password, allowing them to directly access the database.
    *   **Impact:** High - Database access, data breach, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the `alembic.ini` file with appropriate file system permissions (read access only for the necessary user).
        *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly in `alembic.ini`.
        *   Utilize environment variables or secure secrets management systems to store database credentials and reference them in the Alembic configuration.
        *   Encrypt sensitive information within the configuration file if direct storage is unavoidable.

*   **Command-Line Interface (CLI) Abuse**
    *   **Description:** Attackers with server access execute Alembic CLI commands to manipulate the database schema in unauthorized ways.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic provides a powerful CLI for managing database migrations, which can be misused if access is not controlled.
    *   **Example:** An attacker with SSH access to the server executes `alembic downgrade base` to revert the database to an initial state, causing significant data loss.
    *   **Impact:** High - Data loss, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict server access to authorized personnel only.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for server access.
        *   Limit the user accounts that have permissions to execute Alembic commands.
        *   Consider using a dedicated user account with minimal privileges for running Alembic migrations.
