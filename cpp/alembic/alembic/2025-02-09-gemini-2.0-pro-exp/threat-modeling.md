# Threat Model Analysis for alembic/alembic

## Threat: [Malicious Migration Script Injection](./threats/malicious_migration_script_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker (insider or compromised account) creates or modifies a migration script (`.py` file in `versions/`) to include malicious SQL or Python code within the `upgrade()` or `downgrade()` functions, leveraging the `op` (Operations) object.  This could involve dropping tables, stealing data, modifying privileges, creating backdoors, or executing arbitrary commands on the database server. The attacker aims to have this script executed during the migration process.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, data corruption, unauthorized data access, complete database compromise, potential system compromise (if the database server is vulnerable), application downtime, reputational damage.
    *   **Alembic Component Affected:** Migration script files (`.py` files within the `versions/` directory), specifically the `upgrade()` and `downgrade()` functions and the `op` object.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory, Multi-Person Code Reviews:** Enforce strict code reviews for *all* migration scripts, focusing on security.
        *   **Static Code Analysis:** Use tools to automatically scan for dangerous patterns (e.g., `op.execute()` with dynamic input).
        *   **Least Privilege Database User:** Run Alembic with a user having *only* schema modification permissions, *not* administrative privileges.
        *   **Version Control with Branch Protection:** Use Git with rules to prevent direct commits to the main branch and require pull requests.
        *   **Digital Signatures (Advanced):** Consider digitally signing migration scripts.
        *   **Comprehensive Testing:** Thoroughly test all migrations (including downgrades) in a non-production environment, with security-focused tests.
        *   **Input Validation (if applicable):** Rigorously validate and sanitize any external input used in migration scripts (highly discouraged).

## Threat: [Unauthorized Migration Execution](./threats/unauthorized_migration_execution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the environment where Alembic commands are run (compromised developer machine, misconfigured CI/CD, or direct database server access) and executes `alembic upgrade` or `alembic downgrade` without authorization.  This could involve running legitimate migrations at the wrong time, running malicious migrations, or running them out of order.
    *   **Impact:** Unintended schema changes, data loss, data corruption, application downtime, potential privilege escalation (via a malicious migration).
    *   **Alembic Component Affected:** The Alembic command-line interface (CLI) and the execution environment (shell, CI/CD). The `alembic.ini` file is relevant for connection settings, but the *execution* of commands is the core issue.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:** Automate migration execution through a secure pipeline with strict access controls and audit trails. Avoid manual execution in production.
        *   **Environment Separation:** Use separate environments (dev, staging, prod) with distinct credentials and access.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for accounts accessing the pipeline or database server.
        *   **Restricted Network Access:** Limit database server access to authorized hosts/applications.
        *   **Database Auditing:** Enable auditing to track schema changes and identify unauthorized activity.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The Alembic user should have minimal necessary permissions.

## Threat: [`alembic_version` Table Manipulation](./threats/_alembic_version__table_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with direct database access (but *without* legitimate Alembic access) directly modifies the `alembic_version` table. They could change the version to re-run malicious migrations, skip security migrations, or cause Alembic to believe a migration is applied when it isn't. This bypasses Alembic's intended version control.
    *   **Impact:** Re-execution of malicious migrations, bypassing security fixes, data corruption, application instability, potential data loss.
    *   **Alembic Component Affected:** The `alembic_version` table within the target database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Database Permissions:** Restrict write access to the `alembic_version` table to *only* the Alembic database user. No other user/process should have write access.
        *   **Database Auditing:** Monitor changes to the `alembic_version` table for suspicious activity.
        *   **Regular Backups:** Maintain consistent backups of the database, including the `alembic_version` table.
        *   **Integrity Checks (Advanced):** Implement custom checks (outside of Alembic) to verify the integrity of the `alembic_version` table against the expected migration history (e.g., comparing to checksums or records stored elsewhere).

## Threat: [Alembic/Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/alembicdependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability is discovered in Alembic itself or one of its dependencies (SQLAlchemy, Mako, etc.). An attacker exploits this to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access, or cause a denial-of-service.  The attacker might craft malicious input or exploit a flaw in how Alembic processes scripts. This is a direct threat to Alembic's code.
    *   **Impact:** Varies with the vulnerability, but could range from denial-of-service to complete system compromise, including data breaches.
    *   **Alembic Component Affected:** Potentially any part of Alembic or its dependencies, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Alembic and all dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a tool (pip, Poetry) to track and manage dependencies, simplifying updates.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories for Alembic, SQLAlchemy, and related libraries.
