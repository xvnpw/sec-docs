## Attack Tree Path: [[Gain Unauthorized Database Access/Modification/Corruption via Alembic]*](./attack_tree_paths/_gain_unauthorized_database_accessmodificationcorruption_via_alembic_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to gain unauthorized access to the application's database, modify its contents, or corrupt it, all by exploiting vulnerabilities related to Alembic.
*   **Likelihood:** (Not applicable to the overall goal)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** (Varies depending on the specific attack path)
*   **Skill Level:** (Varies depending on the specific attack path)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** (Varies depending on the specific attack path)

## Attack Tree Path: [[1. Exploit Alembic Configuration]*](./attack_tree_paths/_1__exploit_alembic_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on leveraging misconfigurations in Alembic's setup, such as insecurely stored credentials or improper file permissions.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Configuration errors are common)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Direct access to database credentials or control over Alembic's behavior)
*   **Effort:** Generally Low to Medium (Exploiting misconfigurations is often easier than finding and exploiting software vulnerabilities)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring configuration files, environment variables, and file permissions)

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1 Insecure Environment Variables]*](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_insecure_environment_variables_.md)

*   **Description:** Alembic often relies on environment variables to store sensitive information like database connection strings.  If these variables are not properly secured, an attacker can gain access to them.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on server/deployment security)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Direct access to database credentials)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1.1 Read Environment Variables]*](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1_1_read_environment_variables_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains read access to the environment variables, potentially through a compromised process, a vulnerable dependency, or server misconfiguration.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.2 Hardcoded Credentials]*](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2_hardcoded_credentials_.md)

*   **Description:** Database credentials are (incorrectly) stored directly within the Alembic configuration files (`alembic.ini`) or within the application's source code.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Bad practice, but still occurs)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Direct access to database credentials)
*   **Effort:** Low to High (Depends on how the attacker gains access)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.2.1 Source Code Access]*](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2_1_source_code_access_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the application's source code repository, allowing them to read the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.2.2 Configuration File Access]*](./attack_tree_paths/_1_2_2_configuration_file_access_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the server's file system and reads the `alembic.ini` file containing the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3 Weak File Permissions]*](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_weak_file_permissions_.md)

*   **Description:** The Alembic configuration files (`alembic.ini`) or the `versions/` directory have overly permissive file permissions, allowing unauthorized users to read or modify them.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on deployment practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3.1 Read Configuration]*](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_1_read_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker reads the `alembic.ini` file due to weak file permissions, obtaining database credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3.2 Modify Configuration]*](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3_2_modify_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker modifies the `alembic.ini` file due to weak file permissions, potentially changing the database connection to point to a malicious server or altering other settings.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
