# Attack Surface Analysis for alembic/alembic

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Database Credentials (via Alembic Configuration)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_database_credentials__via_alembic_configuration_.md)

**Description:** Alembic configuration files (`alembic.ini`) or environment variable setups used *specifically for Alembic* store database connection details. Exposure of these grants direct database access.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic *requires* these credentials to operate; its configuration mechanisms are the direct point of vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An `alembic.ini` file, intended only for Alembic, contains a plaintext database password and is accidentally committed to a public repository.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise (read, write, delete, modify schema).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Environment Variables (Alembic-Specific):** Use environment variables *specifically scoped for Alembic's use* to store database URLs and passwords.  Avoid reusing general application environment variables if they have broader exposure.
        *   **Secrets Management (Dedicated to Alembic):** If using a secrets manager, create a dedicated secret specifically for Alembic's credentials, separate from other application secrets. This limits the blast radius if the Alembic configuration is compromised.
        *   **Secure `alembic.ini`:** If `alembic.ini` is used for *any* settings (even non-sensitive ones), ensure it has restricted file permissions (`chmod 600` or equivalent).  Treat it as a sensitive file.
        *   **.gitignore (for Alembic files):** Explicitly add `alembic.ini` and any environment files *specifically related to Alembic* to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits.
        *   **Audit Alembic Configuration:** Regularly audit *only* the Alembic-related configuration files and environment setup to ensure credentials are not exposed.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Migration Scripts (Alembic's Core Functionality)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_migration_scripts__alembic's_core_functionality_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject or modify Alembic migration scripts to execute arbitrary SQL, gaining complete control over the database.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** This is the *primary* attack vector against Alembic. Alembic's purpose is to execute these scripts; compromised scripts are directly executed by Alembic.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the `versions/` directory and creates a migration that drops all tables or exfiltrates data.
    *   **Impact:** Complete database compromise, data exfiltration, data corruption, potential for code execution on the database server (depending on database configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Access Control (Migrations Directory):** *Extremely* limited write access to the `versions/` directory (where Alembic stores migrations). Only trusted, authorized personnel should have write permissions.
        *   **Mandatory Code Reviews (Alembic Migrations):** Implement a strict, security-focused code review process *specifically for Alembic migration scripts*.  No migration should be merged or deployed without review.
        *   **Code Signing (for Migration Files):** Digitally sign Alembic migration scripts.  Configure Alembic (or a wrapper script) to *verify* these signatures before execution. This prevents unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Least Privilege (Alembic Database User):** Create a dedicated database user *specifically for Alembic*. Grant this user *only* the absolute minimum privileges required for schema changes.  *Never* grant `DROP DATABASE`, `CREATE USER`, or similar high-risk permissions.
        *   **Static Analysis (of Migration Scripts):** Use static analysis tools to scan Alembic migration scripts for potential SQL injection or other security vulnerabilities *before* they are committed or deployed.
        *   **Version Control (for Migrations):** Use a version control system (e.g., Git) to track all changes to Alembic migration scripts, enabling auditing and rollbacks. This is crucial for identifying when and how a malicious migration might have been introduced.

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Migration Execution (via Alembic Commands)](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_migration_execution__via_alembic_commands_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trigger Alembic commands (e.g., `alembic upgrade`, `alembic downgrade`) without authorization, potentially applying malicious migrations or causing data loss.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic provides the command-line and programmatic interfaces that are being abused in this attack. The vulnerability lies in *how* these Alembic interfaces are exposed and secured.
    *   **Example:** An exposed web endpoint allows unauthenticated users to execute `alembic upgrade head`, which applies a previously injected malicious migration.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss or corruption, application downtime, potential application of malicious migrations (if combined with successful injection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authentication & Authorization (for Alembic Triggers):** *Any* mechanism that can trigger Alembic commands (web endpoints, scripts, CI/CD pipelines) *must* have strong authentication and authorization.  Only authorized users/systems should be able to run Alembic commands.
        *   **Command Injection Prevention (around Alembic calls):** If any application code constructs Alembic commands dynamically, *rigorously* sanitize and validate any input that influences the command.  Prefer parameterized interfaces if available.
        *   **Secure CI/CD Pipelines (for Alembic Execution):**
            *   **Limited Access:** Restrict access to the CI/CD pipeline configuration and execution environment, especially parts that interact with Alembic.
            *   **Verification (of Migrations within CI/CD):** Before running `alembic upgrade` in a pipeline, verify the integrity of the migration scripts (e.g., using code signing, checksums).
            *   **Approval Gates (before Production Alembic Runs):** Require manual approval before applying Alembic migrations to production environments via the CI/CD pipeline.
            *   **Auditing (of Alembic runs in CI/CD):** Log all pipeline activity, *specifically* including Alembic command execution, with details about which migrations were applied.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege (Database User in CI/CD):** The database user used by the CI/CD pipeline to run Alembic migrations should have the absolute minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exfiltration via Migrations](./attack_surfaces/data_exfiltration_via_migrations.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers use Alembic migration scripts to extract sensitive data from the database.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic's ability to execute arbitrary SQL makes it a potential tool for data exfiltration if compromised.
    *   **Example:** A migration script that selects data from a `users` table containing passwords and emails, then writes this data to a file or sends it to an external server.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, exposure of sensitive information, potential for identity theft or other malicious activities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **All mitigations from "Malicious Migration Scripts" apply.**
        *   **Code Review (Data Handling):** Carefully review migration scripts for any operations that access or manipulate sensitive data, ensuring they are necessary and secure.
