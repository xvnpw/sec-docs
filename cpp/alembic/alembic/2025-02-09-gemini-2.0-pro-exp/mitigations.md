## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Alembic's `stamp` Command for Synchronization](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_alembic's__stamp__command_for_synchronization.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Leverage Alembic's `stamp` Command for Synchronization

- **Description:**
    1.  **Before Testing:** Before running any new migrations on a staging or testing environment, use the `alembic stamp` command to explicitly set the database's revision to match the current revision of the production database.  For example: `alembic stamp <production_revision>`.
    2.  **Avoid `upgrade head` Blindly:** Do *not* simply run `alembic upgrade head` on a non-production environment without first ensuring it's at the correct starting point.  This prevents applying migrations out of order or against an incorrect schema.
    3.  **Automated Deployment:** Integrate the `alembic stamp` command into your automated deployment scripts to ensure that the target database is always at the expected revision before applying new migrations.

- **Threats Mitigated:**
    - **Schema Inconsistencies (Severity: High):** Applying migrations out of order or against an incorrect initial schema, leading to unexpected database states.
    - **Application Downtime (Severity: High):** Errors caused by schema inconsistencies that only manifest in non-production environments after incorrect migration application.
    - **Data Corruption (Severity: Critical):** In rare cases, out-of-order migrations *could* lead to data corruption, although this is less likely than schema inconsistencies.

- **Impact:**
    - **Schema Inconsistencies:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring a consistent starting point for migrations.
    - **Application Downtime:** Reduces the risk of errors related to incorrect schema state.
    - **Data Corruption:** Provides a small but important reduction in risk.

- **Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Used inconsistently. Some deployment scripts use `stamp`, others do not."]*

- **Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Consistent use of `alembic stamp` in all deployment and testing scripts.  Documentation and training on its proper use."]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Alembic Configuration (`alembic.ini`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_alembic_configuration___alembic_ini__.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Alembic Configuration (`alembic.ini`)

- **Description:**
    1.  **Environment Variables for Credentials:**  *Never* hardcode database connection strings (including usernames, passwords, hostnames, and database names) directly within the `alembic.ini` file.  Instead, use environment variables.  For example, in `alembic.ini`:
        ```ini
        sqlalchemy.url = ${DATABASE_URL}
        ```
        And then set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable on the server where Alembic is run.
    2.  **File Permissions:**  Restrict access to the `alembic.ini` file itself using operating system file permissions.  Only the user account that runs Alembic (and potentially deployment scripts) should have read access.  No users should have write access except for administrators.
    3.  **Centralized Configuration (Optional):** For larger deployments, consider using a centralized configuration management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to manage the database connection string and inject it into the environment where Alembic runs.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review the contents of `alembic.ini` to ensure no sensitive information has been accidentally added.

- **Threats Mitigated:**
    - **Exposure of Sensitive Information (Severity: Critical):**  Leakage of database credentials, leading to unauthorized access.

- **Impact:**
    - **Exposure of Sensitive Information:**  Significantly reduces the risk of credential exposure by removing them from the configuration file.

- **Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Partially implemented. Database URL uses an environment variable, but file permissions are not strictly enforced."]*

- **Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Strict enforcement of file permissions on `alembic.ini`.  Regular review of the file contents."]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Alembic's `execute()` for Safe Dynamic SQL (with Caution)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_alembic's__execute____for_safe_dynamic_sql__with_caution_.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Utilize Alembic's `execute()` for Safe Dynamic SQL (with Caution)

- **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid String Concatenation:** If you need to execute dynamic SQL within a migration (which should be *rare* and carefully considered), *never* use string concatenation to build the SQL query.  This is highly vulnerable to SQL injection.
    2.  **Parameterized Queries:** Instead, use Alembic's `execute()` method in conjunction with parameterized queries.  This allows you to pass values separately from the SQL code, preventing SQL injection.
        ```python
        from alembic import op
        # ...
        def upgrade():
            op.execute(
                "UPDATE my_table SET column1 = :value WHERE id = :id",
                [{"value": "new_value", "id": 1}, {"value": "another_value", "id": 2}]
            )
        ```
    3.  **Minimize Dynamic SQL:**  Strive to use Alembic's built-in operations (e.g., `op.add_column`, `op.create_table`) whenever possible.  Dynamic SQL should be a last resort.
    4.  **Thorough Review:**  Any migration that uses `execute()` with dynamic SQL *must* undergo extremely rigorous code review to ensure it's not vulnerable to SQL injection.

- **Threats Mitigated:**
    - **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):**  Vulnerabilities that allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL code.

- **Impact:**
    - **SQL Injection:**  Significantly reduces the risk of SQL injection when dynamic SQL is absolutely necessary.

- **Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Dynamic SQL is rarely used, but parameterized queries are not consistently enforced."]*

- **Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Strict policy and code review process to ensure parameterized queries are *always* used with `execute()` when dynamic SQL is present.  Training for developers on safe dynamic SQL practices."]*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicit `downgrade()` Implementation and Testing](./mitigation_strategies/explicit__downgrade____implementation_and_testing.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Explicit `downgrade()` Implementation and Testing

- **Description:**
    1.  **Always Implement `downgrade()`:**  For *every* `upgrade()` function in your Alembic migration scripts, you *must* implement a corresponding `downgrade()` function that reverses the changes.
    2.  **Symmetry:**  The `downgrade()` function should be the exact inverse of the `upgrade()` function.  If `upgrade()` adds a column, `downgrade()` should remove it.  If `upgrade()` inserts data, `downgrade()` should delete it (or revert it to its previous state).
    3.  **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the `downgrade()` function in a staging environment.  This is just as important as testing the `upgrade()` function.  Use `alembic downgrade` to apply the downgrade.
    4.  **Data Preservation (Considerations):**  Consider the implications of `downgrade()` on data.  In some cases, it may not be possible to perfectly restore data to its previous state.  Document any limitations or potential data loss scenarios.

- **Threats Mitigated:**
    - **Data Loss (Severity: Critical):**  Inability to revert a problematic migration, leading to permanent data loss.
    - **Schema Inconsistencies (Severity: High):**  An incomplete or incorrect `downgrade()` function leaving the database in an inconsistent state.
    - **Application Downtime (Severity: High):**  Inability to quickly roll back a failed migration, leading to extended downtime.

- **Impact:**
    - **Data Loss:**  Provides a mechanism to revert changes and potentially recover data.
    - **Schema Inconsistencies:**  Ensures that the database schema can be reverted to a previous state.
    - **Application Downtime:**  Enables faster recovery from failed migrations.

- **Currently Implemented:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "`downgrade()` functions are implemented, but testing is inconsistent."]*

- **Missing Implementation:** *[Placeholder: e.g., "Consistent and thorough testing of *all* `downgrade()` functions in a staging environment."]*
