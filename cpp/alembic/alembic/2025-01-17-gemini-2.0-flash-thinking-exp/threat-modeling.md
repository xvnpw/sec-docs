# Threat Model Analysis for alembic/alembic

## Threat: [Malicious Migration File Injection](./threats/malicious_migration_file_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the codebase or development environment and injects malicious SQL or Python code directly into a new or existing migration file managed by Alembic. This could involve altering existing migrations or adding entirely new ones that Alembic will execute.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary SQL queries leading to data breaches (reading sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), or even database server compromise. Malicious Python code within migrations could lead to remote code execution on the server where Alembic applies the migrations.
*   **Affected Component:** `alembic.script.ScriptDirectory` (where Alembic discovers and manages migration files), individual migration files within the `versions` directory.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls and authentication for the codebase and development environments.
    *   Enforce mandatory code reviews for all migration changes before they are merged or applied.
    *   Consider using signed commits for migration files to ensure their integrity is verifiable by Alembic or related tooling.
    *   Implement automated checks to scan migration files for suspicious code patterns before they are applied by Alembic.

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials in Alembic Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_in_alembic_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Database connection details (username, password, host) required for Alembic to interact with the database are hardcoded or stored insecurely within the `alembic.ini` configuration file or environment variables that are easily accessible. This allows an attacker who gains access to the configuration to directly compromise the database.
*   **Impact:** Attackers gaining access to these credentials can directly connect to the database and perform unauthorized actions, bypassing application-level security measures. This can lead to complete database compromise, including data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `alembic.config.Config` (which is responsible for reading and managing the Alembic configuration, including database connection details), the `alembic.ini` file itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store database credentials securely using environment variables that are managed by a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Avoid hardcoding credentials directly in the `alembic.ini` file.
    *   Restrict access to the server or environment where Alembic is configured and executed, ensuring only authorized personnel can access the configuration files or environment variables.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Execution of Alembic Commands](./threats/unauthorized_execution_of_alembic_commands.md)

*   **Description:** Individuals without proper authorization are able to directly execute Alembic commands (e.g., `upgrade`, `downgrade`) in production or other sensitive environments. This bypasses any intended workflow or approval process for database schema changes.
*   **Impact:**  Unintended or malicious database schema changes can be applied directly, potentially leading to data loss, corruption, application instability, or the introduction of vulnerabilities through schema modifications.
*   **Affected Component:** `alembic.command` module (which contains the logic for executing Alembic commands), the command-line interface (CLI) used to invoke Alembic commands.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls and authentication for executing Alembic commands, especially in production environments. This might involve using operating system-level permissions or dedicated access management tools.
    *   Consider using separate, restricted accounts with minimal necessary privileges for running migrations.
    *   Automate the migration process within a controlled deployment pipeline that includes authorization checks and audit logging, rather than allowing direct command execution.

## Threat: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Custom Alembic Scripts or Hooks](./threats/injection_vulnerabilities_in_custom_alembic_scripts_or_hooks.md)

*   **Description:** If custom Python code is used within Alembic migrations or environment context scripts (`env.py`) to perform tasks beyond basic schema changes, it might be vulnerable to injection attacks. For example, if the custom code constructs SQL queries dynamically based on external input (though this is generally discouraged with Alembic), or if it interacts with the operating system in an insecure manner.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for remote code execution on the server where Alembic is being executed if the custom code interacts with the operating system. If the vulnerability is related to database interaction, it could lead to SQL injection, allowing unauthorized data access or manipulation.
*   **Affected Component:** Custom code within individual migration files, the `env.py` file (especially the `run_migrations_online` function), any custom event listeners or hooks implemented within the Alembic environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid constructing SQL queries dynamically within custom Alembic scripts. Rely on Alembic's built-in operations for schema changes.
    *   Sanitize and validate any external input used within custom Alembic scripts to prevent command injection or other forms of injection.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when writing custom Python code for Alembic, including avoiding the use of functions known to be vulnerable if not handled carefully (e.g., `os.system`, `subprocess.call` with unsanitized input).

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Alembic Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_alembic_library_itself.md)

*   **Description:** A security vulnerability exists within the core Alembic library code. This could be a bug that allows for unexpected behavior or a flaw that can be exploited by a malicious actor.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could potentially allow for unauthorized database access or manipulation if an attacker can trigger the vulnerable code path. In severe cases, it might even lead to remote code execution if the vulnerability lies in how Alembic processes certain inputs or interacts with the operating system.
*   **Affected Component:** The core Alembic library code across various modules, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can be Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Alembic updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with Alembic.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools on the Alembic codebase itself if you have concerns about potential vulnerabilities.
