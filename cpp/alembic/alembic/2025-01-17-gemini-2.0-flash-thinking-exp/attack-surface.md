# Attack Surface Analysis for alembic/alembic

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Database Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_database_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Database connection details (username, password, host, database name) are stored in a way that is accessible to unauthorized individuals or processes.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic configuration files (typically `alembic.ini`) often contain the database connection string. If these files are not properly secured, they become a direct source of sensitive credentials.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains read access to the `alembic.ini` file on a production server and retrieves the database credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the database, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store database credentials securely using environment variables instead of directly in `alembic.ini`.
        *   Implement strict file system permissions on the `alembic.ini` file and the directory containing it, ensuring only authorized users and processes have access.
        *   Avoid committing `alembic.ini` with sensitive credentials to version control systems.
        *   Consider using secrets management tools to handle database credentials.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Migration Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_migration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject or modify migration files to include malicious SQL code that will be executed during the migration process.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic executes the SQL statements defined in the migration files. If these files are compromised, Alembic will unknowingly execute malicious code against the database.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the migrations directory and adds a migration file that drops critical tables or inserts malicious data. When `alembic upgrade head` is run, this malicious code is executed.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, denial of service, or even complete database takeover depending on the privileges of the database user used by Alembic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access controls on the directory containing migration files, limiting write access to authorized personnel and processes only.
        *   Implement code review processes for all migration files before they are applied to production environments.
        *   Use version control for migration files and track changes to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   Consider using checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of migration files.
        *   Run Alembic migrations in a controlled environment with limited database privileges if possible.

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted Access to Alembic Commands](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_access_to_alembic_commands.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized users or processes can execute Alembic commands, potentially leading to unintended or malicious database changes.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic provides powerful CLI commands for managing database migrations. If access to these commands is not controlled, attackers could use them to manipulate the database.
    *   **Example:** A web application exposes an endpoint that allows users to trigger Alembic commands without proper authentication or authorization. An attacker uses this endpoint to downgrade the database to an older version, potentially causing data loss.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, denial of service, or unauthorized schema modifications.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the server environment where Alembic commands are executed.
        *   Avoid exposing Alembic commands directly through web interfaces or APIs.
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms if Alembic commands need to be triggered programmatically.
        *   Use dedicated deployment pipelines and tools that manage Alembic migrations securely.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation through Migrations](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_through_migrations.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage the database user's privileges used by Alembic to perform actions beyond the intended scope of schema changes.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic executes SQL statements with the privileges of the database user configured in its connection string. If this user has excessive privileges, malicious migrations can exploit them.
    *   **Example:** The database user used by Alembic has `CREATE USER` privileges. An attacker injects a migration that creates a new, highly privileged database user.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the database instance, potentially affecting other applications sharing the same database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Ensure the database user used by Alembic has only the necessary permissions to perform schema migrations and nothing more.
        *   Regularly review and audit the permissions of the Alembic database user.
        *   Consider using separate database users for different stages of the application lifecycle (development, staging, production).

## Attack Surface: [Indirect Command Injection via Alembic](./attack_surfaces/indirect_command_injection_via_alembic.md)

*   **Description:** While Alembic itself is unlikely to have direct command injection vulnerabilities, improper use of user-supplied input when constructing Alembic commands can lead to command injection.
    *   **How Alembic Contributes:** If application code dynamically constructs Alembic commands using untrusted user input, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.
    *   **Example:** An application takes user input for a migration name and uses it directly in a system call to execute `alembic upgrade <user_input>`. An attacker provides input like `head; rm -rf /`, leading to command execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the server where Alembic is executed.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid constructing Alembic commands dynamically using user-supplied input.
        *   If dynamic command construction is necessary, sanitize and validate user input rigorously.
        *   Use parameterized commands or APIs provided by Alembic or related libraries to avoid direct command construction.
