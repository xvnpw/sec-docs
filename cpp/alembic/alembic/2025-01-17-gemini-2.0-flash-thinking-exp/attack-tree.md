## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Alembic **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_alembic__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, representing a successful breach of the application's security by exploiting weaknesses within the Alembic framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Migration Script Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_migration_script_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target the migration scripts themselves to introduce malicious code or logic flaws. These scripts execute with database privileges, making this a high-impact attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Migration Scripts **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_migration_scripts__critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to insert malicious Python code into migration scripts. This code could execute arbitrary commands on the server, exfiltrate data, or modify the database in harmful ways when the migration is run.

    * **Via Compromised Developer Account (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Gaining access to a developer's machine or credentials allows direct modification of the migration scripts. This is a common and effective attack vector.

    * **Via Insufficient Access Controls on Migration Files (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Weak file permissions on the migration script directory allow unauthorized modification of the scripts. This makes it easier for attackers with limited access to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Via Compromised Developer Account **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/via_compromised_developer_account__critical_node_.md)

Gaining access to a developer's machine or credentials allows direct modification of the migration scripts. This is a common and effective attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Via Insufficient Access Controls on Migration Files **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/via_insufficient_access_controls_on_migration_files__critical_node_.md)

Weak file permissions on the migration script directory allow unauthorized modification of the scripts. This makes it easier for attackers with limited access to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Logic Flaws in Migration Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_logic_flaws_in_migration_scripts.md)

Attackers introduce subtle but critical flaws in the migration logic that can lead to unintended data manipulation, corruption, or state changes.

    * **Introduce irreversible or destructive migrations:**
        * Attackers create migrations that permanently damage the database or cause significant data loss. This can be done intentionally or through poorly designed migrations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce irreversible or destructive migrations](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_irreversible_or_destructive_migrations.md)

Attackers create migrations that permanently damage the database or cause significant data loss. This can be done intentionally or through poorly designed migrations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Alembic Configuration Vulnerabilities **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_alembic_configuration_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target the `alembic.ini` configuration file to gain access to sensitive information or manipulate Alembic's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Database Credentials in `alembic.ini` **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/modify_database_credentials_in__alembic_ini___critical_node_.md)

Attackers target the `alembic.ini` file to gain access to database credentials, allowing them to directly access and manipulate the database.

    * **Via Compromised Server Access (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Gaining access to the server hosting the application allows direct modification of the `alembic.ini` file to steal or change database credentials.

    * **Via Insufficient File Permissions on `alembic.ini` (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Weak permissions on the `alembic.ini` file allow unauthorized reading, revealing database credentials, or modification to point to a malicious database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Via Compromised Server Access **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/via_compromised_server_access__critical_node_.md)

Gaining access to the server hosting the application allows direct modification of the `alembic.ini` file to steal or change database credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Via Insufficient File Permissions on `alembic.ini` **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/via_insufficient_file_permissions_on__alembic_ini___critical_node_.md)

Weak permissions on the `alembic.ini` file allow unauthorized reading, revealing database credentials, or modification to point to a malicious database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Secure Migration Practices **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_secure_migration_practices__critical_node_.md)

Attackers exploit weaknesses in the development and deployment processes surrounding database migrations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Run Migrations in Production Without Proper Review **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/run_migrations_in_production_without_proper_review__critical_node_.md)

Directly applying migrations to the production database without thorough review increases the risk of introducing malicious or flawed changes that can compromise the application. This relies on internal access and a lack of process.
