## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Malicious Migration File](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_malicious_migration_file.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * An attacker aims to inject malicious SQL or code within a database migration file.
    * This can be achieved by compromising a developer's machine or account, allowing direct modification of migration files.
    * Alternatively, vulnerabilities in custom migration generation scripts (if used) could be exploited.
    * Once a malicious migration exists, the attacker relies on it being applied to the database.
    * This can happen automatically during deployment processes where migrations are executed as part of the deployment.
    * It could also occur through social engineering, where an authorized user is tricked into manually applying the malicious migration.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Code into New Migration](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_malicious_code_into_new_migration.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * Direct modification of migration files on a compromised developer machine or account.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom scripts or tools used to generate migration files, allowing the injection of malicious content during the generation process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Apply the Malicious Migration](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__apply_the_malicious_migration.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * Automated execution of migrations as part of the application's deployment pipeline.
    * Manual execution of the malicious migration by an authorized user who has been deceived or is unaware of its malicious nature.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate Alembic Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__manipulate_alembic_configuration.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * The attacker's goal is to gain access to and modify the `alembic.ini` configuration file.
    * This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in the server's operating system or web server, allowing filesystem access.
    * Compromising the deployment pipeline or configuration management systems could also grant access to modify the configuration file.
    * Once access is gained, the attacker can modify the configuration for malicious purposes.
    * This includes changing the database connection string to point to a database controlled by the attacker, allowing data interception or manipulation.
    * Another attack vector is modifying logging settings or paths to custom scripts that Alembic might execute, enabling code injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Access to Alembic Configuration File (alembic.ini)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__gain_access_to_alembic_configuration_file__alembic_ini_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * Exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the server's operating system or web server to gain unauthorized filesystem access.
    * Targeting and compromising the systems and processes involved in the application's deployment pipeline or configuration management, allowing modification of configuration files during deployment or update cycles.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Alembic Command-Line Interface (CLI) Misuse](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_alembic_command-line_interface__cli__misuse.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * The attacker aims to gain unauthorized access to a server where the Alembic CLI can be executed.
    * This can be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the server's operating system or other services running on the server.
    * Alternatively, the attacker could compromise a user account that has the necessary permissions to execute Alembic commands on the server.
    * With unauthorized access, the attacker can execute malicious Alembic commands.
    * This includes using `alembic upgrade head` to apply any malicious migrations that have been previously injected.
    * Another approach is to downgrade the database to a base state using `alembic downgrade base` and then upgrade it with malicious migrations.
    * If the Alembic configuration allows the execution of custom scripts, the attacker could potentially trigger these scripts for malicious purposes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Unauthorized Access to Server with Alembic CLI](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__gain_unauthorized_access_to_server_with_alembic_cli.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the server's operating system, network services, or applications running on the server to gain remote access.
    * Employing techniques like credential stuffing, brute-force attacks, or phishing to compromise legitimate user accounts that have permissions to execute Alembic commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] The Malicious Migration is Applied Without Proper Review](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__the_malicious_migration_is_applied_without_proper_review.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * This node represents a failure in the security process rather than a direct technical attack.
    * A malicious actor (insider or someone who has gained unauthorized access to the development environment) introduces malicious code into a migration file.
    * The primary attack vector here is the lack of a mandatory and thorough code review process for database migrations. This allows the malicious migration to bypass scrutiny and be applied to the database.
