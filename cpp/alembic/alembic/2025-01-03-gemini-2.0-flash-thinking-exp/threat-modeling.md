# Threat Model Analysis for alembic/alembic

## Threat: [Exposure of Database Credentials through `alembic.ini`](./threats/exposure_of_database_credentials_through__alembic_ini_.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the `alembic.ini` configuration file, which is used by Alembic to connect to the database. This access allows the attacker to retrieve database credentials.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data. This can lead to data breaches, data loss, and disruption of services.

**Affected Alembic Component:** `alembic.config` module, specifically the parsing and handling of the `alembic.ini` file.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Secure file system permissions on `alembic.ini`, restricting access to only necessary users and groups.
- Avoid storing database credentials directly in `alembic.ini`. Utilize environment variables or a dedicated secrets management system, configuring Alembic to read credentials from these sources.

## Threat: [Malicious Migration Script Injection](./threats/malicious_migration_script_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the directory where Alembic stores migration scripts can inject a malicious script. When Alembic executes migrations, this malicious script will also be executed.

**Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access to the server, installation of malware, or denial of service, depending on the content of the malicious script.

**Affected Alembic Component:** `alembic.script` module (handling script discovery and execution), `alembic.command` module (executing upgrade/downgrade).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strict file system permissions on the migrations directory, limiting write access to authorized personnel and processes only.
- Implement code review processes for all migration scripts before they are added to the repository.
- Utilize version control for migration scripts and track changes. Consider using signed migrations or other mechanisms to ensure the integrity of the scripts, although this is not a built-in Alembic feature.

## Threat: [Running Migrations with Excessive Database Privileges](./threats/running_migrations_with_excessive_database_privileges.md)

**Description:** The database user account configured in Alembic's connection settings has overly broad privileges. If a vulnerability in Alembic or a migration script is exploited, or if an attacker gains control of the migration process, these excessive privileges can be abused.

**Impact:** Full database compromise, including the ability to perform any operation on the database, not just schema changes.

**Affected Alembic Component:** The database connection used by Alembic, configured through `alembic.ini` or environment variables, and utilized by `alembic.command`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Adhere to the principle of least privilege. Grant the database user executing migrations only the necessary permissions for schema modifications (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` on specific tables).
- Avoid using highly privileged accounts for routine migration tasks. Create a dedicated user with limited permissions specifically for Alembic migrations.
