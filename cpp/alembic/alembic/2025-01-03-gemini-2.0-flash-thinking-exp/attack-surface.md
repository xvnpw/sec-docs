# Attack Surface Analysis for alembic/alembic

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage and Management of Migration Scripts](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_and_management_of_migration_scripts.md)

**Description:** Migration scripts, containing database schema changes and potentially sensitive data manipulation logic, are stored in a location accessible to unauthorized individuals.

**How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic relies on these scripts to manage database evolution. If these scripts are compromised, Alembic will execute the malicious code within them.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the project's Git repository where migration scripts are stored and injects a script that drops a sensitive table or adds a backdoor user.

**Impact:** Data loss, unauthorized data modification, introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors into the database schema.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict access controls on the storage location of migration scripts (e.g., version control repositories).
*   Conduct code reviews for all migration scripts before they are applied.
*   Utilize integrity checks (e.g., checksums) to ensure migration scripts haven't been tampered with.
*   Consider encrypting sensitive data within migration scripts if absolutely necessary (though ideally, avoid storing sensitive data directly in migrations).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Migration Logic (SQL Injection)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_migration_logic__sql_injection_.md)

**Description:** Developers introduce SQL injection vulnerabilities within the `upgrade()` or `downgrade()` functions of migration scripts by constructing dynamic SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic executes these scripts directly against the database. If the scripts contain SQL injection flaws, Alembic will facilitate the execution of malicious SQL.

**Example:** A migration script dynamically constructs a query based on user-provided data (which should generally be avoided in migrations) without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to the database.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid dynamic SQL construction in migration scripts whenever possible.
*   If dynamic SQL is unavoidable, use parameterized queries or prepared statements provided by the database driver.
*   Thoroughly test migration scripts for SQL injection vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce secure coding practices and provide developer training on SQL injection prevention.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Database Credentials in Alembic Configuration](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_database_credentials_in_alembic_configuration.md)

**Description:** Database connection details, including usernames and passwords, are stored insecurely in the `alembic.ini` file or environment variables.

**How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic requires these credentials to connect to the database and perform migrations. If the configuration is compromised, attackers gain direct database access.

**Example:** The `alembic.ini` file is committed to a public repository or stored on a server with weak access controls, allowing an attacker to retrieve the database credentials.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, including data theft, modification, and deletion.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Never store database credentials directly in configuration files.
*   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables managed by orchestration tools).
*   Ensure proper file permissions on the `alembic.ini` file.
*   Avoid committing sensitive configuration files to version control.

## Attack Surface: [Privilege Escalation through Alembic User Permissions](./attack_surfaces/privilege_escalation_through_alembic_user_permissions.md)

**Description:** The database user used by Alembic for running migrations has overly broad permissions, allowing for actions beyond schema modifications.

**How Alembic Contributes:** Alembic executes migrations using the configured database user. If this user has excessive privileges, a compromised migration script or a direct attack using these credentials can have a wider impact.

**Example:** The Alembic user has `SUPERUSER` or `DBA` privileges, allowing an attacker who compromises the Alembic setup to perform arbitrary database administration tasks.

**Impact:** Complete database compromise, potential for system-level access depending on the database configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Principle of least privilege: Grant the Alembic user only the necessary permissions to perform schema migrations (e.g., `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP` on relevant schemas).
*   Avoid granting administrative privileges to the Alembic user.
*   Regularly review and audit the permissions of the Alembic user.
