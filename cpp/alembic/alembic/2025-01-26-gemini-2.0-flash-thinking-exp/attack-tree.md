## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting misconfigurations to access sensitive information stored in Alembic configuration.
*   **Critical Node: Access Alembic Configuration File (alembic.ini) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Publicly Accessible Configuration File:**  Exploiting misconfigured web servers that serve static files like `.ini` files, making `alembic.ini` directly accessible via web requests.
        *   **Path Traversal Vulnerability:**  Leveraging path traversal flaws in the application or web server to access files outside the intended web root, including `alembic.ini`.
        *   **Unauthorized File System Access:** Gaining broader access to the server through other vulnerabilities (like Remote Code Execution) or compromised accounts, allowing direct file system access to `alembic.ini`.
*   **Critical Node: Extract Sensitive Information from Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Database Credentials (username, password, host, port) [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Finding plaintext database credentials directly within `alembic.ini`. This is a primary target as it grants direct access to the database.
        *   **Database Connection String:**  Extracting the database connection string from `alembic.ini`, which often contains database type, host, port, and potentially embedded credentials or connection parameters that can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Migration Script Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_migration_script_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Compromising or exploiting migration scripts to execute malicious actions.
*   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code into Migration Scripts [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Compromise Developer Environment [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Infiltrating a developer's machine through phishing, malware, or weak account security. This allows attackers to directly modify migration scripts in the development repository before they are deployed.
*   **Critical Node: Execute Malicious Migration Script [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **Gain Access to Deployment/CI/CD Pipeline [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Compromising the CI/CD pipeline by stealing credentials or exploiting pipeline vulnerabilities. This enables attackers to inject malicious scripts into the automated deployment process, ensuring their execution during migrations in various environments (staging, production).
*   **Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities within Existing Migration Scripts [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]::**
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **SQL Injection in Migration Scripts [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities within migration scripts. This often occurs when migration scripts dynamically construct SQL queries using unsanitized input (e.g., from configuration files or external sources) instead of using parameterized queries. Successful SQL injection can lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or complete database takeover.
