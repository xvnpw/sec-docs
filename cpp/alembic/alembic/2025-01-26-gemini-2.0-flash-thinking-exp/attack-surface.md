# Attack Surface Analysis for alembic/alembic

## Attack Surface: [Migration Script Arbitrary Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/migration_script_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or compromised Python migration scripts, executed by Alembic, can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Alembic Contribution:** Alembic's fundamental function is to execute Python scripts to manage database migrations. This design inherently allows for code execution within the migration process.
*   **Example:** An attacker injects malicious Python code into a migration script. When `alembic upgrade head` is executed, this code runs with the privileges of the user executing Alembic, potentially compromising the system.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data exfiltration, denial of service, installation of malware, persistent backdoors.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Migration Script Code Review:** Implement mandatory and rigorous code reviews specifically for all Alembic migration scripts before they are applied. Focus on identifying any potentially malicious or unintended code execution paths.
    *   **Secure Development Practices for Migrations:**  Develop and enforce secure coding guidelines for writing migration scripts. Minimize the use of external dependencies and complex logic within migrations.
    *   **Dependency Scanning for Migration Scripts:** Regularly scan the dependencies of migration scripts using tools like `pip-audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in libraries used by migrations.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Alembic Execution:** Execute Alembic commands and migrations with the minimum necessary privileges. Avoid running migrations as root or highly privileged users.
    *   **Immutable Migration Scripts (Version Control Integrity):** Ensure the integrity of migration scripts stored in version control. Protect the version control system from unauthorized modifications and use branch protection.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Migration Logic Introduction](./attack_surfaces/malicious_migration_logic_introduction.md)

*   **Description:** Compromised or poorly written migration scripts, executed by Alembic, can introduce malicious or flawed logic directly into the database schema or data.
*   **Alembic Contribution:** Alembic scripts are designed to directly modify the database schema and data. This capability, while necessary for migrations, can be exploited to introduce malicious changes if scripts are compromised.
*   **Example:** A malicious migration script, when executed by Alembic, adds a database trigger that exfiltrates sensitive data to an external server whenever a specific table is updated.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, data deletion, unauthorized data modification, introduction of database backdoors (triggers, stored procedures), data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Database Schema and Logic Review:** Implement strict code reviews specifically focused on the database schema changes and data manipulation logic within Alembic migration scripts.
    *   **Automated Database Schema Validation Post-Migration:** Implement automated checks to validate the database schema after each Alembic migration to detect unexpected or malicious changes introduced by the migration scripts.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database User for Migrations):** The database user account used by Alembic for migrations should have only the minimum necessary privileges to perform schema changes and data modifications, limiting the potential scope of damage from malicious migrations.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Migrations and Database:** Conduct periodic security audits of Alembic migration scripts and the resulting database schema to proactively identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities or malicious logic.

## Attack Surface: [Alembic Configuration File Credential Exposure](./attack_surfaces/alembic_configuration_file_credential_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The `alembic.ini` configuration file, used by Alembic, can inadvertently expose sensitive database connection strings, potentially including database credentials, if not properly secured.
*   **Alembic Contribution:** Alembic relies on the `alembic.ini` file to define database connection details required for migration operations. This configuration file is a central point for managing database access for Alembic.
*   **Example:** The `alembic.ini` file, containing plaintext database username and password, is accidentally committed to a public version control repository or left accessible on a publicly accessible server.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized database access, data breach, data modification, data deletion, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Storage and Access Control for `alembic.ini`:** Store the `alembic.ini` file securely and restrict access to it to only authorized personnel and processes. Ensure it is not publicly accessible.
    *   **Externalize Credentials using Environment Variables or Secrets Management:** Avoid storing database credentials directly within the `alembic.ini` file. Utilize environment variables or secure secrets management systems (like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, etc.) to manage and inject database credentials into Alembic's configuration at runtime.
    *   **File System Permissions for `alembic.ini`:** Set restrictive file system permissions on the `alembic.ini` file to prevent unauthorized read access.
    *   **Secret Scanning to Prevent Credential Commits:** Implement automated secret scanning tools in CI/CD pipelines and development environments to detect and prevent accidental commits of credentials within `alembic.ini` or other configuration files.
