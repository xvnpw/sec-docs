# Threat Model Analysis for alembic/alembic

## Threat: [Unauthorized Migration Execution](./threats/unauthorized_migration_execution.md)

Description: An attacker gains unauthorized access to execute Alembic commands (e.g., `alembic upgrade`, `alembic downgrade`). They might leverage this access to directly manipulate the database schema, adding malicious tables, modifying existing data, or disrupting database integrity. This could be achieved by exploiting weak access controls on the server or environment where Alembic commands are run, or by compromising developer credentials.
Impact: Data corruption, data loss, application malfunction, denial of service, potential data breach if malicious data is injected or existing data is altered to expose sensitive information.
Alembic Component Affected: Alembic CLI, Alembic API (if exposed programmatically).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
* Implement strong access control lists (ACLs) on the server or environment where Alembic commands are executed.
* Restrict execution of Alembic commands to dedicated, authorized users or service accounts.
* Avoid exposing Alembic command execution interfaces directly to the internet or untrusted networks.
* Utilize separate environments (development, staging, production) with distinct access controls.
* Implement auditing of Alembic command execution to detect and respond to unauthorized activity.

## Threat: [Exposed Configuration Files](./threats/exposed_configuration_files.md)

Description: Alembic configuration files (e.g., `alembic.ini`) containing database connection strings with credentials are exposed to unauthorized individuals. An attacker could access these files through misconfigured web servers, insecure file permissions, or by gaining access to version control repositories where these files are inadvertently committed. Once credentials are obtained, they can directly access and manipulate the database bypassing application security layers.
Impact: Database compromise, data breach, unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential for complete takeover of the database and associated application.
Alembic Component Affected: `alembic.ini` configuration file, potentially environment variable loading if misconfigured.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
* Securely store Alembic configuration files with restrictive file system permissions, limiting access to only authorized users and processes.
* Never commit sensitive information like database credentials directly into version control systems.
* Utilize environment variables or secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to manage database credentials.
* Regularly audit access to Alembic configuration files and secrets management systems.
* Consider encrypting sensitive data within configuration files if absolutely necessary, though secrets management is preferred.

## Threat: [Malicious Migration Scripts](./threats/malicious_migration_scripts.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious code into Alembic migration scripts. This could happen through compromised developer accounts, supply chain attacks targeting development dependencies, or insecure development practices allowing unauthorized modification of scripts. Upon execution of these scripts via `alembic upgrade`, the malicious code (SQL or Python) is executed within the database context, potentially leading to data exfiltration, data corruption, or denial of service.
Impact: Data breach, data corruption, data loss, denial of service, complete application compromise if the database is critical infrastructure.
Alembic Component Affected: Migration scripts (Python files in `versions` directory), Alembic migration execution engine.
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
* Implement mandatory code review processes for all migration scripts before they are applied to any environment.
* Utilize version control for migration scripts and meticulously track changes, using code signing or branch protection to ensure script integrity.
* Enforce strong authentication and authorization for developers who can create and modify migration scripts, using multi-factor authentication.
* Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) and vulnerability scanning into CI/CD pipelines to automatically scan migration scripts for potential vulnerabilities or malicious code.
* Restrict write access to the migration scripts directory to only authorized personnel and processes.
* Implement a "least privilege" approach for database users used by Alembic, limiting their permissions to only what is necessary for migrations.

## Threat: [Insecure Database Connection](./threats/insecure_database_connection.md)

Description: Alembic is configured to connect to the database using insecure protocols (e.g., unencrypted connections over the internet) or weak authentication methods. An attacker performing network sniffing or man-in-the-middle attacks could intercept database credentials or data transmitted during migration processes.
Impact: Data breach, credential compromise, unauthorized database access, potential data manipulation during migration.
Alembic Component Affected: Database connection configuration within `alembic.ini` or environment variables, database connection logic within Alembic core.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
* Always use secure and encrypted database connections (e.g., TLS/SSL) for all database interactions, including Alembic migrations.
* Enforce strong database authentication mechanisms (e.g., strong passwords, certificate-based authentication).
* Ensure that database servers are properly secured and hardened, following security best practices.
* Regularly review Alembic's database connection configuration to ensure adherence to security best practices and compliance requirements.
* If connecting over a public network, use a VPN or other secure tunnel to protect the connection.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in Alembic or Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_vulnerabilities_in_alembic_or_dependencies.md)

Description: Alembic itself or its dependencies (e.g., SQLAlchemy, Python packages) contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or database during migration processes. This could occur if outdated versions are used, or if a vulnerability is introduced in a new version before patches are applied.
Impact: Application compromise, database compromise, data breach, denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
Alembic Component Affected: Alembic core codebase, dependencies (SQLAlchemy, etc.), package management system (pip, etc.).
Risk Severity: Critical (Potential, depending on vulnerability)
Mitigation Strategies:
* Keep Alembic and all its dependencies up to date with the latest security patches and stable versions.
* Regularly scan Alembic and its dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools and vulnerability scanners integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
* Subscribe to security advisories for Alembic, SQLAlchemy, and Python package ecosystem to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities and promptly apply patches.
* Utilize dependency management tools (e.g., `pip-audit`, `safety`) to track and manage dependencies securely and identify vulnerable packages.
* Implement a process for promptly patching vulnerabilities in dependencies when they are discovered.
