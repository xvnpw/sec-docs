## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (gflags Parsing) [CRITICAL NODE: Input Handling Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities__gflags_parsing___critical_node_input_handling_vulnerabili_a1d8da64.md)

*   **1.1. Command Injection via Flag Value [CRITICAL NODE: Command Injection]**
    *   **1.1.1. Application directly executes shell commands with flag values [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious flag value that, when processed by the application, is directly used in a system command execution (e.g., using `system()`, `exec()`, or similar functions). The attacker injects shell commands within the flag value to be executed by the system.
        *   **Example:** If a flag `--command` is used and the application executes `system("process_data " + FLAGS_command);`, an attacker could set `--command="; rm -rf / ;"` to execute `rm -rf /` after the intended command.
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Full system compromise, data loss, denial of service, and complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Strong Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all flag values before using them in system commands.
            *   **Parameterized Commands:** Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell execution that prevent command injection.
            *   **Avoid Shell Execution:** If possible, avoid executing shell commands directly from the application. Use libraries or APIs that provide the necessary functionality without invoking the shell.

*   **1.2. Path Traversal via Flag Value [CRITICAL NODE: Path Traversal]**
    *   **1.2.1. Application uses flag value to construct file paths without proper validation [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a flag value that is used to construct a file path within the application. By using path traversal sequences like `../` or `../../`, the attacker can manipulate the file path to access files or directories outside the intended scope, potentially gaining access to sensitive files or overwriting critical system files.
        *   **Example:** If a flag `--config_file` is used to load configuration and the application uses `fopen(FLAGS_config_file, "r")`, an attacker could set `--config_file="../../../etc/passwd"` to attempt to read the system password file.
        *   **Impact:** High. Information disclosure (reading sensitive files), potential for arbitrary file write (if write operations are involved), and possible application compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize file paths derived from flag values.
            *   **Allow-lists:** Use allow-lists to restrict file access to permitted directories.
            *   **Canonicalization:** Canonicalize file paths to resolve symbolic links and relative paths, preventing traversal outside the intended directory.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal file system permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Flag Logic and Application Misuse](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_flag_logic_and_application_misuse.md)

*   **2.3. Overwriting Critical Application Settings via Flags [CRITICAL NODE: Overwriting Critical Settings]**
    *   **2.3.1. Flags allow modification of sensitive application configurations at runtime [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application design allows command-line flags to modify critical application settings at runtime, such as database connection strings, API endpoints, or security parameters. An attacker could manipulate these flags to redirect the application to malicious servers, gain unauthorized access to backend systems, or disrupt operations.
        *   **Example:** A flag `--database_host` might allow changing the database server address. An attacker could set `--database_host=malicious.attacker.com` to redirect the application to a rogue database server.
        *   **Impact:** High to Critical. Configuration compromise, data breach, redirection to malicious resources, and potential for complete application takeover.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Restrict Flag Access to Sensitive Settings:** Avoid using flags to control highly sensitive application settings in production.
            *   **Separate Configuration Mechanisms:** Use dedicated and secure configuration mechanisms (e.g., configuration files with restricted access, environment variables, secret management systems) for critical parameters.
            *   **Access Control:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict who can modify critical settings, even through flags (if absolutely necessary).

*   **2.4. Bypassing Security Checks via Flag Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE: Security Bypass via Flags]**
    *   **2.4.1. Flags can disable or weaken security features (e.g., authentication, authorization) [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application uses command-line flags to control or disable security features like authentication, authorization, or input validation. These flags might be intended for debugging or testing but are inadvertently left enabled or accessible in production. An attacker could exploit these flags to bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access or perform privileged actions.
        *   **Example:** A flag `--disable_auth` might disable authentication checks. If this flag is accidentally enabled in production or can be set by an attacker, they can bypass authentication.
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Complete security bypass, unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, and potential for full application compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Avoid Flags for Security Controls:** Do not use command-line flags to control critical security features in production.
            *   **Strict Control of Debug/Test Flags:** If flags are used for debugging or testing security features, ensure they are strictly controlled, disabled by default, and removed or securely disabled in release builds.
            *   **Principle of Secure Defaults:** Security features should be enabled by default and require explicit and secure configuration to disable (if ever necessary).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Information Disclosure via Flag Handling [CRITICAL NODE: Information Disclosure]](./attack_tree_paths/3__information_disclosure_via_flag_handling__critical_node_information_disclosure_.md)

*   **3.1. Exposing Sensitive Data in Flag Values [CRITICAL NODE: Secrets in Flags]**
    *   **3.1.1. Passwords, API keys, or other secrets are passed as command-line flags [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Developers mistakenly pass sensitive information like passwords, API keys, database credentials, or other secrets directly as command-line flags. These flags are then visible in process listings, command history, and potentially in logs or monitoring systems, making them easily accessible to attackers.
        *   **Example:** Running an application with `--db_password=MySecretPassword` exposes the password in the process list.
        *   **Impact:** Critical. Data breach, exposure of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to backend systems, and potential for widespread compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Never Pass Secrets as Flags:** Absolutely avoid passing sensitive information directly as command-line flags.
            *   **Secure Secret Management:** Use secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
            *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables to pass configuration parameters, including secrets, and ensure proper access control to the environment.
            *   **Configuration Files:** Use configuration files with restricted access permissions to store sensitive information.
