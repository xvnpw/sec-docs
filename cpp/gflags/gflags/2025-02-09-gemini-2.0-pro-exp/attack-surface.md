# Attack Surface Analysis for gflags/gflags

## Attack Surface: [Flag Value Injection (Command-Line)](./attack_surfaces/flag_value_injection__command-line_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious or unexpected values into flags via the command line, altering application behavior.
*   **gflags Contribution:** `gflags` is the *direct mechanism* for parsing command-line arguments and setting flag values.  The vulnerability exists because `gflags` processes the attacker-controlled input.
*   **Example:** An application takes a user-provided filename and constructs a command like `./my_app --input-file=<user_input>`. An attacker provides `"; rm -rf /; #"` as the input. `gflags` will parse this, and if the application doesn't sanitize, command injection occurs.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data modification, denial of service, privilege escalation (depending on the application's logic).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application's logic and privileges).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Lines:** If possible, avoid constructing command-line arguments dynamically from untrusted input. This is the most effective mitigation.
    *   **Safe Argument Construction:** If dynamic construction is *unavoidable*, use a well-vetted library specifically designed for safe command-line argument construction.  This library should properly escape special characters and prevent injection.  *Do not* attempt to manually escape input.
    *   **Input Validation (Pre-Parsing):** Before passing *anything* to `gflags`, rigorously validate the input.  Use whitelisting (allowing only known-good values) whenever possible.  For example, if a flag expects a filename, validate that it conforms to expected filename patterns and doesn't contain dangerous characters.

## Attack Surface: [Flag Value Injection (Environment Variables)](./attack_surfaces/flag_value_injection__environment_variables_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate environment variables to inject malicious or unexpected flag values.
*   **gflags Contribution:** `gflags` *directly* reads flag values from environment variables, providing an alternative injection vector that bypasses command-line restrictions.
*   **Example:** An attacker sets the environment variable `MYAPP_ADMIN_MODE=true` to enable a hidden administrative mode that bypasses security checks. `gflags` reads this value and sets the corresponding flag.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data modification, denial of service, privilege escalation (depending on the application and the attacker's control over the environment).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application and the attacker's ability to modify the environment).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  This significantly reduces the impact of successful environment variable manipulation.  Avoid running as root/administrator.
    *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Run the application in a sandboxed or containerized environment.  This isolates the application and limits the attacker's ability to control the environment, including environment variables.
    *   **Input Validation (Post-Parsing):** *Crucially*, even after `gflags` parses environment variables, perform thorough validation of the resulting flag values *within the application code*.  Do *not* assume that values read from the environment are safe.  Check data types, ranges, and allowed values.
