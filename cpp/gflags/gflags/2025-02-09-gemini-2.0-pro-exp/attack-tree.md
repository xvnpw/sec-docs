## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Control/Access [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_controlaccess__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker. This encompasses gaining the ability to modify the application's behavior in unintended ways or accessing data that should be protected.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the root of the attack tree and represents the attacker's final goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit gflags Configuration [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_gflags_configuration__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch focuses on manipulating the *values* of flags defined using the `gflags` library. This is achieved by altering the configuration sources that `gflags` uses.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the primary and most direct method for an attacker to control the application's behavior through `gflags`. It's the gateway to most high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Modify Config Files at Runtime [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__modify_config_files_at_runtime__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** `gflags` can read configuration settings from files. If an attacker can modify these files, they can directly change the values of flags, influencing the application's behavior.
*   **Why Critical:** This is a direct and often easily exploitable path to controlling flag values.

## Attack Tree Path: [1a. File Permissions [CN][HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1a__file_permissions__cn__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** If the configuration file has overly permissive write permissions (e.g., world-writable), any user on the system, or a process running with lower privileges, can modify the file and change the flag values.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This is a very common vulnerability due to misconfigured systems or deployments. It's often easy to exploit and provides direct control over flag values.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1b. Symlink Attack [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1b__symlink_attack__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application opens the configuration file in a predictable location, an attacker might replace the legitimate configuration file with a symbolic link (symlink) pointing to a file controlled by the attacker. When the application reads the configuration, it will unknowingly read the attacker's file.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This allows the attacker to completely control the configuration file's contents, leading to full control over flag values.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1c. Race Condition [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1c__race_condition__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application reads the configuration file multiple times or reloads it periodically, there might be a race condition. An attacker could attempt to modify the file *between* these reads. If the attacker wins the race, they can inject their modified configuration.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Although less likely than other file-based attacks, a successful race condition attack can give the attacker full control over flag values.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Environment Variable Manipulation [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2__environment_variable_manipulation__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** `gflags` can also read flag values from environment variables.  An attacker who can control the environment variables seen by the application can influence flag values.
*   **Why Critical:** This is another direct method for controlling flag values, often overlooked.

## Attack Tree Path: [2a. Set Environment Variable [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/2a__set_environment_variable__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sets an environment variable that corresponds to a `gflags` flag, overriding any value set in a configuration file or on the command line.
*   **Why Critical:** This is a direct way to set flag values. The feasibility depends on how the attacker can influence the environment (e.g., compromised parent process, shell access).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2c. Shell Escape [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2c__shell_escape__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses environment variables in an unsafe way (e.g., directly embedding them in a shell command without proper escaping), an attacker might be able to inject malicious commands through carefully crafted environment variable values. This is a form of command injection.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This can lead to arbitrary code execution, giving the attacker complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Command-Line Injection [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3__command-line_injection__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** `gflags` is primarily designed to parse command-line arguments. If the application constructs command-line arguments based on user input without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker can inject their own flags or modify existing ones.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the most direct and intended way to interact with `gflags`, making it a prime target for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [3a. Argument Injection [CN][HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3a__argument_injection__cn__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides input that is directly incorporated into the command-line arguments passed to `gflags`. This allows them to specify arbitrary flags and their values.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This is a very common vulnerability in web applications and other systems that accept user input. It provides direct control over flag values.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3b. Argument Manipulation [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3b__argument_manipulation__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Even without full injection, the attacker might be able to manipulate existing arguments in a way that changes their meaning or how `gflags` parses them. This could involve adding extra spaces, quotes, or other special characters.
*   **Why High-Risk:** While less powerful than full injection, this can still allow the attacker to influence flag values and potentially bypass intended restrictions.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium to High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
