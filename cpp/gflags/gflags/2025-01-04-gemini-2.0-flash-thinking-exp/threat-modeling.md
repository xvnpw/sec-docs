# Threat Model Analysis for gflags/gflags

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Input Leading to Unexpected Behavior](./threats/uncontrolled_input_leading_to_unexpected_behavior.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malicious or unexpected input through command-line arguments or environment variables that are parsed by `gflags`. The application, without proper validation, uses these parsed values, leading to unintended consequences. For example, an attacker might provide a very large number for an integer flag, causing an overflow later in the application logic.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application crashes, incorrect data processing, potential for exploitation if the unchecked value is used in a security-sensitive context.

**Affected Component:** Parsing, Flag Value Access

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement strict input validation on all flag values *after* they are parsed by `gflags`.
* Check the type, range, and format of flag values before using them in application logic.
* Use appropriate data types for flags to minimize the risk of overflows.
* Consider using allow-lists for expected input values where feasible.

## Threat: [Symbolic Link Vulnerabilities in Configuration Files (If Used)](./threats/symbolic_link_vulnerabilities_in_configuration_files__if_used_.md)

**Description:** If `gflags` is used to load configuration from files, and these files are processed without proper sanitization, an attacker might be able to use symbolic links to trick the application into reading or writing to unintended locations.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, arbitrary file read/write, potential for privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Configuration File Loading (if applicable)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Avoid using `gflags` to directly load configuration files from untrusted sources.
* If file loading is necessary, implement checks to prevent traversal outside of expected directories.
* Sanitize file paths before using them to access files.
