## Attack Tree Path: [Overflow Flag Buffer](./attack_tree_paths/overflow_flag_buffer.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies a string-based command-line flag within the application that uses the `gflags` library. This flag has insufficient bounds checking or buffer size allocation during the parsing process. The attacker crafts an excessively long string value for this flag and provides it as a command-line argument.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify a vulnerable string flag with an insufficient size limit.
    *   Provide an excessively long string value for the flag.
    *   Trigger a buffer overflow during flag parsing.
*   **Potential Impact:** This buffer overflow can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially corrupting program data or control flow. In successful scenarios, this can lead to arbitrary code execution, granting the attacker full control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Characters in Flag Value (Command Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_characters_in_flag_value__command_injection_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses a command-line flag's value directly or indirectly in a system call or command execution without proper sanitization. An attacker identifies such a flag and injects shell metacharacters (like `;`, `|`, `&`, `$()`) into the flag's value.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify flags used in system calls or command execution.
    *   Inject shell metacharacters into the flag value.
    *   The application executes unintended commands due to the unsanitized flag input.
*   **Potential Impact:** Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the application. This can lead to data exfiltration, system compromise, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Critical Configuration Flags](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_critical_configuration_flags.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses command-line flags to configure critical security features, such as authentication mechanisms, authorization rules, or encryption settings. An attacker identifies these flags and provides values that weaken or disable these security measures.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify flags that control security features.
    *   Provide values for these flags that weaken or disable security measures.
    *   Bypass security controls and gain unauthorized access or privileges.
*   **Potential Impact:** By manipulating these flags, an attacker can bypass authentication, gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, or disable security features, making the application vulnerable to further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Resource Exhaustion via Flag Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_resource_exhaustion_via_flag_manipulation.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses command-line flags to control the allocation of system resources, such as memory, threads, or file handles. An attacker identifies these flags and provides values that cause the application to allocate an excessive amount of these resources.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify flags that control resource allocation.
    *   Provide flag values that cause the application to allocate excessive resources.
    *   Lead to denial of service (DoS) by exhausting system resources.
*   **Potential Impact:** By manipulating resource allocation flags, an attacker can cause the application to consume all available resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition where the application becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting its availability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Improper Flag Sanitization During Use](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_improper_flag_sanitization_during_use.md)

**Attack Vector:**  While `gflags` handles the initial parsing, the application code might use the parsed flag values in a way that introduces secondary vulnerabilities due to a lack of sanitization. For example, a flag value might be directly used in a SQL query (leading to SQL injection) or as part of a file path (leading to path traversal).
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify locations in the code where flag values are used without proper sanitization.
    *   Provide malicious values that exploit these unsanitized usages (e.g., SQL injection payloads, path traversal sequences).
    *   Compromise the application through the secondary vulnerability exposed by the unsanitized flag value.
*   **Potential Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the secondary vulnerability. SQL injection can lead to data breaches or unauthorized data manipulation. Path traversal can allow access to sensitive files outside the intended scope.
