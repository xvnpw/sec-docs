## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via String Flags](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_string_flags.md)

* Goal: Execute arbitrary commands on the server.
* Attack: An attacker provides a malicious string as the value for a flag. This flag's value is then used by the application in a system command execution without proper sanitization. The malicious string contains shell commands that the server executes.
* Example: The application uses a flag `--backup_dir` and executes `tar cf /tmp/backup.tar $FLAGS_backup_dir`. An attacker could set `--backup_dir="; rm -rf / ;"` leading to command execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via String Flags](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_string_flags.md)

* Goal: Access arbitrary files on the server.
* Attack: An attacker provides a malicious string as the value for a flag that represents a file path. The application uses this unsanitized path to access files. The malicious string contains ".." sequences to navigate to directories outside the intended scope.
* Example: The application uses a flag `--log_file` and opens the file specified by the flag. An attacker could set `--log_file="../../../../../etc/passwd"` to access the password file.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via String Flags](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_string_flags.md)

* Goal: Execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
* Attack: An attacker provides a malicious string as the value for a flag. This flag's value is then incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries. The malicious string contains SQL code that modifies the query's intent.
* Example: The application uses a flag `--user_filter` and constructs a query like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '$FLAGS_user_filter'`. An attacker could set `--user_filter="%' OR '1'='1"` to bypass the filter and retrieve all users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Flag Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_flag_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* Significance: Successful exploitation at this node allows attackers to manipulate how the application interprets command-line arguments, potentially leading to the injection of malicious values.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Supplying malformed flag arguments that the application's parsing logic doesn't handle correctly, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior that can be further exploited.
    * Exploiting flag collision or override vulnerabilities where providing specific combinations or orderings of flags can lead to intended values being overwritten with malicious ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Values Through Flag Arguments](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_values_through_flag_arguments.md)

* Significance: This node represents the point where the attacker successfully injects malicious data into the application via command-line flags. This is a direct precursor to the high-impact attacks.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Providing malicious strings for string-based flags that are later used in unsafe operations like command execution, file path manipulation, or SQL query construction. The specific attack vector depends on how the application uses the flag's value.
