## High and Critical gflags Threats

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the `gflags` library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | gflags Component Affected | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Flag Overrides via Command Line** | An attacker provides unexpected or malicious values for flags via the command line when launching the application. This directly leverages `gflags`' command-line parsing to override intended defaults or configurations. | - Application misconfiguration leading to unexpected behavior. - Security bypasses (e.g., disabling security features). - Data corruption or loss. | `gflags::ParseCommandLineFlags()` | High | - **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust validation for all flag values *after* parsing, including type checking, range checks, and allowed value lists. Do not rely solely on `gflags`' built-in type checking. - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the application so that even with malicious flag values, the damage is limited. Avoid using flags to directly control critical security functions without further validation. - **Immutable Defaults:** For critical flags, consider making them immutable after initialization or providing a mechanism to detect and reject changes after a secure initial setup. |
