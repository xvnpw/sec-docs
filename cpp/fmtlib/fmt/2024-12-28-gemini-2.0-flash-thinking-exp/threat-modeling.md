*   **Threat:** Format String Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious string as the format string argument to a `fmt` function (e.g., `fmt::format`). This allows the attacker to leverage format specifiers (like `%s`, `%n`, `%p`) to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations within the application's process. They might read sensitive data, overwrite critical data structures, or even inject and execute code.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive data from memory), denial of service (crashing the application by writing to invalid memory), potentially arbitrary code execution (overwriting function pointers or return addresses).
    *   **Affected Component:** `fmt::format` function and other formatting functions that take a format string as an argument. Specifically, the format string parsing logic within these functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never use user-controlled input directly as a format string.** Always use static, predefined format strings.
        *   Pass user-provided data as arguments to the format string, not as part of the format string itself.
        *   Utilize `fmt`'s compile-time format string checks where possible to catch potential issues early.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Long Format Strings
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides an extremely long format string to a `fmt` function. The library might allocate excessive memory to process this string, leading to memory exhaustion and potentially crashing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash due to memory exhaustion).
    *   **Affected Component:** Format string parsing logic within `fmt::format` and related functions. Memory allocation routines used by the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input validation to limit the maximum length of format strings accepted by the application.
        *   Consider setting timeouts or resource limits for formatting operations if feasible.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion via Excessive Precision/Width Specifiers
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a format string with extremely large precision or width specifiers (e.g., `%.1000000f`). This could cause `fmt` to allocate significant memory or perform computationally expensive operations to format the output, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application slowdown or crash due to excessive resource consumption).
    *   **Affected Component:** Formatting logic within `fmt` that handles precision and width specifiers, particularly for floating-point numbers and strings.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input validation to limit the maximum values allowed for precision and width specifiers in format strings.
        *   Consider setting limits on the complexity of formatting operations.
