# Threat Model Analysis for fmtlib/fmt

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability](./threats/format_string_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that is directly used as the format string argument in `fmt::format` or similar functions. The attacker can inject format specifiers like `%s`, `%x`, or `%n` to read arbitrary memory locations, potentially leak sensitive data, cause crashes, or even overwrite memory.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive data), denial of service (application crash), potential for arbitrary code execution (though less likely with modern protections).
*   **Affected fmt Component:** `fmt::format` function, format string parsing logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never use user-controlled input directly as the format string.**
    *   Always use predefined format strings and pass user-provided data as arguments.
    *   Employ static analysis tools to detect potential format string vulnerabilities.
    *   Conduct thorough code reviews to identify instances where user input might be used as a format string.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Format Strings](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_format_strings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a format string with an extremely large number of format specifiers, deeply nested formatting, or excessively long literal strings. This can cause the `fmt` library to consume excessive CPU and memory resources during processing, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unresponsive or crashing it due to resource exhaustion.
*   **Affected fmt Component:** Format string parsing logic, memory allocation within `fmt`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input validation and limits on the size and complexity of format strings.
    *   Set timeouts for formatting operations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
    *   Monitor resource usage of the application and identify potential spikes caused by malformed format strings.
