# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Improve code readability and maintainability in C++ projects by providing a modern and safe formatting library.
 - Enhance developer productivity by offering a user-friendly and efficient formatting tool.
 - Reduce potential errors and vulnerabilities associated with traditional C-style formatting functions like `printf`.
 - Offer a performant alternative to standard library formatting functions.

- Business Risks:
 - Dependency risk: Projects adopting fmtlib become dependent on its continued maintenance and security. Vulnerabilities in fmtlib could impact dependent projects.
 - Integration risk: Compatibility issues with different C++ compilers, standard library versions, or build systems might arise.
 - Adoption risk: Developers might be hesitant to adopt a new library if they are already comfortable with existing formatting methods.
 - Performance risk: Although fmtlib is designed to be performant, there is a potential risk of unexpected performance overhead in specific use cases compared to simpler formatting methods.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's infrastructure security. (Implemented: GitHub platform)
 - security control: Publicly accessible repository, allowing for community review and contributions. (Implemented: GitHub repository access control)
 - security control: Issue tracking system on GitHub for reporting and addressing bugs and potential security vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub Issues)
 - security control: Build and testing infrastructure using GitHub Actions for continuous integration. (Implemented: GitHub Actions workflows - visible in repository)
 - security control: Open Source license (MIT License) promoting transparency and community scrutiny. (Implemented: LICENSE file in repository)

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk:  Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
 - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the library code.
 - accepted risk: Risk of supply chain attacks targeting the GitHub repository or build pipeline, although mitigated by GitHub's security measures.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used during fmtlib's development or testing.
 - security control: Integrate static analysis security testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically identify potential security flaws in the code.
 - security control: Consider performing regular security audits or penetration testing, especially before major releases, to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to guide users on how to report security issues and define the process for handling and resolving them.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a formatting library itself. Authentication is relevant for systems that *use* fmtlib, but not fmtlib itself.
 - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a formatting library itself. Authorization is relevant for systems that *use* fmtlib, but not fmtlib itself.
 - Input Validation: While fmtlib is designed to be safer than `printf`, input validation is still relevant for users of fmtlib. Users should ensure that format strings and arguments passed to fmtlib functions are properly constructed to avoid unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities in their applications. fmtlib itself implements checks to prevent format string vulnerabilities, which is a security control.
 - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to a formatting library itself. Cryptography is relevant for applications that *use* fmtlib if they need to format sensitive data, but fmtlib itself does not handle encryption or decryption.

    style fmtlib_lib fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

- Container Diagram Elements:
 - - Name: fmtlib Library
   - Type: Container
   - Description: A single C++ library container that provides all the formatting functionalities of fmtlib. It's distributed as header files and compiled library files.
   - Responsibilities: Encapsulates all the code for string formatting, including parsing format strings, handling arguments, and producing formatted output.
   - Security controls: Input validation within the library to prevent format string vulnerabilities. Memory safety practices in C++ code to avoid buffer overflows and other memory-related issues. Security testing (SAST, fuzzing) should be applied to this container.

## DEPLOYMENT

- Deployment Model:
 fmtlib itself is a library and is not deployed as a standalone service or application. It is integrated into and deployed as part of C++ applications. The deployment of fmtlib is therefore dependent on how the applications that use it are deployed.

- Example Deployment Scenario (for an application using fmtlib):
  Let's consider a simple C++ command-line application that uses fmtlib and is deployed to a Linux server.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph "Deployment Environment: Linux Server"
      subgraph "Server Instance"
        app_instance("Application Instance")
        os_linux("Operating System: Linux")
        hardware_server("Server Hardware")
      end
    end

    cpp_application("C++ Application (includes fmtlib)") -- "Runs on" --> app_instance
    app_instance -- "Runs on" --> os_linux
    os_linux -- "Runs on" --> hardware_server

    style app_instance fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style os_linux fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style hardware_server fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Software development using C++ where string formatting is required.
 - Maintaining code quality and developer productivity in C++ projects.
 - Ensuring the reliability and security of C++ applications that depend on string formatting.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Source code of fmtlib: Sensitivity - Medium (Open Source, but intellectual property and maintainability).
 - Build artifacts (header files, library files): Sensitivity - Medium (Integrity and availability are important for users).
 - No sensitive user data is directly processed or stored by fmtlib itself. However, applications using fmtlib might handle sensitive data, and the security of fmtlib as a dependency is important for those applications.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What are the primary target platforms and compilers for fmtlib? (Assumption: Broad range of modern C++ compilers and operating systems).
 - Are there specific performance benchmarks or security certifications that fmtlib aims to achieve? (Assumption: Focus on general performance and security best practices for a C++ library).

 - Are there any specific industries or use cases that fmtlib is particularly targeted towards? (Assumption: General-purpose C++ formatting library applicable to a wide range of domains).

- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a high-quality, modern, and safe C++ formatting library for general use in C++ development.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Standard open-source development security practices are followed. The project benefits from the transparency and community scrutiny of open source. Security is a consideration but not the primary differentiating feature compared to functionality and performance.
 - DESIGN: fmtlib is designed as a standalone C++ library. Deployment is handled by applications that integrate fmtlib. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions and standard C++ build tools.
