# Threat Model Analysis for fmtlib/fmt

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability in `fmt`](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_in__fmt_.md)

Description: A publicly known security vulnerability is discovered in the `fmt` library itself. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses a vulnerable version of `fmt`. Depending on the nature of the vulnerability, exploitation could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution. For example, a buffer overflow or memory corruption vulnerability within `fmt` could be exploited by sending crafted input that triggers the vulnerability during formatting.
Impact:  Potentially Critical. Could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing full system compromise, or Denial of Service (DoS), rendering the application unavailable. Information Disclosure is also possible depending on the vulnerability.
Affected fmt component: Any component within the `fmt` library depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., parsing logic, formatting engine, memory management).
Risk Severity: Critical (If RCE is possible) or High (If DoS or significant information disclosure is possible).
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Maintain a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies, including the version of `fmt`.
    * Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, GitHub Security Advisories for `fmtlib/fmt`) for reported vulnerabilities.
    * Implement a robust patch management process to promptly update the `fmt` library to patched versions as soon as vulnerabilities are disclosed and fixes are available.
    * Utilize dependency scanning tools in CI/CD pipelines to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies like `fmt` before deployment.
