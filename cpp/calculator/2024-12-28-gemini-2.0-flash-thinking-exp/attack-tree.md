Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application:** The ultimate goal of the attacker. Mitigation efforts should aim to prevent any path from reaching this objective.
* **Exploit Input Handling of Calculator:** A common entry point for attacks. Vulnerabilities here can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization. Set timeouts for calculator operations.
* **Malicious Input Leading to Unexpected Behavior:** A critical step in exploiting input vulnerabilities.
    * **Mitigation:**  Strict input validation, consider sandboxing the calculator process.
* **Output Injection Leading to Application Compromise:** Directly leads to the highest impact scenario (code execution).
    * **Mitigation:** Treat calculator output as untrusted data. Never directly execute or interpret it as code. Implement strict output sanitization.
* **Calculator Resource Exhaustion Starving Application Resources:** A key step in denial-of-service attacks.
    * **Mitigation:** Implement resource limits for calculator operations. Monitor calculator process resource usage. Implement rate limiting.
* **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Exploitation (If Applicable):**  A critical entry point for potentially high-impact attacks if IPC is used.
    * **Mitigation:** Secure the IPC channel with authentication and encryption. Validate all data received through IPC.

**High-Risk Paths:**

1. **Exploit Input Handling leading to Resource Exhaustion:**
   - **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a large number of complex or resource-intensive calculations to the calculator.
   - **Likelihood:** Medium
   - **Impact:** Medium (Application slowdown or temporary unavailability)
   - **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on requests sent to the calculator. Monitor calculator resource usage. Set limits on the complexity of calculations allowed.

2. **Output Injection Leading to Application Compromise:**
   - **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts input that manipulates the calculator's output to include malicious code or commands, which the application then unknowingly executes.
   - **Likelihood:** Very Low
   - **Impact:** High (Full application compromise, potential system compromise)
   - **Mitigation:** Treat all calculator output as untrusted. Never directly execute or interpret calculator output as code. Implement strict output sanitization and validation. Consider using a separate, isolated process for the calculator.

3. **Exploit Resource Consumption Affecting Application (DoS):**
   - **Attack Vector (CPU Exhaustion):** An attacker repeatedly sends computationally intensive calculations to the calculator, consuming excessive CPU resources and starving the application.
   - **Attack Vector (Calculator Crash):** An attacker sends specific input designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the calculator, causing it to crash or hang, leading to a denial of service for the application.
   - **Likelihood:** Medium
   - **Impact:** Medium (Application functionality dependent on the calculator is unavailable)
   - **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on requests. Set timeouts for calculator operations. Implement robust error handling and retry mechanisms. Consider input validation to prevent inputs known to cause crashes.

4. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Exploitation (If Applicable):**
   - **Attack Vector:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates communication between the application and the calculator through the IPC channel. This could involve eavesdropping on sensitive data, injecting malicious commands, or impersonating either the application or the calculator.
   - **Likelihood:** Low
   - **Impact:** High (Potential for data manipulation, eavesdropping, or impersonation leading to unauthorized actions)
   - **Mitigation:** Secure the IPC channel using strong authentication and encryption. Validate all messages received through IPC. Implement mutual authentication to ensure both parties are legitimate. Run the calculator process with minimal necessary privileges.
