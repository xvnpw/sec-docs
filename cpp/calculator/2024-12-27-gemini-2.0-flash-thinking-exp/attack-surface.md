*   **Attack Surface:** Expression Injection / Malicious Input
    *   **Description:** The calculator accepts mathematical expressions as input. If not properly sanitized or validated, malicious actors can inject unexpected characters, commands, or overly complex expressions *directly into the calculator's input field*.
    *   **How Calculator Contributes:** The core functionality of a calculator is to evaluate user-provided expressions, making it inherently vulnerable to issues arising from how these expressions are processed *by the calculator's internal logic*.
    *   **Example:**  A user inputs an extremely long string of nested parentheses or a mathematical expression designed to consume excessive processing power (e.g., repeated exponentiation) *that the calculator attempts to evaluate*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Overloading the calculator with complex input can lead to resource exhaustion (CPU, memory), causing *the calculator itself* to become unresponsive or crash.
        *   **Unexpected Behavior/Errors:**  Malicious input can trigger unexpected errors or incorrect calculations *within the calculator*, potentially disrupting the application integrating the calculator.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization *specifically for the calculator's input*. Limit the length and complexity of allowed expressions *that the calculator will process*. Use a secure expression parser that can handle potentially malicious input gracefully *within the calculator's evaluation engine*. Implement timeouts for calculation execution to prevent resource exhaustion *during the calculator's processing*.

*   **Attack Surface:** Integer Overflow/Underflow
    *   **Description:**  Performing calculations with extremely large or small numbers *within the calculator's arithmetic operations* can lead to integer overflow or underflow, where the result exceeds the maximum or minimum value that can be represented by the data type used.
    *   **How Calculator Contributes:** The calculator performs arithmetic operations, making it susceptible to these numerical limitations *in its internal calculations* if not handled correctly.
    *   **Example:**  Calculating the factorial of a very large number or raising a large number to a high power *using the calculator's functions*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Incorrect Results:**  Overflow or underflow can lead to inaccurate calculation results *produced by the calculator*, which can have significant consequences in applications relying on the calculator's output.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Use data types *within the calculator's implementation* that can handle a wider range of values (e.g., arbitrary-precision arithmetic libraries). Implement checks for potential overflow/underflow conditions before performing calculations *within the calculator's logic*. Provide clear error messages or handle these conditions gracefully *within the calculator's output or error handling mechanisms*.
