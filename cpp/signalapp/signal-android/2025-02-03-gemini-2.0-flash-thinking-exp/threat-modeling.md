# Threat Model Analysis for signalapp/signal-android

## Threat: [Code Vulnerability in Signal Protocol Implementation (Memory Corruption)](./threats/code_vulnerability_in_signal_protocol_implementation__memory_corruption_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a memory corruption vulnerability (e.g., buffer overflow) in the Java/Kotlin Signal Protocol implementation within `signal-android`. They could craft a malicious message or interaction that triggers the vulnerability. Upon successful exploitation, the attacker can potentially achieve arbitrary code execution on the user's device.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution, complete compromise of user device, loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
*   **Affected Component:** `signal-android` library - Java/Kotlin Signal Protocol implementation (e.g., message processing modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Signal-Android Developers:** Rigorous code reviews, fuzzing, static analysis, and memory safety testing of the `signal-android` library. Promptly patch any identified vulnerabilities and release updates.
    *   **Application Developers:**  Keep `signal-android` library updated to the latest version. Implement robust input validation and error handling when interacting with the library.

## Threat: [Native Library Vulnerability (Buffer Overflow in `libsignal-client`)](./threats/native_library_vulnerability__buffer_overflow_in__libsignal-client__.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the native C++ `libsignal-client` library used by `signal-android`. This could be triggered by sending a specially crafted message or media file. Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the native context.
*   **Impact:** Critical - Remote Code Execution, potentially bypassing Android security sandboxes, complete compromise of user device, loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.
*   **Affected Component:** `signal-android` library - `libsignal-client` native library (e.g., cryptographic functions, media processing).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Signal-Android Developers:**  Rigorous security audits of `libsignal-client` code, memory safety testing, and use of memory-safe coding practices in C++. Promptly patch and update `libsignal-client`.
    *   **Application Developers:**  Ensure `signal-android` library is updated to the latest version, which includes updated `libsignal-client`.

## Threat: [Media Handling Vulnerability (Image Decoder Exploit)](./threats/media_handling_vulnerability__image_decoder_exploit_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG) containing an exploit for a vulnerability in the image decoding libraries used by `signal-android`. When the application processes this image (e.g., upon receiving it as a message attachment), the vulnerability is triggered, potentially leading to remote code execution or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** High - Remote Code Execution or Denial of Service, potential compromise of user device or application unavailability.
*   **Affected Component:** `signal-android` library - Media handling modules, image decoding libraries.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Signal-Android Developers:** Use secure and up-to-date media decoding libraries. Implement sandboxing or isolation for media processing. Validate and sanitize media files before processing.
    *   **Application Developers:** Keep `signal-android` updated.  Consider additional media validation or sanitization steps within the application if feasible.

## Threat: [Insecure Key Storage by Application (Plaintext Storage)](./threats/insecure_key_storage_by_application__plaintext_storage_.md)

*   **Description:** Application developers incorrectly store cryptographic keys managed by `signal-android` in plaintext (e.g., in shared preferences or application files without encryption). An attacker who gains access to the device (e.g., through malware or physical access) can easily retrieve these keys.
*   **Impact:** High - Key Compromise, attacker can decrypt past and future messages, impersonate the user, and forge messages. Loss of confidentiality and integrity.
*   **Affected Component:** Application code - Key storage implementation (misusing `signal-android` key management).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Application Developers:**  **Never store keys in plaintext.** Utilize secure key storage mechanisms provided by the Android platform (e.g., Android Keystore System, Encrypted Shared Preferences). Follow best practices for key management and secure storage.  Consult `signal-android` documentation for recommended key storage approaches.
