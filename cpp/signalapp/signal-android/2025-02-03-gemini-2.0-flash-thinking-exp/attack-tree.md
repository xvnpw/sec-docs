            *   Medium to High Likelihood: Developers often make mistakes in secure data storage, especially if they are not fully aware of Signal-Android's secure storage options or best practices.
            *   High Impact: Exposure of sensitive data like keys or tokens can lead to complete compromise of the application's security and user data, potentially bypassing Signal-Android's security features.
            *   Low Effort: Static code analysis and simple checks can easily identify insecure storage locations.
            *   Beginner Skill Level: Basic code review skills are sufficient.

    *   **2.2.2. Improper Data Sanitization Before/After Signal-Android Processing [HIGH RISK NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploit vulnerabilities due to lack of proper sanitization or validation of data before being passed to Signal-Android APIs or after being received from them.
        *   **Why High Risk:**
            *   Medium to High Likelihood: Input validation and sanitization are frequently overlooked in development, leading to common vulnerabilities.
            *   Medium to High Impact: Lack of sanitization can lead to injection attacks (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting if data is displayed in a web view, SQL Injection if data is used in database queries), data corruption, or information leaks.
            *   Medium Effort: Requires understanding data flow and identifying injection points, but common techniques like fuzzing and manual testing can be effective.
            *   Intermediate Skill Level: Requires understanding of common injection vulnerabilities.

    *   **2.2.3. Logging Sensitive Information Related to Signal-Android [HIGH RISK NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Gain access to application logs and extract sensitive information related to Signal-Android that is inadvertently logged by the application.
        *   **Why High Risk:**
            *   Medium Likelihood: Overly verbose logging, especially in development and sometimes in production environments, is a common practice.
            *   Medium Impact: Exposure of sensitive data in logs depends on the sensitivity of the logged information and the access controls on the logs themselves. It can range from minor information disclosure to more significant data leaks.
            *   Low Effort: Easy to check logs for sensitive information if access is gained.
            *   Beginner Skill Level: Basic log analysis skills are sufficient.

*   **2.4. Lack of Security Best Practices in Application Development [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    *   **2.4.1. Insufficient Input Validation in Application Code [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploit general input validation vulnerabilities within the application code, not necessarily directly related to Signal-Android APIs, but within the application's broader codebase.
        *   **Why High Risk:**
            *   High Likelihood: Insufficient input validation is a pervasive vulnerability in applications across various platforms and languages.
            *   Medium to High Impact: The impact is broad and depends on the specific vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to code execution within the application context, which can indirectly affect Signal-Android integration.
            *   Medium Effort: Requires code analysis and penetration testing, but standard techniques are effective.
            *   Intermediate Skill Level: Requires understanding of common input validation vulnerabilities.

    *   **2.4.3. Lack of Regular Security Testing and Code Reviews [HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** This is not a direct attack vector but a systemic weakness. The absence of regular security testing and code reviews increases the likelihood of all other vulnerabilities (including those related to Signal-Android) remaining undetected and exploitable.
        *   **Why High Risk:**
            *   High Likelihood: Lack of security practices directly leads to a higher probability of vulnerabilities accumulating in the application.
            *   High Impact:  Accumulation of vulnerabilities across the application, including those related to Signal-Android integration, can lead to significant compromise and broader attack surfaces.
            *   Low Effort (for attacker): The attacker doesn't need to exert effort *for this step*, they simply benefit from the *lack* of security effort by the developers.
            *   Beginner Skill Level (for attacker): No specific skill needed for this step from the attacker's perspective.
