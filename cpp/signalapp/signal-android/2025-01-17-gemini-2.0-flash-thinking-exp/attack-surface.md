# Attack Surface Analysis for signalapp/signal-android

## Attack Surface: [Exported Components (Activities, Services, Broadcast Receivers)](./attack_surfaces/exported_components__activities__services__broadcast_receivers_.md)

*   **Description:** `signal-android` exposes components that can be directly invoked by other applications. If these components are not properly secured, malicious apps can interact with them in unintended ways.
*   **How Signal-Android Contributes:** The library's design might necessitate certain components being exported for legitimate inter-app communication or system events. However, improper access controls or vulnerabilities within these components, implemented by `signal-android`, can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A malicious application could send a crafted intent to an exported Activity of `signal-android` to trigger an unintended action or leak information handled by the library.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to functionalities provided by `signal-android`, data leakage managed by the library, denial of service affecting `signal-android`'s features within the host application, or even privilege escalation within the context of the host application due to vulnerabilities in `signal-android`'s exported components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Minimize the number of exported components within `signal-android` if possible. Implement strict permission checks and input validation within the code of `signal-android` for all exported components. Use explicit intents instead of implicit intents where the library initiates communication. Carefully review the AndroidManifest.xml within the `signal-android` library for exported components and their intent filters.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Data Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_data_storage.md)

*   **Description:** `signal-android` stores sensitive data (e.g., encryption keys, message metadata, temporary files) locally on the device in an insecure manner.
*   **How Signal-Android Contributes:** The library is directly responsible for handling and storing sensitive cryptographic keys and message data. If the storage mechanisms used by `signal-android` are not sufficiently protected, this data can be accessed by malicious applications with sufficient permissions.
*   **Example:** Encryption keys or message metadata stored by `signal-android` in shared preferences without proper encryption could be read by a malicious application with `READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` or similar permissions.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of encryption keys managed by `signal-android` leading to the ability to decrypt messages, exposure of message metadata revealing communication patterns handled by the library, and potential unauthorized access to user information managed by `signal-android`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Within `signal-android`, utilize Android's Keystore system for storing cryptographic keys. Encrypt sensitive data before storing it locally within the library's storage mechanisms. Avoid storing sensitive information in easily accessible locations like shared preferences without encryption within `signal-android`. Implement proper file permissions for files created by `signal-android`.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `signal-android` relies on various third-party libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
*   **How Signal-Android Contributes:** The library integrates these dependencies directly. Security flaws within these dependencies become part of `signal-android`'s attack surface and can be exploited through interactions with the library.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable version of a networking library used by `signal-android` could be exploited through the library's network communication functionality to perform a man-in-the-middle attack or achieve remote code execution affecting the host application through `signal-android`.
*   **Impact:** A wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability in the dependency, potentially leading to remote code execution within the context of the host application via `signal-android`, data breaches affecting data handled by the library, and denial of service of `signal-android`'s features.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Regularly update all third-party dependencies used by `signal-android` to their latest versions. Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools within the `signal-android` development process to identify known vulnerabilities in its dependencies. Carefully vet and select dependencies used by the library.

## Attack Surface: [Improper Handling of Intents and Broadcasts](./attack_surfaces/improper_handling_of_intents_and_broadcasts.md)

*   **Description:** `signal-android` sends or receives intents and broadcasts. If these are not handled securely within the library, malicious applications can intercept or spoof them, affecting `signal-android`'s functionality.
*   **How Signal-Android Contributes:** The library's code is responsible for sending and receiving intents and broadcasts for its internal communication and interaction with the Android system. Vulnerabilities in how `signal-android` sends or receives these can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A malicious application could register a broadcast receiver with a higher priority to intercept a broadcast sent by `signal-android` containing sensitive information or instructions. Or, a malicious app could send a crafted intent to a `signal-android` receiver to trigger unintended actions within the library.
*   **Impact:** Data leakage of information intended to be handled internally by `signal-android`, manipulation of the library's internal state or functionality, denial of service of specific features within `signal-android`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
