# Threat Model Analysis for signalapp/signal-android

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Signal Protocol Keys](./threats/insecure_storage_of_signal_protocol_keys.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the device's storage (e.g., through rooting, device compromise, or application vulnerability) and retrieves the Signal protocol keys (identity key, pre-keys, signed pre-key) managed by the `signal-android` library. This allows the attacker to decrypt past and future messages for the compromised user.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's communication confidentiality and integrity. The attacker can read all messages and potentially impersonate the user.

**Affected Component:** `org.signal.libsignal.protocol.storage` (interfaces and implementations for key storage).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize Android's Keystore system with appropriate access controls (e.g., requiring user authentication for access) as recommended by `signal-android`.
*   Avoid storing keys in shared preferences, external storage, or application databases without strong encryption provided by the Keystore, which is the responsibility of the integrating application when using `signal-android`.

## Threat: [Improper Initialization Leading to Security Weakness](./threats/improper_initialization_leading_to_security_weakness.md)

**Description:** The application developers fail to correctly initialize the `signal-android` library components, such as the `KeyStore`, `SessionBuilder`, or `GroupCipher`. This could lead to weakened encryption, failure to establish secure sessions, or other unexpected behavior that compromises security within the Signal protocol implementation.

**Impact:** Messages might not be properly encrypted by the `signal-android` library, leading to potential exposure of communication content. Session establishment might be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks due to incorrect library setup.

**Affected Component:** Application's initialization logic, directly interacting with various classes within `org.signal.libsignal.protocol` and related packages provided by `signal-android`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly adhere to the official Signal-Android documentation and examples for initialization.
*   Implement thorough unit and integration tests to verify correct initialization and secure session establishment using the `signal-android` library.
*   Conduct code reviews to ensure proper usage of the Signal library's initialization procedures.

## Threat: [Using Outdated Signal-Android Library with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/using_outdated_signal-android_library_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The application uses an outdated version of the `signal-android` library that contains known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities within the `signal-android` library if they are aware of them.

**Impact:** Exposure to known security flaws within the `signal-android` library that could lead to various attacks, including message decryption, denial of service within the messaging functionality, or other compromises related to the secure communication protocol.

**Affected Component:** The entire `signal-android` library dependency.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the severity of the known vulnerabilities within `signal-android`)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement a robust dependency management system and regularly update the `signal-android` library to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor security advisories and release notes for the `signal-android` library.
*   Automate dependency updates where possible, while ensuring thorough testing after updates.
