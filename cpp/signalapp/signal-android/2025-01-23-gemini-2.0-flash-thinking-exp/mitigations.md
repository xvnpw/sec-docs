Focus fuzzing efforts on data pathways where your application interacts with `signal-android`'s message handling, key exchange, and media processing functionalities.
4.  **Fuzzing Execution and Monitoring:** Run the fuzzer against your application's `signal-android` integration for an extended period, monitoring for crashes, errors, exceptions, or unexpected behavior within your application or the `signal-android` library itself.
5.  **Crash Analysis and Vulnerability Identification:** Analyze crash reports and error logs generated during fuzzing to identify the root cause of any issues. Determine if crashes or errors indicate potential vulnerabilities in your application's handling of `signal-android` data or within `signal-android` itself (though vulnerabilities in `signal-android` should be reported to the Signal team).
6.  **Remediation of Input Handling Vulnerabilities:** Fix any vulnerabilities discovered through fuzzing by implementing robust input validation, error handling, and data sanitization in your application's code that interacts with `signal-android`.

### Threats Mitigated:
