*   **Regression Risks:**  Updating dependencies can sometimes introduce regressions – unintended side effects that break existing functionality. Thorough testing is crucial to mitigate this risk, but it adds complexity and time to the update process.
*   **Breaking Changes:**  Major updates to the `signal-android` library might introduce breaking changes in APIs or functionalities, requiring code modifications in the application to maintain compatibility. This can be time-consuming and require significant development effort.
*   **Dependency Conflicts:**  Updating `signal-android` might lead to conflicts with other dependencies in the project, requiring careful dependency management and resolution.
*   **False Sense of Security:**  Relying solely on updates can create a false sense of security.  It's crucial to remember that updates are just one part of a comprehensive security strategy, and other vulnerabilities might exist in the application code itself or in other dependencies.
*   **Update Fatigue:**  Frequent updates, especially if poorly managed, can lead to "update fatigue" within the development team, potentially causing updates to be delayed or skipped, undermining the strategy's effectiveness.

#### 4.4. Implementation Challenges

Implementing the "Regularly Update `signal-android` Library" strategy effectively can present several challenges:

*   **Monitoring Releases:**  Manually tracking `signal-android` releases can be time-consuming and prone to errors.  Automated monitoring mechanisms are needed for efficient tracking.
