# BUSINESS POSTURE

Signal is an established open-source project with a strong emphasis on privacy and security. Its primary goal is to provide secure and private communication for its users. The project likely operates with a relatively conservative risk appetite due to the sensitivity of the data it handles (private communications).

Business Priorities:

*   Maintain user trust by ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of communications.
*   Provide a user-friendly and accessible messaging experience.
*   Continuously improve security and privacy features to stay ahead of evolving threats.
*   Maintain a transparent and open-source development process.

Business Goals:

*   Provide end-to-end encrypted messaging.
*   Minimize data collection and retention.
*   Protect user metadata.
*   Resist censorship and surveillance.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Compromise of encryption keys or algorithms, leading to exposure of user communications.
*   Vulnerabilities in the application code that could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to user data or devices.
*   Server-side attacks that could compromise the integrity or availability of the service.
*   Reputational damage due to security breaches or privacy failures.
*   Legal and regulatory challenges related to encryption and data privacy.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of Signal):

*   security control: End-to-end encryption (Signal Protocol) for all communications. Described in Signal Protocol documentation.
*   security control: Open-source codebase, allowing for public scrutiny and security audits. Implemented in GitHub repository.
*   security control: Regular security updates and vulnerability patching. Implemented in release cycle.
*   security control: Use of secure development practices (though specifics would need to be confirmed from internal documentation). Implemented in development process.
*   security control: Limited data collection and retention. Described in privacy policy.
*   security control: Protection against metadata leakage (though specifics would need to be confirmed). Implemented in Signal Protocol and server design.
*   security control: Forward secrecy (messages are protected even if long-term keys are compromised). Implemented in Signal Protocol.
*   security control: Sealed Sender (reduces the amount of metadata exposed to the Signal service). Implemented in server and client design.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party operating systems (Android) and their security models.
*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
*   accepted risk: User error, such as weak passwords or compromised devices.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers.
*   Conduct regular penetration testing by independent security firms.
*   Implement certificate pinning to mitigate the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   Explore formal verification methods for critical parts of the codebase.
*   Enhance supply chain security measures to prevent malicious code injection during the build process.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Users should be authenticated using strong, unique identifiers (e.g., phone numbers verified via SMS or a similar mechanism).
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (e.g., using a PIN or biometric authentication) should be considered.
*   Authorization:
    *   Access to user data and communications should be strictly limited to authorized users and processes.
    *   The principle of least privilege should be applied throughout the application.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user inputs should be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting).
    *   Input validation should be performed on both the client-side and server-side (where applicable).
*   Cryptography:
    *   The Signal Protocol should be used for end-to-end encryption of all communications.
    *   Strong cryptographic algorithms and key lengths should be used.
    *   Cryptographic keys should be securely generated, stored, and managed.
    *   Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations to address new threats and vulnerabilities.
