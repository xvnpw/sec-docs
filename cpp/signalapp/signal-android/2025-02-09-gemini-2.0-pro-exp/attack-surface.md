# Attack Surface Analysis for signalapp/signal-android

## Attack Surface: [Cryptographic Implementation Flaws](./attack_surfaces/cryptographic_implementation_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Errors in the implementation of the Signal Protocol or supporting cryptographic functions *within the Signal Android app itself*.
    *   **How Signal-Android Contributes:** This is entirely within Signal-Android's codebase. The app's core function is secure messaging, making cryptographic flaws extremely dangerous.
    *   **Example:** A bug in the key ratcheting mechanism could break forward secrecy. An integer overflow in a cryptographic calculation could lead to key compromise.  Incorrect handling of pre-keys could lead to decryption failures or impersonation.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of message confidentiality, integrity, and/or authenticity. Potential for impersonation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Rigorous code review (focused on crypto). Extensive unit/integration testing, including fuzzing. Use well-vetted cryptographic libraries (and keep them updated). Formal verification (where feasible). Independent security audits by cryptography experts.
        *   **Users:** Keep the Signal app updated.

## Attack Surface: [Local Data Storage Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/local_data_storage_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weaknesses in how Signal *stores data (messages, attachments, keys) on the device*. This is specifically about the *Signal app's* handling of local data.
    *   **How Signal-Android Contributes:** Signal-Android is responsible for encrypting and storing message history locally. The security of this storage depends on the app's implementation.
    *   **Example:** A weak key derivation function for database encryption (e.g., using a short PIN) allows brute-forcing. A vulnerability in SQLCipher (used by Signal) could bypass encryption.  Improper handling of file permissions could expose encrypted data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of message history and attachments to an attacker with physical access (or a backup).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use strong key derivation functions (PBKDF2 with high iterations). Audit/update SQLCipher regularly. Implement robust database integrity checks. Consider hardware-backed encryption. Secure file handling practices.
        *   **Users:** Use a strong device PIN/passcode/biometric lock. Enable full-disk encryption. Be cautious about physical device security. Use a long Signal passphrase (if enabled).

## Attack Surface: [WebRTC Vulnerabilities (Voice/Video Calls)](./attack_surfaces/webrtc_vulnerabilities__voicevideo_calls_.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws in the *Signal Android app's integration with and use of* the WebRTC library for calls.
    *   **How Signal-Android Contributes:** While WebRTC is a separate library, Signal-Android's *implementation* of how it uses WebRTC is crucial.  This includes handling of media streams, signaling, and interaction with STUN/TURN servers.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow in Signal's handling of WebRTC media data could allow code execution. A flaw in how Signal sets up WebRTC connections could leak the user's IP address.  Incorrect handling of WebRTC error conditions could lead to a crash or denial-of-service.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for eavesdropping on calls, remote code execution, denial-of-service, IP address leakage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep WebRTC library updated. Thoroughly review/test WebRTC integration. Robust input validation/sanitization for WebRTC data. Consider process isolation for WebRTC.
        *   **Users:** Keep the Signal app updated.

## Attack Surface: [Verification Code Phishing/Social Engineering (Signal App UI/UX)](./attack_surfaces/verification_code_phishingsocial_engineering__signal_app_uiux_.md)

*   **Description:** While primarily a user-focused attack, the Signal app's UI/UX plays a role in mitigating or exacerbating this risk.
    *   **How Signal-Android Contributes:** The app's design and warnings (or lack thereof) regarding verification codes directly impact the user's susceptibility to these attacks.
    *   **Example:** If the app doesn't clearly and repeatedly warn users *never* to share their verification code, users are more likely to fall victim to scams.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement clear, prominent, and repeated warnings about verification code scams *within the app*. Consider two-factor authentication options. Improve user education materials *within the app*.
        *   **Users:** *Never* share your verification code. Be suspicious of unsolicited requests. Enable Registration Lock.
