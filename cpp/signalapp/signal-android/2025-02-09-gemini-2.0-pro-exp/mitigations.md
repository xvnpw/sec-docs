# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for signalapp/signal-android

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Cryptographic Code Review and Testing (Signal-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_cryptographic_code_review_and_testing__signal-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Signal's Core Crypto Files:** Maintain a precise list of files within the `signal-android` codebase that implement the Signal Protocol and related cryptography (e.g., files within `libsignal-protocol-java`, `libsignal-service-java` dealing with session management, key exchange, message encryption/decryption, and native code related to Curve25519, AES-GCM, etc.).
    2.  **Mandatory Expert Review:**  Enforce a policy that *any* modification to these identified Signal cryptographic files requires review by at least two security engineers with *demonstrated expertise in the Signal Protocol itself*.  This is *not* a general code review; it's a specialized security review.
    3.  **Signal Protocol-Specific Checklist:** Develop a review checklist *specific to the Signal Protocol*, including:
        *   Correct implementation of Double Ratchet, X3DH, and related algorithms, according to the official specifications.
        *   Verification that key derivation, usage, and rotation adhere to the Signal Protocol's requirements.
        *   Checks for potential timing attacks or other side-channel leaks *within the context of the Signal Protocol's implementation*.
        *   Review of any changes to cryptographic primitives (e.g., if using a different AES-GCM implementation, it must be thoroughly vetted).
        *   Assessment of how changes might affect forward secrecy and post-compromise security.
    4.  **Signal-Specific Automated Testing:**
        *   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests that specifically target Signal's cryptographic functions, covering edge cases and error conditions *relevant to the Signal Protocol*.
        *   **Integration Tests:** Create integration tests that simulate *complete Signal Protocol flows*, including session setup, message exchange, and key rotation.  These tests should verify the correct interaction of different components.
        *   **Known-Answer Tests (KATs):** Use test vectors derived from the Signal Protocol specifications (or generated by a reference implementation) to verify the correctness of cryptographic operations.
    5.  **Upstream Synchronization and Conflict Resolution:**  Establish a process for regularly merging changes from the upstream `signal-android` repository.  *Any* merge conflict within the identified cryptographic files *must* be resolved by a security engineer with Signal Protocol expertise.  This is critical to avoid accidentally reverting security fixes.
    6. **Documentation of Deviations:** If any deviations from the upstream Signal Protocol implementation are *absolutely necessary*, document them *extremely thoroughly*, including the rationale, security analysis, and potential risks.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Incorrect Implementation of Signal Protocol (Severity: Critical):** Directly addresses the risk of introducing bugs that break the core security guarantees of the Signal Protocol.
    *   **Signal-Specific Side-Channel Attacks (Severity: High):**  Helps identify and mitigate side-channel vulnerabilities that are specific to the way Signal implements its cryptography.
    *   **Key Compromise due to Signal-Specific Errors (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the risk of introducing bugs that could expose Signal's cryptographic keys.
    *   **Regression Bugs in Signal's Crypto (Severity: Variable):**  Helps prevent the reintroduction of previously fixed vulnerabilities in Signal's code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Incorrect Implementation:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from "Critical" to "Low").
    *   **Signal-Specific Side-Channels:** Risk reduced (e.g., from "High" to "Medium").
    *   **Key Compromise:** Risk significantly reduced (e.g., from "Critical" to "Low").
    *   **Regression Bugs:** Risk reduced (e.g., from "Medium" to "Low").

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   General code review process exists.
    *   Some unit tests for Signal's cryptographic functions.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   No mandatory review by *multiple* Signal Protocol experts.
    *   No Signal Protocol-specific checklist.
    *   Limited integration testing of complete Signal Protocol flows.
    *   No use of Signal-specific KATs.
    *   Merge conflicts in Signal's crypto code are not always handled by Signal Protocol experts.
    *   Incomplete documentation of deviations from upstream.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Signal Key Management with Android Keystore (Signal-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_signal_key_management_with_android_keystore__signal-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Signal's Key Material:** Precisely identify all cryptographic keys used by Signal within the `signal-android` codebase (identity keys, pre-keys, signed pre-keys, session keys, message keys, chain keys, etc.).
    2.  **Android Keystore for Long-Term Keys:**  Ensure that Signal's long-term keys (identity key, signed pre-key) are stored using the Android Keystore System.
        *   Use `KeyGenParameterSpec.Builder` with settings appropriate for Signal's keys.
        *   *Crucially*, set `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)` to require user authentication (biometric or PIN) *before Signal can access these keys*. This is essential for protecting Signal's keys even if the device is unlocked.
        *   Use `setIsStrongBoxBacked(true)` *if the device supports it* to store Signal's keys in the StrongBox secure hardware. This provides an extra layer of protection.
        *   Verify that the correct key algorithms and purposes are used, matching Signal's requirements (e.g., `KeyProperties.KEY_ALGORITHM_EC` for identity keys, appropriate purposes for signing and encryption).
    3.  **Signal's Ephemeral Key Handling:** For Signal's ephemeral keys (session keys, message keys, chain keys), ensure secure in-memory handling.
        *   Use `SecureRandom` for generating these keys, ensuring it's properly seeded.
        *   *Attempt* to overwrite key material in memory with zeros after use (e.g., `Arrays.fill(keyMaterial, (byte) 0)`).  Understand the limitations of this on a managed runtime.
    4.  **Signal's Key Derivation (If Modified):** If modifying how Signal derives keys (e.g., from a user-chosen passphrase), *ensure the KDF is strong and aligns with Signal's security model*.  Use a well-vetted KDF like Argon2id with parameters appropriate for mobile devices and Signal's threat model.
    5.  **Signal's Key Rotation and Revocation:**  Review and potentially enhance Signal's key rotation and revocation mechanisms.
        *   Ensure that key rotation is performed according to the Signal Protocol's specifications.
        *   If modifying the revocation mechanism, ensure it's robust and prevents replay attacks.
    6. **Careful Audit Logging (Signal Context):** Log *only* Signal key management *events* (key generation, usage for encryption/decryption, rotation, deletion) *without ever logging the key material itself* or any information that could be used to derive it.  Focus on logging *actions* within the Signal Protocol flow.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromise of Signal's Keys from Device Compromise (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of an attacker extracting Signal's keys from a compromised device, *especially* if the device is unlocked.
    *   **Compromise of Signal's Keys from Application Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities within the `signal-android` codebase leading to key exposure.
    *   **Weak Key Derivation in Signal (Severity: High):**  Mitigates attacks against weak passphrases or secrets used to derive Signal's keys (if applicable).
    *   **Signal Key Reuse (Severity: Medium):**  Key rotation reduces the impact of a Signal key compromise.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Device Compromise:** Risk reduced (from "High" to "Medium" or "Low," depending on StrongBox and user authentication).
    *   **Application Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced (from "High" to "Medium").
    *   **Weak Key Derivation:** Risk significantly reduced (from "High" to "Low").
    *   **Key Reuse:** Risk reduced (from "Medium" to "Low").

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   Android Keystore System is used for Signal's identity key.
    *   Ephemeral keys are stored in memory.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   `setUserAuthenticationRequired(true)` is *not* consistently used for all of Signal's long-term keys.
    *   `setIsStrongBoxBacked(true)` is not used, even on supported devices.
    *   Ephemeral keys are not reliably zeroed out.
    *   Signal's key rotation/revocation mechanisms have not been thoroughly reviewed or enhanced.
    *   No careful audit logging of Signal key management events.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Signal Protocol Version Enforcement and Downgrade Attack Prevention](./mitigation_strategies/strict_signal_protocol_version_enforcement_and_downgrade_attack_prevention.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Signal Protocol Versions:** Determine the specific versions of the Signal Protocol supported by the `signal-android` codebase.
    2.  **Enforce Latest Version:** Configure the application to *strictly* accept connections *only* using the latest, most secure version of the Signal Protocol supported by *both* communicating parties.
    3.  **Explicitly Reject Old Versions:**  Add code to *explicitly reject* any connection attempts using older, deprecated versions of the Signal Protocol.  This should be a hard failure, not a fallback.
    4.  **Signal Version Negotiation Review:**  Thoroughly review the code within `signal-android` that handles Signal Protocol version negotiation (likely within `SessionCipher` and related classes).
        *   Ensure that the application *cannot be tricked* into negotiating an older version of the protocol.
        *   Look for any vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to manipulate the version negotiation process, *specifically within the context of Signal's implementation*.
    5.  **Signal-Specific Downgrade Attack Alerting:** Implement mechanisms to detect and alert the user to potential downgrade attacks *related to the Signal Protocol*.
        *   Display a clear warning if the application is forced to use an older version (this should ideally never happen).
        *   Log any attempts to downgrade the Signal Protocol version, including details about the remote party.
    6. **Targeted Testing:** Create test cases that *specifically attempt to force the application to downgrade the Signal Protocol version*.  These tests should verify that the rejection mechanisms are working correctly.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Signal Protocol Downgrade Attacks (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from forcing the application to use a weaker, older version of the Signal Protocol, bypassing security improvements.
    *   **Exploitation of Old Signal Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities that have been fixed in newer versions of the Signal Protocol.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Downgrade Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (from "High" to "Low").
    *   **Exploitation of Old Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced (from "High" to "Low").

*   **Currently Implemented (Example):**
    *   The application generally uses the latest Signal Protocol version.

*   **Missing Implementation (Example):**
    *   No explicit, hard rejection of older Signal Protocol versions.
    *   No dedicated code review focused on Signal's version negotiation logic.
    *   No Signal-specific alerting for downgrade attempts.
    *   No targeted tests for Signal Protocol downgrade attacks.
