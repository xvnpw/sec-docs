# Threat Model Analysis for signalapp/signal-android

## Threat: [Malicious Attachment Handling](./threats/malicious_attachment_handling.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted attachment (e.g., a malicious image, video, or document) that exploits a vulnerability in Signal's attachment handling code. This leverages a bug *within Signal's code* for processing attachments.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.  Severity depends on the specific vulnerability, but could allow an attacker to compromise the Signal application on the device.
    *   **Affected Component:** `org.thoughtcrime.securesms.attachments` package and related classes, specifically the code responsible for parsing and displaying different attachment types (e.g., `ImageAttachment`, `VideoAttachment`, etc.). Also, any third-party libraries used by *Signal itself* for media processing (e.g., image decoders).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical, depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Rigorous input validation and sanitization of all attachment data within the Signal codebase.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:**  Extensive fuzz testing of attachment parsing code within Signal.
        *   **Memory Safety:**  Use memory-safe languages or techniques (e.g., Rust) where possible within Signal's codebase.
        *   **Sandboxing:**  Isolate attachment processing in a separate process or sandbox (this is a design consideration for the Signal team).
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Promptly apply security updates to Signal and any third-party libraries *it* uses.

## Threat: [Compromised Backup Key (if backups are enabled)](./threats/compromised_backup_key__if_backups_are_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** If the user enables Signal backups and chooses a weak passphrase, an attacker could brute-force the passphrase and decrypt the backup, gaining access to the user's message history. This relies on the user's choice, but the *implementation* of backup encryption is within Signal.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the user's backed-up message history.
    *   **Affected Component:** `org.thoughtcrime.securesms.backup` package, specifically the code related to backup creation and restoration within Signal.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Passphrase Enforcement:**  Signal should strongly encourage users to choose strong, unique passphrases for their backups, possibly with minimum complexity requirements.
        *   **Key Derivation Function (KDF):**  Signal *already* uses a strong KDF (e.g., scrypt, Argon2) to make brute-forcing computationally expensive.  This should be regularly reviewed and updated as needed.
        *   **User Education:**  Signal should clearly educate users about the importance of strong passphrases and the risks of weak backups.
        * **Limit Backup Attempts:** Implement a mechanism within Signal to limit the number of incorrect backup passphrase attempts (both locally and potentially on the server if backup metadata is stored).

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries (used by Signal)](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries__used_by_signal_.md)

*   **Description:** Signal-Android relies on numerous third-party libraries. An attacker could exploit a vulnerability *in one of these libraries used by Signal* to compromise Signal's security. This is a vulnerability *within Signal's dependency tree*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies greatly depending on the vulnerable library and the nature of the vulnerability. Could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution *within the Signal app*.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any third-party library used by Signal-Android. Examples include libraries for image processing, networking, cryptography (although core crypto is usually handled by libsignal), etc. This can be found in the `build.gradle` files of the Signal project.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Management:** Signal team must use a robust dependency management system (e.g., Gradle) to track and update dependencies.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Signal team must regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like OWASP Dependency-Check.
        *   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Signal team should maintain an SBOM to track all components and their versions.
        *   **Prompt Updates:** Signal team must apply security updates to third-party libraries as soon as they become available.
        * **Library Selection:** Signal team must carefully vet third-party libraries before including them in the project, choosing libraries with a strong security track record.

## Threat: [Registration Lock Bypass (within Signal's implementation)](./threats/registration_lock_bypass__within_signal's_implementation_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker attempts to bypass the Registration Lock feature, which requires a PIN to register the user's phone number on a new device. This focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities *in Signal's implementation* of the PIN verification or recovery mechanism, *not* social engineering.
    * **Impact:** The attacker could register the user's phone number on their own device, effectively hijacking the account.
    * **Affected Component:** `org.thoughtcrime.securesms.registration.RegistrationLock` and related classes, as well as the server-side components that handle registration lock verification *within Signal's infrastructure*.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strong PIN Enforcement:** Signal should enforce strong, non-guessable PINs.
        * **Rate Limiting:** Signal's server-side components *must* implement strict rate limiting on PIN entry attempts.
        * **Secure PIN Recovery:** If a PIN recovery mechanism is provided by Signal, it *must* be highly secure and resistant to attacks. The implementation details are critical.
        * **Account Activity Monitoring:** Signal should notify users of any attempts to register their number on a new device.
