Okay, the user wants a filtered threat list. I need to go through the previous list and select only the threats that are directly related to Taichi. I also need to filter by risk severity, keeping only "High" and "Critical" threats. The output format remains Markdown lists, without tables.

Here's the filtering logic:

1. **Review each threat from the previous list.**
2. **Check if the threat is directly caused by or involves a Taichi component.**  Exclude threats that are primarily about general web application security or vulnerabilities in external systems *not* directly related to Taichi's functionality.
3. **Check the risk severity.** Keep only threats marked as "High" or "Critical".
4. **Format the remaining threats as a Markdown list.**### High and Critical Taichi Threats

*   **Threat:** Malicious Kernel Injection via Input Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user input that is directly or indirectly used to construct Taichi kernels. They craft input that, when processed, results in the generation of malicious Taichi code. This injected code could perform actions like reading sensitive data, modifying application state, or causing a denial of service when executed by the Taichi runtime.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Taichi Component:** `ti.kernel` decorator, Taichi AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation if user input influences compiled kernels.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly sanitize and validate all user inputs that influence Taichi kernel generation.
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements if user input is used in kernel construction.
        *   Avoid dynamically generating Taichi code based on untrusted input if possible.
        *   Implement input encoding and escaping techniques.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Taichi Compiler Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted Taichi code that triggers a bug or vulnerability within the Taichi compiler itself. This could lead to arbitrary code execution during the compilation process, potentially compromising the build environment or the system where compilation occurs.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server or developer machine, potential supply chain compromise.
    *   **Affected Taichi Component:** Taichi compiler (frontend and backend).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Taichi updated to the latest version with security patches.
        *   Monitor the Taichi project's issue tracker and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools on Taichi code to identify potential compiler-level issues.
        *   Isolate the build environment to limit the impact of a compromise.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Backend Driver Vulnerabilities via Taichi
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts Taichi code that leverages vulnerabilities in the underlying backend drivers (e.g., GPU drivers like CUDA or OpenGL) used by Taichi for execution. This could allow them to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the driver, potentially leading to system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Taichi Component:** Taichi runtime, backend interfaces (e.g., CUDA, OpenGL backends).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure that the underlying drivers for the chosen Taichi backends are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Be aware of known vulnerabilities in the specific backend drivers being used.
        *   Consider using sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of a driver compromise.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection via Untrusted Taichi Modules
    *   **Description:** If the application loads or uses Taichi modules from untrusted sources, an attacker could inject malicious code within these modules. When these modules are imported and used by the application, the malicious code will be executed.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breach, data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Taichi Component:** Taichi module loading mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only load Taichi modules from trusted sources.
        *   Implement integrity checks for Taichi modules before loading.
        *   Use code signing to verify the authenticity of Taichi modules.

*   **Threat:** Security Issues in Custom Taichi Backends (if implemented)
    *   **Description:** If the application implements custom Taichi backends, vulnerabilities in the implementation of these backends could be exploited to compromise the system.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability in the custom backend, could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Taichi Component:** Custom Taichi backend implementation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the complexity and security practices used in the custom backend).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom Taichi backends.
        *   Conduct thorough security testing and code reviews of custom backends.
        *   Isolate custom backends to limit the impact of a compromise.
