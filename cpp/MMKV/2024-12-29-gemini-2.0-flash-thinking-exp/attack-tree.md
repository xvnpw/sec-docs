## Threat Model: Compromising Application Using MMKV - Focused High-Risk View

**Objective:** Compromise application using MMKV by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within MMKV itself.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using MMKV
    * Exploit Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities
        * Indirect Data Manipulation via Application
            * Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses [CRITICAL]
                * Inject Malicious Data Through Application Input
    * Exploit MMKV Implementation Vulnerabilities
        * Cryptographic Weaknesses (If Encryption is Used)
            * Improper Key Management [CRITICAL]
                * Recover Encryption Key
    * Exploit Information Disclosure
        * Read Sensitive Data from MMKV Files
            * Gain Unauthorized File System Access [CRITICAL]
            * Exploit Application Vulnerabilities to Read MMKV Data
                * Bypass Access Controls within the Application [CRITICAL]
    * Exploit MMKV Implementation Vulnerabilities
        * Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks
            * Fill Up Storage Space

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses -> Inject Malicious Data Through Application Input:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides malicious input to the application through its user interface or API. This input is not properly validated or sanitized by the application before being stored in MMKV.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium to High (Can influence application logic or lead to unauthorized access)
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Basic to Intermediate
* **Improper Key Management -> Recover Encryption Key:**
    * **Attack Vector:** If the application uses MMKV's encryption feature, the encryption key is stored insecurely (e.g., hardcoded, stored in shared preferences without proper protection, transmitted insecurely). An attacker can discover or recover this key.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High (Allows decryption of all data stored in MMKV)
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Basic to Intermediate
* **Fill Up Storage Space:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages functionality within the application (or exploits a vulnerability) to write a large amount of data to MMKV, consuming excessive storage space on the device.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium (Can cause the application to crash or become unusable due to lack of storage)
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Basic

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application fails to adequately validate or sanitize user-provided data before storing it in MMKV. This allows attackers to inject malicious data that can manipulate application logic, bypass security checks, or cause unexpected behavior.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium to High
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Basic to Intermediate
* **Improper Key Management [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application's encryption key for MMKV is not managed securely, making it accessible to attackers. This could involve storing the key in plaintext, using weak storage mechanisms, or transmitting the key without encryption.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Basic to Intermediate
* **Gain Unauthorized File System Access [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the device's file system where MMKV files are stored. This could be achieved through exploiting OS vulnerabilities, social engineering, or if the device is rooted.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium (considering social engineering)
    * **Impact:** High (Allows direct reading and modification of MMKV data)
    * **Effort:** Low to High (depending on the method)
    * **Skill Level:** Basic to Advanced (depending on the method)
* **Bypass Access Controls within the Application [CRITICAL]:**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application's internal access controls designed to protect MMKV data are flawed or can be bypassed. This allows attackers to read sensitive information stored in MMKV without proper authorization.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
