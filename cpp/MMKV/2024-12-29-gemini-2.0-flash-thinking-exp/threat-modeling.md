### High and Critical MMKV Specific Threats

This list contains high and critical severity threats that directly involve the MMKV library.

*   **Threat:** Unencrypted Data Exposure
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to sensitive data stored by MMKV because encryption was not enabled. This could involve physically accessing a compromised device, exploiting file system vulnerabilities, or accessing device backups. The vulnerability lies directly in the lack of enforced encryption by MMKV when not explicitly configured.
    *   **Impact:** Confidential information is revealed, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, privacy violations, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected MMKV Component:** Core Storage (specifically the file storage mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always enable encryption during MMKV initialization using `MMKV.initialize(rootDir, MMKV.MULTI_PROCESS_MODE, cryptoKey)` and ensure `cryptoKey` is strong and securely managed.
        *   Avoid storing highly sensitive data if encryption cannot be reliably implemented and managed.

*   **Threat:** Weak Encryption Key Compromise
    *   **Description:** An attacker successfully decrypts MMKV data because the encryption key is weak, easily guessable, hardcoded in the application, or stored insecurely. While the key management is often an application responsibility, the weakness of the encryption algorithm or the lack of strong key derivation functions within MMKV itself could contribute to this.
    *   **Impact:**  Confidential information is revealed, similar to unencrypted data exposure, potentially leading to identity theft, financial loss, privacy violations, or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected MMKV Component:** Encryption Module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use strong, randomly generated encryption keys.
        *   Never hardcode encryption keys directly in the application code.
        *   Store encryption keys securely using platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Android Keystore, iOS Keychain).
        *   Implement key rotation strategies if feasible.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Key Storage
    *   **Description:** The encryption key used by MMKV is stored in an insecure location, making it accessible to attackers. While the storage location is primarily an application concern, vulnerabilities in how MMKV interacts with or suggests key storage could contribute.
    *   **Impact:** The encryption protecting MMKV data is rendered ineffective, leading to the exposure of sensitive information with the same potential consequences as unencrypted data exposure.
    *   **Affected MMKV Component:** Encryption Module, Key Management (interaction with external storage).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize platform-provided secure storage mechanisms like Android Keystore or iOS Keychain for storing encryption keys.
        *   Avoid storing keys in application preferences, configuration files, or other easily accessible locations.
        *   Implement proper access controls and permissions for key storage.

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Native Library Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability within the MMKV native library (written in C++). This could involve buffer overflows, memory corruption issues, or other common native code vulnerabilities present within MMKV's implementation.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution within the application's context, denial of service, or information disclosure, depending on the nature of the vulnerability within MMKV.
    *   **Affected MMKV Component:** Native Library (C++ code).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if exploitable remotely) to Medium (if requiring local access).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the MMKV library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to MMKV.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack on MMKV
    *   **Description:** The MMKV library itself is compromised at its source or distribution point, and a malicious version is used by the application. This directly involves the integrity of the MMKV library.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially severe, as the attacker could have full control over the data stored by MMKV and potentially the application itself.
    *   **Affected MMKV Component:** Entire MMKV library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if successful).
    *   Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use trusted sources for obtaining the MMKV library.
        *   Implement software composition analysis (SCA) tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Consider using checksum verification to ensure the integrity of the downloaded library.
