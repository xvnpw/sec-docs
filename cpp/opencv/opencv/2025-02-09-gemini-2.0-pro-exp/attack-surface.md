# Attack Surface Analysis for opencv/opencv

## Attack Surface: [1. Malformed Image/Video Input](./attack_surfaces/1__malformed_imagevideo_input.md)

*   *Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in OpenCV's image and video parsing/decoding routines through crafted malicious input files.
    *   *How OpenCV Contributes:* OpenCV's core functionality is processing various image/video formats; its internal and external codecs/parsers are the direct attack point.
    *   *Example:* A crafted JPEG with a malformed header triggers a buffer overflow in OpenCV's libjpeg usage, leading to code execution.
    *   *Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical** to **High**.
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate image/video dimensions, sizes, headers, and metadata *before* OpenCV processing.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz test OpenCV's image/video functions with malformed inputs.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Isolate OpenCV processing in a sandbox/container.
        *   **Memory Safety:** Use memory-safe languages or robust C++ memory management.
        *   **Limit Input Size:** Enforce strict limits on input image/video size.
        *   **Dependency Updates:** Keep OpenCV and its image/video codec dependencies up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [2. Adversarial Examples (DNN Module)](./attack_surfaces/2__adversarial_examples__dnn_module_.md)

*   *Description:*  Subtle input image perturbations causing OpenCV's DNN module to misclassify/misdetect.
    *   *How OpenCV Contributes:* OpenCV's DNN module provides the interface for loading and running the vulnerable deep learning models.  The vulnerability is *within* the model, but OpenCV is the *mechanism* of use.
    *   *Example:* A modified stop sign image (imperceptible to humans) causes OpenCV's DNN-based object detection to misclassify it.
    *   *Impact:* Misclassification, misdetection, bypass of security, potential physical harm.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High** to **Critical** (especially in safety-critical systems).
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Adversarial Training:** Train the model with adversarial examples.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Pre-process inputs to detect/mitigate perturbations.
        *   **Defensive Distillation:** Use defensive distillation techniques.
        *   **Ensemble Methods:** Use multiple models for increased robustness.
        *   **Input Gradient Regularization:** Penalize large input gradients during training.

## Attack Surface: [3. XML/YAML Deserialization (FileStorage)](./attack_surfaces/3__xmlyaml_deserialization__filestorage_.md)

*   *Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in XML/YAML parsers used by OpenCV's `FileStorage`.
    *   *How OpenCV Contributes:* OpenCV's `FileStorage` *directly* uses these parsers for loading/saving data; it's the component exposing the vulnerability.
    *   *Example:* A malicious YAML file, loaded via OpenCV's `FileStorage`, executes arbitrary code upon deserialization.
    *   *Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical** (especially for YAML).
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Safe YAML Loading:** Use a safe YAML loader (e.g., `yaml.safe_load` in Python). *Never* use `yaml.load` with untrusted input.
        *   **Disable External Entities (XML):** Disable external entity loading in the XML parser.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate XML/YAML file structure/content before parsing.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal privileges.

## Attack Surface: [4. Malicious Model Loading (DNN Module)](./attack_surfaces/4__malicious_model_loading__dnn_module_.md)

*   *Description:* Loading a tampered or malicious pre-trained model file, leading to code execution.
    *   *How OpenCV Contributes:* OpenCV's DNN module *directly* handles the loading of model files from various formats; it's the entry point for the attack.
    *   *Example:* A malicious object detection model, loaded by OpenCV, executes hidden code.
    *   *Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, system compromise.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**.
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Trusted Sources:** Only load models from trusted sources.
        *   **Checksum Verification:** Verify model file integrity with checksums.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Load and run models in a sandboxed environment.
        *   **Model Scanning:** Ideally, use tools to analyze model files for malicious content.

## Attack Surface: [5. Third-Party Library Vulnerabilities (Directly Used by OpenCV)](./attack_surfaces/5__third-party_library_vulnerabilities__directly_used_by_opencv_.md)

*   *Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities in libraries *directly* used by OpenCV for core functionality (image/video codecs).  This is distinct from general dependencies; it's about libraries *integral* to OpenCV's image/video processing.
    *   *How OpenCV Contributes:*  Vulnerabilities in libraries like libjpeg, libpng, libtiff, which OpenCV *uses for its core image/video handling*, are directly exploitable *through* OpenCV's image/video processing functions.  OpenCV is the *conduit* for the attack.
    *   *Example:* A vulnerability in libpng, used by OpenCV, is exploited via a crafted PNG image processed by OpenCV.
    *   *Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical** to **High**.
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep OpenCV and its *core* dependencies (image/video codecs) up-to-date. This is paramount.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Track and update these critical libraries.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Scan specifically for vulnerabilities in these core libraries.
        *   **Static/Dynamic Analysis:** Analyze OpenCV and its core dependencies for vulnerabilities.
