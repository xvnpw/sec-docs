## Attack Tree Path: [Image/Video Processing Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/imagevideo_processing_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node encompasses vulnerabilities within OpenCV itself and, crucially, its external dependencies used for image and video decoding (e.g., libjpeg, libpng, libtiff, ffmpeg). These libraries are often complex and have a history of security flaws.
*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow in Image Codecs [HR]:**
        *   *Description:*  A classic vulnerability where an attacker provides a specially crafted image or video file that, when processed by a vulnerable codec, overwrites memory beyond the allocated buffer. This can lead to arbitrary code execution.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High
        *   *Impact:* High to Very High (RCE, data breach)
        *   *Effort:* Low to Medium (depending on vulnerability discovery)
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate to Advanced
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to Hard
    *   **Exploit CVE-XXXX (Known Vulnerability) [HR]:**
        *   *Description:*  Attackers actively scan for systems running software with known, published vulnerabilities (identified by CVE numbers).  Exploits for these vulnerabilities are often publicly available, making this a very common attack vector.
        *   *Likelihood:* High (if unpatched)
        *   *Impact:* High to Very High (often RCE)
        *   *Effort:* Very Low to Low (public exploits available)
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice to Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy to Medium (vulnerability scanners)

## Attack Tree Path: [Algorithm/Model Manipulation (if ML is used)](./attack_tree_paths/algorithmmodel_manipulation__if_ml_is_used_.md)

*    **Description:** If the application utilizes OpenCV's machine learning capabilities, this branch becomes relevant. Attackers can manipulate the input to the ML model or the model itself to cause incorrect results.
*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Adversarial Examples [HR]:**
        *   *Description:*  Carefully crafted inputs that are designed to be misclassified by the ML model. These inputs often appear normal to humans but cause the model to make incorrect predictions.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High
        *   *Impact:* Medium to High (misclassification, incorrect results)
        *   *Effort:* Low to Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS) [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__dos___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This critical node focuses on attacks that aim to make the application unavailable by consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory).
*   **High-Risk Path:**
    *   **Trigger Excessive Memory Allocation [HR]:**
        *   *Description:*  An attacker provides very large images, videos, or other inputs that cause the application to allocate an excessive amount of memory, leading to crashes or system instability. This is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium to High (if input validation is weak)
        *   *Impact:* High (application crash, system instability)
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Novice
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy to Medium
