## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application using OpenCV](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_opencv.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Processing Vulnerabilities *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_processing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses in how the application handles external image and video data processed by OpenCV. Attackers aim to provide malicious input that triggers vulnerabilities within OpenCV or its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Image/Video Input *** CRITICAL NODE ***](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_imagevideo_input__critical_node.md)

*   This is the initial step in many input processing attacks. The attacker provides a crafted image or video file designed to exploit a specific vulnerability in OpenCV or its underlying libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Image Format Parsing Vulnerabilities *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_image_format_parsing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path.md)

*   This path involves exploiting weaknesses in the libraries responsible for parsing image formats like JPEG and PNG. These libraries can have vulnerabilities that allow attackers to cause buffer overflows, memory corruption, or even execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow in Image Decoder (e.g., JPEG, PNG) *** CRITICAL NODE ***](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow_in_image_decoder__e_g___jpeg__png___critical_node.md)

*   Attackers provide crafted images with oversized headers or malformed data. When the image decoder attempts to parse this data, it writes beyond the allocated buffer, potentially overwriting critical memory and leading to code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Arbitrary Code Execution via Image Metadata Exploitation (e.g., Exif) *** CRITICAL NODE ***](./attack_tree_paths/arbitrary_code_execution_via_image_metadata_exploitation__e_g___exif___critical_node.md)

*   Attackers embed malicious code within the metadata of an image file (like Exif data). If the application or OpenCV processes this metadata without proper sanitization, the malicious code can be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if OpenCV used for object serialization) *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_opencv_used_for_object_serialization___high-risk_path.md)

*   If the application uses OpenCV to serialize and deserialize data (e.g., storing trained models), attackers can provide maliciously crafted serialized data. When the application attempts to deserialize this data, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Maliciously Crafted Serialized Data *** CRITICAL NODE ***](./attack_tree_paths/supply_maliciously_crafted_serialized_data__critical_node.md)

*   The attacker provides a specially crafted data stream intended to be deserialized by the application using OpenCV. This malicious data exploits vulnerabilities in the deserialization process to execute arbitrary code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Underlying Dependencies *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_underlying_dependencies__high-risk_path.md)

*   OpenCV relies on various third-party libraries for tasks like image decoding (e.g., libjpeg, libpng, ffmpeg). This path involves exploiting known vulnerabilities within these dependency libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Vulnerable Image/Video Codecs (used by OpenCV) *** CRITICAL NODE ***](./attack_tree_paths/target_vulnerable_imagevideo_codecs__used_by_opencv___critical_node.md)

*   Attackers provide image or video files specifically crafted to trigger known vulnerabilities in the image or video codecs used by OpenCV (such as libjpeg, libpng, or ffmpeg). Successful exploitation can lead to code execution or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within OpenCV Library Itself *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_opencv_library_itself__high-risk_path.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities that exist directly within the OpenCV library's code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) *** CRITICAL NODE ***](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerabilities__cves___critical_node.md)

*   Attackers exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific version of OpenCV being used by the application. This often involves targeting specific vulnerable functions or modules for which exploits may already exist.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Memory Corruption Bugs *** HIGH-RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_memory_corruption_bugs__high-risk_path.md)

*   This path involves exploiting memory management errors within OpenCV's code, leading to memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflows in Image Processing Functions *** CRITICAL NODE ***](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflows_in_image_processing_functions__critical_node.md)

*   Attackers provide specific input data that causes OpenCV's image processing functions to write beyond the allocated memory buffer. This can overwrite critical data or inject malicious code, leading to code execution or denial of service.
