# Threat Model Analysis for opencv/opencv

## Threat: [Malicious Image File Exploitation](./threats/malicious_image_file_exploitation.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Image File Exploitation
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG, TIFF) with malformed headers, excessive metadata, or triggers vulnerabilities in OpenCV's internal decoding process. The application, using OpenCV to load or process this image, attempts to parse it. This could lead to a buffer overflow, memory corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution on the system running the application.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, application crash, information disclosure (if memory contents are leaked).
    * **Affected OpenCV Component:** `cv::imread`, `cv::imdecode`, OpenCV's internal image decoding logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate image file headers and metadata before processing with OpenCV.
        * Limit the file formats accepted by the application to only necessary types.
        * Implement robust error handling and exception management around image loading functions.
        * Consider using a separate, sandboxed environment or process for image decoding.
        * Keep OpenCV updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        * Implement file size limits for uploaded images.

## Threat: [Malicious Video File Exploitation](./threats/malicious_video_file_exploitation.md)

* **Threat:** Malicious Video File Exploitation
    * **Description:** Similar to malicious image files, an attacker crafts a video file (e.g., MP4, AVI, MKV) with malformed headers, corrupted frames, or exploits vulnerabilities in OpenCV's internal video processing or decoding logic (even if it delegates to underlying libraries). When OpenCV attempts to process this video, it could trigger a buffer overflow, memory corruption, or arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, application crash, information disclosure.
    * **Affected OpenCV Component:** `cv::VideoCapture`, `cv::VideoWriter`, OpenCV's internal video processing logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate video file headers and metadata before processing.
        * Limit the video file formats accepted by the application.
        * Implement robust error handling around video processing functions.
        * Consider using a separate, sandboxed environment or process for video decoding.
        * Keep OpenCV updated to benefit from security patches in its video processing components.
        * Implement file size and duration limits for uploaded videos.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in Image Processing Operations](./threats/integer_overflow_in_image_processing_operations.md)

* **Threat:** Integer Overflow in Image Processing Operations
    * **Description:** An attacker provides an image with extremely large dimensions or manipulates pixel values in a way that causes integer overflows during arithmetic operations within OpenCV functions (e.g., resizing, filtering, color conversions). This can lead to unexpected behavior, incorrect calculations, or memory corruption.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, unexpected application behavior, potential for memory corruption leading to crashes or vulnerabilities.
    * **Affected OpenCV Component:** Various image processing functions within modules like `imgproc` (e.g., `cv::resize`, `cv::GaussianBlur`, `cv::cvtColor`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement checks on image dimensions and pixel values before performing arithmetic-intensive operations.
        * Be mindful of the data types used for intermediate calculations and ensure they can handle potential overflows.
        * Utilize OpenCV functions with built-in bounds checking where available.
        * Validate input image dimensions against reasonable limits.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Specific OpenCV Algorithms](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_specific_opencv_algorithms.md)

* **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Specific OpenCV Algorithms
    * **Description:** An attacker leverages known vulnerabilities or implementation flaws directly within specific OpenCV algorithms (e.g., in face recognition, object detection, or feature matching modules) by providing specially crafted input data that triggers these flaws. This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or potentially information leakage.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, unexpected application behavior, potential information disclosure depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Affected OpenCV Component:** Specific algorithms within modules like `face`, `objdetect`, `features2d`. Examples: `cv::face::FaceRecognizer::predict`, `cv::CascadeClassifier::detectMultiScale`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Stay informed about known vulnerabilities in specific OpenCV algorithms through security advisories and release notes.
        * If possible, use well-established and thoroughly tested algorithms.
        * Consider input validation and sanitization tailored to the specific algorithm being used.
        * Keep OpenCV updated to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks on OpenCV Binaries or Source Code](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_on_opencv_binaries_or_source_code.md)

* **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks on OpenCV Binaries or Source Code
    * **Description:** An attacker compromises the official OpenCV build or distribution process, injecting malicious code directly into the official binaries or source code hosted on the OpenCV repository. Developers using these compromised versions of OpenCV unknowingly integrate the malicious code into their applications.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    * **Affected OpenCV Component:** Potentially all components, as the malicious code could be injected anywhere within the library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Obtain OpenCV from the official GitHub repository or verified official distribution channels.
        * Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries using checksums or digital signatures provided by the OpenCV team.
        * Consider building OpenCV from source and auditing the build process if security is paramount.
        * Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies (though this primarily addresses third-party library issues, it can provide an additional layer of security).
