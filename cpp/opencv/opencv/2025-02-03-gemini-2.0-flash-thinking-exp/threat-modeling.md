# Threat Model Analysis for opencv/opencv

## Threat: [Malformed Image File Exploitation](./threats/malformed_image_file_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file (e.g., PNG, JPEG, TIFF) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in OpenCV's image decoding libraries. The attacker aims to trigger buffer overflows, memory corruption, or other parsing errors by manipulating file headers, metadata, or image data. Upon processing this file, the application becomes vulnerable.
* **Impact:**
    * **Code Execution:**  Attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to resource exhaustion or errors.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data from server memory might be leaked.
* **Affected OpenCV Component:** `cv::imread` function, image decoding modules (e.g., `imgcodecs` module, specifically PNG, JPEG, TIFF decoders).
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on uploaded files. Verify file types, sizes, and potentially use sanitization libraries before passing to OpenCV.
    * **Secure Image Decoding Libraries:** Ensure OpenCV and its dependencies (image decoding libraries like libpng, libjpeg, libtiff) are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    * **Sandboxing:** Run OpenCV processing in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges to contain the impact of a successful exploit.
    * **File Size Limits:** Enforce reasonable file size limits for uploaded images to mitigate potential DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Malformed Video File Exploitation](./threats/malformed_video_file_exploitation.md)

* **Description:** Similar to malformed image files, an attacker uploads a crafted video file (e.g., MP4, AVI, MKV) to exploit vulnerabilities in OpenCV's video decoding libraries. The attacker manipulates video container formats, codecs, or metadata to trigger parsing errors, buffer overflows, or memory corruption during video processing.
* **Impact:**
    * **Code Execution:** Attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Application crashes or becomes unresponsive due to resource exhaustion or errors.
    * **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data from server memory might be leaked.
* **Affected OpenCV Component:** `cv::VideoCapture` class, video decoding modules (e.g., `videoio` module, specifically FFmpeg backend or other video decoders).
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation on uploaded video files. Verify file types, sizes, and potentially use sanitization libraries before passing to OpenCV.
    * **Secure Video Decoding Libraries:** Ensure OpenCV's video decoding backend (e.g., FFmpeg) is up-to-date with the latest security patches. Regularly update OpenCV and its dependencies.
    * **Sandboxing:** Run OpenCV processing in a sandboxed environment with limited privileges.
    * **File Size and Duration Limits:** Enforce reasonable file size and video duration limits to mitigate potential DoS attacks.
    * **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on video upload and processing endpoints to prevent abuse.

## Threat: [Unsafe Deserialization of OpenCV Objects](./threats/unsafe_deserialization_of_opencv_objects.md)

* **Description:** If the application serializes and deserializes OpenCV objects (e.g., matrices, models) from untrusted sources, there is a risk of unsafe deserialization vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft malicious serialized data to exploit vulnerabilities in OpenCV's deserialization process, potentially leading to code execution.
* **Impact:**
    * **Code Execution:**  Attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Application crashes or becomes unstable due to corrupted objects.
* **Affected OpenCV Component:**  Serialization and deserialization functions within OpenCV, if used by the application (e.g., `cv::FileStorage`, custom serialization logic).
* **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid Deserialization from Untrusted Sources:**  Minimize or eliminate deserialization of OpenCV objects from untrusted sources.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:** If deserialization from untrusted sources is necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of the serialized data before deserialization.
    * **Secure Serialization Methods:** Use secure serialization methods and formats that are less prone to vulnerabilities.
    * **Code Review:** Carefully review code that handles serialization and deserialization of OpenCV objects for potential vulnerabilities.
