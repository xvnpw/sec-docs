## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit OpenCV Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_opencv_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*   This is the primary high-risk path, focusing on directly exploiting weaknesses within the OpenCV library itself. Success here can lead to significant compromise.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Memory corruption vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, heap overflows, integer overflows).
        *   Logic bugs in algorithms (though less emphasized as high-risk compared to memory corruption and dependencies).
