# BUSINESS POSTURE

The primary business goal of the OpenCV project is to provide a comprehensive, open-source library for computer vision, image processing, and machine learning. This aims to empower developers and researchers globally to build innovative applications and advance the field of computer vision. The project prioritizes broad accessibility, high performance, and continuous improvement through community contributions.

Key business priorities include:
- Maintaining a robust and feature-rich library that meets the evolving needs of the computer vision community.
- Fostering a vibrant and active community of contributors and users.
- Ensuring the library is widely adopted and used in diverse applications.
- Maintaining the project's open-source nature and accessibility.
- Ensuring the long-term sustainability of the project through community support and potentially organizational backing.

Most important business risks to address:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to misuse in applications, damaging the reputation and trust in OpenCV.
- Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies or build processes could compromise the integrity of the library.
- Lack of consistent security practices across a large open-source project could lead to vulnerabilities being introduced or overlooked.
- Reputational damage due to security incidents could hinder adoption and community growth.
- Misuse of OpenCV in malicious applications could negatively impact public perception of the project.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code review process for contributions, primarily focused on functionality and code quality, with some attention to obvious security flaws. (Implemented on GitHub through pull requests and maintainer reviews. Described in contribution guidelines.)
- security control: Public vulnerability reporting through issue trackers and community forums. (Implemented on GitHub and OpenCV forums. Described in project documentation.)
- security control: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities. (Implicitly implemented through the open-source nature of the project.)
- accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to exist for some time before being discovered and patched due to the nature of open-source development and reliance on community reporting.
- accepted risk: Limited resources dedicated specifically to proactive security testing and vulnerability research.
- accepted risk: Dependence on external dependencies, which may introduce vulnerabilities.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in code changes.
- recommended security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to track and manage dependencies, and identify known vulnerabilities in them.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear and documented vulnerability disclosure and response process, including a security team or designated security contact.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, potentially through bug bounty programs or partnerships with security firms.
- recommended security control: Implement input validation and sanitization practices across the codebase, especially in modules dealing with external data and file formats.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the OpenCV library itself. Authentication might be relevant for related infrastructure like the project website or issue tracker, but not within the library's core functionality.
- Authorization: Authorization within the library is primarily about API access control, ensuring that functions are used as intended.  This is enforced through API design and documentation rather than explicit authorization mechanisms.
- Input Validation: Robust input validation is critical for OpenCV. The library processes images and videos from various sources, which could be potentially malicious. All input data, including image formats, dimensions, and parameters, must be rigorously validated to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, format string bugs, and injection attacks.
- Cryptography: OpenCV includes modules that utilize cryptography.  Security requirements include using well-vetted cryptographic libraries, following secure cryptographic practices, and avoiding implementation of custom cryptography where possible.  When cryptography is used, it must be implemented correctly to protect data confidentiality and integrity where required (e.g., in modules dealing with secure communication or data storage, if any).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process to protect:
- Development and maintenance of the OpenCV library: Ensuring the integrity and availability of the source code and development infrastructure is crucial for the project's sustainability and continued operation.
- Build and distribution process: Protecting the build pipeline and distribution channels is vital to ensure that users receive trusted and untampered versions of the OpenCV library.
- Community trust and reputation: Maintaining the community's trust in the security and reliability of OpenCV is essential for its continued adoption and growth.

Data to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code: Publicly available, but integrity is paramount. Unauthorized modifications or introduction of vulnerabilities would be a critical risk.
- Build artifacts (binaries, packages): Publicly distributed, but integrity is critical. Compromised build artifacts could lead to widespread security issues in applications using OpenCV.
- Documentation: Publicly available, integrity is important for usability and trust.
- Developer credentials and CI/CD secrets: Confidential. Compromise could lead to unauthorized code changes, build tampering, and distribution of malicious software.
- Vulnerability reports: Sensitive until patched. Public disclosure before a patch is available could increase the risk of exploitation.
