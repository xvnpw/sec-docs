## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Apache Arrow

This table outlines high and critical threats that directly involve the Apache Arrow library.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Arrow IPC Message Exploitation** | An attacker crafts a malicious Arrow IPC message (used for inter-process communication or network transfer) containing specially crafted data designed to exploit a buffer overflow, integer overflow, or other memory safety vulnerability in the Arrow deserialization logic. The attacker might send this message to a service expecting Arrow data. | **Critical:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the receiving process, leading to complete system compromise. Potential for data corruption or denial of service. | Arrow IPC format, Arrow C++ Core (deserialization logic), Language Bindings (if they don't handle deserialization safely) | **Critical** | * **Keep Arrow library updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. * **Input validation (at the schema level):**  While challenging with binary formats, enforce strict schema validation before deserialization. * **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Deserialize untrusted Arrow IPC messages in isolated environments or processes with limited privileges. * **Use secure communication channels:** Employ TLS/SSL for network communication to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks that could inject malicious messages. |
| **Exploiting Parquet/Feather Deserialization Vulnerabilities** | An attacker crafts a malicious Parquet or Feather file containing specially crafted metadata or data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the Arrow file format parsing logic. This could involve oversized fields, incorrect data types, or triggers for known vulnerabilities in the parsing libraries. The attacker might trick a user into opening such a file or upload it to a vulnerable service. | **High:** Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the parsing vulnerability allows it. Data corruption within the loaded Arrow structures. Denial of Service by causing excessive resource consumption during parsing. | Arrow Parquet/Feather reader modules, Arrow C++ Core (file format parsing logic), Language Bindings | **High** | * **Keep Arrow library updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities in file format parsing. * **Schema validation:** Enforce strict schema validation when reading Parquet/Feather files, especially from untrusted sources. * **Sanitize file paths and names:** Avoid directly using user-provided file paths to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities if the parsing logic interacts with the file system. * **Limit file sizes:** Implement limits on the size of Parquet/Feather files that can be processed. |
| **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Arrow Compute Kernels** | An attacker provides specially crafted input data to Arrow compute kernels (optimized functions for data manipulation) that triggers a bug, leading to a crash, incorrect computation, or potentially a memory safety issue within the kernel's execution context. | **High:** Denial of Service due to kernel crashes. Data corruption if the kernel produces incorrect results. Potential for memory corruption within the kernel's context. | Arrow Compute Kernels (specific kernel functions) | **High** | * **Keep Arrow library updated:** Kernel vulnerabilities are often addressed in updates. * **Input validation (at a higher level):** Sanitize or validate data before passing it to compute kernels, especially if the data originates from untrusted sources. * **Monitor resource usage:** Unusual resource consumption during kernel execution might indicate an exploit. |
| **Data Tampering through Crafted Arrow Files** | An attacker modifies an Arrow file (Parquet, Feather) to inject malicious data or alter existing data. If the application trusts the integrity of these files without verification, it could lead to incorrect processing or decisions. | **High:** Data corruption, leading to incorrect application behavior or flawed analysis. Potential for security breaches if the tampered data is used for authorization or access control. | Arrow File Formats (Parquet, Feather) | **High** | * **Integrity checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of Arrow files, such as using checksums or digital signatures. * **Secure storage:** Store Arrow files in secure locations with appropriate access controls to prevent unauthorized modification. * **Read-only access:** If possible, access Arrow files in read-only mode to prevent accidental or malicious modifications. |
| **Spoofing Arrow Data Source (IPC)** | An attacker spoofs the source of an Arrow IPC stream, sending malicious or manipulated data that the application believes originates from a trusted source. | **Medium to High:** Data corruption, leading to incorrect application behavior. Potential for security breaches if the spoofed data is used for authorization or access control. | Arrow IPC format, Network communication | **High** | * **Authentication and authorization:** Implement mechanisms to verify the identity and authorization of data sources sending Arrow IPC messages. * **Digital signatures:** Consider using digital signatures for Arrow IPC messages to ensure authenticity and integrity. * **Secure communication channels:** Use secure protocols (like TLS) when transmitting Arrow data. |
