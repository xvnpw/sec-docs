## Attack Tree Path: [Hermes Engine Bugs (Memory Corruption)](./attack_tree_paths/hermes_engine_bugs__memory_corruption_.md)

*   **Description:** These vulnerabilities arise from errors in how the Hermes engine manages memory.  Attackers can exploit these errors to overwrite memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Sub-Categories:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow:** Writing data beyond the allocated bounds of a buffer. This can overwrite adjacent memory regions, potentially corrupting data structures or function pointers.
    *   **Use-After-Free:** Accessing memory that has already been freed. This can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes or the execution of arbitrary code if the attacker can control the contents of the freed memory.
    *   **Heap Spraying:** A technique used to increase the likelihood of a successful memory corruption exploit. The attacker attempts to fill a large portion of the heap with a specific pattern, increasing the chances that a vulnerable pointer will point to attacker-controlled data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  While Hermes is designed with security in mind, memory corruption vulnerabilities are a persistent threat in C/C++ codebases.
*   **Impact:** High to Very High.  Successful exploitation can lead to complete control of the affected process.
*   **Effort:** High.  Requires in-depth knowledge of memory management, exploit development, and the Hermes engine's internals.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced to Expert.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard to Very Hard.  These vulnerabilities can be subtle and difficult to detect without specialized tools and techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hermes JIT Compiler Bugs (Memory Corruption)](./attack_tree_paths/hermes_jit_compiler_bugs__memory_corruption_.md)

*   **Description:** The Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler dynamically generates machine code from JavaScript.  Bugs in this process can introduce memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sub-Categories:**
        *   **Buffer Overflow:** Similar to engine-level buffer overflows, but occurring within the JIT-generated code or the JIT compiler itself.
        *   **Use-After-Free:**  Similar to engine-level use-after-free, but related to the JIT compiler's management of generated code and associated data structures.
        *   **Heap Spraying:**  Can be used to influence the JIT compiler's output, increasing the chances of a successful exploit.
    *   **Likelihood:** High. JIT compilers are complex and often a prime target for attackers due to the dynamic nature of code generation.
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High.  Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the JavaScript engine.
    *   **Effort:** High.  Requires specialized knowledge of JIT compilation, assembly language, and the specific JIT implementation in Hermes.
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard.  JIT bugs are often difficult to reproduce and debug due to their dynamic nature.
