# Deep Analysis: Supply Chain Compromise of Hermes JavaScript Engine

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Supply Chain Compromise" attack surface related to the use of the Hermes JavaScript engine.  This involves understanding the specific ways an attacker could introduce malicious code into the Hermes library or its dependencies, assessing the potential impact, and refining mitigation strategies beyond the initial high-level overview.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for both developers integrating Hermes and end-users of applications built with it.  A key goal is to move beyond generic advice and provide Hermes-specific context.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the supply chain risks associated with the Hermes JavaScript engine itself, including:

*   **Direct Compromise of the Hermes Repository:**  Unauthorized modification of the official Hermes source code on GitHub.
*   **Compromise of Hermes Build Tools/Infrastructure:**  Tampering with the tools or systems used to compile and package Hermes releases.
*   **Dependency Compromise:**  Malicious code introduced into one of Hermes's direct or transitive dependencies (libraries that Hermes relies on).
*   **Distribution Channel Compromise:**  Interception and modification of Hermes binaries during distribution (e.g., through a compromised CDN or package manager).
*   **Compromise of Third-Party Integrations:** If Hermes is integrated via a third-party library or framework, the compromise of that integration point.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General application security vulnerabilities unrelated to Hermes.
*   Operating system or platform-level vulnerabilities.
*   Physical security breaches.

## 3. Methodology

This deep analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will use a threat modeling approach (e.g., STRIDE or PASTA) to systematically identify potential attack vectors and scenarios related to supply chain compromise.
2.  **Dependency Analysis:**  We will examine Hermes's dependency tree to identify critical dependencies and assess their security posture.  This includes reviewing their own security practices and vulnerability history.
3.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  While a full code review of Hermes is outside the scope, we will perform targeted code reviews of security-sensitive areas, such as build scripts, dependency management configurations, and code signing/verification mechanisms (if present).
4.  **Best Practices Review:**  We will compare Hermes's development and release processes against industry best practices for secure software supply chain management.
5.  **Vulnerability Database Research:**  We will search for known vulnerabilities in Hermes and its dependencies using resources like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD), GitHub Security Advisories, and other relevant sources.
6.  **Open Source Intelligence (OSINT):** We will gather information from public sources (forums, blogs, security reports) to identify any reported incidents or discussions related to Hermes supply chain security.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Threat Modeling (STRIDE Focus)

We'll use the STRIDE model to categorize potential threats:

*   **Spoofing:**
    *   An attacker could impersonate the official Hermes GitHub repository or release channels.
    *   An attacker could create a fake package with the same name as a Hermes dependency.
*   **Tampering:**
    *   An attacker could modify the Hermes source code on GitHub (if they gain unauthorized access).
    *   An attacker could tamper with Hermes binaries during the build process or distribution.
    *   An attacker could inject malicious code into a Hermes dependency.
*   **Repudiation:**
    *   Lack of proper auditing and logging within the Hermes build and release process could make it difficult to trace the origin of a compromised build.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   Vulnerabilities in Hermes or its dependencies could leak sensitive information about the application or its users.  (While not directly a supply chain issue, a compromised dependency could introduce such vulnerabilities).
*   **Denial of Service:**
    *   A compromised dependency could be used to launch a denial-of-service attack against the application or the Hermes engine itself.
    *   A vulnerability in Hermes, introduced via the supply chain, could be exploited to crash the engine.
*   **Elevation of Privilege:**
    *   A compromised version of Hermes could contain code that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.  This is the most critical threat.

### 4.2. Dependency Analysis

Hermes, being a JavaScript engine, has a complex build process and likely relies on several dependencies, both direct and transitive.  A crucial step is to generate a complete dependency graph.  Tools like `npm` (if used in the build process) or dedicated dependency analysis tools can help.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Number of Dependencies:**  A large number of dependencies increases the attack surface.
*   **Dependency Maintenance:**  Are dependencies actively maintained and updated?  Stale dependencies are more likely to contain known vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Security Practices:**  Do the maintainers of key dependencies follow secure coding practices and have a process for handling security vulnerabilities?
*   **Transitive Dependencies:**  It's essential to analyze not just direct dependencies, but also the dependencies of those dependencies (transitive dependencies).  A vulnerability deep in the dependency tree can still be exploited.
* **Specific to Hermes:** We need to identify which parts of the build process are using external dependencies. For example, are there any external libraries used for:
    *   Building the Hermes bytecode compiler.
    *   Testing Hermes.
    *   Generating documentation.
    *   Packaging Hermes for distribution.

**Example (Hypothetical):**

Let's say Hermes uses a library called `lib-bytecode-optimizer` for optimizing bytecode.  If `lib-bytecode-optimizer` has a vulnerability that allows arbitrary code execution, an attacker could exploit this vulnerability to compromise Hermes itself.  Even if `lib-bytecode-optimizer` is a transitive dependency (used by another library that Hermes uses directly), the risk remains.

### 4.3. Targeted Code Review

This section focuses on reviewing specific parts of the Hermes codebase and build process:

*   **`CMakeLists.txt` and Build Scripts:**  Examine how dependencies are fetched, built, and linked.  Are there any hardcoded URLs or insecure protocols (e.g., HTTP instead of HTTPS)?  Are there any custom build steps that could be vulnerable to injection attacks?
*   **Dependency Management Files:**  If Hermes uses a package manager (like `npm` for build tools), review the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or equivalent) files.  Are there any pinned versions that are known to be vulnerable?  Are there any unusual or suspicious dependencies?
*   **Code Signing/Verification (if applicable):**  If Hermes releases are digitally signed, review the signing process and the code that verifies signatures.  Are the signing keys securely stored and managed?  Is the verification process robust against tampering?
* **Release process:** How are releases created? Is there a manual step that could be compromised? Is there an automated pipeline?

**Example (Hypothetical):**

If the `CMakeLists.txt` file uses `curl` to download a dependency without verifying its checksum, an attacker could potentially perform a man-in-the-middle attack and replace the legitimate dependency with a malicious one.

### 4.4. Best Practices Review

We'll compare Hermes's practices against these best practices:

*   **Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):**  Does Hermes provide an SBOM that lists all its dependencies and their versions?  An SBOM is crucial for vulnerability management.
*   **Reproducible Builds:**  Are Hermes builds reproducible?  This means that given the same source code and build environment, the build process should always produce the same output.  Reproducible builds help ensure that the build process hasn't been tampered with.
*   **Code Signing:**  Are Hermes releases digitally signed?  This allows users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the downloaded binaries.
*   **Vulnerability Disclosure Program:**  Does Hermes have a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities?
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Does Hermes undergo regular security audits by independent third parties?
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Is 2FA enforced for all maintainers with commit access to the Hermes repository?
*   **Least Privilege:**  Are build systems and release infrastructure configured with the principle of least privilege?  This minimizes the impact of a potential compromise.
* **Dependency Pinning:** Are dependencies pinned to specific versions to prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities?

### 4.5. Vulnerability Database Research

We'll search for known vulnerabilities in:

*   **Hermes itself:**  Check the NVD, GitHub Security Advisories, and other vulnerability databases.
*   **Hermes's dependencies:**  Use the SBOM (if available) or dependency analysis tools to identify dependencies and then search for vulnerabilities in those dependencies.

### 4.6. Open Source Intelligence (OSINT)

We'll search for:

*   **Reports of Hermes supply chain compromises:**  Have there been any previous incidents or discussions about potential vulnerabilities?
*   **Security research on Hermes:**  Has any security researcher published findings related to Hermes's security?
*   **Discussions on forums and social media:**  Are there any discussions about Hermes security concerns?

## 5. Refined Mitigation Strategies

Based on the deep analysis, we can refine the initial mitigation strategies:

**For Developers Integrating Hermes:**

*   **Obtain Hermes from Official Sources:**  Always download Hermes from the official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/facebook/hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes).  Avoid unofficial mirrors or distribution channels.
*   **Verify Integrity:**
    *   **Checksums:**  Compare the checksum of the downloaded file against the checksum published on the official website or GitHub releases page.  Hermes should provide SHA-256 checksums at a minimum.
    *   **Digital Signatures:**  If Hermes provides digitally signed releases, verify the signature using the official public key.
    *   **Git Commit Verification:** If building from source, verify the Git commit hash against the official repository.  Use `git verify-commit <commit-hash>`.
*   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):**  Use an SCA tool (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot, OWASP Dependency-Check) to automatically scan your project's dependencies (including Hermes and its transitive dependencies) for known vulnerabilities.  Configure the SCA tool to alert you to new vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Pinning:**  Pin Hermes and its dependencies to specific versions in your project's configuration files (e.g., `package.json`, `requirements.txt`).  This prevents unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities or break compatibility.  However, balance this with the need to apply security updates.
*   **Regular Updates:**  Regularly update Hermes and all its dependencies to the latest stable versions.  Monitor the Hermes release notes and security advisories for information about security fixes.
*   **Reproducible Builds (if building from source):**  Strive for reproducible builds.  This makes it easier to verify that the build process hasn't been tampered with.
*   **Sandboxing:**  Consider running Hermes in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a potential compromise.  This could involve using containers, virtual machines, or other isolation techniques.
*   **Runtime Monitoring:**  Implement runtime monitoring to detect unusual behavior that might indicate a compromised Hermes engine.  This could include monitoring system calls, network activity, and memory usage.
*   **Contribute to Hermes Security:** If you discover a potential vulnerability in Hermes, report it responsibly to the Hermes maintainers through their security vulnerability disclosure program.

**For End-Users of Applications Built with Hermes:**

*   **Trusted Sources:**  Download applications only from trusted sources, such as official app stores or the developer's official website.
*   **Application Updates:**  Keep your applications updated to the latest versions.  Developers often release updates to address security vulnerabilities.
*   **Platform Updates:**  Keep your operating system and other platform software updated.  This helps protect against vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise applications.
*   **Security Software:**  Use reputable security software (e.g., antivirus, anti-malware) to help detect and prevent malicious code.
*   **Be Wary of Suspicious Behavior:**  If an application starts behaving strangely (e.g., excessive network activity, unexpected pop-ups), it could be a sign of a compromise.

## 6. Conclusion

The supply chain compromise of a JavaScript engine like Hermes is a critical threat with potentially devastating consequences.  This deep analysis has highlighted the various attack vectors and provided refined mitigation strategies for both developers and users.  By implementing these recommendations, we can significantly reduce the risk of a successful supply chain attack and improve the overall security of applications built with Hermes.  Continuous monitoring, regular updates, and a proactive approach to security are essential for maintaining a strong defense against this evolving threat.
