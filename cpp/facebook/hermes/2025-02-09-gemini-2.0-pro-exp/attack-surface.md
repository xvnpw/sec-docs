# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/hermes

## Attack Surface: [1. Bytecode Interpreter Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/1__bytecode_interpreter_exploitation.md)

*Description:* Flaws in how Hermes interprets compiled JavaScript bytecode. This is the core functionality of the engine, making it a high-priority target.
*How Hermes Contributes:* This is the fundamental mechanism by which Hermes executes JavaScript. Any bug here directly impacts security.
*Example:* A crafted JavaScript input that exploits a type confusion bug in the interpreter's handling of object properties, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution within the Hermes context (severity depends on external sandboxing, but the vulnerability itself is critical within Hermes).
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly update to the latest Hermes release.  This is the *primary* mitigation for internal bugs.
        *   Perform extensive fuzz testing of JavaScript *after* compilation by Hermes, focusing on edge cases and complex interactions. This helps find bugs *triggered* by valid JavaScript, even if the bug is in Hermes.
        *   Implement robust error handling within the JavaScript code (this helps *mitigate* the impact, but doesn't fix the underlying Hermes bug).
    *   **Users:** (No direct mitigation; relies entirely on developers updating Hermes)

## Attack Surface: [2. JIT Compiler Vulnerabilities (if enabled)](./attack_surfaces/2__jit_compiler_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_.md)

*Description:* Bugs in the optional Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler, which translates bytecode to native machine code.
*How Hermes Contributes:* The JIT compiler, if present, is a complex component of Hermes that directly handles code generation.
*Example:* A buffer overflow in the JIT's code generation logic, triggered by a specific JavaScript pattern, allowing injection of malicious native code.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution at the native level (potentially bypassing some sandboxing).
*Risk Severity:* Critical (if JIT is enabled)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   *Strongly consider disabling the JIT compiler if performance allows.* This eliminates this entire attack surface.
        *   If the JIT is required:
            *   Rigorously fuzz test the JIT compiler *specifically*.
            *   Keep Hermes updated.
    *   **Users:** (No direct mitigation)

## Attack Surface: [3. Memory Management Flaws](./attack_surfaces/3__memory_management_flaws.md)

*Description:* Bugs in Hermes's internal memory management (garbage collection, allocation).
*How Hermes Contributes:* Hermes manages its own memory; these are vulnerabilities *within* that system.
*Example:* A use-after-free vulnerability in the garbage collector, triggered by a specific sequence of JavaScript object manipulations.
*Impact:* Potential for arbitrary code execution within the Hermes context, or denial-of-service (crashes).
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly update Hermes. This is the primary defense against internal bugs.
        *   Fuzz testing, specifically targeting memory management, can help uncover these flaws.
    *   **Users:** (No direct mitigation)

## Attack Surface: [4. Built-in API Implementation Bugs](./attack_surfaces/4__built-in_api_implementation_bugs.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities in Hermes's *own* implementations of standard JavaScript APIs (e.g., `JSON.parse`, `RegExp`).
*How Hermes Contributes:* These are bugs *within* Hermes's code, not in how the application uses the APIs.
*Example:* A crafted regular expression that triggers a denial-of-service (ReDoS) vulnerability *within Hermes's RegExp engine*.
*Impact:* Denial-of-service, or potentially code execution (depending on the specific API and vulnerability).
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Regularly update Hermes.
        *   Fuzz testing focused on Hermes's implementations of the built-in APIs.
    *   **Users:** (No direct mitigation)

## Attack Surface: [5. Supply Chain Compromise](./attack_surfaces/5__supply_chain_compromise.md)

*Description:* Malicious code introduced into the Hermes library or its dependencies.
*How Hermes Contributes:* The application's security depends on the integrity of the Hermes library itself.
*Example:* A compromised version of Hermes is distributed, containing a backdoor that allows arbitrary code execution.
*Impact:* Potentially complete system compromise.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Obtain Hermes from the official, trusted source (GitHub repository).
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded binaries/source code (checksums, signatures).
        *   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify known vulnerabilities in Hermes and its dependencies.
        *   Regularly update Hermes and all dependencies.
    *  **Users:**
        * Use applications from trusted developers and sources.
        * Keep the application and its platform (OS, etc.) updated.
