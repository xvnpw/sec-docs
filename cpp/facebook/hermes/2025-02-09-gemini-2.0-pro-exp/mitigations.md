# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for facebook/hermes

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Bytecode Verification](./mitigation_strategies/strict_bytecode_verification.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Checksum Generation (Build Time):** During compilation to Hermes bytecode, generate a SHA-256 hash of the bytecode. Store this securely (e.g., in a build manifest).
    2.  **Checksum Verification (Runtime):** Before loading bytecode, retrieve the pre-calculated hash. Calculate the hash of the loaded bytecode *in memory* (before deserialization). Compare the two hashes. Abort if they don't match.
    3.  **Signature Generation (Build Time - Optional but Recommended):** Digitally sign the bytecode (or its hash) using a private key. Store the public key in the application.
    4.  **Signature Verification (Runtime - Optional but Recommended):** Before loading (or after checksum verification), verify the signature using the public key. Abort if verification fails.
    5.  **Format Validation (Runtime):** *Before* execution, thoroughly validate the bytecode's structure:
        *   Check each opcode for validity.
        *   Verify data types associated with opcodes.
        *   Ensure references are within valid bounds.
        *   Check for inconsistencies.
    6.  **Bounds Checking (Runtime):** During interpretation, continuously check array accesses, offsets, and lengths are within allocated memory bounds.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Severity: Critical):** Prevents loading of malicious bytecode.
    *   **Data Tampering (Severity: High):** Detects modifications to the bytecode.
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: High):** Malformed bytecode could cause crashes; validation helps.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk reduced significantly (Critical to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduced significantly (High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced (High to Medium/Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Checksum generation/verification in build pipeline (`build.gradle`, `build.sh`) and runtime (`BytecodeLoader.java` / `BytecodeLoader.swift`).
    *   Basic format validation in `BytecodeLoader.java` / `BytecodeLoader.swift`.
    *   Partial bounds checking within the Hermes engine.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Signature generation/verification.
    *   Comprehensive format validation (current checks are rudimentary).
    *   Explicit bounds checking in application code interacting with Hermes (though this is less *directly* Hermes-related).

## Mitigation Strategy: [ReDoS Prevention (within Hermes' Regex Engine)](./mitigation_strategies/redos_prevention__within_hermes'_regex_engine_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regex Review:** Identify all regular expressions used *within* JavaScript code that will be executed by Hermes.
    2.  **Complexity Analysis:** Analyze each regex for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities (nested quantifiers, overlapping alternations).
    3.  **Simplification:** Rewrite complex/vulnerable regexes to use safer patterns.
    4.  **Timeout Implementation (Hermes-Specific):**  This is the *key* Hermes-specific part.  If Hermes provides a mechanism to set a timeout for regex matching *within the engine itself*, use it.  If not, this mitigation moves to the "less direct" category (and would involve timeouts at the JSI layer, *if* regex operations were offloaded to native code).  The ideal scenario is a timeout *within* Hermes's regex engine.
    5.  **Regex Fuzzing (Hermes-Specific):** Fuzz test the Hermes engine's regular expression implementation. This is crucial and directly targets Hermes.
    6.  **Safe Regex Libraries (Optional, but Hermes-relevant):** If Hermes allows it (and it likely does, via JSI), consider using a native library with built-in ReDoS protection, and call it *from* JavaScript running in Hermes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (ReDoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from making the application unresponsive.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (ReDoS):** Risk significantly reduced (High to Low/Negligible).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some regular expressions are used in `InputValidator.js`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No systematic regex review.
    *   No Hermes-specific timeout mechanism is used (or investigated).
    *   No fuzzing of Hermes's regex engine.
    *   No safe regex libraries are used via JSI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debugger and Profiler in Production (Hermes-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debugger_and_profiler_in_production__hermes-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Build Configuration (Hermes-Specific):** Modify build configurations (e.g., `CMakeLists.txt`) to ensure Hermes's debugger and profiler are disabled in production. This involves Hermes-specific compiler flags/definitions.
    2.  **Verification:** After building, verify that attempts to connect a debugger to the Hermes instance fail.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):** Prevents access to sensitive info via debugger/profiler.
    *   **Code Manipulation (Severity: Critical):** Reduces risk of using the debugger to alter behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (High to Negligible).
    *   **Code Manipulation:** Risk reduced (Critical to Negligible).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Debugger disabled via `NDEBUG`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Profiler *not* explicitly disabled.
    *   Verification steps are not part of the release process.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Memory Management Hardening (within Hermes)](./mitigation_strategies/memory_management_hardening__within_hermes_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Fuzz Testing (Hermes Internals):**  Fuzz test the Hermes engine *itself*, specifically its garbage collector and memory allocation routines. This is the most direct and crucial step.
    2.  **Memory Safety Tools (Hermes Build):**  When *building* Hermes (if you're building from source), use memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer and Valgrind to detect memory errors *within Hermes's own codebase*.
    3.  **Stay up to date (Hermes Updates):** Keep the version of hermes up to date, because new versions often contains bug fixes and security improvements.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Use-After-Free (Severity: Critical):**
    *   **Double-Free (Severity: Critical):**
    *   **Buffer Overflows (Severity: Critical):**
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: High):**

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced (Critical/High to Medium/Low, depending on findings).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   None.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fuzz testing of Hermes internals.
    *   Use of memory safety tools during Hermes build.
    *   Regular updates of Hermes engine.
