### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Prototype Pollution

#### 4.1. Introduction to Prototype Pollution in Hermes

Prototype pollution is a JavaScript vulnerability that arises from the dynamic nature of the language and its prototype-based inheritance model. In JavaScript, objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes.  The `prototype` of an object constructor (like `Object`, `Array`, `Function`, etc.) is itself an object.  **Prototype pollution occurs when an attacker can modify the prototype of a built-in JavaScript object.**

This is significant because changes to a prototype are reflected in *all* objects that inherit from that prototype.  This means that polluting a global object's prototype (like `Object.prototype`) can have a **global impact** across the entire JavaScript environment of an application.

Hermes, as a JavaScript engine optimized for React Native, is susceptible to prototype pollution vulnerabilities just like any other JavaScript environment. If vulnerabilities exist within Hermes that allow for uncontrolled modification of object prototypes, attackers can leverage them to compromise applications.

#### 4.2. Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path: "Exploit Vulnerabilities in Hermes JavaScript Engine Core -> Prototype Pollution [HIGH RISK PATH]"

This attack path highlights the risk of vulnerabilities within the core Hermes engine that could be exploited to achieve prototype pollution.  The "HIGH RISK PATH" designation underscores the severity of this vulnerability due to its potential for widespread and impactful attacks.

##### 4.2.1. Description: Exploiting prototype pollution vulnerabilities within the Hermes JavaScript engine.

The description accurately summarizes the core issue.  The key takeaway is that vulnerabilities within Hermes itself are the entry point. These vulnerabilities could be:

*   **Bugs in Hermes's JavaScript parsing or execution logic:**  These bugs might allow attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code that, when processed by Hermes, unintentionally modifies prototypes.
*   **Vulnerabilities in Hermes's built-in functions or APIs:**  If Hermes exposes APIs or built-in functions that can be manipulated to directly or indirectly modify prototypes without proper validation or sanitization, these could be exploited.
*   **Memory corruption vulnerabilities:** In more severe cases, memory corruption vulnerabilities within Hermes could be exploited to directly overwrite memory locations associated with object prototypes.

The "JavaScript-specific vulnerability" aspect is crucial. Prototype pollution is a characteristic vulnerability of JavaScript and its prototype-based inheritance.  The "unexpected behavior and potentially security breaches" highlights the wide range of potential impacts.

##### 4.2.2. Attack Vector 1: Exploit prototype pollution vulnerabilities in Hermes's JavaScript environment to modify object behavior globally [HIGH RISK PATH]

*   **Mechanism:** This attack vector focuses on leveraging prototype pollution to modify the behavior of fundamental JavaScript objects.  Attackers inject JavaScript code that targets the prototypes of global objects like `Object.prototype`, `Array.prototype`, `String.prototype`, etc.

    **Example (Conceptual JavaScript - may not directly work in Hermes without specific vulnerability):**

    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable code (example - simplified for illustration, actual vulnerability would be in Hermes engine)
    function processUserInput(input) {
        // ... some processing that might inadvertently allow prototype pollution based on 'input' ...
        // For example, if 'input' is used to dynamically set object properties without proper sanitization.
        // Imagine a scenario where 'input' can control the property name being set.
        let obj = {};
        let key = input.keyFromUserInput; // Attacker controls 'keyFromUserInput'
        let value = input.valueFromUserInput; // Attacker controls 'valueFromUserInput'
        obj[key] = value; // If 'key' is "__proto__" or "constructor.prototype", this could pollute prototypes.
        return obj;
    }

    // Attacker crafted input to pollute Object.prototype
    let maliciousInput = {
        keyFromUserInput: "__proto__.isAdmin",
        valueFromUserInput: true
    };

    processUserInput(maliciousInput);

    // Now, ALL objects in the application will inherit 'isAdmin: true' from Object.prototype
    let user = {};
    console.log(user.isAdmin); // Output: true (due to prototype pollution)
    ```

    **Explanation:** In this simplified example, if the `processUserInput` function is vulnerable (due to insecure handling of user input), an attacker can craft input that sets properties on the `__proto__` (or `constructor.prototype`) of objects.  By setting `__proto__.isAdmin = true`, the attacker pollutes `Object.prototype`.  Consequently, every object created in the application will now inherit the `isAdmin` property with the value `true`.

*   **Impact:** The impact of globally modifying object behavior can be severe:
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Polluting prototypes with properties that cause errors or infinite loops when accessed can crash the application or make it unresponsive.
    *   **Data Manipulation:**  Modifying the behavior of built-in methods (e.g., `Array.prototype.push`, `String.prototype.toUpperCase`) can lead to unexpected data processing and corruption.
    *   **Logic Hijacking:**  Altering the behavior of core JavaScript functions can fundamentally change the application's logic, leading to unpredictable and potentially malicious outcomes.
    *   **Backdoors:**  Attackers can inject properties or methods into prototypes that act as backdoors, allowing them to execute arbitrary code or access sensitive data later.

*   **Likelihood:** The likelihood of this attack vector depends on the presence of prototype pollution vulnerabilities within Hermes. If such vulnerabilities exist, and if attacker-controlled input can reach and trigger these vulnerabilities, the likelihood is high, especially given the potentially widespread impact.

##### 4.2.3. Attack Vector 2: Use prototype pollution to escalate privileges or bypass security checks within the application's JavaScript code [HIGH RISK PATH]

*   **Mechanism:** This attack vector focuses on exploiting prototype pollution to specifically target security-sensitive parts of the application's JavaScript code.  Attackers aim to modify prototypes in a way that bypasses authentication, authorization, or other security mechanisms implemented in JavaScript.

    **Example (Conceptual JavaScript - may not directly work in Hermes without specific vulnerability):**

    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable Authentication Check (example - simplified for illustration)
    function checkAdminAccess(user) {
        if (user.isAdmin === true) { // Relies on 'isAdmin' property
            console.log("Admin access granted!");
            return true;
        } else {
            console.log("Admin access denied.");
            return false;
        }
    }

    let regularUser = {};
    checkAdminAccess(regularUser); // Output: Admin access denied.

    // Attacker pollutes Object.prototype to set 'isAdmin' to true
    Object.prototype.isAdmin = true;

    // Now, even regularUser will be considered an admin due to prototype pollution
    checkAdminAccess(regularUser); // Output: Admin access granted! (Bypassed authentication)
    ```

    **Explanation:** In this example, the `checkAdminAccess` function relies on the `isAdmin` property of a user object to determine administrative privileges. If an attacker can pollute `Object.prototype` and set `isAdmin` to `true`, then *all* objects, including regular user objects, will inherit this `isAdmin: true` property. This effectively bypasses the intended authentication check, granting admin access to unauthorized users.

*   **Impact:** The impact of privilege escalation and security bypass can be critical:
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive data, functionalities, or administrative panels that they should not be able to access.
    *   **Data Breaches:**  Bypassing security checks can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or exfiltration, resulting in data breaches.
    *   **Account Takeover:**  In authentication bypass scenarios, attackers can potentially take over user accounts, including administrative accounts.
    *   **Full Application Control:**  In severe cases, successful privilege escalation can grant attackers complete control over the application and its underlying systems.

*   **Likelihood:** The likelihood of this attack vector is also dependent on the presence of prototype pollution vulnerabilities in Hermes and the application's reliance on JavaScript-based security checks. If the application uses JavaScript for critical security logic and is vulnerable to prototype pollution, this attack vector poses a significant risk.

#### 4.3. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of prototype pollution vulnerabilities in Hermes-based applications, the following strategies should be considered:

**4.3.1. Prevention (Best Approach):**

*   **Secure Hermes Engine:**
    *   **Regular Hermes Updates:**  Keep Hermes updated to the latest version. Facebook actively maintains Hermes and releases security patches. Staying up-to-date is crucial to benefit from these fixes.
    *   **Report Vulnerabilities:** If any potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities are discovered in Hermes, report them to the Facebook security team immediately.
*   **Secure Coding Practices in Application JavaScript:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Property Assignment with User Input:**  Carefully review all JavaScript code that dynamically sets object properties based on user-controlled input.  Sanitize and validate input rigorously.  Avoid using user input directly as property keys without strict validation.
    *   **Use `Object.create(null)` for Dictionaries:** When creating objects intended to be used as dictionaries or hash maps (where prototype inheritance is not needed), use `Object.create(null)`. This creates objects without a prototype, preventing prototype pollution through these objects.
    *   **Freeze Objects and Prototypes:**  Use `Object.freeze()` to make objects and prototypes immutable where appropriate. This can prevent accidental or malicious modification of prototypes. However, be mindful of performance implications.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Minimize the use of global objects and prototypes where possible. Encapsulate logic and data to reduce the scope of potential prototype pollution impacts.
    *   **Code Reviews and Static Analysis:**  Implement thorough code reviews and utilize static analysis tools that can detect potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities in JavaScript code.

**4.3.2. Detection:**

*   **Runtime Monitoring (Advanced):**  Implement runtime monitoring to detect unexpected modifications to object prototypes. This can be complex but can provide an early warning system.
*   **Integrity Checks (Less Practical for Prototypes):**  While less practical for prototypes due to their dynamic nature, consider integrity checks for critical objects or configurations that should not be modified.

**4.3.3. Remediation:**

*   **Rollback Polluted Prototypes (Difficult and Risky):**  Attempting to "undo" prototype pollution by resetting prototypes to their original state is complex and potentially risky. It might not be reliable and could introduce further instability.  This should be considered a last resort and handled with extreme caution.
*   **Application Restart:**  In many cases, the most reliable remediation after detecting prototype pollution is to restart the application to reset the JavaScript environment and clear the polluted prototypes.
*   **Patching Vulnerable Code:**  Identify and patch the vulnerable code that allowed prototype pollution to occur. This is the most important step to prevent future attacks.
