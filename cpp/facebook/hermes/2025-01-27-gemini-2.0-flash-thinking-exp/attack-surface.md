# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/hermes

## Attack Surface: [JIT Compiler Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jit_compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs within Hermes's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that can be exploited by malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Hermes Contribution:** Hermes utilizes a JIT compiler to optimize JavaScript execution, making it a potential source of vulnerabilities if not implemented securely. This is a core component of Hermes.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted JavaScript function triggers a buffer overflow in the JIT compiler during optimization, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Hermes Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Hermes to benefit from JIT compiler bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Disable JIT (If Possible and Acceptable Performance Impact):** In highly security-sensitive environments, consider disabling JIT compilation if performance impact is acceptable. This reduces the attack surface related to JIT bugs, but may impact application performance.

## Attack Surface: [Interpreter Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/interpreter_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs within Hermes's core JavaScript interpreter, even when JIT is disabled or bypassed.
*   **Hermes Contribution:** Hermes's interpreter is the fundamental execution engine for JavaScript, and vulnerabilities within it can be directly exploited. This is a core component of Hermes.
*   **Example:** A specific sequence of JavaScript operations triggers a use-after-free vulnerability in the interpreter's object management, allowing an attacker to corrupt memory and potentially gain control of execution flow.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Hermes Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Hermes to benefit from interpreter bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Management Issues (Heap Overflow/Underflow, Use-After-Free)](./attack_surfaces/memory_management_issues__heap_overflowunderflow__use-after-free_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities arising from incorrect memory management within Hermes, such as heap overflows, underflows, or use-after-free conditions.
*   **Hermes Contribution:** Hermes's memory management implementation is crucial for engine stability and security. Bugs in this area are directly within Hermes's code and can lead to exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A JavaScript operation causes Hermes to allocate insufficient memory for a data structure, leading to a heap buffer overflow when data is written beyond the allocated boundary. This can be exploited to overwrite adjacent memory regions and potentially execute code.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Hermes Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Hermes to benefit from memory management bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Bytecode Verification Bypass](./attack_surfaces/bytecode_verification_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the process of verifying Hermes bytecode, allowing malicious or invalid bytecode to be executed.
*   **Hermes Contribution:** Hermes compiles JavaScript to bytecode for faster startup. The bytecode verification is a Hermes specific security feature, and vulnerabilities here are directly within Hermes.
*   **Example:** A crafted bytecode file exploits a flaw in the bytecode verification logic, allowing it to pass verification despite containing malicious instructions that would normally be rejected. This malicious bytecode then executes within the Hermes engine.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Denial of Service
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Hermes Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Hermes to benefit from bytecode verification bug fixes and security patches.
    *   **Secure Bytecode Distribution:** Ensure bytecode is distributed securely and is not tampered with after compilation. Use integrity checks (e.g., checksums) to verify bytecode integrity before loading.

## Attack Surface: [Bytecode Deserialization Bugs](./attack_surfaces/bytecode_deserialization_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the process of deserializing Hermes bytecode from storage or network into memory.
*   **Hermes Contribution:** Hermes needs to deserialize bytecode for execution. Bugs in this deserialization process are directly within Hermes's bytecode handling code and can be exploited with malicious bytecode.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted bytecode file exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability during deserialization, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute code before the bytecode is even executed as JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Denial of Service
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Hermes Up-to-Date:** Regularly update Hermes to benefit from bytecode deserialization bug fixes and security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Debugging Protocol Vulnerabilities (If Enabled in Production)](./attack_surfaces/remote_debugging_protocol_vulnerabilities__if_enabled_in_production_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the remote debugging protocol used to inspect and control Hermes execution, if inadvertently left enabled in production builds.
*   **Hermes Contribution:** Hermes may offer remote debugging capabilities for development. The debugging protocol and its vulnerabilities are directly related to Hermes's features.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the debugging protocol allows an unauthenticated attacker to connect to a production application's Hermes instance and inject arbitrary JavaScript code through the debugging interface.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution, Information Disclosure, Control Flow Manipulation
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Remote Debugging in Production:** **Absolutely ensure remote debugging features are completely disabled in production builds.** This is the most critical mitigation.
