# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/hermes

## Threat: [JavaScript Engine Vulnerability Exploitation (Critical)](./threats/javascript_engine_vulnerability_exploitation__critical_.md)

*   **Threat:** JavaScript Engine Vulnerability Exploitation
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts and injects malicious JavaScript code into the application. This code exploits a vulnerability within Hermes's core components like the parser, compiler, or runtime engine during the execution process. The attacker might leverage publicly known vulnerabilities or discover zero-day exploits.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the user's device with the privileges of the application. This can lead to complete device compromise, data theft, malware installation, and unauthorized actions.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The malicious code causes Hermes to crash, become unresponsive, or consume excessive resources, rendering the application unusable.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Vulnerabilities might allow the attacker to bypass security boundaries and leak sensitive data from the application's memory or the device's environment.
*   **Hermes Component Affected:** Parser, Compiler, Interpreter/Runtime Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Hermes to the latest stable version provided by Facebook.
    *   Implement secure JavaScript coding practices, including input validation and sanitization.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing focusing on JavaScript execution.

## Threat: [Hermes-Specific Bug Exploitation (High)](./threats/hermes-specific_bug_exploitation__high_.md)

*   **Threat:** Hermes-Specific Bug Exploitation
*   **Description:**  Hermes, being a relatively newer JavaScript engine, might contain unique bugs or implementation flaws not present in more mature engines. An attacker could discover and exploit these Hermes-specific vulnerabilities. These bugs could be related to Hermes's optimizations, bytecode generation, or specific features.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unforeseen Vulnerabilities:** Exploitation of Hermes-specific bugs can lead to unexpected security issues, including RCE, DoS, or information disclosure, that are distinct from common JavaScript engine vulnerabilities.
    *   **Exploitation of Hermes Optimizations:** Attackers might find ways to manipulate or abuse Hermes's performance optimizations to trigger vulnerabilities or create unintended behavior.
*   **Hermes Component Affected:** Hermes Core (specific implementation details, optimizations, bytecode generation)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Actively monitor the Hermes community and issue trackers for reported bugs and vulnerabilities.
    *   Perform Hermes-specific security testing, focusing on unique aspects like bytecode and optimizations.
    *   Use conservative feature adoption, prioritizing well-tested and established Hermes features.
