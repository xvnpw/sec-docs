# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/hermes

## Threat: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Hermes VM](./threats/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_in_hermes_vm.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious JavaScript code that exploits vulnerabilities within the Hermes virtual machine (VM), such as buffer overflows or use-after-free errors. This could be achieved by providing unexpected inputs or triggering specific code paths within the engine.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution within the application's process, allowing the attacker to gain full control, steal sensitive data, or cause a denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Hermes VM core runtime.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Hermes updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Report any potential crashes or unexpected behavior to the Hermes development team for investigation.
*   Consider fuzzing Hermes with various inputs to identify potential vulnerabilities during development.

## Threat: [Type Confusion Exploits in Hermes](./threats/type_confusion_exploits_in_hermes.md)

**Description:** An attacker might leverage weaknesses in Hermes' type system to cause the engine to misinterpret the type of a variable or object. This could lead to unexpected behavior or allow access to memory that should not be accessible.

**Impact:**  This could result in information disclosure, unexpected program behavior, or potentially arbitrary code execution depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Hermes type system and object model.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Hermes updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Adhere to strict typing practices in JavaScript code to minimize the likelihood of type-related issues.
*   Utilize static analysis tools to detect potential type-related errors in the JavaScript codebase.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution via Hermes JavaScript Execution](./threats/prototype_pollution_via_hermes_javascript_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate JavaScript prototypes to inject malicious properties into built-in JavaScript objects or application-defined objects. This can be achieved through vulnerabilities in the application's code or potentially through weaknesses in Hermes' prototype handling.

**Impact:** This could lead to various security issues, including bypassing security checks, modifying application behavior, or even achieving remote code execution in certain scenarios.

**Affected Component:** Hermes' JavaScript execution environment and prototype chain handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid directly modifying prototypes of built-in objects unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
*   Implement safeguards against untrusted input being used to modify object properties.
*   Utilize linting tools and code reviews to identify potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization of Data from Native Code to Hermes (via Bridge)](./threats/insecure_deserialization_of_data_from_native_code_to_hermes__via_bridge_.md)

**Description:** If the application uses the bridge to pass data from native code to JavaScript running in Hermes, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could allow an attacker to inject malicious data that, when processed by Hermes, leads to unintended consequences. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in the data format or the deserialization logic.

**Impact:** This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution within the Hermes environment or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Hermes bridge interface and data deserialization mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use secure and well-defined data serialization formats (e.g., JSON with schema validation).
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on data received from native code before processing it in Hermes.
*   Avoid deserializing complex objects directly from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Data Passed from Hermes to Native Code (via Bridge)](./threats/insecure_handling_of_data_passed_from_hermes_to_native_code__via_bridge_.md)

**Description:** If data passed from JavaScript running in Hermes to native modules is not properly sanitized or validated, it could introduce vulnerabilities in the native code. An attacker could craft malicious JavaScript code to send data that exploits weaknesses in the native module (e.g., buffer overflows in native code).

**Impact:** This could lead to arbitrary code execution within the native part of the application, potentially compromising the entire device or system.

**Affected Component:** Hermes bridge interface and data serialization mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization in the native modules that receive data from Hermes.
*   Use memory-safe languages or techniques in native modules to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows.
*   Define clear contracts and data formats for communication between Hermes and native code.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Native Functionality via Bridge Misconfiguration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_native_functionality_via_bridge_misconfiguration.md)

**Description:**  Developers might inadvertently expose sensitive or privileged native functions to JavaScript through the Hermes bridge without proper access controls. An attacker could then call these functions from JavaScript to perform unauthorized actions.

**Impact:** This could lead to privilege escalation, unauthorized access to system resources, or other security breaches depending on the exposed functionality.

**Affected Component:** Hermes bridge configuration and native module registration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and restrict the native functions exposed to JavaScript via the bridge.
*   Implement proper authorization and authentication mechanisms for sensitive native functions.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing the bridge interface.

## Threat: [Compiler Vulnerabilities Leading to Code Injection](./threats/compiler_vulnerabilities_leading_to_code_injection.md)

**Description:**  While less likely, vulnerabilities in Hermes' ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler could potentially be exploited by an attacker to inject malicious code during the compilation process. This would require a deep understanding of the compiler's internals.

**Impact:**  Successful exploitation could result in the execution of arbitrary code within the application's context.

**Affected Component:** Hermes AOT compiler.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Hermes updated to benefit from compiler bug fixes and security improvements.
*   Report any suspected compiler issues or unexpected code behavior to the Hermes development team.
