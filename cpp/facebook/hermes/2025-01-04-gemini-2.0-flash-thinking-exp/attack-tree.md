## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Hermes (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_hermes__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security due to weaknesses within the Hermes JavaScript engine or its ecosystem.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Hermes Engine (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_hermes_engine__critical_node_.md)

This category encompasses direct attacks targeting flaws within the Hermes engine's implementation. Successful exploitation here often leads to the most severe consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Memory Corruption (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/memory_corruption__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This involves exploiting bugs in Hermes's memory management to overwrite critical data structures, potentially leading to control flow hijacking and arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Memory Corruption for Code Execution (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_memory_corruption_for_code_execution__critical_node_.md)

This specific step signifies the attacker's ability to execute arbitrary code by exploiting a memory corruption vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Type Confusion (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/type_confusion__high-risk_path_.md)

By providing JavaScript code that tricks Hermes into misinterpreting the type of a variable, an attacker can trigger vulnerable operations based on incorrect type assumptions, potentially leading to memory safety issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Integer Overflow/Underflow (leading to HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/integer_overflowunderflow__leading_to_high-risk_path_.md)

Manipulating input to cause integer overflow or underflow in calculations within Hermes can lead to incorrect memory allocations or buffer overflows, enabling further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Overflow/Underflow for Memory Corruption or Control Flow Hijacking (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_overflowunderflow_for_memory_corruption_or_control_flow_hijacking__high-risk_path_.md)

This represents the successful exploitation of an integer overflow or underflow to compromise memory safety or control the program's execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Engine Implementation (leading to HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_engine_implementation__leading_to_high-risk_path_.md)

Discovering and triggering subtle flaws in the implementation of JavaScript features within Hermes can bypass security checks or cause unexpected and exploitable program behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerable Logic for Exploitation (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerable_logic_for_exploitation__high-risk_path_.md)

This step indicates the successful exploitation of a logic error to gain an advantage or compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in JIT Compilation (if enabled) (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_jit_compilation__if_enabled___high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

If Hermes uses Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation, vulnerabilities in the JIT compiler can allow attackers to inject malicious code directly into the generated machine code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Generated Machine Code (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_generated_machine_code__critical_node_.md)

This signifies the successful exploitation of a flaw in the JIT-compiled code, potentially leading to code injection or memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Hermes Bytecode Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_hermes_bytecode_handling__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on attacks targeting the compiled Hermes bytecode or the bytecode interpreter.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Bytecode (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_bytecode__critical_node_.md)

This involves tampering with the compiled bytecode to inject malicious instructions, allowing for direct manipulation of the application's logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Bytecode Interpreter (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_bytecode_interpreter__high-risk_path_.md)

Providing crafted bytecode that triggers bugs in the Hermes bytecode interpreter, such as stack overflows or incorrect handling of opcodes, can lead to exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Hermes Integration with React Native (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_hermes_integration_with_react_native__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This path targets the communication bridge between the JavaScript code running in Hermes and the native code of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads via the Bridge (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads_via_the_bridge__critical_node_.md)

Successfully sending unexpected data types or calling native functions with malicious arguments through the bridge can compromise the native side of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Bridge Communication (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_bridge_communication__high-risk_path_.md)

Manipulating serialized data passed over the bridge to trigger vulnerabilities in the deserialization process on the native side can lead to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies or Tooling Used with Hermes (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_or_tooling_used_with_hermes__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This category highlights the risks associated with the broader ecosystem surrounding Hermes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Environment (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_environment__critical_node_.md)

Gaining control over the development or build environment allows attackers to inject malicious code into the application during the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Vulnerabilities via Third-Party Libraries (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_vulnerabilities_via_third-party_libraries__critical_node_.md)

Exploiting known vulnerabilities or introducing backdoors through compromised third-party libraries used by the application can provide an entry point for attackers.
