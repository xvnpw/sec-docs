## Deep Dive Analysis: Prototype Pollution via Hermes JavaScript Execution

**Context:** We are analyzing the threat of Prototype Pollution within an application leveraging Facebook's Hermes JavaScript engine. This analysis is intended for the development team to understand the risks and implement effective mitigation strategies.

**Threat Summary:**  An attacker exploits the dynamic nature of JavaScript prototypes within the Hermes execution environment to inject malicious properties. This manipulation can affect built-in JavaScript objects or application-defined objects, leading to significant security vulnerabilities.

**Detailed Analysis:**

**1. Understanding Prototype Pollution in JavaScript:**

* **The Prototype Chain:** In JavaScript, objects inherit properties from their prototypes. This forms a chain, where an object first looks for a property on itself, then on its prototype, then on its prototype's prototype, and so on, until it reaches `Object.prototype`.
* **Pollution Mechanism:** Prototype pollution occurs when an attacker can modify the prototype of an object, particularly `Object.prototype` or other built-in object prototypes (e.g., `Array.prototype`, `String.prototype`). Any changes made to these prototypes are then inherited by all objects that inherit from them.
* **Exploitation:** Attackers typically target vulnerabilities in application code that allow them to dynamically set object properties based on user-controlled input. If this input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject property names like `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`, or `prototype` to traverse up the prototype chain and modify higher-level prototypes.

**2. Hermes-Specific Considerations:**

* **Hermes Architecture:** Hermes is an ahead-of-time (AOT) optimizing JavaScript engine designed for mobile applications, particularly React Native. While it aims for performance and efficiency, it still adheres to the core JavaScript language specifications, including prototype inheritance.
* **Potential Hermes-Specific Attack Surfaces:**
    * **JSI (JavaScript Interface):** If the application uses JSI to interact with native code, vulnerabilities in the native code that improperly handle JavaScript objects passed from Hermes could be exploited for prototype pollution. For example, if native code directly sets properties on JavaScript objects without proper validation.
    * **Hermes' Internal Optimizations:** While not inherently a vulnerability, certain optimizations within Hermes might have unintended consequences if prototype pollution occurs. For instance, if Hermes aggressively caches properties based on the prototype chain, polluted prototypes could lead to unexpected behavior in optimized code paths.
    * **Third-Party Libraries:** Applications using Hermes often rely on third-party JavaScript libraries. Vulnerabilities within these libraries that allow prototype pollution can directly impact the application running on Hermes.
* **Research Needs:**  It's crucial to actively monitor for any reported vulnerabilities specifically related to prototype pollution within the Hermes engine itself. While the core concept is language-level, specific implementations might have unique attack vectors or mitigation challenges.

**3. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

* **Direct Manipulation via Vulnerable Code:**  The most common scenario involves application code that directly uses user-controlled input to set object properties without proper validation.
    * **Example:**  `object[userInputKey] = userInputValue;`  If `userInputKey` is `__proto__.isAdmin`, this could pollute `Object.prototype`.
* **Exploiting Third-Party Libraries:** Vulnerable libraries might contain code that allows prototype pollution. If the application uses such a library, the vulnerability can be indirectly exploited.
* **Deserialization Issues:** If the application deserializes data (e.g., JSON) from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, malicious payloads could be crafted to pollute prototypes during the deserialization process.
* **Template Engines:** If the application uses template engines and allows user-controlled data to be rendered without proper escaping, it might be possible to inject code that manipulates prototypes.

**4. Impact Analysis (Expanding on the provided description):**

* **Bypassing Security Checks:**
    * **Authentication Bypass:**  Polluting `Object.prototype` with a property like `isAdmin: true` could potentially bypass authentication checks if the application relies on this property being present on user objects.
    * **Authorization Bypass:**  Similar to authentication, modifying prototypes could grant unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.
* **Modifying Application Behavior:**
    * **Data Manipulation:**  Polluting prototypes of data structures (e.g., arrays, objects) could lead to unexpected data modifications or corruption.
    * **Logic Alteration:**  If the application relies on specific methods or properties of built-in objects, polluting their prototypes could alter the application's core logic.
    * **UI Manipulation:** In React Native applications, prototype pollution could potentially affect how components render or behave.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most severe potential impact. While less direct in many cases, it can be achieved in scenarios where:
    * **Vulnerable Functions are Polluted:** If a critical function (e.g., a function used for executing commands) is accessed through the prototype chain, polluting its prototype could inject malicious code.
    * **Exploiting Built-in Functionality:**  In some cases, polluting prototypes of built-in functions (though often heavily protected) could be leveraged to execute arbitrary code. This is highly dependent on the specific JavaScript engine and its security mechanisms.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While less likely to be the primary goal, prototype pollution could lead to unexpected errors or infinite loops, potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**5. Detection Strategies (More Granular Approach):**

* **Static Code Analysis (SAST):**
    * **Linters with Prototype Pollution Rules:** Configure linters (like ESLint with relevant plugins) to identify potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities, such as direct assignments to `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`.
    * **Custom Static Analysis Rules:** Develop custom rules to detect patterns where user input is used to dynamically set object properties without proper validation.
* **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**
    * **Fuzzing with Prototype Pollution Payloads:**  Use DAST tools to inject various prototype pollution payloads into application inputs and observe the application's behavior for anomalies.
    * **Runtime Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to detect unexpected modifications to object prototypes during runtime.
* **Manual Code Reviews:**
    * **Focus on Input Handling:** Pay close attention to code sections that handle user input, external data, or deserialization processes.
    * **Identify Dynamic Property Access:** Look for instances where object properties are set dynamically using variables derived from user input.
    * **Review Third-Party Library Usage:**  Investigate how third-party libraries handle object properties and if they have known prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
* **Runtime Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to periodically check the integrity of critical object prototypes and alert if unexpected modifications are detected.

**6. Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies (Expanding on the provided list):**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization (Crucial):**
    * **Whitelist Allowed Properties:**  Instead of blacklisting potentially dangerous properties, define a strict whitelist of allowed property names.
    * **Sanitize User Input:**  Remove or escape potentially malicious characters from user input before using it to set object properties.
    * **Type Checking:**  Ensure that the types of values being assigned to object properties are as expected.
* **Avoid Direct Prototype Modification (Best Practice):**
    * **Favor Object.create(null):** When creating objects that shouldn't inherit from `Object.prototype`, use `Object.create(null)`.
    * **Use Object.defineProperty:**  For more controlled property definitions, use `Object.defineProperty` with appropriate flags (e.g., `writable: false`, `configurable: false`).
* **Object Immutability Techniques:**
    * **Object.freeze():**  Freeze objects to prevent any modifications to their properties. This can be applied to critical configuration objects or data structures.
    * **Object.seal():** Seal objects to prevent adding or deleting properties, although existing properties can still be modified if they are writable.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Avoid granting unnecessary permissions or access that could be exploited for prototype pollution.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Stay Updated:** Keep Hermes and all dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP) (For Web Contexts):**  While not directly preventing prototype pollution, CSP can help mitigate the impact of certain exploitation techniques, such as preventing the execution of inline scripts injected through prototype pollution.
* **Consider Using Secure Alternatives:**  In some cases, alternative data structures or programming paradigms might be less susceptible to prototype pollution.
* **Regularly Review and Update Mitigation Strategies:**  The threat landscape is constantly evolving, so it's important to regularly review and update mitigation strategies based on new vulnerabilities and best practices.

**7. Developer Guidance and Actionable Steps:**

* **Educate Developers:** Ensure the development team understands the risks and mechanisms of prototype pollution.
* **Implement Static Analysis Tools:** Integrate linters with prototype pollution rules into the development workflow.
* **Conduct Thorough Code Reviews:**  Specifically focus on identifying potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities during code reviews.
* **Prioritize Input Validation:**  Make input validation and sanitization a core part of the development process.
* **Test for Prototype Pollution:**  Include specific test cases to verify that the application is resistant to prototype pollution attacks.
* **Establish a Security Champion:** Designate a security champion within the team to stay informed about security best practices and emerging threats.
