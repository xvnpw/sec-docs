# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/hermes

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Hermes Engine](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities_in_hermes_engine.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in Hermes's memory management can lead to vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, or dangling pointers.
    *   **How Hermes Contributes:** As the runtime environment for JavaScript, Hermes directly manages memory for JavaScript objects and execution stacks. Bugs in this management can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted JavaScript string or array operation could trigger a buffer overflow in Hermes's internal data structures.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's process, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep Hermes updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for known vulnerabilities. Utilize memory-safe coding practices in any native modules interacting with Hermes. Report any potential memory corruption issues found during development or testing to the Hermes project. Implement robust testing and fuzzing of JavaScript code executed by Hermes.

## Attack Surface: [Type Confusion Issues](./attack_surfaces/type_confusion_issues.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting weaknesses in Hermes's type system to cause the engine to treat an object of one type as another, leading to unexpected behavior or memory corruption.
    *   **How Hermes Contributes:** Hermes's optimized type system, while enhancing performance, might have edge cases or vulnerabilities that can be triggered by specific JavaScript code patterns.
    *   **Example:**  Crafting JavaScript code that manipulates object prototypes or uses specific language features in a way that causes Hermes to misinterpret the type of an object during an operation.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or unexpected program behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep Hermes updated. Thoroughly test JavaScript code, especially when dealing with dynamic types and object manipulation. Be cautious when using advanced or less common JavaScript features that might expose type system vulnerabilities. Report any suspected type confusion issues to the Hermes project.

## Attack Surface: [Integer Overflow/Underflow in Hermes Internals](./attack_surfaces/integer_overflowunderflow_in_hermes_internals.md)

*   **Description:**  Arithmetic operations within Hermes's internal code, particularly when dealing with array indices, memory allocation sizes, or loop counters, could result in integer overflows or underflows.
    *   **How Hermes Contributes:**  Hermes performs numerous arithmetic operations during JavaScript execution and memory management. Errors in these operations can lead to exploitable conditions.
    *   **Example:**  JavaScript code that creates extremely large arrays or triggers operations that involve large numerical calculations within Hermes, potentially leading to an integer overflow that wraps around to a small value, causing unexpected memory access.
    *   **Impact:**  Memory corruption, unexpected program behavior, or potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep Hermes updated. Be aware of potential integer overflow issues when designing native modules that interact with Hermes and handle sizes or indices. Implement checks for potential overflow conditions in critical parts of the native integration.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Hermes's Built-in Functions](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_hermes's_built-in_functions.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or security flaws within the implementation of standard JavaScript built-in functions provided by Hermes (e.g., `parseInt`, `JSON.parse`, array methods).
    *   **How Hermes Contributes:** Hermes provides the implementation of these core JavaScript functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these implementations are directly attributable to Hermes.
    *   **Example:** A bug in Hermes's `JSON.parse` implementation could allow for parsing of specially crafted JSON strings that lead to unexpected behavior or even code execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Unexpected program behavior, data corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep Hermes updated. Be aware of known vulnerabilities in built-in functions and avoid relying on potentially problematic functionalities without thorough testing. Report any suspicious behavior or crashes related to built-in functions to the Hermes project.

## Attack Surface: [Bytecode Injection](./attack_surfaces/bytecode_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker finding a way to inject malicious Hermes bytecode directly into the application's execution flow, bypassing the normal JavaScript parsing and compilation process.
    *   **How Hermes Contributes:** Hermes compiles JavaScript to bytecode for efficient execution. If this bytecode can be manipulated, it can lead to direct control over the engine's behavior.
    *   **Example:** If the application loads bytecode from an untrusted source or if there's a vulnerability that allows writing to the bytecode cache, an attacker could inject malicious bytecode.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution within the application's process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Ensure that Hermes bytecode is loaded from trusted sources only. Implement integrity checks for bytecode to prevent tampering. Protect the bytecode cache from unauthorized access or modification. Avoid dynamic generation or loading of bytecode from untrusted inputs.
