## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Hermes](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_hermes.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Hermes Releases:** Actively track new releases and security patches for the Hermes JavaScript engine on the official GitHub repository: [https://github.com/facebook/hermes](https://github.com/facebook/hermes). Subscribe to release notifications or regularly check the repository's releases page.
    2.  **Review Security Changelogs:** When a new Hermes version is available, meticulously review the release notes and changelogs, paying close attention to any mentions of security fixes, vulnerability patches, or bug resolutions that could have security implications.
    3.  **Staging Environment Testing:** Before deploying a Hermes update to production, thoroughly test the new version in a staging environment that mirrors your production setup. Conduct regression testing and security testing to ensure compatibility and identify any potential issues introduced by the update.
    4.  **Production Update Rollout:** Plan and execute the Hermes update in your production environment during a scheduled maintenance window. Follow established deployment procedures to minimize downtime and ensure a smooth transition. Have a rollback strategy prepared in case of unforeseen problems after the update.
    5.  **Version Tracking:** Maintain a clear record of the Hermes version currently used in your application and the dates of updates. This documentation is crucial for vulnerability tracking and dependency management.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities within the Hermes engine - Severity: High
    *   Exposure to unpatched zero-day vulnerabilities in Hermes (reduced timeframe) - Severity: High
    *   Performance issues within Hermes that could be exploited for denial-of-service - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities within the Hermes engine: High reduction - Directly eliminates known security flaws addressed in newer Hermes versions.
    *   Exposure to unpatched zero-day vulnerabilities in Hermes: Medium reduction - Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit zero-day vulnerabilities by staying up-to-date.
    *   Performance issues within Hermes that could be exploited for denial-of-service: Low reduction - Indirectly improves resilience by incorporating performance optimizations from Hermes updates.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - We have a general dependency update process, but it's not specifically prioritized for Hermes security updates and is not consistently frequent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  We need a dedicated, proactive process for monitoring Hermes releases and prioritizing security-related updates. This includes:
    *   Automated alerts for new Hermes releases.
    *   Designated team member responsible for reviewing Hermes security changelogs.
    *   Faster update cycle for Hermes, especially for security patches, potentially monthly or even more frequently for critical fixes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Bytecode Verification (if available and recommended by Hermes)](./mitigation_strategies/enable_bytecode_verification__if_available_and_recommended_by_hermes_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Hermes Documentation Review:** Consult the official Hermes documentation and any relevant security advisories to confirm if bytecode verification is a supported and recommended security feature. Understand the specific implementation and any performance implications.
    2.  **Build Configuration Adjustment:** If bytecode verification is available, modify your application's build process to enable it. This might involve specific compiler flags, build settings within your development environment, or Hermes-specific configuration options.
    3.  **Testing with Verification Enabled:** Thoroughly test your application in a testing environment with bytecode verification activated. Verify that the application functions as expected and that bytecode verification is indeed operational. Measure any performance overhead introduced by this feature and optimize if necessary.
    4.  **Production Deployment with Verification:** Ensure that all production builds of your application are compiled and deployed with bytecode verification enabled.
    5.  **Monitoring for Verification Failures:** Implement monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect any instances of bytecode verification failures in production. Investigate and address any failures immediately as they could indicate bytecode corruption or malicious activity.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Execution of tampered or modified Hermes bytecode - Severity: High
    *   Execution of malicious bytecode injected by an attacker - Severity: High
    *   Code injection attacks targeting the Hermes bytecode loading process - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Execution of tampered or modified Hermes bytecode: High reduction - Prevents the execution of bytecode that has been altered after compilation, ensuring code integrity.
    *   Execution of malicious bytecode injected by an attacker: High reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of executing attacker-supplied malicious bytecode, as verification would likely fail.
    *   Code injection attacks targeting the Hermes bytecode loading process: High reduction - Makes bytecode injection attacks substantially more difficult to execute successfully.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Bytecode verification is not currently enabled. We haven't yet investigated its availability and implementation within our Hermes setup.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Research and confirm the availability and suitability of Hermes bytecode verification for our application.
    *   If applicable, implement the necessary build process modifications to enable bytecode verification.
    *   Establish testing and monitoring procedures for bytecode verification failures in all environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Isolate Hermes JavaScript Execution Environment](./mitigation_strategies/isolate_hermes_javascript_execution_environment.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Hermes:** Design your application architecture so that the Hermes JavaScript runtime operates with the absolute minimum privileges necessary. Avoid granting excessive permissions to the JavaScript environment.
    2.  **Sandboxing Techniques:** Employ sandboxing techniques to isolate the Hermes process from sensitive parts of the application and the underlying operating system. This could involve operating system-level sandboxing (e.g., containers, process namespaces) or application-level sandboxing libraries.
    3.  **Restricted Native API Access (within Hermes Context):**  Limit the capabilities and permissions granted to JavaScript code *within the Hermes environment* to interact with native modules and APIs.  Ensure that only necessary and safe native functionalities are accessible from JavaScript.
    4.  **Resource Quotas (Hermes Specific):** Implement resource limits and quotas specifically for the Hermes JavaScript engine (e.g., memory limits, CPU time limits). This prevents resource exhaustion attacks originating from JavaScript code running within Hermes.
    5.  **Secure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) (if used with Hermes):** If IPC is used for communication between Hermes and other parts of the application, ensure that IPC channels are secure, properly authenticated, and data exchanged is validated and sanitized.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Sandbox escape vulnerabilities within the Hermes engine itself - Severity: High
    *   Privilege escalation originating from the Hermes JavaScript environment - Severity: High
    *   Lateral movement within the application after compromising the Hermes runtime - Severity: High
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks originating from JavaScript code running in Hermes - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Sandbox escape vulnerabilities within the Hermes engine itself: High reduction - Limits the potential damage of a sandbox escape by restricting the capabilities of the isolated environment.
    *   Privilege escalation originating from the Hermes JavaScript environment: High reduction - Prevents or significantly hinders privilege escalation by limiting the initial privileges of the Hermes runtime.
    *   Lateral movement within the application after compromising the Hermes runtime: High reduction - Restricts an attacker's ability to move to other parts of the application after compromising the JavaScript environment.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks originating from JavaScript code running in Hermes: Medium reduction - Resource limits help prevent resource exhaustion, but might not eliminate all DoS possibilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - We use containerization for deployment, which provides some OS-level isolation. However, fine-grained application-level sandboxing and Hermes-specific resource quotas are not explicitly configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Evaluate and implement application-level sandboxing specifically for the Hermes runtime within our containerized environment.
    *   Define and enforce resource limits and quotas tailored to the Hermes JavaScript engine.
    *   Conduct a security review of our current isolation setup to assess its effectiveness in protecting against Hermes-related threats.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control Access to Native Modules and APIs (Exposed to Hermes)](./mitigation_strategies/control_access_to_native_modules_and_apis__exposed_to_hermes_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Native API Surface Area for Hermes:**  Thoroughly review all native modules and APIs that are exposed and accessible to JavaScript code running within the Hermes engine. Remove any modules or APIs that are not absolutely essential for the application's core functionality. Apply the principle of least privilege.
    2.  **Secure Native API Design (Hermes Context):** Design native APIs exposed to Hermes with security as a primary consideration. Avoid creating APIs that could be easily misused or exploited from JavaScript. Implement robust input validation, sanitization, and output encoding within the native code to prevent injection vulnerabilities and other common issues.
    3.  **Access Control within Hermes Bridge:** Implement access control mechanisms to restrict which JavaScript code running within Hermes can access specific native modules or APIs. This could involve permissions systems, role-based access control, or other authorization methods enforced at the bridge between JavaScript and native code.
    4.  **Security Audits of Native Modules (Hermes Focused):** Conduct regular security reviews and code audits specifically targeting the native modules and APIs exposed to Hermes. Look for potential vulnerabilities, insecure coding practices, and areas for security improvement in these modules.
    5.  **Documentation and Secure Usage Guidelines (for Native APIs used by Hermes):**  Document all native modules and APIs exposed to Hermes, including their intended purpose, security considerations, potential risks, and secure usage guidelines for developers writing JavaScript code that interacts with these APIs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities within native modules accessible from Hermes - Severity: High
    *   Abuse of native APIs exposed to Hermes for malicious actions - Severity: High
    *   Injection attacks through native API interfaces exposed to Hermes - Severity: High
    *   Privilege escalation through vulnerable or misused native modules accessible from Hermes - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of vulnerabilities within native modules accessible from Hermes: High reduction - Minimizing exposed modules and securing existing ones reduces the attack surface and potential for exploitation via native code.
    *   Abuse of native APIs exposed to Hermes for malicious actions: High reduction - Careful API design and access control prevent misuse of native functionalities from JavaScript.
    *   Injection attacks through native API interfaces exposed to Hermes: High reduction - Input validation and sanitization in native code directly mitigate injection vulnerabilities at the JavaScript-native boundary.
    *   Privilege escalation through vulnerable or misused native modules accessible from Hermes: High reduction - Restricting access and securing native modules limits the potential for privilege escalation originating from JavaScript.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - We have a defined set of native modules, but the security review process and minimization efforts specifically focused on the Hermes context are not consistently applied. Input validation in native modules is implemented in some areas but may be inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Conduct a dedicated review of all native modules and APIs currently exposed to Hermes to identify and remove any unnecessary ones.
    *   Establish a standardized and enforced security review and code audit process specifically for native modules used with Hermes.
    *   Strengthen and standardize input validation and sanitization across all native API interfaces accessible from Hermes.
    *   Explore and implement access control mechanisms to further restrict access to native modules from JavaScript code within the Hermes environment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Quotas (Specifically for Hermes)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_quotas__specifically_for_hermes_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Hermes Resource Consumption Points:** Analyze the application's JavaScript code running within Hermes and the native modules it interacts with to pinpoint areas where excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory, execution time) might occur, especially in response to untrusted user input or external data.
    2.  **Hermes Execution Timeouts:** Implement timeouts specifically for JavaScript execution within the Hermes engine. This prevents long-running scripts from consuming excessive CPU time and blocking other application operations. Utilize Hermes's built-in mechanisms for setting execution time limits if available.
    3.  **Hermes Memory Limits:** Configure memory limits specifically for the Hermes JavaScript heap and overall process memory usage. This prevents memory exhaustion attacks and limits the impact of memory leaks within the JavaScript code running in Hermes.
    4.  **Rate Limiting for Hermes-Triggered Actions:** Implement rate limiting for API calls, resource-intensive native operations, or external requests initiated by JavaScript code running within Hermes. This prevents abuse and DoS attacks by limiting the frequency of actions triggered from JavaScript.
    5.  **Hermes Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor resource consumption metrics (CPU usage, memory usage, execution times) specifically for the Hermes process or runtime environment. Set up alerts to detect when resource limits are approached or exceeded, indicating potential DoS attacks or resource leaks within the JavaScript context.
    6.  **Hermes-Specific Error Handling and Recovery:** Implement robust error handling in both JavaScript and native code to gracefully manage resource limit violations within the Hermes environment. Provide informative error messages (without revealing sensitive details) and implement recovery mechanisms to prevent application crashes or instability due to resource exhaustion in Hermes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks through resource exhaustion within the Hermes runtime - Severity: High
    *   Resource leaks in JavaScript code running in Hermes leading to DoS - Severity: Medium
    *   Uncontrolled loops or recursive functions in JavaScript within Hermes causing resource exhaustion - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks through resource exhaustion within the Hermes runtime: High reduction - Resource limits directly prevent resource exhaustion caused by malicious or inefficient JavaScript code running in Hermes.
    *   Resource leaks in JavaScript code running in Hermes leading to DoS: Medium reduction - Memory limits help contain the impact of resource leaks within the Hermes environment, but might not fully prevent them over extended periods.
    *   Uncontrolled loops or recursive functions in JavaScript within Hermes causing resource exhaustion: High reduction - Timeouts effectively prevent uncontrolled loops and recursion in JavaScript from causing DoS within the Hermes runtime.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - We have basic timeouts for network requests initiated from JavaScript. Implicit memory and CPU limits are provided by the container environment, but not specifically configured for Hermes.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicitly configure and fine-tune resource limits (CPU time, memory) specifically for the Hermes JavaScript engine.
    *   Implement granular timeouts for JavaScript execution within Hermes beyond just network requests.
    *   Implement rate limiting for resource-intensive operations triggered by JavaScript code running in Hermes.
    *   Set up dedicated monitoring and alerting for Hermes resource consumption metrics.
    *   Improve error handling for resource limit violations within Hermes to enhance user experience and prevent application instability.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Bytecode Storage and Delivery (Hermes Bytecode)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_bytecode_storage_and_delivery__hermes_bytecode_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Secure Storage Location for Hermes Bytecode:** Store Hermes bytecode files in a secure location on the server or device where the application is deployed. Restrict access to this location to only authorized processes and users. Avoid storing bytecode in publicly accessible directories.
    2.  **Encryption at Rest for Hermes Bytecode:** Consider encrypting Hermes bytecode files at rest to protect them from unauthorized access if the storage medium is compromised. Use strong encryption algorithms and manage encryption keys securely.
    3.  **Secure Delivery Channels for Hermes Bytecode:** If bytecode is delivered over a network (e.g., downloading updates), use HTTPS or other secure protocols to encrypt the communication channel and prevent interception and tampering during transit.
    4.  **Integrity Checks (Hashing) for Hermes Bytecode:** Generate cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-256) of Hermes bytecode files and store these hashes securely. Before loading bytecode, verify its integrity by recalculating the hash and comparing it to the stored hash. This detects any unauthorized modifications to the bytecode.
    5.  **Code Signing for Hermes Bytecode:** Implement code signing for Hermes bytecode files. This involves digitally signing the bytecode with a private key and verifying the signature using a corresponding public key during loading. Code signing provides both integrity and authenticity assurance for the Hermes bytecode.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Tampering of Hermes bytecode files - Severity: High
    *   Substitution of Hermes bytecode with malicious code - Severity: High
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive Hermes bytecode - Severity: Medium
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks during Hermes bytecode delivery - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Tampering of Hermes bytecode files: High reduction - Integrity checks and code signing prevent execution of modified Hermes bytecode.
    *   Substitution of Hermes bytecode with malicious code: High reduction - Integrity checks and code signing ensure that only authentic bytecode from a trusted source is executed by Hermes.
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive Hermes bytecode: Medium reduction - Secure storage and encryption at rest make it harder for unauthorized parties to access and potentially analyze bytecode.
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks during Hermes bytecode delivery: High reduction - HTTPS and secure delivery channels prevent tampering and interception of bytecode during network transmission.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Hermes bytecode is packaged within the application, offering some obscurity. Delivery is over HTTPS. Integrity checks and code signing are not specifically implemented for Hermes bytecode.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement integrity checks (hashing) for Hermes bytecode files during application startup to detect tampering.
    *   Explore and implement code signing for Hermes bytecode to enhance authenticity and integrity assurance.
    *   Evaluate the feasibility and benefits of encrypting Hermes bytecode at rest, especially for sensitive applications.
    *   Review and strengthen access controls to the bytecode storage location on servers and devices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Bytecode Exposure (Hermes Bytecode)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_bytecode_exposure__hermes_bytecode_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Internal Packaging of Hermes Bytecode:** Package Hermes bytecode files within the application's binary or resource files in a manner that makes them less readily accessible to end-users or potential attackers. Avoid storing bytecode in easily accessible external files or directories.
    2.  **Bytecode Obfuscation (for Hermes Bytecode - Limited Effectiveness):** Consider applying bytecode obfuscation techniques specifically to the Hermes bytecode to make it more challenging to reverse engineer or understand. However, recognize that obfuscation is not a strong security measure and can be bypassed by determined attackers.
    3.  **Dynamic Bytecode Generation (Advanced - for Hermes):** In advanced scenarios, explore the possibility of generating Hermes bytecode dynamically at runtime instead of storing pre-compiled bytecode. This adds complexity but can reduce the static attack surface by making it harder to extract bytecode files.
    4.  **Avoid Direct Exposure of Hermes Bytecode in URLs/APIs:**  Ensure that Hermes bytecode files are never directly exposed through public URLs or APIs. Prevent situations where users or external systems can directly request or download bytecode files.
    5.  **Security through Obscurity (Secondary Measure for Hermes Bytecode):** While not a primary security strategy, minimizing bytecode exposure can add a layer of "security through obscurity" by making it slightly more difficult for casual attackers to access and analyze the Hermes bytecode.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Reverse engineering of application logic from Hermes bytecode - Severity: Medium
    *   Analysis of Hermes bytecode for potential vulnerabilities - Severity: Medium
    *   Extraction and modification of Hermes bytecode for malicious purposes - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Reverse engineering of application logic from Hermes bytecode: Low reduction - Minimizing exposure makes reverse engineering slightly more difficult, but determined attackers can still analyze bytecode.
    *   Analysis of Hermes bytecode for potential vulnerabilities: Low reduction - Obscurity might slightly hinder vulnerability analysis, but security should not rely on obscurity.
    *   Extraction and modification of Hermes bytecode for malicious purposes: Low reduction - Minimizing exposure makes extraction slightly harder, but doesn't prevent determined attackers from eventually accessing it.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Hermes bytecode is packaged within the application's assets and is not directly exposed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Evaluate the feasibility and benefits of bytecode obfuscation specifically for Hermes bytecode, understanding its limitations as a security measure.
    *   Further investigate techniques to enhance bytecode packaging robustness against extraction, if deemed necessary for our security posture.
    *   Continuously ensure that Hermes bytecode is never directly exposed through public URLs or APIs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debugging Features in Production (Hermes Debugging)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debugging_features_in_production__hermes_debugging_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Conditional Compilation/Configuration for Hermes Debugging:** Utilize conditional compilation or build configurations to completely disable Hermes-specific debugging features (e.g., remote debugging, Hermes inspector access, verbose debug logging within Hermes) in production builds of the application.
    2.  **Runtime Checks for Hermes Debugging:** Implement runtime checks within the application to verify that Hermes debugging features are indeed disabled in production environments. If debugging features are accidentally enabled, the application should detect this and disable them or potentially fail to start to prevent insecure configurations.
    3.  **Secure Build Pipeline for Hermes:** Integrate the disabling of Hermes debugging features into the automated build pipeline to ensure that production builds are consistently created without these debugging capabilities.
    4.  **Separate Development/Production Builds (Hermes Context):** Maintain distinct build configurations and environments for development, testing, and production. Ensure that Hermes debugging features are only enabled in development and testing environments, and strictly disabled in production builds.
    5.  **Regular Security Audits (Verification of Disabled Hermes Debugging):** Periodically audit production builds and deployments to verify that Hermes debugging features are indeed disabled and that no accidental enabling has occurred due to configuration errors or deployment issues.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Remote debugging vulnerabilities in Hermes - Severity: High
    *   Information leakage through verbose Hermes debug logs in production - Severity: Medium
    *   Exposure of internal Hermes runtime state through debugging interfaces in production - Severity: High
    *   Potential bypass of security controls through Hermes debugging features in production - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote debugging vulnerabilities in Hermes: High reduction - Disabling remote debugging eliminates the risk of remote debugging vulnerabilities in production environments.
    *   Information leakage through verbose Hermes debug logs in production: Medium reduction - Disabling debug logging reduces the risk of accidental information disclosure in production logs.
    *   Exposure of internal Hermes runtime state through debugging interfaces in production: High reduction - Disabling debugging interfaces prevents attackers from potentially accessing sensitive internal runtime state in production.
    *   Potential bypass of security controls through Hermes debugging features in production: High reduction - Disabling debugging features prevents attackers from potentially bypassing security controls using debugging tools intended for development.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Hermes debugging features are disabled in production builds through our build configurations.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Add runtime checks to explicitly verify that Hermes debugging features are disabled in production and trigger an alert or fail-safe mechanism if they are unexpectedly enabled.
    *   Enhance our build pipeline to include automated checks to confirm that Hermes debugging features are disabled in production builds before deployment.
    *   Include verification of disabled Hermes debugging features as part of regular security audits of production deployments.
