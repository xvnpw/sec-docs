### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Cause Deserialization Vulnerabilities on the Native Side

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

Deserialization is the process of converting data that has been serialized (e.g., into a string or byte stream) back into its original object or data structure. When the native side of an application receives data from JavaScript, it often needs to deserialize this data to work with it. If this deserialization process is not handled securely, it can introduce significant vulnerabilities.

The core issue arises when the data being deserialized is controlled by an attacker. Maliciously crafted serialized data can be designed to exploit flaws in the deserialization logic, leading to unintended consequences.

**Potential Attack Vectors:**

Several scenarios could lead to malicious data being deserialized on the native side:

* **Passing Complex Objects from JavaScript:** Hermes allows passing complex JavaScript objects to the native side. If the native side blindly deserializes these objects without proper validation, an attacker could craft a malicious object that triggers a vulnerability during deserialization.
* **Data Received from External Sources (via JavaScript):**  JavaScript code might fetch data from external sources (e.g., APIs, user input) and pass it to the native side. If this data is serialized and the native side deserializes it without sanitization, it becomes a potential attack vector.
* **State Persistence:** If the application persists state information by serializing data on the JavaScript side and deserializing it on the native side upon restart or later use, manipulating this persisted data could lead to vulnerabilities.
* **Inter-Process Communication (IPC):** If the native side communicates with other processes via serialized data passed through JavaScript, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could be exploited.

**How the Attack Might Work:**

1. **Attacker Crafts Malicious Data:** The attacker crafts a specially designed serialized payload (e.g., a JSON string or a custom binary format) within the JavaScript environment. This payload is designed to exploit a weakness in the native deserialization logic.

2. **Data is Passed to the Native Side:** The malicious payload is passed from the JavaScript side to the native side through a bridge or interface provided by the application.

3. **Insecure Deserialization on the Native Side:** The native code attempts to deserialize the received data. Vulnerabilities can arise in several ways:
    * **Lack of Input Validation:** The native code doesn't validate the structure, type, or content of the incoming data before deserialization. This allows the attacker to inject unexpected data types or values.
    * **Type Confusion:** The attacker crafts data that tricks the deserialization process into instantiating objects of unexpected types. This can lead to method calls on attacker-controlled objects, potentially executing arbitrary code.
    * **Instantiation of Arbitrary Objects:**  The deserialization process might allow the instantiation of arbitrary classes or objects based on the data received. If the attacker can control the class being instantiated, they might be able to instantiate malicious classes with harmful side effects.
    * **Exploiting Library Vulnerabilities:** If the native side uses a third-party library for deserialization, vulnerabilities within that library could be exploited through crafted input.

4. **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If the deserialization vulnerability is severe enough, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the native side. This means the attacker can execute any code they want with the privileges of the application process.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of a successful deserialization attack on the native side can be catastrophic:

* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This is the most severe consequence, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
* **Data Breaches:** The attacker could access sensitive data stored or processed by the native application.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Maliciously crafted data could crash the application or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.
* **Privilege Escalation:** If the native application runs with elevated privileges, the attacker could leverage the vulnerability to gain those privileges.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, especially if the application interacts with external systems, a deserialization vulnerability could be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent and mitigate deserialization vulnerabilities on the native side, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data received from the JavaScript side before deserialization. This includes checking data types, formats, and ranges. Implement whitelisting of expected values rather than blacklisting.
* **Secure Deserialization Practices:**
    * **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data:** If possible, avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources altogether.
    * **Use Safe Deserialization Libraries:**  If deserialization is necessary, use libraries that are designed with security in mind and have a good track record of handling untrusted input.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the deserialization process runs with the minimum necessary privileges.
    * **Consider Alternative Data Transfer Methods:** Explore alternative ways to pass data between JavaScript and native code that don't involve serialization and deserialization of complex objects, such as passing primitive types or using well-defined APIs.
* **Type Safety and Strict Typing:**  Utilize strong typing in the native code to prevent type confusion vulnerabilities during deserialization.
* **Sandboxing and Isolation:**  Isolate the native code that handles deserialization in a sandbox environment to limit the impact of a successful attack.
* **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, specifically focusing on the deserialization logic and data flow between JavaScript and native code.
* **Dependency Management:** Keep all third-party libraries used for deserialization up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement robust error handling and logging to detect and respond to potential deserialization attacks.
* **Consider Data Integrity Checks:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of the data being passed between JavaScript and native code to detect tampering.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path "Cause Deserialization Vulnerabilities on the Native Side" represents a significant security risk for applications using Hermes. The potential for arbitrary code execution makes this a critical vulnerability that must be addressed proactively. By understanding the mechanisms of deserialization, potential attack vectors, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation. Prioritizing secure coding practices, thorough input validation, and careful selection of deserialization libraries are crucial steps in securing the application against this type of attack.
