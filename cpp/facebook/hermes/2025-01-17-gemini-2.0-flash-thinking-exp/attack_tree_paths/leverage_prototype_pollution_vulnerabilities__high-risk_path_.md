### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Leverage Prototype Pollution Vulnerabilities

**Description:**

This attack path focuses on exploiting the dynamic nature of JavaScript prototypes to inject malicious properties or functions into built-in objects (like `Object.prototype`, `Array.prototype`, etc.) or other objects within the application's scope. By modifying these prototypes, an attacker can influence the behavior of all objects inheriting from them, potentially leading to widespread and subtle vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details:**

In JavaScript, objects inherit properties and methods from their prototypes. When a property is accessed on an object, the JavaScript engine first checks the object itself. If the property is not found, it traverses up the prototype chain until it finds the property or reaches the end of the chain (usually `null`).

Prototype pollution occurs when an attacker can modify the prototype of an object, particularly the root prototype (`Object.prototype`). Any property added to `Object.prototype` becomes accessible to all JavaScript objects in the application. This allows attackers to:

* **Inject malicious properties:**  Add properties that are unexpectedly accessed by the application's logic, leading to incorrect behavior or security breaches.
* **Overwrite existing properties:** Modify the behavior of built-in methods or application-specific functions by overwriting properties on prototypes.
* **Introduce backdoor functionality:**  Add functions to prototypes that can be called later to execute arbitrary code or manipulate data.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider the following vulnerable code snippet:

```javascript
function setProperty(obj, path, value) {
  const parts = path.split('.');
  let current = obj;
  for (let i = 0; i < parts.length - 1; i++) {
    if (!current[parts[i]]) {
      current[parts[i]] = {};
    }
    current = current[parts[i]];
  }
  current[parts[parts.length - 1]] = value;
}

const user = {};
const userInput = '__proto__.isAdmin';
const maliciousValue = true;

setProperty(user, userInput, maliciousValue);

console.log(({}).isAdmin); // Output: true
```

In this example, the `setProperty` function is vulnerable because it doesn't prevent setting properties on the `__proto__` object. By providing a malicious `path` like `__proto__.isAdmin`, the attacker can inject the `isAdmin` property onto `Object.prototype`. Now, any newly created object will inherit this `isAdmin` property, potentially bypassing authorization checks or altering application logic.

**Attack Vectors in a Hermes Application:**

Several potential attack vectors could lead to prototype pollution in an application using Hermes:

* **Manipulation of User-Provided JSON or Objects:** If the application parses user-provided JSON or objects without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties with malicious values.
* **Vulnerable Dependencies:** Third-party libraries or dependencies used by the application might contain prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
* **Server-Side JavaScript Injection:** In scenarios where server-side JavaScript is used (e.g., with Node.js backend interacting with the Hermes frontend), vulnerabilities in the server-side code could lead to prototype pollution that affects the client-side application.
* **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** Deserializing untrusted data without proper validation can allow attackers to construct objects with malicious prototype modifications.
* **Exploiting DOM Manipulation Vulnerabilities:** In web-based applications using Hermes (e.g., within a WebView in React Native), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities could be leveraged to manipulate the DOM and inject malicious JavaScript that pollutes prototypes.

**Impact Assessment:**

The impact of a successful prototype pollution attack can be significant and far-reaching:

* **Authentication and Authorization Bypass:**  Injecting properties like `isAdmin` or modifying authentication-related functions on prototypes can allow attackers to bypass security checks and gain unauthorized access.
* **Data Manipulation:**  Modifying prototypes of data structures can lead to unexpected data corruption or manipulation, potentially affecting application logic and data integrity.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Polluting prototypes with properties that cause errors or infinite loops can lead to application crashes or performance degradation.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, attackers might be able to inject functions into prototypes that can be triggered to execute arbitrary code.
* **Information Disclosure:**  Modifying prototypes can allow attackers to intercept or access sensitive information that is being processed by the application.
* **Subtle and Difficult-to-Debug Errors:** Prototype pollution can introduce subtle bugs that are hard to track down, as the behavior of seemingly unrelated parts of the application might be affected.

**Hermes-Specific Considerations:**

While Hermes aims for JavaScript compatibility, it's important to consider any specific optimizations or behaviors that might influence prototype pollution:

* **Performance Optimizations:** Hermes's focus on performance might involve specific optimizations related to object property access and prototype chains. Understanding these optimizations is crucial for analyzing the exploitability and impact of prototype pollution.
* **JavaScript Standard Compliance:**  Hermes generally adheres to JavaScript standards, meaning the fundamental mechanisms of prototype pollution are likely to be present.
* **Security Focus:**  While not explicitly designed as a security-focused engine, any inherent security features or limitations within Hermes could potentially affect the attack surface. Further investigation into Hermes's internals regarding object creation and property lookup would be beneficial.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing prototype pollution requires a multi-layered approach:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input, especially when parsing JSON or objects. Prevent the use of `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` in input data.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  For web-based applications using Hermes in WebViews, implement a strong CSP to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities that could lead to prototype pollution.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Avoid Dynamic Property Access:** Minimize the use of bracket notation (`obj[variable]`) with untrusted input as the property name.
    * **Object Freezing:**  Use `Object.freeze()` or `Object.seal()` to prevent modifications to critical objects and their prototypes.
    * **Immutable Data Structures:** Consider using immutable data structures where modifications create new objects instead of altering existing ones.
    * **Avoid `eval()` and `Function()`:**  These functions can be exploited to inject arbitrary code, including prototype pollution attacks.
* **Dependency Management:**  Keep dependencies up-to-date and regularly audit them for known vulnerabilities, including prototype pollution. Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
* **Object Creation Best Practices:**  When creating objects, consider using `Object.create(null)` for objects where prototype inheritance is not needed, preventing access to `Object.prototype`.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities in the application.
* **Runtime Protection Mechanisms:** Explore using runtime protection libraries or techniques that can detect and prevent prototype modifications.
* **Hermes-Specific Security Considerations:** Stay informed about any security recommendations or best practices specific to developing applications with Hermes.

**Detection and Monitoring:**

Detecting prototype pollution can be challenging due to its subtle nature. Consider the following:

* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement logging to track object modifications and property assignments, especially those involving `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`.
* **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor application behavior for unexpected changes in object properties or functionality that might indicate prototype pollution.
* **Security Testing:** Include specific test cases for prototype pollution vulnerabilities in your security testing suite.
* **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools that can identify potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities in the codebase.

### 5. Conclusion

Prototype pollution is a significant security risk for applications using JavaScript, including those built with Hermes. The dynamic nature of prototypes allows attackers to inject malicious properties and functions, potentially leading to severe consequences like authentication bypass, data manipulation, and even remote code execution.

A proactive approach is crucial to mitigate this risk. This involves implementing robust input validation, adhering to secure coding practices, carefully managing dependencies, and employing detection and monitoring mechanisms. Understanding the specific characteristics of the Hermes engine and staying updated on security best practices for Hermes development will further strengthen the application's defenses against prototype pollution attacks. By diligently addressing this vulnerability, development teams can significantly enhance the security and reliability of their Hermes-based applications.
