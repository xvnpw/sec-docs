### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Send Malicious Data that the Native Code Doesn't Sanitize

**Attack Path Description:** This attack path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the native code of an application that arise from a failure to properly sanitize data received from the JavaScript environment managed by the Hermes engine. An attacker can craft malicious input within the JavaScript code that, when passed to the native layer, triggers unintended and potentially harmful behavior due to the lack of input validation and sanitization.

**Detailed Breakdown:**

* **Attack Vector:** The attacker leverages the ability to influence data that is passed from the JavaScript environment (executed by Hermes) to the native code. This could involve:
    * **Directly manipulating variables or arguments passed to native functions.**
    * **Crafting specific data structures (e.g., objects, arrays) that, when processed by the native code, expose vulnerabilities.**
    * **Exploiting APIs or interfaces that facilitate communication between Hermes and native code.**

* **Vulnerable Component:** The vulnerability lies within the **native code**. This code is responsible for handling data received from the JavaScript environment. The lack of sanitization means that the native code directly processes the received data without verifying its format, content, or size.

* **Mechanism of Exploitation:**  The attacker sends malicious data that exploits weaknesses in how the native code handles input. This can manifest in several ways:
    * **Buffer Overflows:** Sending data larger than the allocated buffer in the native code, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions and allowing for arbitrary code execution.
    * **Format String Bugs:** Injecting format specifiers (e.g., `%s`, `%x`) into strings passed to functions like `printf` in the native code, allowing for information disclosure or arbitrary code execution.
    * **Injection Vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection in native code interacting with databases):**  While less common in direct Hermes-native interactions, if the native code uses the received data to construct queries or commands without proper escaping, it could lead to injection attacks.
    * **Integer Overflows/Underflows:** Sending values that cause integer variables in the native code to wrap around, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    * **Path Traversal:** If the native code uses the received data to construct file paths without proper validation, an attacker could access or modify files outside the intended directory.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending data that causes the native code to crash or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service.

* **Impact Assessment:** The potential impact of successfully exploiting this vulnerability can be severe:
    * **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker could gain complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
    * **Data Breach:** Sensitive data processed or stored by the native code could be accessed or exfiltrated.
    * **Data Corruption:** Malicious input could lead to the corruption of data managed by the native code.
    * **Denial of Service:** The application could become unavailable due to crashes or resource exhaustion.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** If the native code runs with elevated privileges, the attacker could gain those privileges.

* **Example Scenario:** Consider a native function that receives a string from JavaScript representing a filename to be opened. If the native code doesn't sanitize this filename, an attacker could send a string like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` leading to unauthorized access to sensitive system files.

**Hermes Specific Considerations:**

* **Hermes's Role:** Hermes is responsible for executing the JavaScript code. The attacker would craft the malicious data within the JavaScript environment.
* **Data Passing Mechanisms:** Understanding how Hermes passes data to the native code is crucial. This might involve specific APIs or data structures defined by the application.
* **Type Conversion:**  Potential vulnerabilities could arise during the conversion of data types between JavaScript and the native environment. For example, unexpected behavior could occur if a JavaScript number is interpreted as a different type in the native code without proper validation.
* **JSI (JavaScript Interface):** If the application uses JSI to interact with native code, understanding the specific JSI bindings and how data is marshalled is essential for identifying potential attack vectors.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Validation and Sanitization in Native Code:** This is the most critical mitigation. The native code **must** validate and sanitize all data received from the JavaScript environment. This includes:
    * **Type Checking:** Verify that the received data is of the expected type.
    * **Range Checking:** Ensure numerical values are within acceptable limits.
    * **Length Checks:** Prevent buffer overflows by verifying the size of strings and other data structures.
    * **Format Validation:** Ensure data conforms to the expected format (e.g., email addresses, URLs).
    * **Encoding and Decoding:** Handle character encoding correctly to prevent injection attacks.
    * **Escaping Special Characters:**  Escape characters that have special meaning in the context of how the data is used (e.g., in database queries or shell commands).
* **Secure Coding Practices in Native Code:** Follow secure coding guidelines to minimize vulnerabilities:
    * **Avoid using unsafe functions:**  Replace functions known to be prone to vulnerabilities (e.g., `strcpy`, `sprintf`) with safer alternatives (e.g., `strncpy`, `snprintf`).
    * **Use memory-safe languages or libraries:** If feasible, consider using languages or libraries that provide automatic memory management and bounds checking.
    * **Minimize the attack surface:** Only expose necessary native functions to the JavaScript environment.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the native code runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful attack.
* **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Regularly review the native code for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to automatically generate and send various inputs to the native code to identify potential crashes or unexpected behavior.
* **Consider a Secure Data Passing Layer:** Implement a well-defined and secure layer for passing data between Hermes and native code, with built-in validation and sanitization mechanisms.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While primarily focused on web contexts, if the application involves web views or similar components, CSP can help mitigate certain types of attacks.

**Challenges and Considerations:**

* **Complexity of Native Code:** Native code can be complex and harder to audit for security vulnerabilities compared to JavaScript.
* **Performance Overhead:** Implementing thorough input validation can introduce performance overhead. Balancing security and performance is crucial.
* **Maintaining Consistency:** Ensuring consistent validation and sanitization across all interfaces between Hermes and native code is essential.
* **Evolution of Attack Techniques:** Attackers are constantly developing new techniques. Continuous monitoring and updates are necessary.

**Conclusion:**

The attack path "Send Malicious Data that the Native Code Doesn't Sanitize" represents a significant security risk for applications using the Hermes JavaScript engine. The lack of proper input validation in the native code can lead to a wide range of vulnerabilities with potentially severe consequences. A strong focus on secure coding practices, particularly robust input validation and sanitization within the native code, is paramount to mitigating this risk. Development teams must prioritize security audits, code reviews, and testing to identify and address these vulnerabilities proactively. Understanding the specific interaction mechanisms between Hermes and the native code is crucial for implementing effective mitigation strategies.
