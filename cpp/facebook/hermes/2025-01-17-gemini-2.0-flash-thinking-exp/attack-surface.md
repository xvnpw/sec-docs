## Attack Surface: [Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Hermes JavaScript engine itself.](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_within_the_hermes_javascript_engine_itself.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Hermes JavaScript engine itself. This could involve memory corruption bugs, type confusion issues, or other flaws in the engine's implementation.
    * **How Hermes Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Hermes *is* the execution environment for JavaScript code. Bugs within its core logic can be directly exploited by malicious JavaScript.
    * **Example:** A crafted JavaScript payload triggers a buffer overflow in Hermes's bytecode interpreter, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code on the device.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, application crash, information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Hermes updated to the latest version, as updates often include security patches.
        * Report any suspected Hermes engine bugs to the Facebook Hermes team.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any data that influences JavaScript execution paths, even if it seems internal.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure interaction between JavaScript code running in Hermes and native code through the JavaScript bridge.](./attack_surfaces/insecure_interaction_between_javascript_code_running_in_hermes_and_native_code_through_the_javascrip_f6412b0c.md)

**Description:** Insecure interaction between JavaScript code running in Hermes and native code through the JavaScript bridge. This can occur if the bridge itself has vulnerabilities or if data passed between the two environments is not handled securely, leading to exploitable conditions within Hermes's interaction layer.
    * **How Hermes Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Hermes provides the mechanism for JavaScript to interact with native code. Vulnerabilities in the bridge implementation within Hermes become exploitable through JavaScript execution.
    * **Example:** A vulnerability in Hermes's bridge implementation allows malicious JavaScript to manipulate internal data structures when calling a native function, leading to a crash or potentially code execution within the Hermes context.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary native code execution (if the vulnerability bridges into native code), application crash, potential for sandbox escape.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly audit and secure the Hermes JavaScript bridge implementation.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization on data passed through the bridge in both directions.
        * Use secure serialization/deserialization techniques for data exchange between JavaScript and native code.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) attacks caused by malicious JavaScript code consuming excessive resources *within the Hermes engine*.](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_caused_by_malicious_javascript_code_consuming_excessive_resources_wi_5ef010e4.md)

**Description:** Denial of Service (DoS) attacks caused by malicious JavaScript code consuming excessive resources *within the Hermes engine*.
    * **How Hermes Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Hermes executes the JavaScript code. If the engine doesn't have sufficient safeguards against resource-intensive scripts, it can be overwhelmed, even without direct interaction with native modules.
    * **Example:** Malicious JavaScript creates an infinite loop or allocates extremely large data structures *within the JavaScript heap managed by Hermes*, causing Hermes to consume excessive CPU or memory, making the application unresponsive.
    * **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability for legitimate users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement timeouts and resource limits for JavaScript execution within Hermes.
        * Carefully review and test JavaScript code for potential performance issues and resource consumption that could overwhelm the engine.
        * Consider using techniques like web workers to isolate potentially resource-intensive tasks and limit their impact on the main Hermes instance.
