# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/hermes

## Threat: [Execution of Malicious JavaScript Code](./threats/execution_of_malicious_javascript_code.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject or introduce malicious JavaScript code into the application's codebase or through a compromised dependency. This code would then be executed by the **Hermes engine**. The attacker might aim to steal sensitive data, manipulate the application's behavior, or gain unauthorized access to device resources.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions within the application, potential compromise of the user's device, denial of service.

**Affected Hermes Component:** JavaScript Engine

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust code review processes.
* Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
* Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) where applicable to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
* Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Sanitize and validate any user-provided input that could influence JavaScript execution.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Hermes JavaScript Engine Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploitation_of_hermes_javascript_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers could discover and exploit inherent vulnerabilities within the **Hermes JavaScript engine** itself. This could involve triggering bugs that allow for arbitrary code execution, memory corruption, or bypassing security restrictions within the engine.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, application crashes, denial of service, potential compromise of the underlying operating system.

**Affected Hermes Component:** JavaScript Engine

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the **Hermes engine** to the latest stable version, incorporating security patches.
* Monitor security advisories and bug reports related to the **Hermes** project.
* Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) if the application has a web-facing component that could be used to deliver exploits.

## Threat: [Insecure JSI (JavaScript Interface) Usage](./threats/insecure_jsi__javascript_interface__usage.md)

**Description:** If the application uses the JavaScript Interface (JSI) to interact with native code, vulnerabilities can arise from insecurely implemented native modules or improper handling of data passed between JavaScript (executed by **Hermes**) and native layers. An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary native code or access sensitive native resources.

**Impact:** Remote code execution in the native environment, access to sensitive device functionalities, data breaches.

**Affected Hermes Component:** JSI Bridge

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement secure coding practices in native modules, including thorough input validation and output encoding.
* Minimize the surface area of the JSI bridge by only exposing necessary native functionalities.
* Perform rigorous security testing of the native modules and the JSI communication layer.
* Avoid passing sensitive data directly through the JSI bridge without proper encryption or sanitization.

## Threat: [Type Confusion or Memory Corruption Bugs due to Hermes Optimizations](./threats/type_confusion_or_memory_corruption_bugs_due_to_hermes_optimizations.md)

**Description:** **Hermes** employs various optimizations to improve performance. However, bugs in these optimizations could potentially lead to type confusion or memory corruption vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit for arbitrary code execution or denial of service.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, application crashes, unpredictable behavior.

**Affected Hermes Component:** JavaScript Engine (Optimizer)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Rely on the security testing and patching efforts of the **Hermes** development team.
* Thoroughly test the application with different **Hermes** versions and configurations.
* Report any suspected bugs or unexpected behavior to the **Hermes** project.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Hermes Bytecode (Less Likely, More Complex)](./threats/manipulation_of_hermes_bytecode__less_likely__more_complex_.md)

**Description:** While less likely in typical scenarios, an advanced attacker might attempt to manipulate the **Hermes** bytecode directly after it has been generated but before execution. This could involve modifying the bytecode to inject malicious logic or alter the application's behavior.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, bypassing security checks, complete control over the application's execution.

**Affected Hermes Component:** Bytecode Interpreter

**Risk Severity:** High (due to potential impact, though likelihood is lower)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement integrity checks on the application's resources, including the **Hermes** bytecode.
* Secure the storage and delivery mechanisms for the application's code.
* Employ code signing to verify the authenticity and integrity of the application.
