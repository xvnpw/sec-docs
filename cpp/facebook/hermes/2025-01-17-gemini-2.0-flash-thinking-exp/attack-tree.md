## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Hermes Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_hermes_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, representing a successful breach of the application's security through vulnerabilities in the Hermes JavaScript engine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code in Application Context (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_in_application_context__critical_node_.md)

This is the primary objective, allowing the attacker to run their own code within the application's environment, potentially gaining full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Hermes JavaScript Engine Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_hermes_javascript_engine_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

This broad category encompasses attacks that target flaws within the Hermes engine itself, leading to various forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_memory_corruption_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

These attacks exploit errors in how Hermes manages memory, potentially allowing attackers to overwrite critical data or control program execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Malicious JavaScript Input (High-Risk Path, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/provide_malicious_javascript_input__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This is the initial action taken by the attacker to trigger memory corruption or other vulnerabilities by crafting specific JavaScript code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Input to Cause Buffer Overflow (High-Risk Path, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_input_to_cause_buffer_overflow__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Providing JavaScript input that exceeds the allocated buffer size, overwriting adjacent memory regions and potentially hijacking control flow.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Input to Cause Use-After-Free (High-Risk Path, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_input_to_cause_use-after-free__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Providing JavaScript input that leads to accessing memory after it has been freed, potentially allowing the attacker to control the contents of that memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft Input to Cause Type Confusion (High-Risk Path, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/craft_input_to_cause_type_confusion__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

Providing JavaScript input that tricks the engine into misinterpreting the type of a variable, leading to unexpected behavior and potential memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Prototype Pollution Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_prototype_pollution_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Missing Input Validation on the Native Side (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_missing_input_validation_on_the_native_side__high-risk_path_.md)

Taking advantage of situations where the native code does not properly validate data received from JavaScript.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malicious Data that the Native Code Doesn't Sanitize (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_data_that_the_native_code_doesn't_sanitize__high-risk_path_.md)
