## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known RocksDB Vulnerabilities - CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_rocksdb_vulnerabilities_-_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:** Leverage publicly disclosed CVEs (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs) in the RocksDB library.
* **Description:** Attackers exploit known security flaws in the RocksDB code. These vulnerabilities can potentially allow for arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the application.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the age of the RocksDB version and patching cadence).
* **Impact:** High (Potentially arbitrary code execution, complete system compromise).
* **Effort:** Medium (If public exploits exist), High (If requiring custom exploit development).
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate (To use existing exploits), Advanced/Expert (For exploit development).
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (IDS/IPS might detect some exploit attempts, but targeted exploits can be stealthy).

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) by Exhausting Memory - CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__by_exhausting_memory_-_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:** Write large amounts of data to RocksDB without proper cleanup or triggering operations that consume excessive memory.
* **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the server's memory by forcing RocksDB to allocate excessive amounts of RAM. This can lead to crashes, slowdowns, and ultimately a denial of service.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (Relatively straightforward to execute if write limits are not in place).
* **Impact:** Medium (Application downtime, service disruption).
* **Effort:** Low to Medium (Requires ability to send write requests).
* **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Spikes in memory usage, slow performance).

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) by Exhausting Disk Space - CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__by_exhausting_disk_space_-_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:** Repeatedly write data to RocksDB leading to excessive disk usage.
* **Description:** Attackers fill up the disk space allocated to RocksDB by continuously writing data. This can prevent RocksDB from functioning correctly and lead to application downtime.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (Similar to memory exhaustion).
* **Impact:** Medium (Application downtime, service disruption).
* **Effort:** Low to Medium.
* **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Disk space alerts, slow performance).

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection-like Attacks on Key/Value Operations - CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection-like_attacks_on_keyvalue_operations_-_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:** Craft input that, when used as a key or value in RocksDB operations by the application, leads to unintended data access or modification.
* **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the application constructs RocksDB keys or values based on user input. By injecting malicious data, they can potentially read or modify data they are not authorized to access.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (If application doesn't properly sanitize input for key/value operations).
* **Impact:** Medium to High (Data breach, unauthorized access, data modification).
* **Effort:** Low to Medium (Similar to SQL injection techniques).
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected with proper input validation logging and anomaly detection).

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Application-Level Access Controls - CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_application-level_access_controls_-_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploit flaws in how the application enforces permissions on data stored in RocksDB.
* **Description:** Attackers find ways to circumvent the application's authorization mechanisms, allowing them to access or manipulate data that should be restricted.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the complexity and robustness of the application's access control logic).
* **Impact:** Medium to High (Unauthorized access to sensitive data).
* **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of the application's authorization mechanisms).
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Auditing access patterns and detecting unauthorized access attempts).

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Excessive Read Operations - CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_excessive_read_operations_-_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:** Force the application to perform a large number of read operations on RocksDB, overloading the database.
* **Description:** Attackers manipulate the application to generate a high volume of read requests to RocksDB, causing performance degradation or a complete denial of service.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (If application exposes endpoints that can trigger many reads).
* **Impact:** Medium (Application slowdown, potential downtime).
* **Effort:** Low to Medium (Requires ability to make requests to the application).
* **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (High read I/O, slow response times).

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Excessive Write Operations - CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_excessive_write_operations_-_critical_node.md)

**Attack Vector:** Force the application to perform a large number of write operations on RocksDB, overwhelming the database.
* **Description:** Attackers manipulate the application to generate a high volume of write requests to RocksDB, potentially leading to performance degradation, disk space exhaustion, or a denial of service.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (Similar to excessive reads).
* **Impact:** Medium (Application slowdown, potential downtime, disk space exhaustion).
* **Effort:** Low to Medium.
* **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (High write I/O, disk space usage increase).
