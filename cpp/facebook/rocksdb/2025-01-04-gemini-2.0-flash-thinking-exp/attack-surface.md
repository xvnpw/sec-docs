# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/rocksdb

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Default Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_default_configuration.md)

**Description:** Relying on default RocksDB configuration options without understanding their security implications.

**How RocksDB Contributes:** RocksDB has numerous configuration options, some of which have security implications if left at their defaults.

**Example:**  The default file permissions for RocksDB data files are too permissive, allowing unauthorized local users to read or modify the database directly.

**Impact:** Data breaches due to unauthorized access, data corruption or loss due to unauthorized modification.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Review and configure RocksDB options according to security best practices.
*   Set appropriate file permissions for RocksDB data directories and files.
*   Consider enabling encryption at rest.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption through Native API Misuse](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_through_native_api_misuse.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly using RocksDB's C++ API in the application's native code, leading to memory corruption vulnerabilities.

**How RocksDB Contributes:** RocksDB is a C++ library, and its API requires careful memory management.

**Example:** The application's native code incorrectly handles memory allocated by RocksDB, leading to buffer overflows or use-after-free vulnerabilities when interacting with iterators or reading data.

**Impact:** Application crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution if memory corruption is exploitable.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices when interacting with RocksDB's native API.
*   Use memory-safe wrappers or abstractions if possible.
*   Thoroughly test native code integrations, including fuzzing.

## Attack Surface: [File System Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Insufficient protection of the file system where RocksDB stores its data.

**How RocksDB Contributes:** RocksDB stores its data in files on the file system.

**Example:**  If the RocksDB data directory is accessible to unauthorized users or processes, an attacker could directly modify or delete database files, leading to data corruption or loss.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict file system permissions for the RocksDB data directory to only the necessary processes and users.
*   Consider using file system encryption.
*   Regularly back up RocksDB data.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Snapshots/Backups](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_snapshotsbackups.md)

**Description:** RocksDB snapshots or backups are stored without adequate security measures.

**How RocksDB Contributes:** RocksDB provides mechanisms for creating snapshots and backups of the database.

**Example:** Database backups are stored on a network share with weak access controls, allowing unauthorized individuals to access sensitive data.

**Impact:** Data breaches due to unauthorized access to backup data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Encrypt backups and snapshots.
*   Implement strong access controls for backup storage locations.
*   Securely transfer backups to offsite locations.
