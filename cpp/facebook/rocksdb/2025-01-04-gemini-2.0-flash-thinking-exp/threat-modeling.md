# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/rocksdb

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Bugs in Write Path](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_bugs_in_write_path.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting bugs within RocksDB's write path (e.g., during memtable flushing or WAL writing) can lead to data corruption. This could involve crafting specific data payloads or exploiting race conditions within RocksDB's internal mechanisms.

**Impact:**  Data stored in RocksDB becomes inconsistent, unreliable, or completely lost, leading to application malfunctions and data integrity issues.

**Affected Component:**  Write Path (including MemTable, Write Ahead Log (WAL), SST file writing).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update to the latest stable version of RocksDB to benefit from bug fixes.
*   Thoroughly test the application's interaction with RocksDB, including edge cases that might trigger write path issues.
*   Consider using checksums and other data integrity features provided by RocksDB.

## Threat: [Data Corruption during Compaction](./threats/data_corruption_during_compaction.md)

**Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within RocksDB's compaction process (which merges and reorganizes SST files) can be exploited to introduce data corruption within the stored data. This might involve triggering specific compaction scenarios or exploiting race conditions during the merge process within RocksDB's compaction logic.

**Impact:**  Data within SST files becomes corrupted, leading to inconsistent reads and potential data loss, which can be difficult to detect and recover from.

**Affected Component:** Compaction Module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep RocksDB updated to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor compaction processes for errors and unusual behavior reported by RocksDB.
*   Implement regular backups to recover from potential corruption.
*   Consider using features like `verify_checksums_in_compaction` for added integrity checks within RocksDB's compaction process.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Memory)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__memory_.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting RocksDB's memory management by sending a large volume of write requests, potentially with unique keys, can cause the MemTable (in-memory buffer managed by RocksDB) to grow excessively, leading to out-of-memory errors and crashing the RocksDB instance.

**Impact:** The application becomes unavailable due to crashes or severe performance degradation of the RocksDB instance.

**Affected Component:** MemTable.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Configure appropriate `write_buffer_size` and `max_write_buffer_number` settings in RocksDB to limit MemTable growth.
*   Monitor memory usage of the RocksDB process.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (Disk Space)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__disk_space_.md)

**Description:**  Flooding RocksDB with write operations can cause the database files (SST files and WAL files managed by RocksDB) to grow rapidly and exhaust the available disk space, leading to RocksDB failing to write new data.

**Impact:** The application becomes unavailable as RocksDB fails to write new data.

**Affected Component:**  Storage Engine (SST files, WAL files).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Monitor disk space usage for the RocksDB data directory.
*   Configure appropriate data retention policies and potentially utilize features like Time-To-Live (TTL) if applicable within the application logic interacting with RocksDB.

## Threat: [Confidential Data Exposure through Unencrypted Storage](./threats/confidential_data_exposure_through_unencrypted_storage.md)

**Description:** If sensitive data is stored within RocksDB without utilizing its encryption at rest features, an attacker gaining access to the underlying file system or storage medium can directly read and access the confidential information stored in RocksDB's SST files.

**Impact:**  Confidential data is exposed, potentially leading to privacy breaches and regulatory violations.

**Affected Component:** Storage Engine (SST files).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize RocksDB's built-in encryption at rest features.
*   Ensure proper access controls and permissions are in place for the RocksDB data directory.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies.md)

**Description:** RocksDB relies on various third-party libraries (e.g., for compression). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise RocksDB itself.

**Impact:**  Potential for data corruption, denial of service, or even remote code execution within the RocksDB process, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:**  Various modules depending on the vulnerable dependency (e.g., Compression Module).

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability. Can be Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update RocksDB and its dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and manage known vulnerabilities within RocksDB's dependencies.
