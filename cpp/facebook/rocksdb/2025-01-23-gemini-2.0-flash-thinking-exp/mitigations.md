## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Checksums](./mitigation_strategies/enable_checksums.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Data Checksums
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Checksum Type:** Decide on a suitable checksum algorithm (e.g., `kCRC32c`, `kXXHash64`).
    2.  **Configure `BlockBasedTableOptions`:** In RocksDB options, set `BlockBasedTableOptions::checksumType` to your chosen algorithm.
    3.  **Configure `DBOptions` for Compaction Verification:** In `DBOptions`, set `DBOptions::verify_checksums_in_compaction` to `true`.
    4.  **Deploy and Monitor:** Deploy with these configurations and monitor RocksDB logs for checksum errors.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Corruption (High Severity):** Silent data corruption due to hardware failures, software bugs, or accidental modification.
    *   **Malicious Data Tampering (Medium Severity):** Detection of unauthorized data modifications at rest.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Corruption:** High reduction in risk.
    *   **Malicious Data Tampering:** Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in configuration files for RocksDB initialization.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation currently.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Effectively](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_write-ahead_logging__wal__effectively.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Effective Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `wal_dir`:** In `DBOptions`, set `DBOptions::wal_dir` to a dedicated directory (ideally separate storage).
    2.  **Choose WAL Write Mode:** Select appropriate WAL write mode in `DBOptions` (e.g., `WRITE_LOGGED`).
    3.  **Monitor WAL Size:** Implement monitoring to track WAL file size.
    4.  **Implement WAL Recycling/Purging:** Configure RocksDB's WAL recycling or implement a purging strategy.
    5.  **Regularly Review WAL Configuration:** Periodically review WAL settings.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Loss on Crash (High Severity):** Loss of recent writes before flush to SST files.
    *   **Data Inconsistency after Crash (High Severity):** Database corruption or inconsistent state after a crash.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Loss on Crash:** High reduction in risk.
    *   **Data Inconsistency after Crash:** High reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** `wal_dir` is configured within the data directory. WAL write mode is `WRITE_LOGGED`. Basic disk space monitoring exists.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Dedicated WAL size monitoring and explicit WAL recycling/purging strategy. Consider separate storage for `wal_dir`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption at Rest](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_at_rest.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Encryption at Rest
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose Encryption Provider:** Select a RocksDB-supported encryption provider.
    2.  **Generate and Securely Store Encryption Key:** Use a KMS/HSM for key management, *not* hardcoding keys.
    3.  **Configure `DBOptions` for Encryption:**
        *   Set `DBOptions::encryption_provider`.
        *   Provide the encryption key via the provider.
    4.  **Test Encryption:** Verify encryption by writing and reading data.
    5.  **Key Rotation Policy:** Implement a key rotation policy.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Breach due to Physical Storage Compromise (High Severity):** Unauthorized access if storage media is stolen.
    *   **Data Breach due to Insider Threat (Medium to High Severity):** Protection against unauthorized physical access by insiders.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach due to Physical Storage Compromise:** High reduction in risk.
    *   **Data Breach due to Insider Threat:** Medium to High reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No encryption at rest is implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement encryption at rest with a KMS/HSM and key rotation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_quotas.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** RocksDB Resource Limiting
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Resource Requirements:** Understand application's RocksDB resource needs.
    2.  **Configure `max_open_files`:** In `DBOptions`, set `DBOptions::max_open_files` to limit open files.
    3.  **Configure `write_buffer_size`:** In `DBOptions` or `ColumnFamilyOptions`, set `write_buffer_size` to control write buffer size.
    4.  **Configure `max_background_compactions` and `max_background_flushes`:** In `DBOptions`, limit background threads using `DBOptions::max_background_compactions` and `DBOptions::max_background_flushes`.
    5.  **Monitor Resource Usage:** Monitor RocksDB resource consumption.
    6.  **Adjust Limits as Needed:** Fine-tune limits based on monitoring and performance.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service due to Resource Exhaustion (Medium to High Severity):** RocksDB consuming excessive resources, causing performance issues or unavailability.
    *   **Resource Starvation for Other Processes (Medium Severity):** RocksDB starving other system processes of resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service due to Resource Exhaustion:** Medium to High reduction in risk.
    *   **Resource Starvation for Other Processes:** Medium reduction in risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** `max_open_files` and `write_buffer_size` are configured with defaults. `max_background_compactions` and `max_background_flushes` are default. No specific RocksDB resource monitoring.
