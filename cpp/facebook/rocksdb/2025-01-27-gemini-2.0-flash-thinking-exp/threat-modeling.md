# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/rocksdb

## Threat: [Unencrypted Data at Rest](./threats/unencrypted_data_at_rest.md)

Description: An attacker who gains physical access to the server or storage media where RocksDB data resides can directly read the unencrypted SST files and other RocksDB files. This could be achieved through server theft, compromised backups, or unauthorized access to data centers.
Impact: Full disclosure of sensitive application data, leading to privacy breaches, regulatory fines, reputational damage, and identity theft.
RocksDB Component Affected: Storage Engine (SST files, WAL, MANIFEST, CURRENT files on disk)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement application-level encryption before writing data to RocksDB.
    * Utilize operating system level disk encryption (e.g., LUKS, BitLocker) for volumes storing RocksDB data.
    * Secure physical access to servers and storage media.
    * Encrypt backups of RocksDB data.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification via File System Access](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification_via_file_system_access.md)

Description: An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the server and sufficient privileges can directly modify RocksDB data files (SST files, MANIFEST, etc.) on the file system, bypassing application-level access controls. This could be achieved through exploiting OS vulnerabilities or insider threats.
Impact: Data tampering, data corruption, unauthorized modification of application state, potential system compromise, and loss of data integrity.
RocksDB Component Affected: Storage Engine (SST files, MANIFEST, CURRENT files on disk), File System Permissions
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Restrict file system permissions on the RocksDB data directory to only the application user and necessary system processes using least privilege principles.
    * Implement strong access control mechanisms on the server and operating system.
    * Regularly audit file system permissions and access logs.
    * Employ intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block unauthorized access attempts.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

Description: An attacker can flood the application with excessive read or write requests, or craft specific requests that consume excessive RocksDB resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, disk space). This can overwhelm RocksDB and lead to performance degradation or complete service unavailability.
Impact: Application unavailability, performance degradation, service disruption, and potential system instability.
RocksDB Component Affected:  Request Handling (Read and Write paths), Resource Management (Memory Manager, Block Cache, Write Buffer)
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement rate limiting and request throttling in the application to prevent overwhelming RocksDB.
    * Monitor RocksDB resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, disk space) and set up alerts for abnormal consumption.
    * Properly configure RocksDB resource limits (e.g., `write_buffer_size`, `block_cache_size`, `max_open_files`) to prevent excessive resource consumption.
    * Ensure sufficient resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, disk space) are provisioned for the RocksDB instance based on expected load and potential attack scenarios.
    * Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent resource-intensive or malicious requests.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in RocksDB Codebase (e.g., Buffer Overflows, Memory Corruption)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_rocksdb_codebase__e_g___buffer_overflows__memory_corruption_.md)

Description: An attacker could exploit security vulnerabilities within RocksDB's C++ codebase, such as buffer overflows, memory corruption issues, or format string bugs. By crafting specific inputs or exploiting network interfaces (if exposed), an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server running RocksDB.
Impact: Full system compromise, remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and other severe security incidents.
RocksDB Component Affected: Core RocksDB Modules (C++ codebase in general, specific modules depending on the vulnerability)
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Stay updated with RocksDB security advisories and patch to the latest stable versions promptly.
    * Implement security best practices for the operating system and infrastructure where RocksDB is running (e.g., least privilege, network segmentation, firewalls).
    * Disable or restrict any unnecessary network interfaces or features of RocksDB if exposed (though RocksDB is primarily a library, certain configurations or wrappers might expose network interfaces).
    * Consider using security scanning tools (static and dynamic analysis) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the RocksDB codebase and its dependencies.
    * Implement Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP) on the operating system to mitigate exploitation of memory corruption vulnerabilities.
