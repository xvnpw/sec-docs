## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits - Disk Space Quotas](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_-_disk_space_quotas.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Disk Space Quotas (RocksDB Configuration)
**Description:**
1.  **Configuration:** Configure RocksDB's `max_total_wal_size` option. This option limits the total size of write-ahead log files, preventing unbounded WAL growth. Set this value based on available disk space and recovery requirements within RocksDB `Options`.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Disk Exhaustion DoS (High Severity):**  Malicious or unintentional excessive writes can fill up the disk due to uncontrolled WAL growth, causing RocksDB and the application to crash or become unresponsive.
**Impact:**
*   **Disk Exhaustion DoS:** High Reduction. Limits the potential for unbounded disk usage by WAL, directly mitigating disk exhaustion caused by RocksDB's internal processes.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Disk space monitoring is in place using system tools, and alerts are configured, but `max_total_wal_size` is not explicitly set in RocksDB options.
**Missing Implementation:** Configuration of `max_total_wal_size` in RocksDB options is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Memory Management - Block Cache Limits (RocksDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/memory_management_-_block_cache_limits__rocksdb_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Memory Management - Block Cache Limits (RocksDB Configuration)
**Description:**
1.  **Configuration:**  When creating `BlockBasedTableOptions`, configure `block_cache`. Set a reasonable size for the block cache based on available system memory and application needs within RocksDB configuration. Avoid unbounded block cache sizes.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Memory Exhaustion DoS (High Severity):**  Uncontrolled memory usage by the block cache within RocksDB can lead to system-wide memory exhaustion, causing application crashes or system instability.
**Impact:**
*   **Memory Exhaustion DoS:** Medium Reduction. Limits the memory consumed by the block cache, reducing the risk of memory exhaustion originating from RocksDB's cache management.
**Currently Implemented:** Implemented. `BlockBasedTableOptions` are configured with a fixed size block cache in the RocksDB initialization code.
**Missing Implementation:** No Missing Implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Memory Management - Write Buffer and Memtable Limits (RocksDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/memory_management_-_write_buffer_and_memtable_limits__rocksdb_configuration_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Memory Management - Write Buffer and Memtable Limits (RocksDB Configuration)
**Description:**
1.  **Configuration:** Configure `write_buffer_size` and `max_write_buffer_number` in `Options`. `write_buffer_size` controls the size of each memtable, and `max_write_buffer_number` limits the number of memtables before flushing to SST files. Set these values to control memory usage related to write operations within RocksDB configuration.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Memory Exhaustion DoS (High Severity):**  Excessive memory usage by write buffers and memtables within RocksDB, especially under heavy write load, can lead to memory exhaustion and application instability.
**Impact:**
*   **Memory Exhaustion DoS:** Medium Reduction. Limits memory consumption related to write operations within RocksDB, reducing the risk of memory exhaustion from this source.
**Currently Implemented:** Implemented. `write_buffer_size` and `max_write_buffer_number` are configured in `Options` during RocksDB initialization.
**Missing Implementation:** No Missing Implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Compaction Throttling](./mitigation_strategies/compaction_throttling.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Compaction Throttling (RocksDB Configuration)
**Description:**
1.  **Configuration:** Configure compaction related options in `Options` within RocksDB:
    *   `max_background_compactions`: Limit the number of concurrent background compaction threads.
    *   `level0_slowdown_writes_trigger`:  Set a threshold for the number of level 0 SST files that triggers write slowdown.
    *   `level0_stop_writes_trigger`: Set a threshold for the number of level 0 SST files that completely stops writes.
2.  **Tuning:**  Adjust these parameters based on workload and resource availability by modifying RocksDB configuration.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Compaction-Induced DoS (Medium Severity):**  Aggressive compaction within RocksDB can consume significant CPU and I/O resources, potentially impacting application performance and leading to DoS-like conditions, especially during peak write periods.
**Impact:**
*   **Compaction-Induced DoS:** Medium Reduction. Throttling compaction within RocksDB reduces the resource consumption of compaction processes, mitigating the risk of resource exhaustion caused by excessive compaction.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. `max_background_compactions` is configured, but `level0_slowdown_writes_trigger` and `level0_stop_writes_trigger` are using default values in RocksDB configuration.
**Missing Implementation:**  Tuning and explicit configuration of `level0_slowdown_writes_trigger` and `level0_stop_writes_trigger` based on workload analysis in RocksDB configuration is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Checksums](./mitigation_strategies/enable_checksums.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Data Checksums (RocksDB Configuration)
**Description:**
1.  **Configuration:** Ensure that `Options::checksum_type` is set to a non-`kNoChecksum` value (e.g., `kCRC32c`, `kXXHash64`) when initializing RocksDB. This enables checksum verification for data integrity within RocksDB.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Corruption (High Severity):**  Silent data corruption within RocksDB due to hardware failures, software bugs, or other issues can lead to incorrect data being read and processed, potentially causing application errors or security vulnerabilities.
**Impact:**
*   **Data Corruption:** High Reduction. Checksums within RocksDB provide a strong mechanism for detecting data corruption during reads and writes, significantly reducing the risk of using corrupted data from the database.
**Currently Implemented:** Implemented. `Options::checksum_type` is set to `kCRC32c` in the RocksDB configuration.
**Missing Implementation:** No Missing Implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Ensure WAL is Enabled](./mitigation_strategies/ensure_wal_is_enabled.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) (RocksDB Configuration)
**Description:**
1.  **Configuration:** Verify that WAL is enabled in `Options` within RocksDB.  Ensure `Options::wal_dir` is configured (or defaults to the data directory if not explicitly set). Avoid explicitly disabling WAL unless there is a very specific and well-understood reason within RocksDB configuration.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Loss on Crash (High Severity):**  If WAL is disabled or improperly configured in RocksDB, committed writes might be lost in case of application or system crashes, leading to data inconsistency and potential data integrity issues.
**Impact:**
*   **Data Loss on Crash:** High Reduction. WAL within RocksDB ensures durability by persisting write operations to disk before they are applied to the memtable. This significantly reduces the risk of data loss in case of crashes related to the database.
**Currently Implemented:** Implemented. WAL is enabled by default and `wal_dir` is implicitly configured by RocksDB.
**Missing Implementation:** No Missing Implementation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Encryption at Rest (Consideration - RocksDB Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/encryption_at_rest__consideration_-_rocksdb_feature_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Encryption at Rest (RocksDB Built-in Feature or External Integration)
**Description:**
1.  **Requirement Analysis:** Evaluate if encryption at rest is necessary based on the sensitivity of the data stored in RocksDB and the organization's security policies.
2.  **Encryption Method Selection:** Choose an appropriate encryption method. Consider using RocksDB's built-in encryption features if available and suitable.
3.  **Key Management:** Implement a secure key management system for storing and managing encryption keys used by RocksDB encryption. Keys should be protected from unauthorized access and backed up securely.
4.  **Performance Impact Assessment:**  Evaluate the performance impact of encryption within RocksDB. Encryption can introduce overhead. Test and tune encryption settings to minimize performance degradation.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Breach from Physical Media Compromise (High Severity):**  If storage media containing RocksDB data is physically stolen or compromised, encryption at rest within RocksDB protects the data from unauthorized access.
**Impact:**
*   **Data Breach from Physical Media Compromise:** High Reduction. Encryption at rest within RocksDB renders the data unreadable without the encryption keys, significantly mitigating the risk of data breaches in case of physical media compromise.
**Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. Encryption at rest is not currently enabled for RocksDB data.
**Missing Implementation:**  Encryption at rest needs to be implemented, potentially using RocksDB's built-in features or integrating external encryption solutions with RocksDB. This involves selecting an encryption method, configuring RocksDB for encryption, and implementing secure key management.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular RocksDB Updates and Vulnerability Management](./mitigation_strategies/regular_rocksdb_updates_and_vulnerability_management.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regular RocksDB Updates and Vulnerability Management
**Description:**
1.  **Monitoring Releases:** Subscribe to RocksDB release announcements, security mailing lists, and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases) to stay informed about new RocksDB releases and security vulnerabilities.
2.  **Vulnerability Assessment:** When new RocksDB versions or security advisories are released, assess their impact on your application's usage of RocksDB. Determine if any reported vulnerabilities affect your deployment.
3.  **Update Process:** Establish a process for testing and deploying RocksDB updates in a timely manner, especially security patches for RocksDB itself. Include testing in a staging environment before deploying to production.
4.  **Dependency Management:** Use dependency management tools to track and manage the RocksDB dependency in your project. This simplifies the update process for RocksDB.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of Known RocksDB Vulnerabilities (High Severity):**  Outdated versions of RocksDB may contain known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the application or the underlying system through the database.
**Impact:**
*   **Exploitation of Known RocksDB Vulnerabilities:** High Reduction. Regularly updating RocksDB to the latest versions, especially security patches, directly mitigates the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities within the database software.
**Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. We are monitoring RocksDB releases, but the update process is not fully automated and timely updates are not always guaranteed for RocksDB.
**Missing Implementation:**  Need to improve the update process to ensure timely application of security patches for RocksDB. Automate dependency updates and integrate vulnerability scanning for RocksDB dependencies into the CI/CD pipeline.
