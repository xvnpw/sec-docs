# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for facebook/rocksdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable and Verify Checksums](./mitigation_strategies/enable_and_verify_checksums.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configuration:** In the RocksDB options configuration (typically when opening the database), ensure that `checksum` or `use_checksum` is set to `true`.  This is often the default, but explicit verification is crucial.  Consider using a stronger checksum algorithm like `kxxHash64` if performance allows. This setting applies to block-level checksums.
2.  **Table-Level Checksums:** If using table-level options, ensure checksumming is enabled there as well. This provides an additional layer of protection.
3.  **Verification:** Implement a periodic (e.g., daily or weekly, depending on data sensitivity and change rate) background task or scheduled job that calls `DB::VerifyChecksum()` on the open database instance. This actively checks the integrity of the entire database. Log the results of this verification.
4.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling around the `DB::VerifyChecksum()` call. If a checksum error is detected, trigger alerts and initiate a data recovery process (e.g., restore from backup).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Silent Data Corruption (Severity: High):** Caused by hardware errors, filesystem bugs, or even rare RocksDB bugs. Checksums detect data modifications that would otherwise go unnoticed.
*   **Bit Rot (Severity: Medium):** Gradual data degradation over time due to storage media issues. Checksums help detect this early.
*   **Malicious Data Modification (Severity: Medium):** If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the data files *and* can modify them without being detected by other mechanisms, checksums *might* help detect the tampering (though this is not their primary purpose; encryption is better for this).

**Impact:**
*   **Silent Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced. Checksums provide a high probability of detecting corruption.
*   **Bit Rot:** Risk significantly reduced. Early detection allows for timely intervention.
*   **Malicious Data Modification:** Risk *slightly* reduced; detection is possible, but not guaranteed.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `use_checksum = true` is set in the main database options in `database.cpp`.
*   A basic `DB::VerifyChecksum()` call is present in a unit test (`database_test.cpp`), but it's not run regularly.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No periodic background task or scheduled job to call `DB::VerifyChecksum()` in the production environment.
*   No robust error handling or alerting if `DB::VerifyChecksum()` detects an error.
*   No table-level checksum configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Tune Compaction and Limit Memory Usage](./mitigation_strategies/tune_compaction_and_limit_memory_usage.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Analyze Workload:** Understand the application's read/write patterns and data size. Use RocksDB's built-in statistics and tools (or external monitoring) to identify potential bottlenecks.
2.  **Compaction Settings:**
    *   `level0_file_num_compaction_trigger`: Adjust this to control when L0 compactions are triggered. Too low a value can lead to excessive compactions.
    *   `max_bytes_for_level_base`: Control the maximum size of L1. A larger L1 can reduce write amplification but increase read latency.
    *   `target_file_size_base`: Control the target size of SST files.
    *   `write_buffer_size`: Size of in-memory buffer.
    *   Experiment with different compaction styles (level-based, universal, FIFO) using the RocksDB API.
3.  **Memory Limits:**
    *   `block_cache_size`: Limit the size of the block cache (using RocksDB options) to prevent excessive memory consumption.
    *   `write_buffer_size`: Control the size of the memtable (write buffer) via RocksDB options.
    *   `max_open_files`: Limit the number of open files (RocksDB option) to prevent resource exhaustion.
4.  **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor RocksDB's internal statistics (memory usage, compaction statistics, etc.) using the provided APIs and tools. Adjust settings as needed.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Write Amplification (Severity: Medium):** Proper compaction tuning reduces write amplification, making the database less vulnerable to DoS attacks that flood it with writes. This is a RocksDB-specific DoS vector.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Memory Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Memory limits (configured *within* RocksDB) prevent attackers from consuming all available memory through crafted requests that exploit RocksDB's internal memory management.
*   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Low):** Proper tuning improves overall database performance and responsiveness.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS due to Write Amplification:** Risk moderately reduced.
*   **DoS due to Memory Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Performance Degradation:** Performance improved.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Default RocksDB settings are used for compaction.
*   `block_cache_size` is set to a fixed value, but it hasn't been tuned based on workload.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No workload analysis or performance monitoring using RocksDB's tools.
*   No tuning of compaction settings beyond defaults.
*   No limits on `write_buffer_size` or `max_open_files` within the RocksDB configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement RocksDB Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rocksdb_rate_limiting.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create RateLimiter:** Within your application code, create a `rocksdb::RateLimiter` object.
2.  **Set Rate Limit:** Configure the `RateLimiter` with the desired rate limit (bytes per second). This should be based on your system's capacity and performance requirements. Consider separate limits for different operations (e.g., writes, compactions).
3.  **Integrate with RocksDB:** Pass the `RateLimiter` object to the RocksDB `Options` when opening the database. This applies the rate limiting directly to RocksDB's internal operations.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Rate limiting, specifically *within* RocksDB, prevents attackers from overwhelming the database with requests that would cause excessive disk I/O or other resource consumption *within* RocksDB's control*.
*   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Low):** Controlled resource usage can improve overall performance stability.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS due to Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Performance Degradation:** Performance stability improved.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No RocksDB `RateLimiter` is used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Complete absence of RocksDB-level rate limiting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure WAL Settings for Durability](./mitigation_strategies/configure_wal_settings_for_durability.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Understand WAL Options:** Familiarize yourself with RocksDB's Write-Ahead Log (WAL) options:
    *   `wal_ttl_seconds`: How long to keep WAL files before deleting them.
    *   `wal_size_limit_mb`: The maximum total size of WAL files.
    *   `manual_wal_flush`: Whether to manually flush the WAL.
    *   `sync_wal`: Whether to sync the WAL to disk on every write.
2.  **Configure for Durability:** Set these options in the RocksDB `Options` when opening the database.  For high durability, consider:
    *   A reasonable `wal_ttl_seconds` and `wal_size_limit_mb` to retain enough WAL data for recovery.
    *   Setting `sync_wal = true` if you need to guarantee that every write is immediately durable (this has a performance cost).
3.  **Use `SyncWAL()`:** In your application code, use the `DB::SyncWAL()` method *judiciously* after critical operations where immediate durability is essential.  Don't overuse it, as it impacts performance.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Loss due to Crashes/Power Failures (Severity: High):** Properly configured WAL settings ensure that data is not lost if the application or system crashes before data is flushed to SST files. This is a core RocksDB data durability mechanism.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Loss due to Crashes/Power Failures:** Risk significantly reduced, depending on the specific WAL settings chosen (trade-off between performance and durability).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Default WAL settings are used.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No explicit configuration of WAL settings for the specific durability requirements of the application.
*   No use of `DB::SyncWAL()` for critical operations.
