## Attack Tree Path: [1. Abuse Configuration or Features [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__abuse_configuration_or_features__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks that exploit misconfigurations or misuse intended features of RocksDB, rather than exploiting underlying code vulnerabilities. This is often a more accessible attack path.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Poor Access Control [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_poor_access_control__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This sub-branch focuses on failures in the application's access control mechanisms, allowing unauthorized interaction with RocksDB. RocksDB itself does not provide application-level authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 No Authentication/Authorization Checks [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_no_authenticationauthorization_checks__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The application using RocksDB does not implement any authentication (verifying user identity) or authorization (checking user permissions) before allowing access to the database. This is a fundamental security flaw.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Common application-level mistake.)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete data compromise.)
*   **Effort:** Very Low (Trivial if no checks exist.)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium (Absence of authentication logs is a clear indicator; unauthorized access attempts might be logged.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization in the application *before* any RocksDB interaction.
    *   Use a least-privilege model.
    *   Never expose RocksDB directly to untrusted networks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Weak Cryptography](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_weak_cryptography.md)

*   **Description:** This focuses on weaknesses related to RocksDB's encryption features, particularly key management.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Insecure Key Management](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_insecure_key_management.md)

*   **Description:** Encryption keys for RocksDB are stored or managed insecurely, making them vulnerable to compromise. Examples include hardcoding keys, storing them in easily accessible files, or using weak key generation methods.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Poor key management practices are common.)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Leads to data decryption.)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depends on key storage location.)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Difficult to detect unless key access is specifically monitored.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Use a secure Key Management System (KMS).
    *   Never hardcode keys.
    *   Follow best practices for key rotation and access control.
    *   Consider Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** This branch represents attacks that directly exploit vulnerabilities within RocksDB's code or its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Code Flaws](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_code_flaws.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 CVE-XXX (Placeholder)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_cve-xxx__placeholder_.md)

*   **Description:** Represents known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in RocksDB. The risk is significantly higher when a *known, exploitable* CVE exists and a patch is not applied.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on the specific CVE and patch application speed.)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Depends on the CVE; could range from DoS to RCE and data exfiltration.)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits are often publicly available.)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate (Using pre-built exploits is easier.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (IDS/WAFs *might* detect known patterns, but sophisticated attackers can bypass them.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Regularly update RocksDB to the latest version.
    *   Monitor security advisories.
    *   Implement a robust vulnerability management process.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Other Libraries Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_other_libraries_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Dependency Vulnerabilities (CVE-XXX) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_dependency_vulnerabilities__cve-xxx___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in libraries that RocksDB depends on (e.g., compression libraries). Similar to direct RocksDB CVEs, the risk is high when a known, exploitable CVE exists.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependencies are frequently updated, but vulnerabilities are regularly discovered.)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Depends on the specific dependency and vulnerability.)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits are often publicly available.)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Similar to direct CVEs.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Maintain an up-to-date Software Bill of Materials (SBOM).
    *   Monitor for vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   Update dependencies promptly.
    *   Use dependency analysis tools.
