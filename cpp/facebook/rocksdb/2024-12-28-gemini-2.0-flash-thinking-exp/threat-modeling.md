### High and Critical RocksDB Threats

*   **Threat:** Direct File System Manipulation of SST Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system where RocksDB stores its Sorted String Table (SST) files. They might directly modify the content of these files, inject malicious data, or corrupt existing data structures. This could involve using operating system commands or specialized tools to bypass RocksDB's internal mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, introduction of malicious data leading to application malfunction or security breaches, potential for denial of service if critical data structures are corrupted.
    *   **Affected Component:** SST Files (data storage files)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file system permissions to restrict access to RocksDB data directories and files to only the necessary user accounts.
        *   Consider using file system-level encryption to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the data at rest.
        *   Regularly monitor file system integrity using tools that detect unauthorized modifications.

*   **Threat:** Direct File System Manipulation of WAL Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the file system where RocksDB stores its Write-Ahead Log (WAL) files. They might modify or truncate the WAL files to prevent proper recovery after a crash, replay old transactions to revert state, or inject malicious transactions.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss during recovery, inconsistent database state, potential for replaying malicious operations, denial of service if recovery fails.
    *   **Affected Component:** Write-Ahead Log (WAL)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file system permissions to restrict access to WAL directories and files.
        *   Consider using encryption for WAL files to protect their confidentiality and integrity.
        *   Implement integrity checks for WAL files to detect unauthorized modifications.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Insecure Backup and Restore Procedures
    *   **Description:** If backup files created by RocksDB's backup functionality are not stored securely or the restore process is vulnerable, an attacker could gain access to backups to retrieve sensitive data or tamper with backups to introduce malicious data upon restoration.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, introduction of malicious data, data corruption upon restore.
    *   **Affected Component:** Backup/Restore Functionality
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt backup files at rest and in transit.
        *   Store backups in secure, access-controlled locations.
        *   Implement integrity checks for backup files to detect tampering.
        *   Secure the restore process, requiring authentication and authorization.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in RocksDB Library
    *   **Description:**  RocksDB might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or compromise the integrity of the data.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts, including data breach, data corruption, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various modules and functions within the RocksDB library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the RocksDB library up-to-date with the latest stable version and security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in RocksDB.
        *   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the RocksDB integration.

*   **Threat:** Insecure File Permissions on RocksDB Data Directories
    *   **Description:** If the directories where RocksDB stores its data files (SST files, WAL files, etc.) have overly permissive file system permissions, unauthorized users or processes might be able to access or modify these files.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, data corruption, potential for denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** File System Interface (how RocksDB interacts with the file system)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when setting file system permissions for RocksDB data directories.
        *   Ensure that only the user account under which RocksDB is running has read and write access to these directories.
