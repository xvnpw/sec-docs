# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/rocksdb

## Threat: [Data Corruption due to Bugs in Write Path](./threats/data_corruption_due_to_bugs_in_write_path.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption due to Bugs in Write Path
    *   **Description:** A bug within RocksDB's write path (e.g., during `Put`, `Merge`, or `Delete` operations) could be triggered by specific data patterns or concurrent operations. This could lead to incorrect data being written to disk. An attacker cannot directly trigger the bug but the conditions leading to it might be influenced by crafted data or specific timing of operations.
    *   **Impact:** Data inconsistency, application errors, potential data loss, requiring manual intervention for data recovery.
    *   **Affected Component:** Write path (specifically functions related to `WriteBatch`, `MemTable`, and WAL).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update RocksDB to the latest stable version, monitor RocksDB logs for warnings and errors, implement data validation checks after reads, consider using checksums.

## Threat: [Data Corruption during Compaction](./threats/data_corruption_during_compaction.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption during Compaction
    *   **Description:** A bug or unexpected interruption (e.g., power failure at the OS level impacting RocksDB's process) during the compaction process could lead to data loss or corruption as data is being merged and reorganized. While an attacker might not directly cause the bug, they could try to time attacks to coincide with compaction windows to increase the likelihood of corruption during an interruption.
    *   **Impact:** Data loss, database inconsistency, potential service disruption, requiring restoration from backups.
    *   **Affected Component:** Compaction process (specifically functions within the `compaction` module).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure a stable and reliable infrastructure, use UPS for power backup, monitor compaction progress and logs, consider tuning compaction parameters carefully, test recovery procedures.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in RocksDB Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_rocksdb_logs.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in RocksDB Logs
    *   **Description:** RocksDB logs can contain information about database operations, including potentially sensitive data values being written. An attacker gaining access to these log files (due to misconfigured permissions or a broader system compromise) could extract this information. The vulnerability lies in RocksDB's logging behavior potentially including sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potential privacy violations, compliance issues.
    *   **Affected Component:** Logging module within RocksDB.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Restrict access to RocksDB log files, configure logging levels to minimize sensitive data exposure, consider rotating and archiving logs regularly, redact sensitive information from logs if necessary.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Write Amplification Exploitation](./threats/denial_of_service_through_write_amplification_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service through Write Amplification Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific write patterns that intentionally trigger excessive write amplification in RocksDB's compaction process, leading to high disk I/O and potentially crashing the system or making it unresponsive. This directly exploits RocksDB's internal mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, performance degradation, potential disk wear and tear.
    *   **Affected Component:** Compaction process and its interaction with the storage engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully tune RocksDB compaction parameters, monitor write amplification metrics, implement strategies to reduce unnecessary writes, use SSDs with high write endurance.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_configurations.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configurations
    *   **Description:** Using default RocksDB configurations without understanding their security implications can introduce vulnerabilities. For example, leaving certain debugging features enabled that could expose internal state or metrics.
    *   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, potential for information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration loading and initialization within RocksDB.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Review and understand all RocksDB configuration options, follow security best practices for database configuration, avoid using default passwords or keys if applicable, implement secure configuration management practices.

## Threat: [Memory Leaks Leading to Denial of Service](./threats/memory_leaks_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Threat:** Memory Leaks Leading to Denial of Service
    *   **Description:** Bugs within RocksDB could cause memory leaks over time. An attacker might trigger specific sequences of operations that exacerbate these leaks, eventually leading to memory exhaustion and application crashes. The vulnerability resides within RocksDB's memory management.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, application downtime.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various memory allocation points within RocksDB.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly update RocksDB, monitor memory usage, perform thorough testing and memory profiling, implement application-level restart mechanisms.

## Threat: [Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) through yet undiscovered vulnerabilities.](./threats/potential_for_remote_code_execution__rce__through_yet_undiscovered_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) through yet undiscovered vulnerabilities.
    *   **Description:** Like any complex software, RocksDB might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities that could potentially be exploited for remote code execution. An attacker finding such a vulnerability could gain complete control over the server.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breach, service disruption, and other severe consequences.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various parts of the RocksDB codebase depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Keep RocksDB updated to the latest stable version, subscribe to security advisories, implement strong system-level security measures, consider using sandboxing or containerization.
