# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/rocksdb

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  The application deserializes data retrieved from RocksDB without proper validation, allowing an attacker to inject malicious payloads that execute upon deserialization.

**How RocksDB Contributes:** RocksDB stores raw byte arrays. It's the application's responsibility to handle serialization and deserialization. If the application uses insecure deserialization practices, RocksDB provides the storage mechanism for the malicious data.

**Example:** An application stores serialized Java objects in RocksDB. An attacker modifies the raw bytes in RocksDB (if they have access) or crafts malicious data that, when deserialized by the application, executes arbitrary code.

**Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE), data corruption, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use secure serialization libraries and avoid default Java serialization if possible.
*   Implement robust input validation on data retrieved from RocksDB *before* deserialization.
*   Consider using data formats that are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities (e.g., JSON with careful parsing).
*   Employ sandboxing or containerization to limit the impact of potential RCE.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Options](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_options.md)

**Description:**  RocksDB is configured with insecure options that expose the application to risks.

**How RocksDB Contributes:** RocksDB offers various configuration parameters. Incorrectly setting these parameters can weaken security.

**Example:**  Disabling encryption at rest in RocksDB configuration means sensitive data is stored unencrypted on disk, making it vulnerable if the storage medium is compromised.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable encryption at rest using strong encryption keys and proper key management.
*   Restrict file system permissions for the RocksDB data directory to the least privileged user.
*   Carefully review and understand the security implications of all RocksDB configuration options.
*   Avoid using default or weak passwords if authentication mechanisms are available (though less common directly with RocksDB itself).

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in RocksDB Native Code](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_rocksdb_native_code.md)

**Description:**  Security vulnerabilities exist within the RocksDB C++ codebase itself (e.g., buffer overflows, memory corruption).

**How RocksDB Contributes:** As a native library, RocksDB is susceptible to common C/C++ vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A bug in the RocksDB compaction process could be triggered by specific data patterns, leading to a buffer overflow and potentially allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the application's process.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), denial of service, data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update RocksDB to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to RocksDB.
*   Consider using static and dynamic analysis tools on the application to detect potential issues related to RocksDB's memory management.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Large Values/Keys](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_large_valueskeys.md)

**Description:** An attacker inserts extremely large keys or values into RocksDB, leading to excessive memory consumption or disk space usage, causing a denial of service.

**How RocksDB Contributes:** RocksDB allows storing arbitrary byte arrays as keys and values. Without application-level limits, it can become a target for resource exhaustion attacks.

**Example:** An attacker repeatedly writes entries with gigabyte-sized values into the database, filling up the available disk space and potentially crashing the application or the underlying system.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement limits on the maximum size of keys and values that the application will write to RocksDB.
*   Monitor disk space and memory usage related to the RocksDB instance.
*   Implement rate limiting or input validation to prevent the insertion of excessively large data.
