## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions in Asynchronous Operations using `folly::futures`](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_in_asynchronous_operations_using__follyfutures_.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper synchronization when using `folly::futures`, `folly::promises`, or `folly::SemiFuture` can lead to race conditions, where the outcome of operations depends on the unpredictable order of execution of concurrent tasks.
*   **How Folly Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Folly provides powerful asynchronous programming primitives. However, the responsibility for ensuring thread safety and proper synchronization when accessing shared state from within these asynchronous operations lies with the developer. Incorrect use of synchronization mechanisms or lack thereof can introduce race conditions.
*   **Example:** Two asynchronous tasks modify a shared variable without proper locking or atomic operations. The final value of the variable becomes unpredictable and could lead to incorrect application state or security vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unexpected application behavior, potential security breaches if sensitive data is involved in the race condition.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use appropriate synchronization primitives (like `std::mutex`, `folly::SharedMutex`, atomic operations) when accessing shared state from within asynchronous tasks.
    *   Carefully design asynchronous workflows to minimize shared mutable state.
    *   Utilize Folly's synchronization primitives where applicable.
    *   Thoroughly test concurrent code for race conditions using techniques like thread sanitizers.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion in Asynchronous I/O (`folly::io::async`)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion_in_asynchronous_io___follyioasync__.md)

*   **Description:**  Incorrect handling of incoming connections or data streams in applications using `folly::io::async` can lead to resource exhaustion, causing a denial-of-service.
*   **How Folly Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Folly's asynchronous I/O framework provides efficient mechanisms for handling network operations. However, if the application doesn't implement proper resource management (e.g., limiting the number of concurrent connections, handling backpressure), an attacker can exploit this by overwhelming the server with requests.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a large number of connection requests to a server using `folly::AsyncServerSocket` without the server implementing connection limits. This could exhaust server resources (memory, file descriptors), making it unresponsive to legitimate requests.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement connection limits and rate limiting for incoming connections.
    *   Implement backpressure mechanisms to handle situations where the application cannot keep up with the incoming data rate.
    *   Set appropriate timeouts for network operations to prevent resources from being held indefinitely.
    *   Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for abnormal activity.

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption due to Incorrect Usage of Custom Data Structures (`folly::FBVector`, `folly::FBString`)](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_due_to_incorrect_usage_of_custom_data_structures___follyfbvector____follyfbstring__11d9bea2.md)

*   **Description:** While designed for efficiency and safety, incorrect manipulation of Folly's custom data structures like `folly::FBVector` or `folly::FBString` can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities. This can happen through out-of-bounds access, iterator invalidation, or incorrect resizing operations.
*   **How Folly Contributes to the Attack Surface:** These custom data structures offer performance optimizations but require careful handling. Developers need to be aware of their specific behavior and potential pitfalls, especially when performing operations that modify the size or content of the containers.
*   **Example:**  Iterating through an `folly::FBVector` while simultaneously adding or removing elements without proper care can invalidate iterators, leading to crashes or memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** Crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution if memory corruption is exploitable.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly understand the behavior of Folly's custom data structures, especially regarding iterator invalidation and resizing.
    *   Use range-based for loops or index-based access with careful bounds checking when iterating and modifying these containers.
    *   Avoid modifying the size of these containers while iterating through them using traditional iterators.
    *   Consider using safer alternatives if the performance benefits of `folly::FBVector` or `folly::FBString` are not critical.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities with `folly::json` (if used)](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_vulnerabilities_with__follyjson___if_used_.md)

*   **Description:** If Folly's JSON parsing functionality is used to process untrusted input, vulnerabilities related to deserialization can arise. This could include issues like arbitrary code execution if custom deserialization logic is involved or if underlying libraries have vulnerabilities.
*   **How Folly Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Folly provides utilities for JSON parsing. If not used carefully, especially when deserializing complex objects or when custom deserialization logic is implemented, it can become a vector for attacks.
*   **Example:** An application deserializes a JSON object received from an untrusted source. The JSON contains instructions that, when processed by custom deserialization logic, execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Validate and sanitize all input before deserialization.
    *   Avoid implementing custom deserialization logic for complex objects if possible.
    *   Use safe deserialization practices and be aware of potential vulnerabilities in underlying JSON parsing libraries.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when deserializing data.
