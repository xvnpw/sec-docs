## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Folly Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_folly_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the starting point for all potential attacks leveraging Folly vulnerabilities. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Management Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_management_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Folly, being a performance-oriented C++ library, often involves manual memory management. This category of vulnerabilities arises from incorrect handling of memory allocation, deallocation, and access. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution, crashes, or information leaks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Buffer Overflow [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/buffer_overflow__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Occurs when an attacker provides more data than a buffer can hold, overwriting adjacent memory. This can corrupt program state, leading to crashes or, more critically, allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code by overwriting return addresses or function pointers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger overflow in Folly's data structures (e.g., fbstring, containers) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_overflow_in_folly's_data_structures__e_g___fbstring__containers___critical_node___high-risk__becc1d9a.md)

This is the specific action of causing a buffer overflow within Folly's provided data structures like its string class (`fbstring`) or other container classes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide overly long input to functions using Folly strings or buffers [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/provide_overly_long_input_to_functions_using_folly_strings_or_buffers__critical_node___high-risk_pat_3eefaa05.md)

A common method to trigger buffer overflows is by supplying input that exceeds the allocated size of a buffer being used by a Folly function.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit incorrect size calculations in memory operations [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect_size_calculations_in_memory_operations__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Buffer overflows can also occur due to errors in calculating the required buffer size before a memory operation (like copying data). Attackers can exploit these miscalculations to write beyond the intended buffer boundaries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use-After-Free [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/use-after-free__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

This vulnerability occurs when memory is freed, but a pointer to that memory is later dereferenced. The freed memory might be reallocated for a different purpose, leading to unpredictable behavior, crashes, or the potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the contents of the reallocated memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger use of freed memory in Folly's asynchronous or concurrent components [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_use_of_freed_memory_in_folly's_asynchronous_or_concurrent_components__critical_node___high-r_ba5b077f.md)

Use-after-free vulnerabilities are particularly common in concurrent programming where object lifetimes and resource management are more complex. Folly's asynchronous features (like futures and promises) and concurrent data structures are potential areas for these vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate object lifetimes in multithreaded scenarios [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_object_lifetimes_in_multithreaded_scenarios__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can exploit race conditions or incorrect synchronization in multithreaded code to influence the order of operations and trigger a use-after-free by ensuring an object is freed while another thread is still holding a pointer to it.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit incorrect resource management in callbacks or futures [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect_resource_management_in_callbacks_or_futures__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Incorrect handling of resources in callbacks or futures within Folly's asynchronous programming model can lead to use-after-free vulnerabilities if the lifetime of the resource is not properly managed relative to the execution of the callback or the resolution of the future.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build and Dependency Related Issues [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_build_and_dependency_related_issues__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

This category of attacks doesn't directly involve vulnerabilities in Folly's code but rather exploits weaknesses in how the application is built and manages its dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use of Vulnerable Folly Version [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/use_of_vulnerable_folly_version__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

If an application uses an older version of Folly that contains known security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these publicly documented flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target known vulnerabilities in specific Folly versions [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/target_known_vulnerabilities_in_specific_folly_versions__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers actively look for and target applications using outdated versions of libraries with known exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify the Folly version used by the application [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/identify_the_folly_version_used_by_the_application__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

Before exploiting version-specific vulnerabilities, attackers need to determine which version of Folly the target application is using. This information might be obtained through various means, such as inspecting application files, error messages, or network traffic.
