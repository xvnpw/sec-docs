# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/folly

## Threat: [Denial of Service due to malformed input in `IOBuf`.](./threats/denial_of_service_due_to_malformed_input_in__iobuf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a network packet or provides data that, when processed by Folly's `IOBuf` (Input/Output Buffer) component, triggers an unhandled exception or causes excessive resource consumption (e.g., memory allocation). This could involve crafting packets with unexpected sizes or formats that the `IOBuf` implementation doesn't handle gracefully.

**Impact:** The application using Folly crashes or becomes unresponsive, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Affected Folly Component:** `folly::IOBuf`, specifically functions related to data manipulation, allocation, and parsing.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization before passing data to `IOBuf` functions.
*   Set limits on the size of data processed by `IOBuf`.
*   Thoroughly test the application's handling of various input scenarios, including malformed data, using fuzzing techniques.
*   Keep Folly updated to the latest version, as newer versions may contain fixes for known vulnerabilities in `IOBuf`.

## Threat: [Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Folly's parsing utilities (e.g., for JSON or other formats).](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_folly's_parsing_utilities__e_g___for_json_or_other_formats_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malformed or malicious data to Folly's parsing utilities (if the application uses them), leading to buffer overflows, denial of service, or other vulnerabilities. This could occur if the parsing logic has flaws in handling unexpected input formats or sizes.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if a memory corruption vulnerability is present in the parsing logic.

**Affected Folly Component:**  Specific parsing utilities within Folly, such as those potentially found in `folly/json.h` or other data format handling components.

**Risk Severity:** High (if arbitrary code execution is possible)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization before passing data to Folly's parsing utilities.
*   Set limits on the size and complexity of data being parsed.
*   Keep Folly updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches in parsing components.
*   Consider using well-vetted and actively maintained parsing libraries if Folly's capabilities are not strictly required.

## Threat: [Type confusion or memory corruption due to incorrect usage of `fbstring`.](./threats/type_confusion_or_memory_corruption_due_to_incorrect_usage_of__fbstring_.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits incorrect handling or assumptions about Folly's `fbstring` (Facebook string) implementation, potentially leading to type confusion vulnerabilities or memory corruption if string operations are performed without proper bounds checking or type safety.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution if memory corruption can be reliably triggered and exploited.

**Affected Folly Component:** `folly/FBString.h`.

**Risk Severity:** High (if arbitrary code execution is possible)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review all uses of `fbstring` to ensure correct usage and avoid potential type confusion or buffer overflows.
*   Utilize memory safety tools and techniques during development and testing.
*   Prefer using standard library string types (`std::string`) when Folly-specific features are not required.
