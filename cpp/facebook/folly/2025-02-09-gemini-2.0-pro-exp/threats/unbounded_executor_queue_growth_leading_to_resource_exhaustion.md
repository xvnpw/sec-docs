*   **Risk Severity:** High.

### 3. Code Analysis

#### 3.1. Folly Executor Internals (Simplified)

`folly::Executor` implementations typically use an internal queue (often a `folly::MPMCQueue` or similar) to store tasks waiting to be executed.  The `add()` method (or similar) enqueues a task.  Worker threads (in the case of thread pool executors) dequeue and execute tasks.  If the queue is unbounded and tasks are added faster than they can be processed, the queue grows indefinitely.

#### 3.2. Hypothetical Vulnerable Code Patterns

```c++
// Example 1: Unbounded CPUThreadPoolExecutor
folly::CPUThreadPoolExecutor executor(4 /* threads */); // No queue size limit!

void handleRequest(const Request& req) {
  executor.add([req]() {
    // Potentially long-running or blocking operation based on attacker-controlled input
    processRequest(req);
  });
}

// Example 2:  Unbounded queue via addWithPriority
folly::IOThreadPoolExecutor ioExecutor(4);
void handle_data(folly::IOBufQueue& q) {
    ioExecutor.addWithPriority([&]() {
        //process data
        auto data = q.move();
        // ... potentially slow processing ...
    }, 0); // No queue limit
}

// Example 3:  Future chain with unbounded executor
folly::CPUThreadPoolExecutor executor(4); // Unbounded

folly::Future<Result> processData(Data data) {
  return folly::makeFuture()
    .via(&executor)
    .thenValue([data](auto&&) {
      // Long-running operation on data
      return performSlowOperation(data);
    })
    .thenValue([](auto&& result) {
      // ... further processing ...
      return result;
    });
}
```

These examples demonstrate how an attacker, by controlling the input (`req` or `data`), could cause a large number of slow tasks to be submitted to an unbounded executor.

#### 3.3. `folly::futures` Interaction

`folly::futures` often interact with executors through `via()`.  If the executor passed to `via()` is unbounded, any slow operation within the future chain can contribute to queue growth.  Crucially, even if individual operations *seem* short, a large number of them enqueued concurrently can still exhaust resources.

### 4. Vulnerability Identification

Specific scenarios where this threat is likely to manifest:

1.  **API Endpoints Processing User Input:**  Any API endpoint that takes user input and uses that input to perform a potentially long-running operation within a `folly::Executor` is vulnerable.  Examples:
    *   Image processing services where the attacker can upload very large or complex images.
    *   Search services where the attacker can craft complex queries that take a long time to execute.
    *   Data processing pipelines where the attacker can inject large or malformed data.
2.  **Asynchronous Task Processing:**  Background tasks or asynchronous workflows that are triggered by external events (e.g., message queues, timers) are vulnerable if the rate of events can be controlled by an attacker.
3.  **Recursive or Iterative Operations:**  Code that recursively or iteratively submits tasks to an executor based on attacker-controlled data is highly vulnerable.  A small change in input could lead to a massive increase in the number of tasks.
4.  **Third-Party Library Interactions:** If the application uses third-party libraries that interact with `folly::Executor` (directly or indirectly), vulnerabilities in those libraries could lead to unbounded queue growth.

### 5. Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

#### 5.1. Use Bounded Queues

This is the most crucial mitigation.  Configure executors with a maximum queue size.

```c++
// Example: Bounded CPUThreadPoolExecutor
folly::CPUThreadPoolExecutor executor(
    4, /* threads */
    std::make_unique<folly::LifoSemMPMCQueue<folly::CPUThreadPoolExecutor::Task, folly::QueueBehaviorIfFull::Reject>>
        (1000 /* max queue size */)
);

// Example using setMaxQueueSize (if available)
folly::IOThreadPoolExecutor ioExecutor(4);
ioExecutor.setMaxQueueSize(500);
```

When the queue is full, new tasks should be rejected.  This can be handled by:

*   **Returning an Error:**  Return a `503 Service Unavailable` or similar error to the client.
*   **Dropping the Task:**  Silently discard the task (less desirable, as it provides no feedback).
*   **Backpressure:**  Implement a backpressure mechanism to slow down the rate of task submission (e.g., using a semaphore or token bucket).  This is more complex but provides better control.

#### 5.2. Implement Timeouts

Set timeouts on tasks to prevent them from running indefinitely.

```c++
// Example: Timeout using folly::futures::sleep()
folly::Future<Result> processWithTimeout(Data data) {
  return folly::makeFuture()
    .via(&executor)
    .thenValue([data](auto&&) {
      return performOperation(data);
    })
    .thenValue([](auto&& result) {
      // ... further processing ...
      return result;
    })
    .onTimeout(std::chrono::seconds(5), []() {
      // Handle timeout (e.g., log an error, return a default value)
      return Result::TimeoutError;
    });
}

// Example: Timeout using within()
folly::Future<Result> processWithTimeout2(Data data, folly::Executor* executor) {
    return folly::futures::within(std::chrono::seconds(10), executor, [&](){
        return performOperation(data);
    }).thenValue([](folly::Try<Result>&& t) {
        if (t.hasException()) {
            //check if it is folly::TimedOut exception
            if (t.withException<folly::TimedOut>([](const folly::TimedOut&) {
                //handle timeout
                LOG(ERROR) << "Task timed out!";
            }))
            return Result::TimeoutError;
        }
        return t.value();
    });
}
```

#### 5.3. Rate Limiting

Limit the rate at which tasks can be submitted to the executor.

```c++
// Example: Simple rate limiting (conceptual)
std::atomic<int> requestsInFlight{0};
const int MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 10;

void handleRequest(const Request& req) {
  if (requestsInFlight.fetch_add(1) >= MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS) {
    requestsInFlight.fetch_sub(1);
    // Reject the request (e.g., return 503 Service Unavailable)
    return;
  }

  executor.add([req, this]() {
    try {
        processRequest(req);
    }
    catch(...) {
        //handle exception
    }
    requestsInFlight.fetch_sub(1);
  });
}
```

This is a very basic example.  Production-ready rate limiting often involves:

*   **Token Buckets:**  A more sophisticated approach that allows for bursts of activity.
*   **Sliding Windows:**  Track requests within a time window.
*   **Distributed Rate Limiting:**  For systems with multiple instances, rate limiting needs to be coordinated across instances.  (e.g., using Redis or a similar service).

#### 5.4. Input Validation

Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input *before* it is used to generate tasks for the executor.  This can prevent attackers from crafting inputs that lead to excessive task creation.

### 6. Testing and Validation

#### 6.1. Unit Tests

*   **Bounded Queue Tests:**  Test that the executor correctly rejects tasks when the queue is full.
*   **Timeout Tests:**  Test that tasks are cancelled when they exceed their timeouts.
*   **Rate Limiting Tests:**  Test that the rate limiting mechanism correctly limits the number of concurrent tasks.

#### 6.2. Integration Tests

*   **Load Tests:**  Simulate a high volume of requests to the application and verify that the executor queue remains bounded and that the application remains responsive.
*   **Stress Tests:**  Push the application to its limits to identify potential resource exhaustion issues.
*   **Chaos Engineering:**  Introduce failures (e.g., slow network connections, high CPU load) to test the application's resilience.

#### 6.3. Fuzzing

Use fuzzing techniques to generate a wide variety of inputs and test the application's behavior under unexpected conditions.  This can help identify vulnerabilities that might not be caught by traditional testing methods.

### 7. Monitoring and Alerting

*   **Executor Queue Size:**  Monitor the size of the executor queue.  Alert if the queue size exceeds a predefined threshold.
*   **Task Execution Time:**  Monitor the average and maximum execution time of tasks.  Alert if tasks are taking longer than expected.
*   **Task Completion Rate:**  Monitor the rate at which tasks are completed.  Alert if the completion rate drops significantly.
*   **Resource Usage:**  Monitor CPU usage, memory usage, file descriptor usage, and other relevant system resources.  Alert if resource usage exceeds predefined thresholds.
*   **Error Rates:** Monitor the rate of errors returned by the executor (e.g., due to queue rejections or timeouts).
*   **Application-Specific Metrics:**  Monitor any application-specific metrics that are relevant to the threat (e.g., the number of active users, the number of requests per second).

**Alerting Thresholds:**  Thresholds should be determined based on the application's expected workload and performance characteristics.  Start with conservative thresholds and adjust them as needed.

### 8. Conclusion

The "Unbounded Executor Queue Growth" threat is a serious vulnerability that can lead to denial-of-service attacks. By understanding how `folly::Executor` works and implementing the mitigation strategies described above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this threat.  Continuous monitoring and testing are essential to ensure the ongoing security and stability of the application. Remember to combine multiple mitigation strategies for a defense-in-depth approach.
