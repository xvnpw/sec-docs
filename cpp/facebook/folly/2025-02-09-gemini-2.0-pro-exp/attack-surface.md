# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/folly

## Attack Surface: [Memory Corruption in `fbstring` and `IOBuf`](./attack_surfaces/memory_corruption_in__fbstring__and__iobuf_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in Folly's string and buffer management implementations (`fbstring` and `IOBuf`) could lead to buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other memory corruption issues.
*   **How Folly Contributes:**  `fbstring` and `IOBuf` are complex, performance-optimized implementations that handle memory management.  Bugs within these Folly components are the direct source of risk.
*   **Example:**  An attacker sends a specially crafted string that, when processed by a function using `fbstring::append`, triggers a buffer overflow due to an integer overflow in size calculation within Folly's code.
*   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to take complete control of the application.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Extensively fuzz test all code paths that handle user input and interact with `fbstring` and `IOBuf`. Use tools like AFL++, libFuzzer, or Honggfuzz.
    *   **Static Analysis:**  Employ static analysis tools (e.g., Clang Static Analyzer, Coverity) to identify potential memory safety issues.
    *   **Dynamic Analysis:**  Run the application under memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan), MemorySanitizer (MSan), and Valgrind during development and testing.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Sanitize and validate all input *before* it reaches `fbstring` or `IOBuf` operations.  Enforce length limits and character restrictions.  (While input validation is crucial, it doesn't eliminate the risk of bugs *within* Folly).
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Thoroughly review code that uses `fbstring` and `IOBuf`, paying close attention to memory allocation, resizing, and boundary conditions.
    *   **Stay Updated:**  Keep Folly up-to-date to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [`folly::dynamic` Misuse and Type Confusion (Due to Folly Vulnerabilities)](./attack_surfaces/_follydynamic__misuse_and_type_confusion__due_to_folly_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities *within* `folly::dynamic`'s parsing or type handling could lead to type confusion, unexpected type conversions, and potentially exploitable logic errors, even with seemingly valid input.
*   **How Folly Contributes:** The risk stems from potential bugs *within* Folly's implementation of `folly::dynamic`, not just from application misuse.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a carefully crafted, but syntactically valid, JSON payload that exploits a subtle bug in `folly::dynamic`'s type conversion logic, leading to an unexpected type being used in a later operation.
*   **Impact:** Code injection, denial-of-service, data corruption, or other application-specific vulnerabilities, depending on how the misused data is handled.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Schema Validation:** Use a schema validation library. While this primarily mitigates application-level misuse, it can also help constrain input to avoid triggering obscure Folly bugs.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize input *before* parsing. This is less effective against vulnerabilities *within* Folly, but still good practice.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz test `folly::dynamic`'s parsing and processing logic *extensively*. This is crucial for finding bugs within Folly itself.
    *   **Stay Updated:** Keep Folly up-to-date.
    *   **Consider Alternatives:** If extremely high security is required for JSON processing, consider using a dedicated JSON library with a strong security focus and a smaller attack surface than `folly::dynamic`.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `folly::AsyncSocket` and Networking (Folly-Specific)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__follyasyncsocket__and_networking__folly-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities *within* Folly's networking components (e.g., `folly::AsyncSocket`, `folly::IOBuf` used in networking) could lead to denial-of-service, buffer overflows, or other network-related attacks.
*   **How Folly Contributes:** The risk arises from potential bugs in Folly's networking implementation itself.
*   **Example:**  A crafted network packet exploits a buffer overflow in `folly::IOBuf` *as used within* `folly::AsyncSocket` during parsing of network data.
*   **Impact:**  Denial-of-service, arbitrary code execution (in the case of buffer overflows), information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **High** (can be Critical)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate network data. While this helps, it doesn't eliminate the risk of bugs *within* Folly.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting. This mitigates DoS, but not vulnerabilities within Folly.
    *   **Timeouts:** Use appropriate timeouts.
    *   **Secure Protocols:** Use TLS/SSL. This protects against eavesdropping/tampering, but not against vulnerabilities *within* Folly's handling of the protocol.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  *Extensively* fuzz test the network input handling code, specifically targeting `folly::AsyncSocket` and related components. This is crucial for finding Folly-specific bugs.
    *   **Stay Updated:** Keep Folly up-to-date.
