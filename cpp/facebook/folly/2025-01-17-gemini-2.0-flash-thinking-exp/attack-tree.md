## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow in Folly Data Structures [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_in_folly_data_structures__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides malicious input to the application. This input is then processed by Folly's string or container classes (e.g., `fbstring`, `F14ValueMap`). Due to a failure in Folly's internal logic to properly validate the size of the input, a buffer overflow occurs. This overwrites adjacent memory regions, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    * **Overwrite function pointers:** Redirect program execution to attacker-controlled code.
    * **Overwrite return addresses:**  Gain control when a function returns.
    * **Modify critical data structures:** Alter the application's state or permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Use-After-Free in Folly's Memory Management [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_use-after-free_in_folly's_memory_management__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application's logic incorrectly leads to the premature deallocation of an object that is still being managed by Folly. Subsequently, a Folly function attempts to access this freed memory. This can lead to:
    * **Arbitrary code execution:** If the freed memory is reallocated and contains attacker-controlled data.
    * **Information disclosure:** If sensitive data remains in the freed memory.
    * **Application crash:** Leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities in Folly's Networking Utilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_folly's_networking_utilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application uses Folly's networking classes to handle network data, an attacker can send maliciously crafted network packets. These packets exploit vulnerabilities in Folly's parsing logic, such as:
    * **Buffer overflows:** When parsing overly long headers or data fields.
    * **Format string vulnerabilities:** If user-controlled data is used in format strings.
    * **Integer overflows:** Leading to incorrect memory allocation or processing.
    * **Consequences:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the application server or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities in Folly's Serialization Mechanisms [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities_in_folly's_serialization_mechanisms__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application uses Folly for serializing and deserializing data (e.g., using `dynamic` or other serialization features), an attacker can provide maliciously crafted serialized data. When this data is deserialized by the application using Folly, it can trigger vulnerabilities such as:
    * **Code injection:** By crafting objects that, upon deserialization, execute arbitrary code.
    * **Information disclosure:** By manipulating object properties to reveal sensitive data.
    * **Denial of service:** By creating objects that consume excessive resources during deserialization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Incorrect Usage of Cryptographic Primitives Provided by Folly [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_incorrect_usage_of_cryptographic_primitives_provided_by_folly__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Even if Folly's cryptographic implementations are secure, application developers can make mistakes when using these primitives. This can lead to vulnerabilities such as:
    * **Using weak or broken cryptographic algorithms:** If Folly provides options for different algorithms, developers might choose insecure ones.
    * **Incorrect key management:** Storing keys insecurely or using hardcoded keys.
    * **Improper initialization vectors (IVs):** Leading to predictable encryption.
    * **Padding oracle attacks:** If block cipher padding is not handled correctly.
    * **Consequences:** Compromise of sensitive data, authentication bypass, and other security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect Configuration of Folly Features](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_configuration_of_folly_features.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application might be configured in a way that exposes sensitive information or provides unintended attack vectors. Examples include:
    * **Enabling debug features in production:** This can leak internal state, error messages, or even memory contents.
    * **Overly permissive settings:**  Allowing access to functionalities that should be restricted.
    * **Consequences:** Information disclosure, easier exploitation of other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Input Validation Before Passing Data to Folly [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/improper_input_validation_before_passing_data_to_folly__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application receives untrusted input from external sources (e.g., user input, network data). This input is then directly passed to Folly functions without proper validation or sanitization. This allows attackers to inject malicious data that can trigger vulnerabilities within Folly, such as buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other parsing errors.
    * **Consequences:** This is a common entry point for many types of attacks, potentially leading to code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Outdated Version of Folly with Known Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/using_outdated_version_of_folly_with_known_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses an older version of the Folly library that contains publicly known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can leverage readily available exploit code or techniques to target these vulnerabilities.
    * **Consequences:**  Depending on the specific vulnerability, this can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service. Exploiting known vulnerabilities is often easier and requires less skill than discovering new ones.
