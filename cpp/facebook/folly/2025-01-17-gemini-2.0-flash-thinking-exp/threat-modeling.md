# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/folly

## Threat: [Heap Buffer Overflow in `fbstring` Operations](./threats/heap_buffer_overflow_in__fbstring__operations.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could provide overly long input to functions manipulating `fbstring` objects (e.g., concatenation, assignment) without proper bounds checking. This could overwrite adjacent memory on the heap.
    *   **Impact:**  Memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution if attacker gains control of instruction pointers or other critical data. Application crash or unexpected behavior.
    *   **Affected Folly Component:** `folly/FBString.h`, specifically functions like `append`, `operator+=`, `assign`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize input before using it with `fbstring` operations.
        *   Utilize `fbstring`'s capacity management features to pre-allocate sufficient memory.
        *   Employ memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) during development and testing.
        *   Keep Folly updated to benefit from potential bug fixes in `fbstring`.

## Threat: [Use-After-Free in `ConcurrentHashMap` Iteration](./threats/use-after-free_in__concurrenthashmap__iteration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could trigger a race condition where an iterator is used on a `ConcurrentHashMap` after the underlying bucket or element has been deallocated by another thread performing a removal or resize operation.
    *   **Impact:**  Application crash, potential for information disclosure if freed memory contains sensitive data, or potentially exploitable memory corruption.
    *   **Affected Folly Component:** `folly/concurrency/ConcurrentHashMap.h`, specifically iterators and related methods like `erase`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid holding iterators for extended periods, especially in concurrent environments.
        *   Implement proper synchronization mechanisms when iterating over and modifying `ConcurrentHashMap` concurrently.
        *   Consider using snapshot-based iteration if available and suitable for the use case.
        *   Carefully review code that involves concurrent access and modification of `ConcurrentHashMap`.

## Threat: [Integer Overflow in `IOBuf` Allocation](./threats/integer_overflow_in__iobuf__allocation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could provide a very large size value when allocating an `IOBuf`, potentially leading to an integer overflow. This could result in a smaller-than-expected buffer being allocated, leading to subsequent buffer overflows when data is written into it.
    *   **Impact:**  Heap buffer overflow, potential for arbitrary code execution, application crash.
    *   **Affected Folly Component:** `folly/io/IOBuf.h`, specifically allocation functions like `create`, `allocate`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Validate the size parameter before allocating `IOBuf` objects, ensuring it does not exceed reasonable limits.
        *   Be aware of potential integer overflow issues when performing calculations involving buffer sizes.
        *   Rely on Folly's internal checks and assertions where available, but also implement application-level validation.
