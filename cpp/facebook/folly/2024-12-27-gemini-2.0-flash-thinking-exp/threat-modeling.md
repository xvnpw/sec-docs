## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Facebook Folly

This table outlines high and critical threats directly introduced by the Facebook Folly library.

| Threat | Description | Impact | Affected Folly Component(s) | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Integer Overflow in Data Structures** | An attacker provides input that causes an integer overflow when calculating the size or capacity of a Folly data structure (e.g., `fbvector`, `F14`). This could lead to heap overflow when allocating memory. | **Critical:** Memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution. | `fbvector`, `F14`, potentially other container-like structures using size calculations. | **Critical** |  * **Use Folly's built-in size limits and checks:** Ensure proper usage of functions like `reserve()` with appropriate bounds. * **Implement input validation:** Sanitize and validate input sizes before using them with Folly data structures. * **Consider using safer alternatives:** If possible, explore alternative data structures with built-in overflow protection. |
| **Use-After-Free in Asynchronous Operations** | An attacker triggers a sequence of asynchronous operations (using Folly's futures, promises, or executors) that leads to a use-after-free vulnerability. This could involve manipulating the timing or dependencies of these operations. | **Critical:** Memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution. | `futures`, `promises`, `Executor` framework, `EventBase`. | **Critical** | * **Careful resource management:** Ensure proper lifetime management of objects shared between asynchronous tasks. * **Utilize Folly's smart pointers:** Employ `folly::SharedPtr` and `folly::make_shared` to manage object lifetimes automatically. * **Thorough testing of asynchronous code:** Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests to identify potential race conditions and lifetime issues. |
| **Race Conditions in Concurrency Primitives** | An attacker exploits race conditions in Folly's concurrency primitives (e.g., `Baton`, `EventCount`, `SpinLock`) to manipulate shared state in an unintended way. This could lead to data corruption or unexpected program behavior. | **High:** Data corruption, inconsistent state, potential for denial of service. | `Baton`, `EventCount`, `SpinLock`, `RWSpinLock`, `ConcurrentHashMap`. | **High** | * **Minimize shared mutable state:** Design the application to reduce the need for shared mutable data. * **Use appropriate synchronization primitives:** Carefully choose the correct Folly synchronization primitives for the specific concurrency requirements. * **Follow best practices for concurrent programming:** Adhere to established principles for writing thread-safe code. * **Utilize thread-safety annotations:** Leverage Folly's annotations to help identify potential concurrency issues. |
| **Buffer Overflows in String Manipulation** | An attacker provides overly long strings as input to functions using Folly's string utilities (e.g., `StringPiece`, `fbstring`) without proper bounds checking, potentially leading to buffer overflows. | **High:** Memory corruption, potential for denial of service or code execution (depending on the context). | `StringPiece`, `fbstring`, functions manipulating strings (e.g., `split`, `join`). | **High** | * **Use Folly's safe string manipulation functions:** Favor functions that perform bounds checking or allocate memory dynamically. * **Validate input string lengths:** Check the length of input strings before processing them with Folly's string utilities. * **Be cautious with C-style string conversions:** Avoid unnecessary conversions to `char*` and use Folly's string types directly. |
| **Incorrect Usage of Folly's Hashing Functions** | If Folly's hashing functions are used in security-sensitive contexts (e.g., password hashing) without proper salting or with weak algorithms, it could lead to security vulnerabilities. | **High:** Authentication bypass, information disclosure. | `Hashing` utilities within Folly. | **High** | * **Use dedicated cryptographic libraries for security-sensitive hashing:**  Folly's hashing functions are generally for performance and not intended for strong cryptographic purposes. Use libraries like OpenSSL or libsodium for password hashing. * **Always use salts:** When using hashing for authentication, ensure proper salting of passwords. |
