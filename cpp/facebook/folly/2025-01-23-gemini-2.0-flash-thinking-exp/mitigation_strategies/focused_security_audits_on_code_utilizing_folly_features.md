*   **Prioritize Audit Scope:** Prioritization based on data sensitivity, external input, and complexity is a standard security practice and is feasible to implement. Risk assessment methodologies can be applied to guide prioritization.
*   **Expert Review of Folly Integration:** This is the most critical and potentially challenging aspect.  Finding security experts or developers with deep Folly knowledge might require investment in training, hiring, or external consultants.  However, leveraging existing senior developers with C++ expertise and providing them with Folly-specific training is a viable option.
*   **Focus on Folly-Specific Vulnerability Types:**  This is feasible if auditors are provided with checklists, training, and knowledge resources about common Folly-related vulnerabilities.  Sharing knowledge and creating internal documentation can facilitate this.

**Overall Feasibility:** While requiring dedicated resources and expertise, the strategy is practically implementable, especially in organizations already conducting security audits.  The key challenge lies in securing the necessary Folly expertise.

#### 4.3. Cost and Resource Implications

The cost and resource implications are **medium**.

*   **Personnel Costs:**  Involving security experts or experienced developers with Folly knowledge will incur personnel costs.  The extent of these costs depends on whether internal resources can be trained or external consultants are needed.
