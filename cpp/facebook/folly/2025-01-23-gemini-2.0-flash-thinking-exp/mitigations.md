        *   Memory leaks in code using Folly's custom allocators or manual memory management patterns.
        *   Double frees and use-after-free vulnerabilities in code interacting with Folly's data structures and algorithms.
        *   Buffer overflows, especially in areas where Folly is used for string manipulation or data serialization/deserialization.
    4.  **Review and Address Findings:** Establish a process to review static analysis reports, focusing on issues flagged in code using Folly. Prioritize fixing high-severity memory safety issues.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
