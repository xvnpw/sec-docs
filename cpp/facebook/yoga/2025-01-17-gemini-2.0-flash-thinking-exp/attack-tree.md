## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Yoga Input -> Provide Malicious Layout Definitions -> Exploit Integer Overflows in Layout Calculations:](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_yoga_input_-_provide_malicious_layout_definitions_-_exploit_integer_overflows_in_layout_c_6a910a97.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific layout definitions containing extremely large positive or negative values for properties like `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, `borderWidth`, etc. These values are designed to cause integer overflows during Yoga's layout calculations.

**Mechanism:** When Yoga performs arithmetic operations on these large or negative values, the result can wrap around, leading to unexpected and incorrect layout calculations. This can cause application crashes due to out-of-bounds memory access or other unexpected behavior. In some cases, carefully crafted overflows could potentially be leveraged for memory corruption.

**Impact:** Application crash, unexpected layout rendering, potential memory corruption leading to further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Yoga Input -> Provide Malicious Layout Definitions -> Trigger Infinite Loops or Recursive Layout Calculations:](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_yoga_input_-_provide_malicious_layout_definitions_-_trigger_infinite_loops_or_recursive_l_ebe89e7d.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides layout definitions that create circular dependencies between elements (e.g., element A's size depends on element B's size, and element B's size depends on element A's size) or define excessively deep nesting of layout elements.

**Mechanism:** Yoga's layout engine attempts to resolve these dependencies or calculate the layout for the deeply nested structure. This can lead to an infinite loop or an extremely long calculation process, consuming excessive CPU and memory resources.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by exhausting server resources, making the application unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Input Parsing Mechanism -> Trigger Buffer Overflows in the Parser:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_input_parsing_mechanism_-_trigger_buffer_overflows_in_the_parser.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application uses a parsing mechanism (e.g., to parse JSON or a custom format for layout definitions) that has buffer overflow vulnerabilities, an attacker can send excessively long strings for layout properties.

**Mechanism:** When the parsing mechanism attempts to store the overly long string in a fixed-size buffer, it overflows the buffer, potentially overwriting adjacent memory locations. This can lead to application crashes or, in more severe cases, allow the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential for arbitrary code execution, allowing the attacker to gain control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Input Parsing Mechanism -> Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_the_input_parsing_mechanism_-_exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_c4ccae1a.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application deserializes layout definitions from an untrusted source (e.g., user input, external file), and the deserialization library is vulnerable, an attacker can embed malicious objects within the serialized data.

**Mechanism:** When the application deserializes the data, the malicious objects are instantiated. These objects can contain code that executes upon deserialization, allowing the attacker to perform actions like remote code execution, data exfiltration, or other malicious activities.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data corruption, data breaches, complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
