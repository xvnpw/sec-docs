## Attack Surface: [Circular Dependencies in Layout](./attack_surfaces/circular_dependencies_in_layout.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers create layout configurations where the size or position of one node depends on another, which in turn depends on the first, creating a circular dependency.
    *   **How Yoga Contributes:** Yoga's layout algorithm might enter an infinite loop or perform excessive calculations trying to resolve these circular dependencies.
    *   **Example:** Node A's width is set to be equal to Node B's height, and Node B's height is set to be equal to Node A's width.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Infinite loops in the layout calculation, leading to application hangs or crashes.
        *   Excessive CPU usage, causing performance degradation or DoS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Checks:** Implement checks within the application logic to detect and prevent the creation of circular dependencies before passing the layout configuration to Yoga.
        *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts for layout calculations to prevent indefinite looping.
        *   **Careful Layout Design:** Educate developers on best practices for layout design to avoid introducing circular dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying C++ Code](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_c++_code.md)

*   **Description:**  Memory safety issues (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) or other vulnerabilities exist within the Yoga library's C++ implementation.
    *   **How Yoga Contributes:** Yoga is implemented in C++, making it susceptible to common C++ vulnerabilities if not carefully coded.
    *   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability in a function that calculates node dimensions based on provided properties.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code execution, allowing attackers to run arbitrary code on the server or client.
        *   Application crashes and denial of service.
        *   Information disclosure by reading sensitive memory.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Yoga Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version of Yoga to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Utilize static analysis tools on the Yoga codebase (if possible and within your security posture) to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Employ fuzzing techniques to test Yoga's robustness against unexpected or malformed inputs.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Yoga's Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_yoga's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist in libraries or components that Yoga depends on.
    *   **How Yoga Contributes:** If Yoga uses vulnerable dependencies, the application indirectly inherits those vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Yoga depends on a specific version of a logging library that has a known remote code execution vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency (e.g., remote code execution, information disclosure, DoS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (Can be High or Critical depending on the dependency vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan Yoga's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   **Keep Yoga Updated:** Updating Yoga often includes updates to its dependencies, addressing potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to Yoga and its dependencies.
