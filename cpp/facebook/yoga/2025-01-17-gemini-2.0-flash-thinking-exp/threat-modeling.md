# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/yoga

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Malicious Layout Complexity](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_malicious_layout_complexity.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides intentionally complex or deeply nested layout data. When the application attempts to process this data using Yoga, the layout calculation module consumes excessive CPU and memory resources *within the Yoga library itself*. This can lead to the application becoming unresponsive or crashing for legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability, degraded performance, potential server overload.
*   **Affected Component:** Yoga Layout Calculation Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement limits on the depth and complexity of layout structures allowed *before* passing data to Yoga.
    *   Set timeouts for Yoga layout calculations to prevent indefinite processing.
    *   Consider using a separate thread or process for layout calculations to isolate potential DoS impacts.
    *   Implement resource monitoring and alerting for excessive CPU and memory usage *during Yoga layout processing*.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Parsing Vulnerabilities in Layout Data](./threats/exploitation_of_parsing_vulnerabilities_in_layout_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malformed or specially crafted layout data that exploits vulnerabilities in Yoga's parsing logic. This could potentially lead to crashes or unexpected behavior *within the Yoga library*, or, in extreme cases, even remote code execution within the context of the application (though highly unlikely with a mature library like Yoga).
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, potential for arbitrary code execution (low probability but high impact if it occurs).
*   **Affected Component:** Yoga Layout Data Parsing Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potential for critical impact)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the Yoga library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   If possible, implement a secondary validation layer for layout data before it reaches Yoga.
    *   Monitor Yoga's release notes and security advisories for any reported parsing vulnerabilities.
