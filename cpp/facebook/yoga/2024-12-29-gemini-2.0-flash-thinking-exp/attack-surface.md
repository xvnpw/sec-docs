Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Yoga, with high and critical risk severity:

*   **Maliciously Crafted Layout Specifications (Excessive Nesting/Size):**
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides layout specifications with an extremely large number of nodes or deeply nested structures.
    *   **How Yoga Contributes:** Yoga's core function is to process and calculate layouts based on these specifications. Inefficient handling of excessively complex structures can lead to resource exhaustion.
    *   **Example:**  A user provides a JSON layout object with thousands of nested `<div>` equivalents, each with minimal content, forcing Yoga to perform a massive number of calculations.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) leading to application unresponsiveness or crashes due to excessive CPU or memory consumption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the depth and size of layout specifications accepted by the application.
        *   Implement timeouts for layout calculations to prevent indefinite processing.
        *   Consider using techniques like iterative layout algorithms or virtualized rendering for very large layouts.
