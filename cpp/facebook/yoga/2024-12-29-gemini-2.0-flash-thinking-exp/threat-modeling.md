Here is the updated threat list, focusing only on high and critical threats directly involving the Facebook Yoga library:

*   **Threat:** Malformed Layout Definitions
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious layout definitions (e.g., in JSON format) containing unexpected characters, deeply nested structures, or excessively large values. They submit this through an API endpoint or configuration file processed by the application. Yoga's input parser attempts to process this malformed data.
    *   **Impact:** The Yoga component crashes, leading to a denial of service. The application becomes unresponsive or terminates unexpectedly. This disrupts functionality for legitimate users and may require manual intervention to restart the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Yoga's Input Parser (the code responsible for interpreting layout definitions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all layout definitions before passing them to Yoga.
        *   Use a schema validation library to ensure the layout definition conforms to the expected structure and data types.
        *   Set limits on the size and complexity of layout definitions (e.g., maximum nesting depth, maximum number of nodes).
        *   Implement error handling to gracefully catch parsing errors and prevent application crashes.

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion through Layout Complexity
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a layout definition with an excessive number of nodes, deeply nested structures, or highly complex flexbox configurations. When Yoga attempts to calculate the layout for such a complex structure, it consumes significant CPU and memory resources.
    *   **Impact:** The application becomes slow and unresponsive, potentially leading to denial of service for legitimate users. The server hosting the application might experience high CPU and memory usage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Yoga's Layout Calculation Engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the complexity of layout definitions (e.g., maximum number of nodes, maximum nesting depth).
        *   Implement timeouts for layout calculations to prevent indefinite resource consumption.
        *   Consider techniques like virtualization or pagination for displaying large datasets to reduce the number of layout nodes.
        *   Monitor resource usage of the application and identify potential bottlenecks related to layout calculations.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Yoga Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Yoga might rely on other underlying libraries or system components. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them indirectly through Yoga.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Yoga's Dependencies (the external libraries and components that Yoga relies on).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the dependency vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Yoga and all its dependencies to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
        *   Perform security scanning on dependencies to identify known vulnerabilities.
