## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Layout Complexity](./mitigation_strategies/limit_layout_complexity.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify key layout areas:** Analyze your application's UI to pinpoint areas where Yoga layouts are dynamically generated or potentially complex (e.g., lists, grids, dynamic forms).
    2.  **Set maximum nesting depth:**  Define a maximum allowed depth for the Yoga node tree.  Implement checks during Yoga layout creation to prevent exceeding this depth. If the limit is reached, log an error and potentially simplify the layout or refuse to render it.
    3.  **Limit child node count:**  Establish a maximum number of child nodes allowed for any single Yoga node.  Enforce this limit during Yoga layout construction. If exceeded, log an error and handle gracefully (e.g., truncate lists, simplify complex elements).
    4.  **Restrict dynamic property ranges:**  For Yoga layout properties like `flex-basis`, `width`, and `height` that are dynamically set, define reasonable maximum and minimum values. Validate input data against these ranges before applying them to Yoga nodes.
    5.  **Regularly review layout performance:**  Periodically profile your application's Yoga layout performance, especially in areas identified as potentially complex. Identify and refactor Yoga layouts that are consistently slow or resource-intensive.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to Complex Layout Calculations (Severity: High)
        *   Memory Exhaustion due to Deeply Nested Layouts (Severity: Medium)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS due to Complex Layout Calculations: High Reduction
        *   Memory Exhaustion due to Deeply Nested Layouts: Medium Reduction

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented
        *   Maximum nesting depth is defined in UI guidelines document.
        *   Basic input validation exists for some dynamic properties in form components.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Enforcement of maximum nesting depth and child node count in Yoga layout creation code.
        *   Comprehensive input validation for all dynamically set Yoga layout properties across the application.
        *   Automated Yoga layout performance monitoring and alerting.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Quotas for Layout Calculations](./mitigation_strategies/resource_quotas_for_layout_calculations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Layout Timeout:**  Wrap Yoga layout calculation calls with a timeout mechanism.  Use asynchronous operations or timers to interrupt Yoga layout calculations that exceed a predefined duration (e.g., 100ms, 500ms).
    2.  **Error Handling for Timeout:**  When a Yoga layout timeout occurs, log a detailed error message including the context of the Yoga layout calculation.  Implement fallback behavior, such as displaying a simplified layout or an error message to the user, instead of crashing or hanging the application.
    3.  **CPU and Memory Monitoring:**  Integrate system monitoring tools or libraries to track CPU and memory usage during Yoga layout operations.  Establish thresholds for acceptable resource consumption.
    4.  **Circuit Breaker/Throttling:**  If resource usage exceeds thresholds repeatedly or Yoga layout timeouts occur frequently in a specific area, implement a circuit breaker pattern to temporarily halt or throttle Yoga layout calculations in that area. This prevents cascading failures and protects system resources.
    5.  **Adjust Quotas Based on Performance:**  Continuously monitor Yoga layout performance and resource usage in production.  Adjust timeout values and resource thresholds based on observed performance and user experience.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Background Layout Processing](./mitigation_strategies/background_layout_processing.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Blocking Layout Operations:**  Profile your application to identify Yoga layout operations that block the main UI thread, causing jank or unresponsiveness.
    2.  **Offload to Background Threads/Processes:**  Refactor code to move computationally intensive Yoga layout calculations to background threads or processes. Utilize threading or concurrency mechanisms provided by your development platform (e.g., Web Workers in JavaScript, threads in native languages).
    3.  **Asynchronous Yoga APIs:**  Utilize asynchronous APIs provided by your Yoga bindings if available.  This allows Yoga layout calculations to run concurrently without blocking the main thread.
    4.  **Communication with Main Thread:**  Establish a communication mechanism between background threads/processes and the main UI thread to pass Yoga layout results back for rendering.  Use message passing or shared memory techniques.
    5.  **Progressive Layout Rendering:**  Consider implementing progressive rendering techniques.  Calculate and render initial Yoga layouts quickly in the foreground to provide immediate feedback to the user, and then refine or complete more complex Yoga layouts in the background.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) due to Complex Layout Calculations (Severity: Medium - Reduces impact on user experience)

    *   **Impact:**

    2.  **Implement Layout Cache:**  Create a caching mechanism to store the results of Yoga layout calculations.  Use a suitable data structure like a hash map or dictionary, keyed by Yoga layout configuration or input data.
    3.  **Cache Invalidation Strategy:**  Define a clear cache invalidation strategy.  Determine conditions under which cached Yoga layouts should be invalidated and recalculated (e.g., data changes, configuration updates, UI theme changes).
    4.  **Cache Size Limits:**  Implement limits on the size of the Yoga layout cache to prevent excessive memory usage.  Use eviction policies (e.g., LRU - Least Recently Used) to manage cache size.
    5.  **Cache Persistence (Optional):**  For frequently accessed Yoga layouts, consider persisting the cache to local storage or disk to improve startup performance and reduce initial Yoga layout calculation time.
