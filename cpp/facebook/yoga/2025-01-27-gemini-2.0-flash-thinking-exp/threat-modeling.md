## Threat: [Malicious Layout Specification Parsing leading to Memory Corruption](./threats/malicious_layout_specification_parsing_leading_to_memory_corruption.md)

Description: An attacker crafts a highly specific and malformed layout specification (e.g., JSON) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Yoga's parsing logic. This crafted input aims to trigger a buffer overflow, out-of-bounds write, or other memory corruption issues within Yoga's native code during parsing. Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to overwrite critical memory regions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or a complete system compromise.
Impact: Critical. Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete system compromise, data breach, Denial of Service (DoS).
Yoga Component Affected: Yoga Parser (Input processing module, specifically native code parsing logic)
Risk Severity: High (potentially Critical depending on exploitability and impact in specific environments)
Mitigation Strategies:
    Prioritize regular Yoga updates: Immediately apply security patches and updates released by the Yoga team, as parsing vulnerabilities are often targeted for fixes.
    Implement robust input validation and sanitization: While Yoga should handle parsing safely, defense-in-depth is crucial.  Perform strict validation of layout specifications before they reach Yoga, checking for unexpected data types, excessive lengths, and malformed structures.
    Utilize memory safety tools during development: Employ tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) during development and testing to detect memory corruption issues early.
    Consider sandboxing Yoga processing: If feasible for your application architecture, isolate Yoga's processing within a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential memory corruption vulnerabilities.
    Thorough fuzzing of Yoga parser: Conduct extensive fuzz testing of Yoga's parser with a wide range of malformed and malicious inputs to proactively identify and fix potential parsing vulnerabilities before attackers can exploit them.
