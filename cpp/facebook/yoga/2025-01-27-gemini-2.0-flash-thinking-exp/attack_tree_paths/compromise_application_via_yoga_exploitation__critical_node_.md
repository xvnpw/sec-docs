* **Provide actionable insights** for the development team to enhance the application's security posture related to Yoga integration.

### 2. Scope

This analysis is focused specifically on the attack path:

**Compromise Application via Yoga Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]**

* **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Facebook Yoga layout engine or flaws in its integration within the application.
* **Target:** The application that utilizes the `facebook/yoga` library for layout management.
* **Boundaries:** The analysis will consider vulnerabilities originating from:
    * **Yoga library itself:** Including potential bugs in its core C++ code, layout algorithms, and parsing logic.
