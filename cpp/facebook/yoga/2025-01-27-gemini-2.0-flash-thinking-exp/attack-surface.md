# Attack Surface Analysis for facebook/yoga

## Attack Surface: [1. Memory Management Vulnerabilities (Buffer Overflows & Use-After-Free)](./attack_surfaces/1__memory_management_vulnerabilities__buffer_overflows_&_use-after-free_.md)

Description: Critical vulnerabilities within Yoga's C++ implementation related to improper memory management, specifically buffer overflows and use-after-free errors. These can potentially lead to code execution or significant application instability.
*   **Yoga Contribution:** Yoga is implemented in C++, requiring manual memory management.  Bugs in memory allocation, deallocation, or data handling within Yoga's core logic can lead to these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**  A buffer overflow could occur if Yoga copies layout property data into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking. If an attacker can influence layout properties to provide excessively long strings or data exceeding the buffer size, it could overwrite adjacent memory regions. A use-after-free could occur if Yoga incorrectly manages the lifecycle of layout nodes or internal data structures, leading to access of freed memory.
*   **Impact:**  **Critical**. Buffer overflows and use-after-free vulnerabilities can potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution, allowing attackers to gain control of the application or system. They can also lead to application crashes and data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Immediately apply updates to Yoga to patch known security vulnerabilities, including memory management issues. Monitor Yoga's security advisories and release notes.
    *   **Code Audits (Yoga Developers):**  For Yoga developers, prioritize rigorous code reviews and utilize static and dynamic analysis tools to proactively identify and eliminate memory management vulnerabilities in Yoga's C++ codebase. Focus on secure coding practices in C++.
    *   **Memory Safety Practices (Yoga Developers):** Yoga developers must strictly adhere to modern C++ memory safety practices, including RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization), smart pointers, and bounds checking, to minimize the risk of memory management errors.

## Attack Surface: [2. Input Data Processing Vulnerabilities Leading to Memory Corruption (Integer Overflows)](./attack_surfaces/2__input_data_processing_vulnerabilities_leading_to_memory_corruption__integer_overflows_.md)

Description: High severity vulnerabilities arising from processing maliciously crafted or unexpected input layout specifications that cause integer overflows within Yoga's calculations, potentially leading to memory corruption.
*   **Yoga Contribution:** Yoga directly processes numerical layout properties. Integer overflows in calculations involving these properties (e.g., `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, especially when combined with `flexGrow`, `flexShrink`) can corrupt memory if not handled correctly.
*   **Example:**  Providing extremely large integer values for properties like `width` and `margin` in a complex layout. If Yoga's internal calculations for layout dimensions or offsets involve these large values without proper overflow checks, an integer overflow could occur. This overflowed value might then be used in memory access operations, leading to out-of-bounds writes and memory corruption.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Integer overflows leading to memory corruption can cause application crashes, unpredictable behavior, and potentially create pathways for exploitation if the corrupted memory regions are security-sensitive. While direct code execution might be less likely than with buffer overflows, the impact is still severe.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation with Overflow Prevention:** Implement robust input validation on layout property values *before* they are passed to Yoga.  Specifically, perform checks to ensure that numerical properties are within safe ranges that will not cause integer overflows during Yoga's internal calculations. Use safe integer arithmetic practices where applicable.
    *   **Range Checks and Limits:**  Enforce strict range checks on numerical layout properties.  Define maximum and minimum acceptable values to prevent excessively large or small inputs that could trigger overflows.
    *   **Sanitization and Clipping:** Sanitize or clip input values that are outside the acceptable ranges. Ensure that even if unexpected large values are provided, they are clamped to safe limits before being used in Yoga's calculations.
