## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos___high_risk_.md)

*   Overall Description: This is the most likely and impactful category of attacks. The attacker aims to make the application unresponsive or crash it by exploiting vulnerabilities in Yoga's layout calculations or resource management.
*   Likelihood: High
*   Impact: High (Application freeze/crash, potential server impact)
*   Effort: Varies (Low to High, depending on the specific sub-attack)
*   Skill Level: Varies (Intermediate to Advanced)
*   Detection Difficulty: Varies (Easy to Hard)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Infinite Layout Loop](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__infinite_layout_loop.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Craft Malicious Style Configurations (e.g., conflicting flex properties, cyclic dependencies) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__craft_malicious_style_configurations__e_g___conflicting_flex_properties__cyclic_dependencies__2393848c.md)

*   Description: The attacker provides a set of style properties that create a situation where Yoga's layout algorithm cannot reach a stable solution, resulting in an infinite loop. This could be due to conflicting flex properties, cyclic dependencies between nodes, or other edge cases.
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High (Application freeze/crash)
*   Effort: Medium
*   Skill Level: Intermediate
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires monitoring for hangs/crashes)
*   Mitigation:
    *   Rigorous input validation of all style properties.
    *   Fuzz testing to identify edge cases.
    *   Implementation of loop detection mechanisms (if not already present in Yoga).
    *   Limit on the maximum number of layout iterations.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Exploit Edge Cases in Flexbox Algorithm Implementation [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__exploit_edge_cases_in_flexbox_algorithm_implementation__high_risk_.md)

*   Description: The attacker leverages specific, potentially undocumented, combinations of flexbox properties (e.g., `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, `flex-basis`, `align-items`, `justify-content`) that trigger an infinite loop due to subtle bugs or limitations in Yoga's implementation of the Flexbox algorithm.
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High (Application freeze/crash)
*   Effort: Medium
*   Skill Level: Intermediate
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Requires monitoring for hangs/crashes)
*   Mitigation:
    *   Extensive fuzz testing focused on Flexbox properties.
    *   Careful code review of the Flexbox implementation in Yoga.
    *   Input validation to restrict unusual or extreme combinations of Flexbox properties.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Excessive Memory Consumption (Memory Exhaustion) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__excessive_memory_consumption__memory_exhaustion___high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Trigger Deeply Nested Layouts [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__trigger_deeply_nested_layouts__critical_.md)

*   Description: The attacker provides input that causes Yoga to create a very deeply nested tree of layout nodes.  Each node consumes memory, and a sufficiently deep tree can exhaust available memory, leading to a crash.
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High (Application crash, potential server impact)
*   Effort: Low
*   Skill Level: Intermediate
*   Detection Difficulty: Easy (Memory usage monitoring)
*   Mitigation:
    *   Strict limits on the maximum nesting depth of layout nodes.
    *   Input validation to reject excessively nested structures.
    *   Resource limits (e.g., cgroups) to constrain Yoga's memory usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Provide Input that Creates Exponentially Growing Node Tree [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__provide_input_that_creates_exponentially_growing_node_tree__high_risk_.md)

*   Description:  The attacker crafts input (e.g., a recursive structure or a structure with a large branching factor) that causes the number of layout nodes to grow exponentially with the nesting depth. This accelerates memory consumption and makes it easier to trigger a crash.
*   Likelihood: Medium
*   Impact: High (Application crash, potential server impact)
*   Effort: Low
*   Skill Level: Intermediate
*   Detection Difficulty: Easy (Memory usage monitoring)
*   Mitigation:
    *   Strict limits on nesting depth and the total number of nodes.
    *   Input validation to prevent recursive or excessively branching structures.
    *   Resource limits (e.g., cgroups) to constrain Yoga's memory usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4. Crash due to unhandled exception [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4__crash_due_to_unhandled_exception__high_risk_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.1 Integer overflow [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_1_integer_overflow__critical_.md)

*   Description: The attacker provides extremely large integer values for dimensions (width, height, margins, padding) or other numeric inputs to Yoga, causing an integer overflow during calculations. This can lead to unexpected behavior, memory corruption, and ultimately a crash.
*   Likelihood: Low
*   Impact: High (Application crash)
*   Effort: Low
*   Skill Level: Intermediate
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Crash reports, debugging)
*   Mitigation:
    *   **Strict input validation:** Check all numeric inputs for reasonable bounds *before* passing them to Yoga.  Reject excessively large or negative values where inappropriate.
    *   Use data types that can accommodate the expected range of values.
    *   Consider using checked arithmetic operations (if available in the programming language) to detect overflows.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.1.1 Provide extremely large values for dimensions or other numeric inputs. [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_1_1_provide_extremely_large_values_for_dimensions_or_other_numeric_inputs___high_risk_.md)

*   Description: This is the specific action the attacker takes to trigger the integer overflow. They would manipulate the input data (e.g., through a web form, API call, or other input mechanism) to include very large numbers.
*   Likelihood: Low
*   Impact: High (Application crash)
*   Effort: Low
*   Skill Level: Intermediate
*   Detection Difficulty: Medium (Crash reports, debugging)
*   Mitigation:
    *   **Strict input validation:** This is the primary defense. Implement robust checks to ensure that all numeric inputs are within acceptable ranges.
