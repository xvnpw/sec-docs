# Threat Model Analysis for facebook/yoga

## Threat: [Excessive Node Nesting DoS](./threats/excessive_node_nesting_dos.md)

*   **Threat:** Excessive Node Nesting DoS

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts an input layout configuration with an extremely deep hierarchy of nested nodes (e.g., thousands of nested nodes). This overwhelms Yoga's recursive layout calculations.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to excessive CPU consumption and/or stack overflow.
    *   **Affected Yoga Component:** `YGNodeCalculateLayout` (and recursively called functions within it), the core layout calculation function. The node tree structure (`YGNodeRef`) is also implicated.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (Nesting Depth Limit):** Impose a strict limit on the maximum allowed nesting depth of nodes in the layout configuration. A reasonable limit (e.g., 50-100 levels) should be sufficient.
        *   **Recursive Depth Check:** Within the application code that processes the layout configuration *before* passing it to Yoga, implement a check for excessive nesting depth.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement a timeout for the overall layout calculation. If it exceeds the timeout, terminate the calculation.

## Threat: [Extreme Dimension Values DoS](./threats/extreme_dimension_values_dos.md)

*   **Threat:** Extreme Dimension Values DoS

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides layout configurations with extremely large values for dimensions (width, height, margins, padding) or flex properties (flex-grow, flex-shrink). This can lead to integer overflows or excessive memory allocation.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) or potentially memory corruption. The application may crash, become unresponsive, or exhibit unexpected behavior.
    *   **Affected Yoga Component:** `YGNodeCalculateLayout`, specifically the parts handling dimension calculations and constraint solving. Functions related to floating-point arithmetic and rounding are also relevant.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation (Value Range Limits):** Enforce strict limits on the maximum and minimum allowed values for all dimension and flex properties. Use reasonable, context-specific limits.
        *   **Sanitize Input:** Before passing values to Yoga, sanitize them to ensure they are within acceptable bounds. Clamp values to the limits if necessary.
        *   **Overflow Checks (if applicable):** If working with a language/environment where integer overflows are a concern, add explicit checks.

## Threat: [Yoga Library Tampering (Supply Chain)](./threats/yoga_library_tampering__supply_chain_.md)

*   **Threat:** Yoga Library Tampering (Supply Chain)

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Yoga library itself (e.g., through a compromised dependency or a malicious build) and injects malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially any of the above (DoS, Information Disclosure, Spoofing), or even arbitrary code execution, depending on the nature of the injected code.
    *   **Affected Yoga Component:** Potentially any part of the Yoga library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Trusted Sources:** Obtain Yoga from official sources (e.g., official GitHub repository, trusted package manager).
        *   **Verify Integrity:** Use checksums or digital signatures to verify the integrity of the Yoga library before using it.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use a secure dependency management system that can detect and prevent the inclusion of compromised dependencies.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Yoga and all related dependencies up-to-date.
