## Mitigation Strategy: [Schema Validation for Layout Input](./mitigation_strategies/schema_validation_for_layout_input.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define a strict schema that outlines the allowed structure, data types, and value ranges specifically for Yoga layout properties (e.g., `flexDirection`, `width`, `height`, `margin`, etc.). This schema should be tailored to the properties and values that your application actually uses with Yoga.
    2.  Integrate a validation library or function to check all incoming layout data against this Yoga-specific schema *before* it is passed to the Yoga layout engine.
    3.  For each layout definition intended for Yoga, parse it and validate if the Yoga-related properties conform to the defined schema.
    4.  If validation fails for Yoga properties, reject the input and log an error related to invalid Yoga layout definition. Do not proceed with Yoga layout calculation using invalid input.
    5.  Regularly review and update the Yoga-specific schema to reflect the expected and safe structure of Yoga layout definitions as your application evolves and uses different Yoga features.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Yoga Layout Injection (High Severity):** Attackers could inject crafted layout definitions with unexpected or malicious Yoga properties or values that exploit vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior within the Yoga layout engine itself.
        *   **Yoga Layout Processing Errors (Medium Severity):**  Incorrectly formatted or unexpected Yoga input data could lead to errors, crashes, or unpredictable layout behavior specifically within the Yoga engine.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Yoga Layout Injection:** High risk reduction. Schema validation specifically targets and blocks injection of unexpected or malicious Yoga layout structures at the input stage, preventing them from reaching the Yoga engine.
        *   **Yoga Layout Processing Errors:** Medium risk reduction. Validation ensures Yoga-specific data conforms to expected formats, reducing errors caused by malformed input *intended for Yoga*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in the API input validation module. Currently validates basic data types but lacks detailed schema specifically for Yoga properties and their valid ranges.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Need to define a comprehensive schema specifically covering all relevant Yoga properties and their constraints (data types, allowed values, ranges, etc.).
        *   Extend the existing input validation module to fully enforce the defined Yoga-specific schema for all layout inputs that are processed by the Yoga engine.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Layout Complexity (Yoga Specific Metrics)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_layout_complexity__yoga_specific_metrics_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Determine reasonable limits for Yoga layout complexity based on your application's performance when using Yoga and typical UI structures rendered by Yoga. Focus on metrics directly related to Yoga's processing:
        *   Maximum number of Yoga nodes in a layout tree.
        *   Maximum depth of Yoga layout nesting.
        *   Consider the combination of Yoga style properties used per node, as some combinations might be more computationally expensive for Yoga.
    2.  Implement checks in your application *before* or *during* Yoga layout construction to enforce these Yoga-specific complexity limits.
    3.  If a Yoga layout definition exceeds the defined complexity limits (in terms of Yoga nodes, depth, etc.), reject it and log an error related to excessive Yoga layout complexity.
    4.  Provide informative error messages indicating that the Yoga layout is too complex and needs to be simplified for efficient Yoga processing.
    5.  Regularly review and adjust these Yoga-specific complexity limits based on performance monitoring of Yoga layout calculations and application evolution.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Yoga Layouts (High Severity):** Attackers could provide extremely complex Yoga layout definitions specifically designed to consume excessive CPU and memory resources *during Yoga layout calculation*, leading to application slowdown or crashes due to Yoga processing.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Yoga Layouts:** High risk reduction. Limiting Yoga-specific complexity directly prevents processing of excessively resource-intensive layouts *by the Yoga engine*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic limits on the number of UI elements exist, but these are not directly tied to Yoga layout complexity metrics like node count or depth within the Yoga tree structure.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Need to implement specific checks for Yoga layout tree depth and Yoga node count during layout construction, focusing on metrics relevant to Yoga's internal processing.
        *   Integrate these Yoga-specific complexity checks directly into the layout processing pipeline, ideally before passing the layout to Yoga for calculation.
        *   Fine-tune the Yoga complexity limits based on performance testing and real-world usage patterns, specifically measuring Yoga layout calculation times and resource consumption.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout for Yoga Layout Calculations](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_for_yoga_layout_calculations.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Determine an acceptable maximum execution time specifically for the `YGLayoutCalculate` function or its equivalent in your Yoga bindings. This timeout should be based on performance requirements and user experience expectations *related to layout rendering*.
    2.  Implement a timeout mechanism specifically around the call to the Yoga layout calculation function (`YGLayoutCalculate` or similar).
    3.  Start a timer immediately before calling the Yoga layout calculation function.
    4.  If the Yoga layout calculation exceeds the defined timeout period, interrupt the Yoga calculation process.
    5.  Handle the timeout event gracefully. Log an error indicating a Yoga layout calculation timeout and return an error response if necessary. Ensure the application remains stable and does not crash due to a Yoga timeout.
    6.  Investigate layouts that frequently trigger Yoga calculation timeouts to understand if they are genuinely complex or if there might be performance issues within Yoga or its integration.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation in Yoga (High Severity):**  Attackers might craft layouts that exploit potential algorithmic inefficiencies *within Yoga's layout engine itself*, causing excessively long Yoga calculation times and leading to DoS specifically due to slow Yoga processing.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Algorithmic Complexity Exploitation in Yoga:** High risk reduction. Timeouts prevent indefinite execution of Yoga layout calculations, mitigating DoS caused by slow or inefficient layouts *processed by Yoga*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Timeouts are implemented at the request level, but not specifically for individual Yoga layout calculations.  General request timeouts might indirectly limit Yoga calculation time, but are not targeted.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Need to implement a more granular timeout mechanism specifically for the `YGLayoutCalculate` function or its equivalent in the Yoga bindings used.
        *   Integrate this timeout directly around the Yoga layout calculation call within the layout processing function.
        *   Configure an appropriate timeout duration based on performance testing and expected Yoga layout calculation times for typical and complex layouts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Yoga Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_yoga_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a process for regularly monitoring for updates to the `facebook/yoga` library specifically. Subscribe to Yoga release notifications, watch the Yoga GitHub repository, or use dependency management tools that specifically track Yoga updates.
    2.  When a new version of Yoga is released, *prioritize reviewing the release notes and changelog for security fixes or vulnerability patches specifically within the Yoga library itself*.
    3.  Prioritize applying Yoga updates that address identified security vulnerabilities in Yoga.
    4.  Test the updated Yoga library thoroughly in a staging environment before deploying it to production.  Focus testing on areas potentially affected by Yoga changes and ensure continued correct layout behavior.
    5.  Automate the Yoga library update process as much as possible using dependency management tools and CI/CD pipelines to ensure timely application of Yoga security patches.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Yoga Vulnerabilities (Severity Varies - can be High):**  If vulnerabilities are discovered and publicly disclosed *specifically in the `facebook/yoga` library*, attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities in applications using older, unpatched versions of Yoga.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Yoga Vulnerabilities:** High risk reduction. Regularly updating Yoga patches known vulnerabilities *within the Yoga library*, significantly reducing the attack surface related to Yoga itself.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Dependency updates are part of the regular maintenance cycle, but Yoga library updates are not prioritized *specifically for Yoga security patches*.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Need to establish a more proactive process for monitoring Yoga security releases and prioritizing Yoga-specific security updates.
        *   Integrate security vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect outdated Yoga versions with known vulnerabilities *specifically in the Yoga library*.
        *   Define a clear policy and process for rapidly applying security updates to the Yoga library.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Memory Safety Checks (Specifically for Yoga Bindings in Memory-Unsafe Languages)](./mitigation_strategies/memory_safety_checks__specifically_for_yoga_bindings_in_memory-unsafe_languages_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  If you are using Yoga bindings in languages like C++ or other languages with manual memory management, pay extra attention to memory safety when interacting with the Yoga library's C API.
    2.  Utilize memory safety tools and techniques during development and testing, such as:
        *   AddressSanitizer (ASan)
        *   MemorySanitizer (MSan)
        *   Valgrind (Memcheck)
        *   Static analysis tools that detect memory errors (e.g., Coverity, Clang Static Analyzer).
    3.  Specifically focus these tools on code sections that interface with the Yoga C API, including:
        *   Allocation and deallocation of Yoga node structures (`YGNodeNew`, `YGNodeFree`).
        *   Setting Yoga properties (`YGNodeStyleSet...`).
        *   Retrieving layout results (`YGNodeLayoutGet...`).
    4.  Address any memory errors detected by these tools promptly. Memory leaks, buffer overflows, or use-after-free vulnerabilities in Yoga binding code can lead to crashes or exploitable security issues.
    5.  Consider using safer language features or libraries that provide memory safety guarantees if feasible for your Yoga bindings.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Yoga Bindings (High to Critical Severity in Memory-Unsafe Languages):**  Improper memory management in Yoga bindings (especially in C++) can lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and memory leaks. These can be exploited for code execution or DoS.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities in Yoga Bindings:** High risk reduction in memory-unsafe languages. Memory safety checks help detect and prevent memory-related vulnerabilities in the Yoga binding layer, which are critical for security and stability.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic memory safety practices are followed in development, but systematic use of memory safety tools specifically focused on Yoga bindings is not consistently enforced.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Need to integrate memory safety tools (ASan, MSan, Valgrind) into the CI/CD pipeline and make them a mandatory part of testing for Yoga binding code.
        *   Establish coding guidelines and training for developers on secure memory management practices when working with Yoga C API bindings.
        *   Regularly review and audit Yoga binding code for potential memory safety issues.
