## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Manipulation -> Manipulate Existing Layout Properties -> Unauthorized Modification of Layout State](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_manipulation_-_manipulate_existing_layout_properties_-_unauthorized_modification_of_la_501563c8.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages mechanisms that allow external influence on layout properties (e.g., URL parameters, user input fields, API endpoints).

**Mechanism:** The attacker crafts malicious input that modifies layout properties in unintended ways.

**Impact:** This can lead to:

*   **Visual Deception:**  Creating fake UI elements or misrepresenting information to trick users.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Manipulating layout to make the application unusable or perform poorly.
*   **Triggering Unintended Logic:** Altering layout in a way that activates application logic in an unexpected or harmful manner.

**Example:** An attacker might manipulate URL parameters controlling the position of a critical button, making it inaccessible or overlapping with a malicious element.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Output Interpretation Vulnerabilities -> Misinterpretation of Calculated Layout Values -> Incorrect Bounds Checking](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_output_interpretation_vulnerabilities_-_misinterpretation_of_calculated_layout_values_-_inco_94e96097.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific layout properties that cause Yoga to calculate layout values that, when misinterpreted by the application, bypass security checks or trigger unintended actions.

**Mechanism:** The application relies on Yoga's output for critical decisions (e.g., determining if an element is visible, handling user interactions like clicks). If the application doesn't properly validate these values, an attacker can manipulate the layout to produce misleading output.

**Impact:** This can result in:

*   **Security Bypass:**  Circumventing access controls or authentication mechanisms by manipulating perceived element positions or visibility.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  Triggering actions on unintended elements or data due to incorrect hit testing.
*   **Logic Errors:** Causing the application to execute code paths that should not be reached based on the intended layout.

**Example:** An attacker might manipulate the layout so that a hidden "delete" button appears to be a harmless "view" button, leading a user to unintentionally delete data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities -> Vulnerabilities in the Application's Yoga Binding -> Memory Leaks or Buffer Overflows](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerabilities_in_the_application's_yoga_binding_-_memory_lea_3b3df419.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker provides specific layout properties or interacts with the application in a way that triggers memory management errors within the application's Yoga binding code.

**Mechanism:**  This could involve providing unusually large or complex layout structures that exceed buffer capacities or cause memory leaks over time.

**Impact:** This can lead to:

*   **Denial of Service:** Crashing the application due to memory exhaustion or buffer overflows.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** In severe cases, attackers might be able to overwrite memory with malicious code, gaining control of the application or even the underlying system.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Memory leaks could potentially expose sensitive data residing in memory.

**Example:** An attacker might send a series of requests with deeply nested layouts, causing the application's binding to leak memory until it crashes. In a buffer overflow scenario, a carefully crafted layout could overwrite adjacent memory regions.
