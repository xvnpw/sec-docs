## Threat: [Malicious Layout Input Leading to Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/malicious_layout_input_leading_to_resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides crafted layout instructions with extremely deep nesting, excessively large dimension values, or circular dependencies. This forces Yoga's layout calculation engine to perform an enormous number of calculations or allocate excessive memory.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to high CPU or memory usage. This leads to a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Which Yoga Component is Affected:** Yoga layout calculation engine (specifically the tree traversal and constraint solving algorithms).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* Implement input validation to limit nesting depth and the size of dimension values before passing data to Yoga.
* Set timeouts for layout calculations to prevent indefinite processing.
* Monitor resource usage and implement circuit breakers to stop layout calculations if they exceed predefined thresholds.
