## Attack Surface: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities on Layout Properties](./attack_surfaces/input_validation_vulnerabilities_on_layout_properties.md)

* **Description:** The application passes user-controlled or external data directly as values for Yoga layout properties (e.g., `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`). Insufficient validation can lead to unexpected behavior within Yoga's calculations.
* **How Yoga Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Yoga directly processes these numerical values to calculate layout. If these values are maliciously crafted, Yoga's internal calculations might overflow, underflow, or lead to other unexpected states.
* **Example:** A user provides an extremely large integer for the `width` property of a view. This could cause an integer overflow within Yoga's calculation, potentially leading to a crash or unexpected memory allocation.
* **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), unexpected UI rendering, potential for memory corruption depending on how the calculated values are used subsequently.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all data used to set Yoga layout properties.
    * Set reasonable limits on the range of acceptable values for layout properties.
    * Consider using a type system or schema to enforce valid data structures for layout configurations.
