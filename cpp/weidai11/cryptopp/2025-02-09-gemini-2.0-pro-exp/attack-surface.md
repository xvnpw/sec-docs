# Attack Surface Analysis for weidai11/cryptopp

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Algorithm/Mode Selection](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_algorithmmode_selection.md)

*   **Description:** Choosing a cryptographically weak algorithm, an insecure mode of operation, or inappropriate parameters (key size, IV length, etc.) for the specific use case.
*   **How Crypto++ Contributes:** Crypto++ provides a vast array of algorithms and modes, increasing the chance of misconfiguration if developers aren't cryptographic experts.  It *allows* insecure choices.
*   **Example:** Using DES (Data Encryption Standard) for new development, or using AES in ECB (Electronic Codebook) mode, which reveals patterns in the plaintext.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of confidentiality and/or integrity of the protected data.  Attacker can decrypt data or forge messages.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Follow cryptographic best practices (NIST, OWASP) rigorously.  Document the rationale for all cryptographic choices.  Use a configuration management system to enforce approved settings.  Prioritize authenticated encryption (GCM, CCM, EAX). Conduct regular security reviews.

## Attack Surface: [Key Management Failures (Specific Crypto++ Interaction)](./attack_surfaces/key_management_failures__specific_crypto++_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of cryptographic keys *in the context of using Crypto++ for operations*. This focuses on how keys are *passed to* and *used within* Crypto++ functions, not general key storage.
*   **How Crypto++ Contributes:** Crypto++ functions require keys as input (often as `SecByteBlock` or raw byte arrays).  Incorrectly creating, passing, or handling these key representations within the application code, even if the key *storage* is secure, creates vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Using a weak key derivation function (KDF) with insufficient iterations *before* passing the derived key to a Crypto++ encryption function.  Or, failing to zero out a `SecByteBlock` *immediately* after it's used with a Crypto++ function.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all cryptographic operations relying on the mishandled key(s).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Use strong KDFs (PBKDF2, scrypt, Argon2) with appropriate parameters *before* using keys with Crypto++.  Zero out memory containing keys *immediately* after use with Crypto++ functions (using `SecByteBlock` and secure memory wiping). Ensure correct key sizes and formats are used for the chosen Crypto++ algorithms.

## Attack Surface: [Random Number Generation Weakness](./attack_surfaces/random_number_generation_weakness.md)

*   **Description:** Using a weak or improperly seeded random number generator (RNG) provided by Crypto++ for cryptographic operations.
*   **How Crypto++ Contributes:** Crypto++ offers various RNGs.  If the application chooses a weak one or misuses a strong one (e.g., not checking for errors, insufficient seeding), security is compromised.
*   **Example:** Using a predictable PRNG without proper seeding, or failing to check the return value of `AutoSeededRandomPool` to ensure it successfully generated random data.
*   **Impact:** Predictable keys, IVs, nonces, etc., leading to complete compromise of cryptographic operations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Use a CSPRNG provided by Crypto++ (e.g., `AutoSeededRandomPool`, `OS_GenerateRandomBlock`). Verify the platform-specific seeding mechanism is robust. *Always* check the return values of RNG functions.

## Attack Surface: [Timing Attacks](./attack_surfaces/timing_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting variations in the execution time of *Crypto++ cryptographic operations* to deduce information about secret keys.
*   **How Crypto++ Contributes:** Some Crypto++ functions (especially those involving modular exponentiation or elliptic curves) *may* be vulnerable if not implemented with constant-time techniques.  This is a direct property of the Crypto++ implementation.
*   **Example:** An attacker measuring the time it takes for a Crypto++ RSA decryption operation to potentially recover bits of the private key.
*   **Impact:** Partial or complete key recovery, leading to compromise of confidentiality and/or integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (often requires close proximity or specialized access)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Be aware of potentially vulnerable functions.  Use constant-time implementations where available (check Crypto++ documentation).  Consider "blinding" techniques (but implement with extreme care).  Keep Crypto++ updated.

## Attack Surface: [API Misuse](./attack_surfaces/api_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrectly using the Crypto++ API, leading to subtle but critical security flaws.
*   **How Crypto++ Contributes:** The Crypto++ API is complex, and misunderstandings can easily lead to vulnerabilities. This is a direct consequence of using the library.
*   **Example:** Reusing an IV/nonce with a stream cipher or a block cipher in a mode that requires unique IVs (like CTR, GCM), failing to authenticate ciphertext before decryption (padding oracle attacks), or mishandling exceptions thrown by Crypto++ functions.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific misuse, but can range from data corruption to complete compromise of confidentiality and/or integrity.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific misuse)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Thoroughly understand the Crypto++ documentation. Write extensive unit tests specifically for cryptographic operations. Conduct code reviews with a focus on correct API usage. Create higher-level abstractions to encapsulate Crypto++ calls and reduce direct API interaction.

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Crypto++ Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_crypto++_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Crypto++ being used.
*   **How Crypto++ Contributes:** Like any software, Crypto++ can have bugs.  Older versions may contain known vulnerabilities. This is inherent to using any third-party library.
*   **Example:**  A specific version of Crypto++ might have a flaw in its AES implementation that allows for a key recovery attack.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but can range from denial-of-service to complete compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Variable (depends on the vulnerability), potentially Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Keep Crypto++ up-to-date.  Monitor security advisories and mailing lists.  Consider using dependency management tools to automate updates.
