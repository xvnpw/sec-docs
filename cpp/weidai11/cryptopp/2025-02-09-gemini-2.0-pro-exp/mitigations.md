## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Approved Algorithm and Mode Selection (Crypto++ Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_approved_algorithm_and_mode_selection__crypto++_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Create an Approved List (Crypto++ Specific):** The approved list *must* specify the exact Crypto++ classes and parameters to be used for each approved configuration.  For example:
    *   **Approved:** `CryptoPP::AES::Encryption` with `CryptoPP::GCM<CryptoPP::AES>::Encryption`, key size 256 bits, randomly generated IV using `CryptoPP::AutoSeededRandomPool`.
    *   **Forbidden:** `CryptoPP::DES_EDE2::Encryption`, `CryptoPP::ECB_Mode_ExternalCipher`.
2.  **Mandatory Code Review (Crypto++ Focus):** The security reviewer verifies that the code uses *only* the approved Crypto++ classes and parameters, with no deviations.  This includes checking for correct instantiation, correct use of member functions, and correct handling of return values.
3.  **Wrapper Functions/Classes (Crypto++ Encapsulation):** The wrapper functions/classes *completely encapsulate* the Crypto++ implementation.  Developers should *never* directly access Crypto++ objects or functions outside of these wrappers.  The wrappers handle all Crypto++-specific details (e.g., object lifetime, memory management, exception handling).
4.  **Regular List Updates (Crypto++ Versions):** The approved list is updated not only for new cryptographic recommendations but also to reflect any changes in the Crypto++ API across different versions.  This ensures compatibility and avoids using deprecated features.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Use of Weak Crypto++ Algorithms/Modes:** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents direct use of weak or inappropriate Crypto++ classes.
*   **Incorrect Crypto++ API Usage (Algorithm/Mode):** (Severity: Critical) - Ensures correct instantiation and parameterization of Crypto++ cryptographic objects.
*   **Crypto++ Version Incompatibilities:** (Severity: Medium) - Avoids using deprecated or changed features in newer Crypto++ versions.

**Impact:**
*   **Use of Weak Crypto++ Algorithms/Modes:** Risk reduced to near zero (within the wrappers).
*   **Incorrect Crypto++ API Usage (Algorithm/Mode):** Risk significantly reduced (within the wrappers).
*   **Crypto++ Version Incompatibilities:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Approved list exists in `docs/security/crypto_approved_list.md` and includes specific Crypto++ class names.
*   Wrapper functions for symmetric encryption (`utils/crypto_wrappers.cpp`) encapsulate Crypto++ usage.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Wrapper functions for asymmetric encryption and digital signatures are missing; direct Crypto++ API calls are present in `src/signature_module.cpp`.
*   The approved list needs explicit version compatibility notes for Crypto++.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Key Generation (using Crypto++)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_key_generation__using_crypto++_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Mandatory `AutoSeededRandomPool`:**  All cryptographic keys *must* be generated using `CryptoPP::AutoSeededRandomPool`.  No other random number generators are permitted for key generation.  This is enforced through code reviews.
2.  **Key Size Validation:**  The code that generates keys *must* validate the key size against the approved list and the requirements of the chosen algorithm (using Crypto++ constants where available, e.g., `CryptoPP::AES::DEFAULT_KEYLENGTH`).
3. **Key Derivation with Crypto++ KDFs:** When deriving keys, use only approved Crypto++ KDF implementations (e.g., `CryptoPP::PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC`, `CryptoPP::Scrypt`, `CryptoPP::Argon2_Factory`). The parameters (iterations, memory cost, salt) are configured according to the approved list and validated during code review. The salt *must* be generated using `CryptoPP::AutoSeededRandomPool`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Weak Key Generation (Crypto++):** (Severity: High) - Ensures that keys are generated with sufficient entropy using Crypto++'s recommended PRNG.
*   **Incorrect Key Size (Crypto++):** (Severity: High) - Prevents using key sizes that are too small for the chosen Crypto++ algorithm.
*   **Weak Key Derivation (Crypto++):** (Severity: High) - Ensures the use of strong, approved Crypto++ KDFs with appropriate parameters.

**Impact:**
*   **Weak Key Generation (Crypto++):** Risk reduced to near zero.
*   **Incorrect Key Size (Crypto++):** Risk reduced to near zero.
*   **Weak Key Derivation (Crypto++):** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `CryptoPP::AutoSeededRandomPool` is used for key generation in `utils/key_generation.cpp`.
*   Argon2id (using `CryptoPP::Argon2_Factory`) is used for key derivation in `utils/key_derivation.cpp`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Explicit key size validation against the approved list is not consistently implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Key Deletion (using Crypto++)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_key_deletion__using_crypto++_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Mandatory `SecureWipeArray`:**  Whenever a key (or any sensitive data) held in memory is no longer needed, it *must* be securely erased using `CryptoPP::SecureWipeArray`. This applies to `CryptoPP::SecByteBlock` instances and any other buffers containing key material.
2.  **RAII with `SecByteBlock`:**  Encourage the consistent use of `CryptoPP::SecByteBlock` for storing keys and other sensitive data.  `SecByteBlock` automatically calls `SecureWipeArray` in its destructor, ensuring secure deletion when the object goes out of scope.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Key Exposure in Memory (Crypto++):** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of keys remaining in memory after they are no longer needed, making them vulnerable to memory dumps or other attacks.

**Impact:**
*   **Key Exposure in Memory (Crypto++):** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `CryptoPP::SecureWipeArray` is used in `utils/key_derivation.cpp` and `utils/crypto_wrappers.cpp`.
*   `CryptoPP::SecByteBlock` is used consistently for sensitive data.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Review all code interacting with Crypto++ to ensure consistent use of `SecureWipeArray` and `SecByteBlock`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Integer Overflow/Underflow Prevention (Crypto++ Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/integer_overflowunderflow_prevention__crypto++_interaction_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Input Validation (Crypto++ Specific):** Before passing *any* size or length value to a Crypto++ function (e.g., buffer sizes, key sizes, IV sizes), rigorously validate the value.  This includes checking for:
    *   Negative values where they are not allowed by the Crypto++ API.
    *   Values exceeding the maximum limits allowed by the specific Crypto++ class or function (consult the Crypto++ documentation).
    *   Values that could lead to integer overflows/underflows in *internal* Crypto++ calculations (this is harder to assess and may require careful analysis of the Crypto++ source code).
2.  **Fuzz Testing (Crypto++ Focus):** The custom fuzzer *must* specifically target Crypto++ functions with a wide range of input sizes, including:
    *   Very small values (near zero).
    *   Very large values (near the maximum limits of the data types).
    *   Values that are likely to cause overflows/underflows (e.g., `MAX_INT - 1`, `MAX_INT`, `MAX_INT + 1`).
    *   Values that are specifically designed to test the boundary conditions of the Crypto++ API.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Integer Overflows/Underflows in Crypto++:** (Severity: High) - Prevents vulnerabilities caused by integer overflows/underflows within Crypto++ itself or triggered by incorrect input to Crypto++ functions.

**Impact:**
*   **Integer Overflows/Underflows in Crypto++:** Risk significantly reduced (effectiveness depends heavily on the thoroughness of fuzz testing).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic input validation is present in some areas, but not consistently applied to all Crypto++ interactions.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Fuzz testing specifically targeting Crypto++ is not yet implemented.
*   Comprehensive input validation for *all* Crypto++ function calls is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Memory Management Error Prevention (Crypto++ Objects)](./mitigation_strategies/memory_management_error_prevention__crypto++_objects_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **RAII with `SecByteBlock` (Mandatory):**  `CryptoPP::SecByteBlock` *must* be used for all dynamically allocated memory that will hold sensitive data (keys, plaintexts, ciphertexts) that are processed by Crypto++.
2.  **Smart Pointers (for Crypto++ Objects):** If Crypto++ objects themselves need to be dynamically allocated (which should be minimized), use `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to manage their lifetime.  Avoid raw pointers to Crypto++ objects.
3.  **Memory Sanitizers (Crypto++ Testing):**  Run all tests that involve Crypto++ with AddressSanitizer (ASan) and MemorySanitizer (MSan) enabled.  This includes unit tests and integration tests.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Buffer Overflows (Crypto++):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents buffer overflows within Crypto++ or caused by incorrect memory management when interacting with Crypto++.
*   **Use-After-Free (Crypto++):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents use-after-free errors related to Crypto++ objects and buffers.
*   **Double-Frees (Crypto++):** (Severity: Critical) - Prevents double-free errors related to Crypto++ objects and buffers.

**Impact:**
*   **Buffer Overflows (Crypto++):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Use-After-Free (Crypto++):** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Double-Frees (Crypto++):** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `CryptoPP::SecByteBlock` is used consistently for sensitive data.
*   ASan is run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   MSan is not currently used.
*   Consistent use of smart pointers for dynamically allocated Crypto++ *objects* (not just data) needs review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Crypto++ API Misuse Prevention (Detailed)](./mitigation_strategies/crypto++_api_misuse_prevention__detailed_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **API Documentation Review (Mandatory):** Before using *any* Crypto++ API, developers *must* provide evidence (e.g., in code comments or commit messages) that they have read and understood the relevant sections of the Crypto++ documentation, including security considerations.
2.  **Unit Testing (Crypto++ Specific):** Unit tests *must* specifically target the correct usage of Crypto++ APIs.  This includes:
    *   **IV Uniqueness:** Tests that verify that a new, unique IV is generated for each encryption operation when required by the Crypto++ mode (e.g., CBC).  This often involves mocking the random number generator.
    *   **Authentication Tag Verification:** Tests that explicitly verify that the authentication tag is checked *before* decrypting or processing any data when using Crypto++ authenticated encryption modes (e.g., GCM, CCM).  This includes testing with valid and invalid tags.
    *   **Padding Handling:** Tests that verify correct padding and unpadding when using Crypto++ modes that require padding (e.g., CBC with PKCS#7).  This includes testing with various input sizes and edge cases.
    *   **Error Handling:** Tests that verify the correct handling of Crypto++ exceptions and error codes (e.g., `CryptoPP::InvalidCiphertext`, `CryptoPP::InvalidKeyLength`).
    *   **Parameter Validation:** Tests that verify that the code correctly handles invalid input parameters to Crypto++ functions (e.g., invalid key sizes, invalid IV sizes).
3.  **Code Review (Crypto++ Checklist):** Code reviews *must* include a specific checklist for Crypto++ API usage, covering the points listed above (IV handling, authentication, padding, error handling, parameter validation).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Incorrect Crypto++ IV Handling:** (Severity: Critical)
*   **Missing Crypto++ Authentication Verification:** (Severity: Critical)
*   **Incorrect Crypto++ Padding Handling:** (Severity: High)
*   **General Crypto++ API Misuse:** (Severity: Variable)
*   **Crypto++ Exception Handling Errors:** (Severity: Medium to High)

**Impact:**
*   All listed threats: Risk significantly reduced (effectiveness depends on the thoroughness of unit tests and code reviews).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Some unit tests exist, but they are not comprehensive.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive unit tests covering all aspects of Crypto++ API usage are needed.
*   A formal Crypto++ API usage checklist for code reviews is needed.
*   Mandatory documentation review is not enforced.
