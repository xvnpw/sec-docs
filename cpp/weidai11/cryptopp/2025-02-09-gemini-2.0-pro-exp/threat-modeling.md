# Threat Model Analysis for weidai11/cryptopp

## Threat: [Weak Cipher Suite Selection (Due to Developer Choice within Crypto++)](./threats/weak_cipher_suite_selection__due_to_developer_choice_within_crypto++_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers choose a weak or outdated cipher algorithm (e.g., DES, RC4) or a weak mode of operation (e.g., ECB) *available within Crypto++* for encryption.  An attacker could passively eavesdrop on encrypted communications or actively manipulate encrypted data. This is a direct misuse of Crypto++'s available options.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Confidentiality breach: Sensitive data encrypted with weak ciphers can be decrypted.
        *   Integrity violation: Data encrypted with weak modes (like ECB) can be altered.
        *   Loss of user trust, legal/regulatory consequences.
    *   **Affected Crypto++ Component:**
        *   `BlockCipher` implementations (e.g., `DES`, `AES`, `Blowfish`)
        *   `StreamCipher` implementations (e.g., `RC4`, `Salsa20`)
        *   Mode of operation classes (e.g., `ECB_Mode`, `CBC_Mode`, `CTR_Mode`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce Strong Defaults:** Configure the application to default to strong ciphers (AES-256, ChaCha20) and authenticated encryption (GCM, CCM).
        *   **Deprecate/Disable Weak Options:** Remove or disable weak ciphers/modes in the build or via runtime checks.
        *   **Code Review and Static Analysis:** Detect the use of weak primitives.
        *   **Developer Education:** Train developers on appropriate algorithm/mode selection.

## Threat: [Padding Oracle Attack (CBC Mode Misuse within Crypto++)](./threats/padding_oracle_attack__cbc_mode_misuse_within_crypto++_.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses Crypto++'s `CBC_Mode` with padding (e.g., PKCS#7) but fails to handle padding errors correctly. An attacker sends crafted ciphertexts, observing error responses or timing differences to decrypt the ciphertext without the key. This is a direct misuse of the `CBC_Mode` implementation.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Confidentiality breach: Decrypt arbitrary ciphertexts.
        *   Potential for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Crypto++ Component:**
        *   `CBC_Mode` (specifically with padding)
        *   Decryption functions within `CBC_Mode`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Authenticated Encryption:** Prioritize GCM, CCM, or EAX, which are inherently resistant.
        *   **Constant-Time Padding Verification:** If CBC *must* be used, implement *constant-time* padding verification. Review Crypto++'s implementation for constant-time guarantees.
        *   **Generic Error Handling:** Return a generic error message, regardless of the padding error.

## Threat: [Key Derivation Weakness (Using Weak Crypto++ KDF Options)](./threats/key_derivation_weakness__using_weak_crypto++_kdf_options_.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses a weak key derivation function (KDF) *provided by Crypto++*, such as a low-iteration PBKDF2 or a simple hash-based KDF. An attacker can perform brute-force or dictionary attacks on the password to derive the encryption key. This is a direct misuse of Crypto++'s KDF options.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Key compromise: Obtain the encryption key.
        *   Loss of confidentiality and integrity.
    *   **Affected Crypto++ Component:**
        *   `PKCS5_PBKDF2_HMAC` (if used with low iteration count)
        *   `PasswordBasedKeyDerivationFunction` (base class, if a weak derived class is used)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Strong KDFs:** Use Argon2 (Argon2id). If PBKDF2 *must* be used, use a *very* high iteration count (hundreds of thousands or more).
        *   **Salting:** Use a unique, random salt (at least 128 bits).
        *   **Consider Alternatives:** Use a dedicated key management library or HSM.

## Threat: [Random Number Generator Weakness (Misusing Crypto++ RNG)](./threats/random_number_generator_weakness__misusing_crypto++_rng_.md)

*   **Description:** The application relies on a weak or improperly configured random number generator (RNG) *within Crypto++*.  This could involve using a non-cryptographic PRNG or failing to properly seed `AutoSeededRandomPool`. An attacker could predict generated random numbers, compromising key generation, IVs, and nonces.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Key Compromise: Predictable keys.
        *   Replay Attacks: Predictable nonces.
        *   Loss of confidentiality and integrity.
    *   **Affected Crypto++ Component:**
        *   `RandomNumberGenerator` (base class)
        *   `AutoSeededRandomPool` (if improperly seeded)
        *   `OS_GenerateRandomBlock` (if the OS RNG is weak or unavailable)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use a Strong RNG:** Ensure Crypto++ uses a CSPRNG. `AutoSeededRandomPool` is usually good, *but verify proper seeding*.
        *   **OS-Provided RNG:** Prefer the OS's CSPRNG via `OS_GenerateRandomBlock`.
        *   **External Entropy:** Seed with additional entropy from a trusted source.
        *   **Avoid Weak RNGs:** *Never* use `std::rand()` or Mersenne Twister for cryptography.

## Threat: [Incorrect use of `SecByteBlock` (Leading to Memory Issues)](./threats/incorrect_use_of__secbyteblock___leading_to_memory_issues_.md)

*   **Description:** `SecByteBlock` is misused, leading to vulnerabilities. Examples include accessing the underlying data pointer without bounds checking or failing to zeroize memory after use. This is a direct misuse of a core Crypto++ memory management class.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information Leakage: Sensitive data remains in memory.
        *   Buffer Overflows: Incorrect pointer arithmetic.
    *   **Affected Crypto++ Component:**
        *   `SecByteBlock`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use `SecByteBlock` API:** Always use provided API methods. Avoid direct pointer manipulation.
        *   **Zeroize Memory:** Ensure memory is zeroized when no longer needed. `SecByteBlock`'s destructor should handle this, but explicit zeroization is good practice. Use `memset_s` or Crypto++'s ` সেক্রেtZeroize`.
        *   **Code Review:** Review code using `SecByteBlock`.

## Threat: [Unvalidated Signature Verification (Using Crypto++ Incorrectly)](./threats/unvalidated_signature_verification__using_crypto++_incorrectly_.md)

* **Description:** The application uses Crypto++ for digital signature verification but fails to properly validate the signature or the certificate chain (if applicable).  This is a direct misuse of Crypto++'s signature verification APIs. An attacker could forge a signature or use an invalid certificate.
    * **Impact:**
        *   Integrity Violation: Accept modified or forged data.
        *   Loss of Trust.
    * **Affected Crypto++ Component:**
        *   Signature verification functions (e.g., `RSASS<>::Verifier`, `ECDSA<>::Verifier`, `DSA::Verifier`)
        *   Hash functions used in signature schemes (e.g., `SHA256`, `SHA3_256`)
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Complete Verification:** Implement *full* verification:
            *   Check signature against the public key.
            *   Validate the certificate chain (if applicable).
            *   Check for certificate revocation.
        *   **Strong Algorithms:** Use strong signature algorithms.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review verification code.
