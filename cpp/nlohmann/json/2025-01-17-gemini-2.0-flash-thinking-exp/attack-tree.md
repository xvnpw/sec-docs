## Attack Tree Path: [***CRITICAL NODE*** Compromise Application via nlohmann/json](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_nlohmannjson.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents any successful compromise achieved through exploiting the `nlohmann/json` library or the application's use of it.

## Attack Tree Path: [***CRITICAL NODE*** OR Exploit Vulnerabilities in nlohmann/json Library](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_or_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_nlohmannjson_library.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's attempt to directly exploit flaws within the `nlohmann/json` library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** AND Trigger Memory Corruption](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_and_trigger_memory_corruption.md)

This path focuses on causing memory corruption within the application by providing specially crafted JSON input.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR Provide Maliciously Crafted JSON](./attack_tree_paths/or_provide_maliciously_crafted_json.md)

The attacker crafts specific JSON payloads to trigger memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK NODE*** Send JSON with specific patterns known to trigger bugs (if discovered)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_node_send_json_with_specific_patterns_known_to_trigger_bugs__if_discovered_.md)

This involves leveraging known bugs in the library that can be triggered by specific JSON structures, potentially leading to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK NODE*** AND Exploit a known vulnerability (CVE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_node_and_exploit_a_known_vulnerability__cve_.md)

This involves exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (with assigned CVEs) in the `nlohmann/json` library that lead to memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND Trigger Integer Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/and_trigger_integer_overflow.md)

This path focuses on exploiting integer overflow vulnerabilities within the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK NODE*** AND Exploit a known vulnerability (CVE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_node_and_exploit_a_known_vulnerability__cve_.md)

This involves exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (with assigned CVEs) in the `nlohmann/json` library that lead to integer overflows, potentially causing unexpected behavior or memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND Trigger Unexpected Behavior/Logic Errors](./attack_tree_paths/and_trigger_unexpected_behaviorlogic_errors.md)

This path focuses on causing unexpected behavior or logic errors within the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK NODE*** Exploit a known vulnerability (CVE)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_node_exploit_a_known_vulnerability__cve_.md)

This involves exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (with assigned CVEs) in the `nlohmann/json` library that lead to unexpected behavior or logic errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** AND Exploit Deserialization Issues (if applicable, depending on usage)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_and_exploit_deserialization_issues__if_applicable__depending_on_usage_.md)

This path is relevant if the application uses custom deserialization logic in conjunction with `nlohmann/json`.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR Provide JSON leading to object injection or other deserialization vulnerabilities (if custom deserialization is used)](./attack_tree_paths/or_provide_json_leading_to_object_injection_or_other_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_custom_dese_2d304a82.md)

The attacker crafts JSON payloads that, when deserialized by custom logic, lead to object injection or other deserialization vulnerabilities, potentially allowing for remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK NODE*** AND Exploit a known vulnerability (CVE) related to deserialization (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_node_and_exploit_a_known_vulnerability__cve__related_to_deserialization__if_applicable_.md)

## Attack Tree Path: [***CRITICAL NODE*** OR Exploit Application Logic Flaws Through Malicious JSON](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_or_exploit_application_logic_flaws_through_malicious_json.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the application's own logic by providing malicious JSON input that the application processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** AND Manipulate Application State](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_and_manipulate_application_state.md)

This path focuses on using malicious JSON to alter the application's internal state.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR Send JSON that alters critical application data](./attack_tree_paths/or_send_json_that_alters_critical_application_data.md)

The attacker crafts JSON to modify sensitive application data.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK NODE*** Send JSON with modified user IDs or permissions](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_node_send_json_with_modified_user_ids_or_permissions.md)

This specific attack vector involves manipulating JSON to change user identifiers or access rights, potentially leading to privilege escalation or unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [AND Cause Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/and_cause_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

This path focuses on using malicious JSON to cause a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [OR Send JSON that crashes the application](./attack_tree_paths/or_send_json_that_crashes_the_application.md)

The attacker crafts JSON to force the application to crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK NODE*** Send JSON that exploits a vulnerability leading to a crash](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_node_send_json_that_exploits_a_vulnerability_leading_to_a_crash.md)

This involves leveraging vulnerabilities (potentially in `nlohmann/json` or the application's handling) that can be triggered by specific JSON, causing the application to crash.
