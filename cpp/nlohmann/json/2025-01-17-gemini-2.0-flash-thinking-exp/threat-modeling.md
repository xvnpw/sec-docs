# Threat Model Analysis for nlohmann/json

## Threat: [Large Payload Denial of Service](./threats/large_payload_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large JSON payload to the application. The `nlohmann/json` library attempts to parse and store this large payload in memory. This can lead to excessive memory consumption, causing the application to slow down, become unresponsive, or crash due to out-of-memory errors.

**Impact:** Application becomes unavailable, leading to denial of service for legitimate users. System resources may be exhausted, potentially affecting other applications on the same server.

**Affected Component:** `nlohmann::json::parse()` function, internal memory management of the `nlohmann::json` object.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a maximum size limit for incoming JSON payloads *before* passing it to the `nlohmann/json` library.
* Configure web servers or load balancers to enforce request size limits.
* Monitor application resource usage (CPU, memory) and set up alerts for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Deeply Nested Object/Array Denial of Service](./threats/deeply_nested_objectarray_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with an excessive level of nesting of objects or arrays. Parsing such deeply nested structures can lead to stack overflow errors due to excessive recursion within the `nlohmann/json` parsing logic, or excessive memory allocation for internal representation.

**Impact:** Application crashes due to stack overflow or excessive memory usage, leading to denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `nlohmann::json::parse()` function, recursive parsing logic within the library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a limit on the maximum depth of allowed nesting in JSON payloads *before* parsing with `nlohmann/json`.
* Consider using iterative parsing techniques if feasible (this would require changes within the `nlohmann/json` library itself or using alternative parsing approaches for pre-processing).
* Test the application's resilience against deeply nested JSON structures.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Unintended Serialization](./threats/information_disclosure_through_unintended_serialization.md)

**Description:** When serializing data back into JSON using `nlohmann/json`, the application might inadvertently include sensitive information that should not be exposed. This could happen if the data structures being serialized contain sensitive fields that are not properly filtered or excluded.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized parties.

**Affected Component:** `nlohmann::json::dump()` function, application logic responsible for populating the `nlohmann::json` object before serialization.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully review the data being serialized using `nlohmann::json::dump()` and ensure only necessary information is included.
* Use specific data transfer objects (DTOs) or filtering mechanisms to control which fields are serialized before passing them to `nlohmann::json::dump()`.
* Avoid directly serializing entire internal application objects without careful consideration.
