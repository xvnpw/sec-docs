## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service via Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service_via_parsing.md)

*   Compromise Application via nlohmann/json
    *   Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities ***CRITICAL NODE***
        *   Cause Denial of Service (DoS)
            *   Resource Exhaustion ***CRITICAL NODE***
                *   Send Extremely Large JSON Payload ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                    *   Likelihood: High
                    *   Impact: Medium (Temporary service disruption)
                    *   Effort: Low
                    *   Skill Level: Beginner
                    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
                    *   Attack Vector Details: An attacker sends a JSON string with a massive size, potentially exceeding memory limits and causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
                *   Send Deeply Nested JSON Payload ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                    *   Likelihood: Medium
                    *   Impact: Medium (Temporary service disruption, potential stack exhaustion)
                    *   Effort: Low
                    *   Skill Level: Beginner
                    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
                    *   Attack Vector Details: An attacker sends a JSON object or array with many levels of nesting, leading to stack overflow or excessive recursion during parsing, causing a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Security Checks](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_security_checks.md)

*   Compromise Application via nlohmann/json
    *   Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities ***CRITICAL NODE***
        *   Bypass Security Checks (if any rely on parsing) ***CRITICAL NODE***
            *   Craft JSON to Misrepresent Data ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                *   Likelihood: Medium
                *   Impact: High (Circumvention of security measures, unauthorized access)
                *   Effort: Medium to High
                *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
                *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
                *   Attack Vector Details: If the application relies on parsing JSON to make security decisions (e.g., authentication, authorization), an attacker crafts JSON to misrepresent data, potentially bypassing these checks and gaining unauthorized access or privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors due to Incorrect Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_due_to_incorrect_input_validation.md)

*   Compromise Application via nlohmann/json
    *   Exploit Logic Errors in Application Using nlohmann/json
        *   Incorrect Input Validation ***CRITICAL NODE***
            *   Application Does Not Validate JSON Structure/Content ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                *   Likelihood: High
                *   Impact: Varies (From minor errors to significant security vulnerabilities)
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Beginner
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
                *   Attack Vector Details: The application fails to validate the structure and content of the received JSON data. An attacker can send unexpected or malicious JSON that, when processed, leads to logic errors, unexpected behavior, or security vulnerabilities within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors due to Incorrect Output Handling](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_due_to_incorrect_output_handling.md)

*   Compromise Application via nlohmann/json
    *   Exploit Logic Errors in Application Using nlohmann/json
        *   Incorrect Output Handling
            *   Application Does Not Properly Sanitize/Escape Serialized JSON ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                *   Likelihood: Medium
                *   Impact: High (Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), other injection vulnerabilities)
                *   Effort: Low to Medium
                *   Skill Level: Beginner to Intermediate
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
                *   Attack Vector Details: The application does not properly sanitize or escape the JSON output generated by `nlohmann/json` before using it in other contexts (e.g., displaying it on a web page). This can lead to injection vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), where malicious scripts are injected into the output and executed by other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack.md)

*   Compromise Application via nlohmann/json
    *   Exploit Build/Dependency Vulnerabilities (Indirectly related) ***CRITICAL NODE***
        *   Compromise Build Process or Dependencies
            *   Introduce Malicious Code During Compilation or via a Dependency ***HIGH-RISK PATH***
                *   Likelihood: Low to Medium
                *   Impact: Critical (Full application compromise)
                *   Effort: High
                *   Skill Level: Advanced
                *   Detection Difficulty: Hard
                *   Attack Vector Details: An attacker compromises the application's build process or one of its dependencies (which could include tools used with `nlohmann/json`). This allows them to inject malicious code into the application during compilation or through a compromised library, leading to full control over the application.
