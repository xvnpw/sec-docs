# Threat Model Analysis for nlohmann/json

## Threat: [Integer Overflow/Underflow during Parsing](./threats/integer_overflowunderflow_during_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send a JSON payload containing extremely large or small integer values that exceed the limits of the application's integer data types. This could lead to integer overflow or underflow when `nlohmann/json` parses these values and the application attempts to store or process them.

**Impact:** Application crash, potential denial of service, or unexpected behavior due to incorrect calculations or memory allocation based on the overflowed/underflowed value.

**Affected Component:** JSON parsing logic, specifically the handling of integer values.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement input validation to check the range of integer values *before* parsing or using them (this is an application-level mitigation, the library itself doesn't prevent this).
* Use data types that can accommodate the expected range of integer values in the JSON within your application.
* Implement error handling to catch exceptions during integer parsing in your application.

## Threat: [Stack Overflow via Deeply Nested JSON](./threats/stack_overflow_via_deeply_nested_json.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send a JSON payload with excessively deep nesting of objects or arrays. When `nlohmann/json` attempts to parse this deeply nested structure, it could lead to excessive stack usage, resulting in a stack overflow.

**Impact:** Application crash, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** JSON parsing logic, specifically the recursive descent parser.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum depth of nested objects and arrays allowed during parsing (this might require wrapping or modifying the `nlohmann/json` parsing process).
* Consider alternative parsing approaches if dealing with potentially deeply nested structures (though `nlohmann/json`'s core parser is recursive).
* Increase the stack size for the application's threads (less recommended as a primary mitigation).

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Large JSON Payloads](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_large_json_payloads.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send an extremely large JSON payload. Parsing and storing this large payload by `nlohmann/json` could consume excessive memory and CPU resources, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, instability, or complete denial of service.

**Affected Component:** JSON parsing logic, memory allocation within the `json` object.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement limits on the maximum size of JSON payloads that the application will accept *before* attempting to parse with `nlohmann/json`.
* Consider streaming or incremental parsing approaches if dealing with potentially very large JSON data (though `nlohmann/json` is primarily an in-memory parser, requiring application-level handling of large streams).
* Implement timeouts for JSON parsing operations.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Hash Collision Attacks on Object Keys](./threats/denial_of_service_via_hash_collision_attacks_on_object_keys.md)

**Description:** While less likely with modern hash functions, an attacker could craft a JSON payload with a large number of keys that hash to the same or similar values. This could potentially degrade the performance of `nlohmann/json`'s internal hash map used for storing object members, leading to increased CPU usage and a potential denial of service.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, increased resource consumption, potential denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Internal hash map implementation for JSON objects.

**Risk Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure you are using a reasonably up-to-date version of `nlohmann/json` which likely uses a robust hash function.
* Implement limits on the maximum number of keys allowed in a JSON object *before* parsing.
