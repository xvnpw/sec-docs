# Attack Surface Analysis for nlohmann/json

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Extremely Deeply Nested JSON Structures](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_extremely_deeply_nested_json_structures.md)

* **Description:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Extremely Deeply Nested JSON Structures.
    * **How JSON Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `nlohmann/json` library, by default, attempts to parse and represent deeply nested JSON objects and arrays in memory. This process can consume significant stack space or heap memory, potentially leading to stack overflow or excessive memory allocation.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload like `{"a": {"b": {"c": ... } } }` with hundreds or thousands of levels of nesting.
    * **Impact:** Application crash, unresponsiveness, resource exhaustion.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a maximum nesting depth limit: Configure the application to reject JSON payloads exceeding a reasonable nesting depth. This can be done by pre-processing the JSON or by implementing checks during the parsing process.
        * Use iterative parsing if possible: If the application logic allows, consider alternative parsing strategies that don't require fully loading the entire JSON structure into memory at once.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Very Large JSON Payloads](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_very_large_json_payloads.md)

* **Description:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Very Large JSON Payloads.
    * **How JSON Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The library needs to allocate memory to store the parsed JSON data. Extremely large JSON payloads can lead to excessive memory allocation, potentially exhausting available memory and causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload consisting of a very large array or object with numerous entries, potentially containing long strings.
    * **Impact:** Memory exhaustion, application slowdown, crash.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a maximum payload size limit: Reject JSON payloads exceeding a predefined size limit. This can be enforced at the application level or at the network level (e.g., using a web application firewall).
        * Stream processing: If the application logic allows, process the JSON data in chunks or streams rather than loading the entire payload into memory at once.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via JSON Bombs (Quadratic Blowup)](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_json_bombs__quadratic_blowup_.md)

* **Description:** Denial of Service (DoS) via JSON Bombs (Quadratic Blowup).
    * **How JSON Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Certain crafted JSON structures, like deeply nested arrays with repeated elements, can exploit the parsing algorithm's time complexity, leading to an exponential increase in processing time and memory usage.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends a JSON payload like `[[[[[[...]]]]]]` or `{"a": ["b", "b", "b", ...], "c": ["a", "a", "a", ...]}` designed to cause the parser to perform redundant operations.
    * **Impact:** Extreme CPU and memory consumption, application freeze, crash.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement complexity analysis or limits: Analyze the structure of the incoming JSON and reject payloads that exhibit patterns known to cause quadratic blowup. This might involve limiting the number of nested arrays or objects, or the repetition of certain elements.
        * Set parsing timeouts: Implement timeouts for the JSON parsing process. If parsing takes longer than a defined threshold, terminate the operation to prevent resource exhaustion.
        * Consider alternative, more resilient parsers: While `nlohmann/json` is generally efficient, for highly sensitive applications dealing with untrusted input, exploring parsers with stronger guarantees against algorithmic complexity attacks might be considered.
