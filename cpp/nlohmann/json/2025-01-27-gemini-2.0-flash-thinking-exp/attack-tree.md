## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application using nlohmann/json (Root Goal)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_nlohmannjson__root_goal_.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success here means the attacker has achieved some level of control or compromise over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities Post-Parsing (Post-Parsing Data Handling - Major Risk Area)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities_post-parsing__post-parsing_data_handling_-_major_risk_area_.md)

This node represents the stage after the JSON has been successfully parsed by nlohmann/json. The vulnerabilities here arise from how the application *uses* the parsed JSON data. This is a major risk area because even with secure JSON parsing, insecure data handling can lead to severe vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Attacks via JSON Data (Injection Attacks - High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/injection_attacks_via_json_data__injection_attacks_-_high_impact_.md)

This node represents a category of attacks where malicious code or commands are injected into the application through JSON data. Injection attacks are high-impact because they can lead to significant compromise, including data breaches, remote code execution, and system takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via JSON data (SQL Injection - Highest Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_json_data__sql_injection_-_highest_impact_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts JSON data containing malicious SQL commands within string values. If the application uses these string values to construct SQL queries *without proper sanitization or parameterization*, the attacker's SQL commands will be executed against the database.

**Impact:** SQL Injection is considered one of the most critical web application vulnerabilities. Successful exploitation can lead to:
*   Full database compromise: Access to all data, including sensitive information.
*   Data breach: Leakage of confidential data.
*   Data manipulation: Modification or deletion of data.
*   Service disruption: Database unavailability or corruption.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Parameterization is crucial:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases. This prevents user-supplied data from being interpreted as SQL code.
*   **Input Sanitization (as a secondary defense):** Sanitize JSON data before using it in SQL queries, but parameterization is the primary and most effective defense.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Database accounts used by the application should have minimal necessary permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via JSON data (Command Injection - High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_json_data__command_injection_-_high_impact_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts JSON data containing malicious operating system commands within string values. If the application uses these string values to execute system commands (e.g., using `system()`, `exec()`, or similar functions) *without proper sanitization*, the attacker's commands will be executed on the server.

**Impact:** Command Injection can lead to:
*   Full server compromise: Remote code execution on the server.
*   System takeover: Complete control of the server.
*   Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive data from the server.
*   Denial of Service: Crashing or disrupting the server.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Avoid system calls if possible:**  Design the application to minimize or eliminate the need to execute system commands based on user input.
*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (if system calls are unavoidable):**  If system calls are necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize JSON data before using it in commands. Use whitelisting of allowed characters and commands.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run application processes with minimal necessary privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via JSON data](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_json_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts JSON data containing malicious file paths within string values. If the application uses these string values to access files on the server *without proper validation*, the attacker can potentially access files outside of the intended directory.

**Impact:** Path Traversal can lead to:
*   Unauthorized file access: Accessing sensitive files that should not be publicly accessible.
*   Information disclosure: Leaking confidential data from files.
*   Potential for further exploitation: Depending on the files accessed, it could lead to other vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Validate and Sanitize File Paths:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize file paths extracted from JSON data.
*   **Whitelisting of Allowed Paths:**  Use a whitelist of allowed directories or file paths.
*   **Secure File Access Mechanisms:**  Use secure file access APIs and avoid directly using user-provided paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via JSON data (if JSON is reflected in web UI)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_json_data__if_json_is_reflected_in_web_ui_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts JSON data containing malicious JavaScript code within string values. If the application displays this JSON data in a web browser *without proper output encoding*, the attacker's JavaScript code will be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact:** XSS can lead to:
*   Client-side compromise: Executing malicious JavaScript in the user's browser.
*   Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies.
*   Defacement: Altering the appearance of the web page.
*   Phishing: Redirecting users to malicious websites or stealing credentials.

**Mitigation:**
*   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all JSON data that is displayed in a web UI based on the context (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
