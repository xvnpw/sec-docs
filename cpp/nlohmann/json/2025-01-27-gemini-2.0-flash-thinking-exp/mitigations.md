# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nlohmann/json

## Mitigation Strategy: [Schema Validation](./mitigation_strategies/schema_validation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a JSON Schema validation library:** Select a library compatible with your project's language to validate JSON against schemas.
    2.  **Define JSON Schemas:** Create schemas that define the expected structure, data types, and constraints for all JSON inputs your application processes.
    3.  **Validate Incoming JSON:** Before parsing with `nlohmann/json`, validate the raw JSON string against the defined schema using the chosen library.
    4.  **Reject Invalid JSON:** If validation fails, reject the JSON payload and return an error.
    5.  **Parse Valid JSON:** If validation succeeds, proceed to parse the JSON string using `nlohmann/json`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malformed JSON Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents processing of syntactically invalid JSON.
    *   **Data Type Mismatch Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity):** Enforces expected data types within JSON payloads.
    *   **Unexpected Structure Exploits (Medium Severity):** Restricts JSON structure to the defined schema, preventing unexpected elements.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Structures (Low to Medium Severity):** Limits allowed JSON complexity through schema constraints.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malformed JSON Injection:** High reduction.
    *   **Data Type Mismatch Vulnerabilities:** High reduction.
    *   **Unexpected Structure Exploits:** High reduction.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Structures:** Medium reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in API endpoints for user registration and login, but basic schema validation only.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in API endpoints for data updates, reporting, admin interfaces, and internal JSON configuration files. Needs expansion to include detailed data type, format, and range checks across all JSON input points.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Type and Range Checks (Post-Parsing)](./mitigation_strategies/data_type_and_range_checks__post-parsing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Parse JSON with `nlohmann/json`:** Parse the incoming JSON payload using `nlohmann/json`.
    2.  **Access and Validate JSON Data:** Access data elements from the parsed `nlohmann::json` object.
    3.  **Perform Data Type Checks:** Use `nlohmann/json` functions (`is_string()`, `is_number()`, etc.) to verify expected data types.
    4.  **Validate Data Ranges and Formats:** Check numeric ranges, string lengths, and formats (e.g., using regex for strings) of the extracted JSON data.
    5.  **Handle Validation Failures:** If any data validation fails, reject the request or input and log the failure.
    6.  **Process Validated Data:** Proceed with application logic only if all data validations pass.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents issues from out-of-range numeric values in JSON.
    *   **Buffer Overflow via String Length (Medium Severity):** Mitigates risks from excessively long strings in JSON.
    *   **Logic Errors due to Unexpected Data (Medium Severity):** Reduces errors from unexpected data values within valid JSON structures.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Strings/Arrays (Low to Medium Severity):** Limits impact of excessively large data within JSON.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:** High reduction.
    *   **Buffer Overflow via String Length:** High reduction.
    *   **Logic Errors due to Unexpected Data:** High reduction.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Strings/Arrays:** Medium reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in some data processing modules with basic type checks, but range and format validation are inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in many data processing modules, especially for complex JSON structures and user-provided data. Range checks for numbers and format validation for strings are largely absent. Needs consistent and thorough data validation after JSON parsing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Reject Malformed JSON (Strict Parsing)](./mitigation_strategies/reject_malformed_json__strict_parsing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `nlohmann/json` Strict Parsing:** Rely on `nlohmann/json`'s default strict parsing to enforce JSON syntax.
    2.  **Implement Exception Handling for Parsing:** Use `try-catch` blocks around `nlohmann::json::parse()` to catch parsing errors.
    3.  **Catch Parsing Exceptions:** Specifically catch `nlohmann::json::parse_error` exceptions.
    4.  **Handle Parsing Errors Securely:** Log parsing errors for debugging, return generic error responses to clients, and avoid exposing detailed error information.
    5.  **Stop Processing on Parsing Error:** Immediately reject and stop processing any JSON payload that fails parsing.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Bypass of Parsing Logic (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from bypassing validation with slightly malformed JSON.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior due to Parsing Ambiguity (Medium Severity):** Avoids issues from ambiguous interpretation of malformed JSON.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Parser Exploits (Low Severity):** Reduces attack surface related to parser vulnerabilities by enforcing strictness.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Bypass of Parsing Logic:** High reduction.
    *   **Unexpected Behavior due to Parsing Ambiguity:** High reduction.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Parser Exploits:** Low reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Largely implemented by default due to `nlohmann/json`'s strictness and exception handling in API endpoints.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Review all JSON parsing code paths to ensure consistent exception handling and no relaxed parsing options are enabled. Verify secure error handling for parsing failures across the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Payload Size Limits for JSON](./mitigation_strategies/payload_size_limits_for_json.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine JSON Payload Size Limits:** Define maximum acceptable sizes for incoming JSON payloads based on application needs and resources.
    2.  **Check Payload Size Before Parsing:** Implement a check on the raw size of the incoming JSON data *before* attempting to parse it with `nlohmann/json`.
    3.  **Reject Oversized JSON Payloads:** If the JSON payload exceeds the size limit, reject the request with an error (e.g., 413 Payload Too Large).
    4.  **Configure Web Server Limits (Optional):** Set size limits at the web server level as an initial defense layer for JSON payloads.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large JSON Payloads (High Severity):** Prevents resource exhaustion from processing extremely large JSON payloads.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Memory/CPU) due to Large JSON (High Severity):** Controls resource consumption during JSON parsing and processing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large JSON Payloads:** High reduction.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Memory/CPU) due to Large JSON:** High reduction.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented with web server limits, but application-level JSON payload size limits are not consistently enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Need explicit payload size checks within the application code for all API endpoints handling JSON input. Limits should be configurable and appropriately set for JSON data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Parsing Timeout for JSON](./mitigation_strategies/parsing_timeout_for_json.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify JSON Parsing Operations:** Locate all code sections where `nlohmann/json` is used for parsing.

    3.  **Set JSON Parsing Timeout Value:** Determine a reasonable timeout duration for JSON parsing, balancing legitimate complex JSON with DoS prevention.
    4.  **Handle JSON Parsing Timeout:** If parsing exceeds the timeout, terminate the process, log the timeout, and return an error response.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex JSON (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents DoS by limiting parsing time for excessively complex JSON.
    *   **Algorithmic Complexity Exploits in JSON Parsing (Medium Severity):** Mitigates exploits that leverage parser complexity to cause performance degradation.
