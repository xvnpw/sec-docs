# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gabime/spdlog

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration of Log Levels and Destinations](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_of_log_levels_and_destinations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Configuration of Log Levels and Destinations

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Environment-Specific Configuration:** Use separate configuration files (or environment variables, or programmatic configuration) for different environments (development, testing, staging, production).  `spdlog` can be configured programmatically or via configuration files (though the file loading is typically handled by the application).
        2.  **Log Level Control:**
            *   **Development/Testing:** Use `spdlog::level::debug` or `spdlog::level::trace`.
            *   **Staging:** Use `spdlog::level::info` or `spdlog::level::debug` (depending on testing needs).
            *   **Production:** Use `spdlog::level::info`, `spdlog::level::warn`, or `spdlog::level::err`.  *Never* use `debug` or `trace` in production.  Use `spdlog`'s level filtering capabilities.
        3.  **Secure File Sink Configuration (if used):**
            *   **Permissions:** (Handled *outside* of `spdlog`, but crucial).
            *   **Dedicated Directory:** (Handled *outside* of `spdlog`, but crucial).
            *   **Rotation:** Configure log rotation using `spdlog`'s built-in features:
                *   `spdlog::sinks::rotating_file_sink_mt`: Rotate based on file size.  Use `spdlog::sinks::rotating_file_sink_mt::set_rotation_policy()`.
                *   `spdlog::sinks::daily_file_sink_mt`: Rotate daily.
                *   Set appropriate size limits and the number of rotated files to keep using the sink's constructor or setter methods.
        4.  **Secure System Log Sink Configuration (if used):**
            *   Use `spdlog::sinks::syslog_sink` (or the Windows equivalent).  The security of the system logger itself is *outside* of `spdlog`'s control.
        5.  **Secure Remote Sink Configuration (if used):**
            *   This typically requires a *custom* sink, as `spdlog` doesn't have built-in remote sinks with TLS/authentication.  If you implement a custom sink, ensure it handles security (TLS, authentication, certificate validation) *within* the sink's implementation.
        6.  **Regular Review:** (Handled *outside* of `spdlog`).

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Information Disclosure (High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data from being logged at inappropriate log levels.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Logs (High Severity):** (Indirectly, by configuring secure destinations).
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Disk Space Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Log rotation prevents log files from growing indefinitely.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Logs:** Risk reduced (depends on external configuration of file permissions, etc.).
        *   **DoS via Disk Space Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Mostly implemented. Environment-specific configurations are used. Production uses `spdlog::level::info`. File sinks are used with log rotation (daily, 5 files kept) configured via `spdlog::sinks::daily_file_sink_mt`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   We are experimenting with a remote logging service, which would require a custom sink with TLS and authentication. This is not yet implemented.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Asynchronous Logging](./mitigation_strategies/asynchronous_logging.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Asynchronous Logging

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Use Asynchronous Logger:** Instead of using the default synchronous loggers, use `spdlog::async_logger` (or the convenience functions like `spdlog::create_async`).
        2.  **Configure Queue Size:**  Adjust the size of the asynchronous queue based on expected log volume and memory constraints.  Use the `spdlog::init_thread_pool()` function to initialize the thread pool and set the queue size.
        3.  **Handle Overflow Policy:**  Choose an appropriate overflow policy for the asynchronous queue:
            *   `spdlog::async_overflow_policy::block`:  The calling thread will block until space is available in the queue (this can impact performance).
            *   `spdlog::async_overflow_policy::overrun_oldest`:  The oldest messages in the queue will be discarded to make room for new messages (this can lead to log loss).
        4. **Flush on critical errors:** Use `logger->flush_on(spdlog::level::err);` to ensure that critical error messages are written immediately, even when using asynchronous logging.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Logging (Medium Severity):** Prevents logging from blocking the main application thread, improving resilience to DoS attacks targeting the logging system.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **DoS via Excessive Logging:** Risk reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Asynchronous logging is enabled using `spdlog::create_async`. The default queue size is used. `flush_on` is set to `spdlog::level::err`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   The queue size and overflow policy haven't been explicitly tuned for our application's specific needs.


## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates and Dependency Management (Focus on `spdlog` and `fmtlib`)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_and_dependency_management__focus_on__spdlog__and__fmtlib__.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Updates and Dependency Management (Focus on `spdlog` and `fmtlib`)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Dependency Management System:** (Handled *outside* of `spdlog`, but crucial).
        2.  **Version Pinning:** Pin the versions of `spdlog` and `fmtlib` to specific, known-good releases within your dependency management system.
        3.  **Regular Updates:** Regularly check for new releases of `spdlog` and `fmtlib` *through your dependency management system*. Prioritize security updates.
        4.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** (Ideally handled *outside* of `spdlog`, but relies on knowing the versions of `spdlog` and `fmtlib`).
        5.  **Testing:** After updating `spdlog` or `fmtlib`, thoroughly test the application.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity, potentially Critical):** Prevents attackers from exploiting known vulnerabilities in `spdlog` or its dependencies.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** We use CMake with FetchContent. Versions are pinned.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Updates are not performed on a regular schedule.
