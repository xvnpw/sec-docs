# Threat Model Analysis for gabime/spdlog

## Threat: [Configuration Manipulation (Spoofing)](./threats/configuration_manipulation__spoofing_.md)

*   **Threat:** Configuration Manipulation (Spoofing)

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the `spdlog` configuration (e.g., via a vulnerable configuration file, environment variables, or command-line arguments) to redirect log output to a file or network location they control, disable logging entirely, or change log levels to suppress critical events.  This directly targets `spdlog`'s configuration mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of log integrity, potential for attackers to cover their tracks, inability to audit security events, potential information disclosure if logs are redirected to an attacker-controlled location.
    *   **Affected spdlog Component:** Configuration loading mechanisms (e.g., `spdlog::from_file`, environment variable parsing, command-line argument processing), sink creation (based on the manipulated configuration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strictly validate and sanitize all external inputs** used to configure `spdlog`. Use a whitelist approach.
        *   **Protect configuration files** with appropriate file system permissions (read-only for most users).
        *   **Use a secure configuration management system.**
        *   **Log changes to the `spdlog` configuration itself** to a separate, secure log.

## Threat: [Log File Tampering](./threats/log_file_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Log File Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker with write access to the log files modifies or deletes log entries to remove evidence of malicious activity or inject false information. This directly affects the output produced by `spdlog`'s file sinks.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of log integrity, inability to accurately investigate security incidents, potential for misleading investigations.
    *   **Affected spdlog Component:** File sinks (e.g., `spdlog::sinks::basic_file_sink`, `spdlog::sinks::rotating_file_sink`), potentially custom sinks if they don't implement proper access controls.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict write access to log files** to the application user only (principle of least privilege).
        *   **Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM).**
        *   **Use rotating file sinks with limited file count and size.**
        *   **Log to a remote, secure logging server (SIEM).**
        *   **Implement cryptographic signing of log entries** (custom sink).

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability within Logging](./threats/format_string_vulnerability_within_logging.md)

*   **Threat:** Format String Vulnerability within Logging

    *   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that is used as part of a format string *within* a `spdlog` logging call. If the format string itself is sourced from untrusted input, this could lead to a denial-of-service or potentially arbitrary code execution. This is a vulnerability *within* `spdlog`'s formatting logic.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution (though less likely with modern compilers and libraries).
    *   **Affected spdlog Component:** Format string processing within `spdlog::logger::log` (and related functions), custom formatters if they handle user input unsafely.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if format strings are sourced from untrusted input)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never source format strings from untrusted input.** Hardcode format strings.
        *   **If configurable format strings are *essential*, use a very strict whitelist of allowed format specifiers.**
        *   **Keep `spdlog` updated.**

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs

    *   **Description:** Although primarily a developer error, `spdlog` is the *mechanism* by which sensitive data (passwords, API keys, PII) is exposed if the application inadvertently logs it. The threat is the *use* of `spdlog` to write this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for credential theft, privacy violations.
    *   **Affected spdlog Component:** All sinks (since they all write the log data), potentially custom formatters if they don't handle sensitive data properly.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Code review to prevent logging of sensitive data.**
        *   **Implement data masking/redaction** (custom formatter or sink).
        *   **Use appropriate log levels (avoid sensitive data at DEBUG/TRACE).**
        *   **Sanitize user input before logging.**
