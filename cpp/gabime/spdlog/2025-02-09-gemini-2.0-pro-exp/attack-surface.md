# Attack Surface Analysis for gabime/spdlog

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Log Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_log_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker overwhelms the logging system with a high volume of log messages, causing resource exhaustion (disk space, CPU, I/O, memory).
*   **spdlog Contribution:** `spdlog` provides the core logging mechanisms (sinks, formatters, asynchronous queues) that are directly involved in handling the flood of messages.  The asynchronous queue, while designed for performance, has a finite capacity and can become a bottleneck or overflow. The choice of sink and its performance characteristics directly impact the severity.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application to trigger numerous error messages. `spdlog`, configured to use an asynchronous logger with a blocking overflow policy, becomes overwhelmed.  The application threads waiting to log become blocked, leading to application unresponsiveness.
*   **Impact:** Application slowdown or complete unresponsiveness. Potential data loss if the asynchronous queue overflows and the policy is set to discard. Disk space exhaustion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Bounded Asynchronous Queue:** Use a bounded queue for asynchronous logging and monitor its size. Carefully choose the overflow policy (`block` or `discard`) based on application requirements. `block` is the default and can lead to DoS.
    *   **Efficient Sinks:** Select efficient sinks appropriate for the expected log volume.  Avoid slow sinks (e.g., network sinks over a congested connection) if high-volume logging is anticipated.
    *   **Alerting:** Configure alerts for high log volume, queue overflow, or excessive disk space usage related to `spdlog`'s output.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection (Highly Unlikely)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection__highly_unlikely_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in `spdlog`'s formatting or parsing logic, *specifically within spdlog's own code or the fmt library it uses*, is exploited to inject and execute arbitrary code. This excludes vulnerabilities in *custom* formatters written by application developers.
*   **spdlog Contribution:** `spdlog`'s internal code, including its use of the `fmt` library for formatting, is the direct target of this attack. The vulnerability would need to exist within `spdlog` or `fmt` itself.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical zero-day vulnerability in `spdlog`'s pattern parsing logic allows an attacker to craft a malicious log message that, when processed by `spdlog`, triggers arbitrary code execution. This is *not* a vulnerability in a custom formatter, but in `spdlog`'s core code.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (but extremely low probability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep `spdlog` and `fmt` Updated:** This is the *primary* mitigation. Regularly update `spdlog` and the `fmt` library to the latest versions to receive security patches. This addresses vulnerabilities discovered in the library itself.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. This limits the damage a successful code injection attack can cause, even if `spdlog` is compromised.
