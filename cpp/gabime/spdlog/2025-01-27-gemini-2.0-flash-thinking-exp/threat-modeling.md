# Threat Model Analysis for gabime/spdlog

## Threat: [Unintentional Logging of Sensitive Data](./threats/unintentional_logging_of_sensitive_data.md)

Description: Developers using `spdlog` might inadvertently include sensitive information (credentials, PII, tokens) in log messages through format strings or directly logged variables. Attackers gaining access to these `spdlog` generated logs can extract sensitive data.
Impact: Information disclosure, privacy breaches, identity theft, account compromise, compliance violations.
Affected spdlog component: Application code using `spdlog` logging functions (e.g., `spdlog::info`, format strings).
Risk Severity: High to Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Mandatory code reviews specifically for `spdlog` log statements.
    * Static analysis tools to detect potential sensitive data in `spdlog` logging calls.
    * Structured logging with predefined, non-sensitive fields for `spdlog`.
    * Log masking/redaction applied to `spdlog` output before storage.
    * Developer training on secure logging practices with `spdlog`.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Log File Access](./threats/unauthorized_log_file_access.md)

Description: Attackers exploit system misconfigurations or vulnerabilities to access log files generated by `spdlog`. This allows them to read sensitive information logged by the application via `spdlog` or monitor application activity.
Impact: Information disclosure, unauthorized surveillance, potential for further attacks based on revealed information.
Affected spdlog component: Log files generated by `spdlog` and their storage location.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Restrict file system permissions on directories containing `spdlog` log files.
    * Secure access to centralized logging systems receiving `spdlog` logs with strong authentication.
    * Regularly audit access controls for `spdlog` log storage.
    * Avoid storing `spdlog` logs in publicly accessible web directories.

## Threat: [Log File Modification or Deletion](./threats/log_file_modification_or_deletion.md)

Description: Attackers gaining write access to the system can modify or delete log files generated by `spdlog`. This can be used to hide malicious activity logged by `spdlog` or manipulate audit trails.
Impact: Loss of auditability, inability to detect security incidents, compromised forensic analysis, regulatory non-compliance.
Affected spdlog component: Log files generated by `spdlog` and their storage location.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement write-only access to `spdlog` log files for application processes.
    * Utilize centralized logging systems with tamper-evident logging for `spdlog` logs.
    * Consider immutable logging solutions for `spdlog` output.
    * Regularly back up `spdlog` log files to secure locations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Sinks or Formatters](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_sinks_or_formatters.md)

Description: Developers implementing custom sinks or formatters for `spdlog` might introduce vulnerabilities (buffer overflows, injection flaws) in this custom code. Exploiting these vulnerabilities in `spdlog` extensions can lead to code execution or denial of service.
Impact: Code execution on the logging system or application server, data corruption, denial of service.
Affected spdlog component: Custom sinks and formatters extending `spdlog` functionality.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Thorough security review and testing of custom `spdlog` sinks and formatters.
    * Secure coding practices for custom `spdlog` extensions (input validation, buffer overflow protection).
    * Prefer using well-vetted, standard `spdlog` sinks and formatters.
    * Principle of least privilege for custom `spdlog` sink code.
