# Attack Surface Analysis for gabime/spdlog

## Attack Surface: [Format String Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/format_string_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Occurs when user-controlled input is directly used as the format string in a logging function. Attackers can inject format specifiers to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.

**How spdlog Contributes:** `spdlog` uses format strings similar to `printf`. If the application passes unsanitized user input directly as the format string argument to `spdlog`'s logging macros (e.g., `logger->info(user_input);`), it becomes vulnerable.

**Example:** An attacker provides the input `%x %x %x %x %s` which is then used as the format string in `logger->info(user_input);`. This could leak stack memory.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (reading memory), potentially leading to further exploitation or even arbitrary code execution (writing to memory).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Never use user-controlled input directly as the format string.**
*   **Always use parameterized logging:** `logger->info("User logged in: {}", username);` where `username` is the user-provided input. `spdlog` handles the escaping and formatting safely.

## Attack Surface: [Log Injection](./attack_surfaces/log_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious content into log messages. While the vulnerability lies in the application's handling of input, `spdlog` directly records this unsanitized data.

**How spdlog Contributes:** `spdlog`'s core function is to record log messages. If the application doesn't sanitize user input before logging, `spdlog` will record the malicious input verbatim, making it available for exploitation by other systems that process the logs.

**Example:** An attacker provides input containing newline characters and crafted log prefixes, potentially allowing them to inject fake log entries that mislead administrators or trigger alerts in security monitoring systems. `logger->info("User input: {}", malicious_input_with_newlines);`

**Impact:** Log tampering, misleading security analysis, potential exploitation of vulnerabilities in log processing tools (e.g., command injection if logs are piped to a shell command).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Sanitize user input before logging:** Remove or escape special characters (like newlines, carriage returns) that could be used for injection.
*   **Use structured logging formats (e.g., JSON):** This makes parsing and analysis more robust and less susceptible to injection attacks. `spdlog` supports JSON formatting.

## Attack Surface: [File Path Injection (Log File Destinations)](./attack_surfaces/file_path_injection__log_file_destinations_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows user-controlled input to determine the destination of log files, attackers can inject malicious paths to write logs to arbitrary locations.

**How spdlog Contributes:** `spdlog` allows specifying file paths for log output. If the application uses user-provided input (e.g., from configuration files or command-line arguments) to construct these file paths without proper validation, `spdlog` will attempt to write logs to the attacker-controlled location.

**Example:** An attacker provides the path `../../../../etc/passwd` as the log file destination. If the application uses this directly with `spdlog`, it might attempt to write log data to this sensitive file.

**Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, information disclosure by writing logs to accessible locations, denial of service by filling up arbitrary disk space.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Validate and sanitize user-provided file paths:** Ensure they conform to expected patterns and do not contain path traversal sequences (like `../`).
*   **Use absolute paths or restrict allowed directories:** Configure `spdlog` to only write logs to specific, controlled directories.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Sinks](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_sinks.md)

**Description:** If the application uses custom `spdlog` sinks (implementing the `spdlog::sinks::sink` interface), vulnerabilities within the custom sink implementation can introduce security risks.

**How spdlog Contributes:** `spdlog` provides an interface for creating custom sinks. If developers implement these sinks insecurely, `spdlog` will utilize these vulnerable sinks, potentially exposing the application to risks during the logging process.

**Example:** A custom sink that sends logs over a network might not implement proper authentication or encryption, allowing attackers to intercept or tamper with log data. Another example is a custom sink that executes external commands based on log content without proper sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability in the custom sink. Could range from information disclosure and data manipulation to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the sink's functionality)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Thoroughly review and audit custom sink implementations:** Follow secure coding practices and perform security testing.
*   **Avoid unnecessary complexity in custom sinks:** Keep the logic simple and focused on the core logging functionality.
*   **Use established and secure libraries for any external interactions:** If the sink interacts with networks or external systems, use well-vetted and secure libraries.
