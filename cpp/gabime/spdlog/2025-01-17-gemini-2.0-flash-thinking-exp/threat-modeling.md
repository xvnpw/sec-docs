# Threat Model Analysis for gabime/spdlog

## Threat: [Format String Vulnerability](./threats/format_string_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that is directly used as the format string in `spdlog` logging calls. This allows the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations within the application's process by exploiting format specifiers. They might be able to leak sensitive information, cause a denial of service by crashing the application, or potentially even achieve remote code execution.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, denial of service, remote code execution.

**Affected spdlog Component:** Logging calls (e.g., `spdlog::info`, `spdlog::error`, etc.) when the first argument is directly derived from user input.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Never use user-controlled input directly as the format string in `spdlog` logging calls.
* Always use predefined format strings and pass user-provided data as arguments to the logging functions (e.g., `spdlog::info("User logged in: {}", username)`).
* Utilize static analysis tools to identify potential format string vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in Log File Paths](./threats/path_traversal_in_log_file_paths.md)

**Description:** If the application allows configuration of the `spdlog` file sink's log file path based on user input or external configuration without proper validation, an attacker might be able to use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../sensitive.log`) to write logs to arbitrary locations on the file system. This could overwrite critical system files or expose sensitive information by writing logs to publicly accessible directories.

**Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to system compromise or information disclosure.

**Affected spdlog Component:** Configuration of the file sink, specifically the path where log files are written.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid allowing user-controlled input to directly define the log file path for `spdlog`'s file sink.
* If necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of any path-related configuration provided to `spdlog`.
* Use absolute paths or restrict the base directory for log files and prevent traversal outside of it when configuring the file sink.
