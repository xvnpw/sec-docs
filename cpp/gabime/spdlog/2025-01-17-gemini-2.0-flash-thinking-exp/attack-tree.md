## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via spdlog](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_spdlog.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. All mitigation efforts should aim to prevent the attacker from achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path / Critical Node: Exploit Logging Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__critical_node_exploit_logging_mechanisms.md)

* This category represents a significant attack surface where the logging functionality itself is abused.
    * **Attack Vector: Log Injection [CRITICAL NODE]**
        * Attackers inject malicious content into log messages.
        * **High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Payloads via Logged Data**
            * Crafting input data containing escape sequences or format string specifiers that are interpreted by downstream systems (e.g., log aggregators, SIEM).
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: Medium (Information Disclosure) to High (Command Injection)
            * Effort: Low to Medium
            * Skill Level: Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path / Critical Node: Exploit spdlog Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__critical_node_exploit_spdlog_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

* This category highlights risks arising from insecure configuration of the spdlog library.
    * **Attack Vector: Insecure Logging Levels [CRITICAL NODE]**
        * **High-Risk Path:** Configuring the application to log sensitive information at unnecessarily verbose levels (e.g., DEBUG or TRACE in production).
            * Likelihood: Medium
            * Impact: Medium to High (Information Disclosure)
            * Effort: Low
            * Skill Level: Basic
            * Detection Difficulty: Easy
    * **Attack Vector: Misconfigured Sinks [CRITICAL NODE]**
        * **High-Risk Path:** Using sinks that write logs to insecure locations or services without proper authentication or authorization.
            * Likelihood: Low to Medium
            * Impact: Medium to High (Information Disclosure, potential for further compromise)
            * Effort: Low (discovery) to Medium (exploitation)
            * Skill Level: Basic to Intermediate
            * Detection Difficulty: Medium
