# Threat Model Analysis for gabime/spdlog

## Threat: [Malicious Log Injection](./threats/malicious_log_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits insufficient input validation when the application passes data to `spdlog`'s logging functions. `spdlog` then processes and writes this malicious content to the log output. The attacker manipulates data that is subsequently logged to inject control characters, escape sequences, or other potentially harmful content directly into the log stream via `spdlog`.

**Impact:**
*   Log Forgery and Tampering: Injected content can create false entries or modify existing log data as it is being written by `spdlog`.
*   Command Injection (Indirect): If log files written by `spdlog` are later processed by vulnerable scripts or tools, the injected content can lead to command execution.
*   Information Disclosure: Attackers can inject content that, when displayed from logs written by `spdlog`, reveals sensitive information to unauthorized viewers.

**Affected spdlog Component:**
*   `spdlog::info()`, `spdlog::warn()`, `spdlog::error()`, `spdlog::log()` and other logging functions that are used to write data to the configured sinks.
*   Potentially formatters if they don't handle injected control characters safely during the formatting process within `spdlog`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization Before Logging:** The application *must* sanitize any user-provided or external data *before* passing it to `spdlog`'s logging functions. Escape special characters and control sequences.
*   **Parameterized Logging:**  The application should consistently use parameterized logging (e.g., `spdlog::info("User logged in: {}", username);`) to prevent direct injection of untrusted data into the log message format string processed by `spdlog`.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Logs](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_logs.md)

**Description:** The application directly passes sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal data) as arguments to `spdlog`'s logging functions. `spdlog` then faithfully records this sensitive data into the configured log outputs. The vulnerability lies in the application's misuse of `spdlog` by providing it with sensitive information to log.

**Impact:**
*   Confidentiality Breach: Sensitive credentials or data logged by `spdlog` become accessible to anyone who can read the log files.
*   Privacy Violation: Logging PII by `spdlog` can violate privacy regulations.
*   Security Compromise: Exposed internal details logged by `spdlog` can aid attackers in further compromising the system.

**Affected spdlog Component:**
*   All logging functions (`spdlog::info()`, `spdlog::debug()`, etc.) where sensitive data is passed as an argument for `spdlog` to process and write.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Logging Policies:** The development team must establish and enforce strict policies that prohibit logging sensitive information.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify and remove instances where sensitive data is being passed to `spdlog`'s logging functions.
*   **Data Masking/Redaction:** Implement mechanisms *before* logging to mask or redact sensitive information before it is passed to `spdlog`.
*   **Secure Configuration of Sinks:** Ensure that the sinks configured for `spdlog` (e.g., file sinks, network sinks) are themselves securely configured to protect the logged data.
