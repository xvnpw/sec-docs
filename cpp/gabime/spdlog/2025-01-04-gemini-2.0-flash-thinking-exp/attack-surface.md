# Attack Surface Analysis for gabime/spdlog

## Attack Surface: [Format String Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/format_string_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Occurs when user-controlled input is directly used as the format string in logging functions. This allows attackers to inject format specifiers that can read from or write to arbitrary memory locations.
- **How spdlog Contributes:** `spdlog` uses a `fmt`-like syntax for formatting log messages. If the format string argument in functions like `spdlog::info(format_string, ...)` is directly derived from user input, it becomes vulnerable.
- **Example:**
    ```cpp
    std::string user_input = get_untrusted_input();
    spdlog::info(user_input); // Vulnerable!
    ```
    An attacker could provide `user_input` like `"%p %x %s %n"` to potentially leak memory addresses or cause crashes.
- **Impact:** Memory corruption, information disclosure (leaking stack or heap data), denial of service (crashing the application), potentially even remote code execution in older systems or with specific library versions.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Never use user-controlled input directly as the format string.** Always use string literals or pre-defined, safe format strings.
    - Pass user-provided data as arguments to the format string:
      ```cpp
      std::string user_input = get_untrusted_input();
      spdlog::info("User input: {}", user_input); // Safe
      ```
    - Utilize static analysis tools that can detect format string vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in File Logging](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_file_logging.md)

- **Description:** If the application allows users to influence the log file path, attackers might be able to specify a path outside the intended logging directory, potentially overwriting critical files.
- **How spdlog Contributes:** `spdlog` allows specifying the log file path when creating file sinks. If this path is derived from unsanitized user input or configuration, it becomes vulnerable.
- **Example:**
    ```cpp
    std::string log_path = get_untrusted_log_path();
    auto file_sink = std::make_shared<spdlog::sinks::basic_file_sink<>>(log_path); // Vulnerable!
    auto logger = std::make_shared<spdlog::logger>("file_logger", file_sink);
    ```
    An attacker could provide `log_path` like `"../../../../etc/passwd"` to attempt overwriting system files.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary file overwrite, potentially leading to system compromise or denial of service.
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Never directly use user-provided input for log file paths.**
    - **Use absolute paths or relative paths within a restricted, pre-defined logging directory.**
    - **Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user-provided input that influences the log file path.**

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Sinks](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_sinks.md)

- **Description:** `spdlog` allows for the creation of custom sinks to handle log output in various ways. If these custom sinks are not implemented securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities.
- **How spdlog Contributes:** `spdlog` provides the interface for custom sinks, but the security of the implementation is the responsibility of the developer creating the sink.
- **Example:** A custom network sink that doesn't properly authenticate or encrypt communication could be exploited to intercept or manipulate log data. A custom database sink with SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the custom sink, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution.
- **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Thoroughly review and test custom sink implementations for security vulnerabilities.**
    - **Follow secure coding practices when developing custom sinks, including input validation and proper error handling.**
    - **Use secure communication protocols (e.g., TLS) for network-based sinks.**
    - **Ensure custom database sinks use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.**
