## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Log Injection to Influence Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_log_injection_to_influence_application_logic.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the fact that the application logs data which is subsequently used for making security-related decisions. By injecting malicious or misleading data into the logs, the attacker can manipulate the application's behavior.

**Critical Node: Application Logs Data Used in Security Decisions (e.g., usernames, file paths):** This is a critical point because if the application relies on log data for authentication, authorization, or other security checks, manipulating this data can directly lead to unauthorized access or actions. For example, an attacker might inject a log entry indicating a successful login for their account when it was actually a failed attempt, potentially bypassing authentication checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieving Arbitrary File Write and Overwriting Critical Files](./attack_tree_paths/achieving_arbitrary_file_write_and_overwriting_critical_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker aims to gain the ability to write log files to arbitrary locations on the system. Once this is achieved, they can overwrite critical application files, such as configuration files or executable binaries, leading to application compromise or denial of service.

**Critical Node: Achieve Arbitrary File Write:** This is a critical juncture as it unlocks the ability to perform numerous high-impact attacks related to file system manipulation.

**Critical Node: Application Configures File Sink with User-Controlled Path:** This configuration vulnerability is a direct enabler of arbitrary file write. If the application allows users or external sources to control the log file path without proper validation, attackers can manipulate this to write to any location they desire.

## Attack Tree Path: [Accidentally Passing User-Controlled Strings as Format Strings](./attack_tree_paths/accidentally_passing_user-controlled_strings_as_format_strings.md)

**Attack Vector:** Despite Spdlog's efforts to prevent format string vulnerabilities, developers might mistakenly pass user-controlled input directly as the format string to Spdlog's logging functions. This allows attackers to inject format specifiers that can read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to code execution.

**Vulnerable Code Path Uses User Input in Logging:** This is the specific point where the developer error occurs, making it a crucial part of this high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Sinks](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_sinks.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application utilizes custom-developed Spdlog sinks, these sinks might contain security vulnerabilities such as injection flaws or buffer overflows. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution or other malicious outcomes.

**Critical Node: Application Implements a Custom Sink:** This is a critical point because it introduces the potential for vulnerabilities inherent in custom code, which might not have the same level of scrutiny as the core Spdlog library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulating Spdlog Configuration to Expose Sensitive Information](./attack_tree_paths/manipulating_spdlog_configuration_to_expose_sensitive_information.md)

**Attack Vector:** The attacker targets the Spdlog configuration mechanism. If the application loads its configuration from an external source that the attacker can control, they can modify the configuration to redirect log output to an attacker-controlled server or change the logging format to include sensitive data that would not normally be logged.

**Critical Node: Manipulate Spdlog Configuration to Expose Sensitive Information:** This represents the successful compromise of the logging configuration for malicious purposes.

**Critical Node: Application Loads Spdlog Configuration from External Source:** This configuration practice introduces a vulnerability if the external source is not adequately secured, making it a critical point in this attack path.
