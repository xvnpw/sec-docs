# Attack Surface Analysis for taichi-dev/taichi

## Attack Surface: [Kernel Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/kernel_code_injection.md)

*Description:* Injection of malicious code into Taichi kernels, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code on the target backend (CPU, GPU, etc.).
*How Taichi Contributes:* Taichi's core functionality is the compilation and execution of user-defined kernels.  Direct influence over kernel code generation by untrusted input creates the injection vulnerability.
*Example:* A web application allows users to input parameters that are directly used (without proper sanitization) to construct a Taichi kernel's loop conditions or mathematical operations. An attacker inputs malicious code that gets executed on the GPU.
*Impact:* Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, arbitrary code execution on the backend.
*Risk Severity:* Critical
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation and sanitization of *all* user-provided data used in kernel construction. Use a whitelist approach.
    *   **Templating with Escaping:** Employ a secure templating engine with robust escaping mechanisms. Avoid direct string concatenation.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Taichi kernels with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Execute Taichi kernels within a sandboxed environment.

## Attack Surface: [Backend Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/backend_exploitation.md)

*Description:* Exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying backend hardware or software (e.g., CUDA, Vulkan, Metal drivers) through specially crafted Taichi code.
*How Taichi Contributes:* Taichi compiles to multiple backends. Taichi code serves as the *direct* mechanism to trigger vulnerabilities in these backends. The attacker uses Taichi as the delivery vehicle.
*Example:* An attacker crafts a Taichi kernel that, when compiled and executed, triggers a known buffer overflow in a specific, outdated CUDA driver version.
*Impact:* System instability, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution (depending on the backend vulnerability).
*Risk Severity:* High (potentially Critical, depending on the specific backend vulnerability)
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Keep Backends Updated:** Regularly update all backend drivers and libraries.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities in the specific backends.
    *   **Runtime Checks (if feasible):** Implement runtime checks within the Taichi code (if performance allows) to detect potential out-of-bounds access.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Sandboxing the execution environment.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*Description:* An attacker submits a Taichi kernel designed to consume excessive computational resources (CPU, GPU, memory), leading to a denial of service.
*How Taichi Contributes:* Taichi's ability to perform highly parallel computations on GPUs and CPUs, *directly controlled by user-provided code*, makes it a prime target for resource exhaustion.
*Example:* An attacker submits a Taichi kernel with an extremely large number of iterations, a massive data allocation, or an infinite loop (if not properly checked).
*Impact:* Denial of service, system instability, potential for data loss.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Resource Limits:** Impose strict limits on Taichi kernel execution: time, memory, threads/blocks.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Continuously monitor resource usage during kernel execution.
    *   **Queueing System:** Implement a queueing system to manage kernel execution.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate at which users can submit Taichi kernels.

## Attack Surface: [Metaprogramming Abuse](./attack_surfaces/metaprogramming_abuse.md)

*Description:* Exploiting Taichi's metaprogramming capabilities to generate malicious or unintended code.
*How Taichi Contributes:* Taichi's *built-in* metaprogramming features allow for dynamic code generation.  If attacker input controls this process, it's a direct Taichi vulnerability.
*Example:* An attacker provides input that influences the parameters of a `ti.template()` function, causing it to generate code that accesses unauthorized memory.
*Impact:* Similar to kernel code injection; can lead to arbitrary code execution or data breaches.
*Risk Severity:* High
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Apply rigorous input validation and sanitization to all inputs influencing metaprogramming.
    *   **Restricted Metaprogramming API:** Expose only a limited and well-defined API for metaprogramming to untrusted users.
    *   **Code Review:** Carefully review any code that uses metaprogramming.
