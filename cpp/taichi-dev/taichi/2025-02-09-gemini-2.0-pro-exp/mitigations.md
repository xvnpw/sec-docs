# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for taichi-dev/taichi

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Input Sanitization and Validation (Kernel Code & Data)](./mitigation_strategies/1__input_sanitization_and_validation__kernel_code_&_data_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Whitelist (Taichi-Specific):** Create a precise list of *allowed Taichi language constructs*. This goes beyond basic Python syntax and includes Taichi-specific elements:
        *   Allowed decorators (e.g., `@ti.kernel`, `@ti.func`, `@ti.struct_class`).  Disallow or carefully scrutinize others (e.g., `@ti.pyfunc` if external Python calls are risky).
        *   Allowed data types (e.g., `ti.i32`, `ti.f32`, `ti.types.vector(3, ti.f32)`).  Restrict or disallow custom data types if they introduce complexity or potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Allowed control flow structures (e.g., `for`, `if`, `while`).  Limit or disallow recursion if it's not strictly necessary.
        *   Allowed built-in functions (e.g., `ti.sin`, `ti.cos`, `ti.atomic_add`).  Disallow or carefully examine any functions that interact with external resources or have side effects.
        *   Allowed operations (e.g., arithmetic, bitwise).  Restrict or disallow potentially dangerous operations.
    2.  **Develop a Parser/Validator (Taichi-Focused):**
        *   Use Python's `ast` module to parse the Taichi kernel code (which is, at its core, Python code).
        *   Traverse the AST and check each node against the whitelist.  Specifically, look for `ast.Call` nodes where the function being called is a Taichi decorator or function.
        *   For data inputs, use Taichi's type system (e.g., `ti.types`) to validate the types and shapes of arguments passed to kernels.
    3.  **Reject Invalid Code/Data:** If any part of the Taichi code or data violates the whitelist, reject it immediately.
    4.  **Log Validation Failures:** Log all rejections.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Untrusted Code Execution (High Severity):** Prevents malicious Taichi code (specifically, code using disallowed Taichi features) from being compiled and executed.
    *   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):** Limits the complexity of Taichi code, reducing the chance of resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Untrusted Code Execution:** Significant risk reduction (e.g., 80-95%, depending on whitelist strictness).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Moderate risk reduction (e.g., 40-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* Basic data type validation using `ti.types` is in `src/input_validation.py`. A simple whitelist of Taichi functions is in `config/taichi_whitelist.json`.
    *   *(Real Project: Specify files and functions where Taichi-specific validation occurs.)*

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* Full AST-based validation of Taichi constructs is missing. Validation of loop structures and disallowed operations is incomplete.
    *   *(Real Project: Identify gaps in Taichi-specific validation.)*

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Resource Limits (Leveraging Taichi APIs)](./mitigation_strategies/2__resource_limits__leveraging_taichi_apis_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Limits:** Determine appropriate limits for CPU time, memory, and GPU memory.
    2.  **Implement Limits (Taichi-Specific):**
        *   **GPU Memory:** Explore Taichi's API for controlling GPU memory allocation.  This might involve using specific Taichi functions or configuration options when initializing the Taichi runtime (e.g., setting a maximum memory fraction).  *This is the most direct Taichi-specific control.*
        *   **CPU Time/Memory (Indirect):** While Taichi doesn't directly offer CPU time or general memory limits *within* a kernel, you can use Python's standard library (e.g., `threading.Timer`, `resource` module) *around* the Taichi kernel invocation to enforce limits on the *entire* Taichi process. This isn't purely Taichi-specific, but it's the closest you can get without external tools.
    3.  **Monitor (Indirect):** Use Python's `psutil` library (or similar) to monitor the Taichi process's resource usage *from outside* the kernel.
    4.  **Terminate:** If limits are exceeded, terminate the Taichi process.
    5. **Log:** Log all violations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessive resource consumption.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Significant risk reduction (e.g., 70-90%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* No direct Taichi API calls for resource limiting are used. A basic CPU timeout using `threading.Timer` is in `src/kernel_executor.py`.
    *   *(Real Project: Specify any Taichi API usage for resource control.)*

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* Investigate and implement Taichi's GPU memory limiting features. Implement more robust CPU time and memory limits using `psutil` and potentially the `resource` module.
    *   *(Real Project: Identify missing Taichi-specific resource controls.)*

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Compiler Updates (Staying Current with Taichi)](./mitigation_strategies/3__compiler_updates__staying_current_with_taichi_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Track Taichi Releases:** Monitor the official Taichi GitHub repository (https://github.com/taichi-dev/taichi) for new releases.  Subscribe to release notifications.
    2.  **Review Release Notes:** Carefully examine the release notes for each new version, paying close attention to:
        *   **Security Fixes:** Explicitly mentioned security vulnerabilities that have been addressed.
        *   **Bug Fixes:**  Bugs, even if not explicitly security-related, can sometimes lead to vulnerabilities.
        *   **Deprecations:**  Deprecated features might indicate potential future security issues.
    3.  **Update Regularly:** Update your application's Taichi dependency to the latest stable release, after appropriate testing.
    4. **Test After Update:** Thoroughly test your application after each Taichi update to ensure compatibility and that no new issues have been introduced.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compiler Bugs (Variable Severity):** Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in the Taichi compiler.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compiler Bugs:** Risk reduction (degree depends on the specific bugs fixed).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* The application uses Taichi version X.Y.Z. There's no formal process for tracking updates.
    *   *(Real Project: Describe the current Taichi version and update practices.)*

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* Establish a formal process for monitoring Taichi releases and updating the dependency.
    *   *(Real Project: Identify gaps in Taichi update procedures.)*

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Disable Unnecessary Taichi Features](./mitigation_strategies/4__disable_unnecessary_taichi_features.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify Unnecessary Features:** Analyze your application's use of Taichi and identify any features that are not strictly required. This might include:
        *   Advanced metaprogramming capabilities.
        *   Custom data types.
        *   Specific backends (e.g., if you only need CPU, disable GPU backends).
        *   Experimental features.
    2. **Disable Features:**
        *   **Configuration Options:** Check the Taichi documentation for configuration options that can disable specific features. This might involve setting environment variables or modifying Taichi's initialization.
        *   **Code Modifications:** If configuration options are not available, you might need to modify the Taichi source code (if you have a fork) or avoid using the unnecessary features in your own code.
    3. **Test Thoroughly:** After disabling features, thoroughly test your application to ensure that it still functions correctly.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Untrusted Code Execution (Variable Severity):** Reduces the attack surface by limiting the available Taichi features that could be exploited.
    *   **Compiler Bugs (Variable Severity):** Reduces the likelihood of encountering bugs in unused features.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Untrusted Code Execution:** Risk reduction depends on the specific features disabled.
    *   **Compiler Bugs:** Risk reduction depends on the specific features disabled.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* No specific Taichi features have been explicitly disabled.
    *   *(Real Project: List any Taichi features that have been disabled.)*

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Example (Hypothetical):* Analyze the application's Taichi usage and identify any features that can be safely disabled. Investigate Taichi's configuration options for disabling features.
    *   *(Real Project: Identify opportunities to disable unnecessary Taichi features.)*
