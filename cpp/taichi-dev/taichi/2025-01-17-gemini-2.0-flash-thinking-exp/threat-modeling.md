# Threat Model Analysis for taichi-dev/taichi

## Threat: [Malicious Kernel Injection](./threats/malicious_kernel_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into Taichi kernels if the application dynamically constructs or parameterizes kernels based on untrusted user input without proper sanitization. This could involve crafting input strings that, when processed by Taichi's compilation pipeline, result in the execution of arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or client machine running the application, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Taichi's JIT Compiler, specifically the parts responsible for parsing and generating code from user-provided input or Python definitions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid dynamically constructing kernel code based on untrusted user input.
*   If dynamic construction is necessary, implement rigorous input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious code snippets.
*   Use parameterized kernels with clearly defined input types and ranges.

## Threat: [Backend-Specific Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/backend-specific_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Attackers could exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities present in the specific backend implementations used by Taichi (e.g., CUDA drivers, OpenGL implementations). This might involve crafting specific Taichi programs that trigger these vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Can range from application crashes and unexpected behavior to arbitrary code execution with the privileges of the backend driver or runtime environment.

**Affected Component:** Taichi's Backend Interface and the specific backend implementation (e.g., `taichi.lang.cuda`, `taichi.lang.opengl`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Taichi and the underlying backend drivers updated to the latest stable versions.
*   Monitor security advisories for the specific backends your application uses.
*   Consider the security implications of choosing specific backends and potentially limit the supported backends.

## Threat: [Taichi Compiler Vulnerability](./threats/taichi_compiler_vulnerability.md)

**Description:**  Attackers could exploit bugs or vulnerabilities within Taichi's JIT compiler itself. This might involve crafting specific Taichi programs that trigger these vulnerabilities during the compilation process.

**Impact:** Could lead to denial of service (crashing the compiler), unexpected behavior, or potentially even arbitrary code execution during compilation.

**Affected Component:** Taichi's JIT Compiler (`taichi.lang.kernel`, `taichi.program`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use stable and well-tested versions of Taichi.
*   Monitor Taichi's issue tracker and security advisories for reported compiler vulnerabilities.
*   Avoid using experimental or nightly builds in production environments.
