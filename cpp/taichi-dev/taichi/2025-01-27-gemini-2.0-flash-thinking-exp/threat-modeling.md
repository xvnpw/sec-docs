# Threat Model Analysis for taichi-dev/taichi

## Threat: [Malicious Compiler Injection](./threats/malicious_compiler_injection.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Taichi compiler. They craft a malicious Taichi program or input that, when compiled, injects arbitrary code into the compiled kernel or the compilation process itself. This could happen if the compiler has bugs in parsing, optimization, or code generation stages.
Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server or client machine where compilation occurs. Full system compromise is possible.
Affected Taichi Component: Taichi Compiler (specifically parsing, optimization, or code generation modules).
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep Taichi updated to the latest stable version.
    * Monitor Taichi security advisories.
    * Consider static analysis and fuzzing of Taichi code and compilation pipelines.
    * Isolate compilation environment if possible.

## Threat: [Runtime Environment Exploitation](./threats/runtime_environment_exploitation.md)

Description: An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Taichi runtime environment, particularly in backend-specific implementations (CPU, GPU). This could involve memory corruption bugs, race conditions, or improper handling of system calls within the runtime. Exploitation might be triggered by specific Taichi kernel execution or crafted input data.
Impact: Privilege Escalation, Memory Corruption, Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Container Escape if running in containers.
Affected Taichi Component: Taichi Runtime Environment (especially backend-specific implementations and driver interaction modules).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Keep underlying system and drivers (especially GPU drivers) up-to-date.
    * Isolate Taichi execution environment using sandboxing or containerization.
    * Monitor resource usage of Taichi processes for anomalies.
    * Regularly restart Taichi runtime processes to mitigate potential memory leaks or long-running exploits.

## Threat: [Insecure Kernel Logic](./threats/insecure_kernel_logic.md)

Description: Developers write Taichi kernels with logic errors, such as buffer overflows, out-of-bounds access, or integer overflows. An attacker can provide input data that triggers these errors, leading to unexpected behavior or exploitable conditions.
Impact: Denial of Service (DoS), Data Corruption, Information Disclosure, potentially Remote Code Execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
Affected Taichi Component: User-written Taichi Kernels (specifically the logic implemented within `@ti.kernel` functions).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Apply secure coding practices in Taichi kernels (input validation, boundary checks, memory safety).
    * Conduct thorough code reviews and testing of Taichi kernels, especially those handling external data.
    * Utilize Taichi's debugging tools to identify and fix logic errors.
    * Consider using memory-safe programming techniques and libraries within Taichi kernels where applicable.

## Threat: [Data Injection Attack](./threats/data_injection_attack.md)

Description: An attacker injects malicious or crafted data into the application that is subsequently processed by Taichi kernels. This data is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the kernel logic or cause unexpected behavior, potentially leading to information leakage or denial of service.
Impact: Denial of Service (DoS), Data Corruption, Information Disclosure, potentially Remote Code Execution.
Affected Taichi Component: Data input pipeline to Taichi Kernels (specifically the interface between the application and Taichi data structures).
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Implement robust input validation and sanitization *before* data is passed to Taichi kernels.
    * Define and enforce data schemas to prevent unexpected data types or formats.
    * Use data integrity checks (checksums, signatures) to detect data tampering.
    * Principle of least privilege for data access within Taichi kernels.

## Threat: [Compromised Taichi Package](./threats/compromised_taichi_package.md)

Description: An attacker compromises the Taichi package distribution channel (e.g., PyPI). They inject malicious code into the Taichi package itself. Users downloading or updating Taichi from the compromised source will unknowingly install the malicious package.
Impact: Remote Code Execution, Backdoor installation, Data theft, System compromise on developer and user machines.
Affected Taichi Component: Taichi Package Distribution (PyPI, official repositories).
Risk Severity: Critical
Mitigation Strategies:
    * Download Taichi from trusted and official sources only.
    * Verify package integrity using checksums or signatures if available.
    * Use virtual environments or containerization to limit the impact of a compromised package.
    * Employ security scanning tools to detect potentially malicious code in installed packages.
