# Attack Surface Analysis for taichi-dev/taichi

## Attack Surface: [JIT Compiler Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/jit_compiler_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Bugs or weaknesses in Taichi's Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler that could be exploited by malicious Taichi code.
* **Taichi Contribution:** Taichi relies heavily on JIT compilation, making the compiler a core component and potential vulnerability point.
* **Example:** A specially crafted Taichi kernel triggers a buffer overflow in the JIT compiler during code generation, allowing arbitrary machine code injection.
* **Impact:** Code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.
* **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use Stable Taichi Versions.
    * Regularly Update Taichi.
    * Input Validation for Compilation Parameters.
    * Support Compiler Security Hardening efforts in the Taichi project.

## Attack Surface: [Taichi Runtime Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/taichi_runtime_library_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Security flaws within the core Taichi runtime library, responsible for memory management, execution, and backend interactions.
* **Taichi Contribution:** The Taichi runtime is essential for program execution, and its vulnerabilities directly impact application security.
* **Example:** A memory management bug in the Taichi runtime leads to a buffer overflow when processing large datasets, enabling code execution.
* **Impact:** Memory corruption, code execution, denial of service, data integrity issues.
* **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use Stable Taichi Versions.
    * Regularly Update Taichi.
    * Support Memory Safety Practices in the Taichi project.
    * Implement Resource Limits for Taichi applications.

## Attack Surface: [Deserialization Attacks on Taichi Objects](./attack_surfaces/deserialization_attacks_on_taichi_objects.md)

* **Description:** Vulnerabilities during deserialization of Taichi objects (kernels, data structures) from untrusted sources.
* **Taichi Contribution:** Taichi's serialization/deserialization mechanisms can be exploited if not handled securely, directly related to Taichi's object handling.
* **Example:** A malicious serialized Taichi kernel object, when deserialized, triggers code execution due to a vulnerability in the deserialization process.
* **Impact:** Code execution, data corruption, denial of service.
* **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (escalating to High/Critical if code execution is easily achievable).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data.
    * Input Validation Before Deserialization.
    * Use Secure Serialization Methods.
    * Apply Principle of Least Privilege to deserialization processes.
