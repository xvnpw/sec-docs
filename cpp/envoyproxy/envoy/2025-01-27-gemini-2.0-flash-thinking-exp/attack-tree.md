## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Envoy Exploitation:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_envoy_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to application data, functionality, or causing disruption.
*   **Attack Vectors (Leading to this goal via High-Risk Paths):**
    *   Exploiting Envoy Misconfiguration
    *   Exploiting Envoy Weakness (While not explicitly marked as High-Risk Path in this sub-tree for brevity, it's implicitly a path to compromise)

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Envoy Misconfiguration [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_envoy_misconfiguration__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Leveraging incorrect or insecure configuration settings in Envoy to compromise the application. Misconfiguration is a common and often easily exploitable vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-Nodes):**
    *   Exploit Insecure Authentication/Authorization Configuration
    *   Exploit Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration
    *   Exploit Insecure Logging/Monitoring Configuration
    *   Exploit Denial of Service (DoS) via Configuration
    *   Exploit Insecure Routing Configuration
    *   Exploit Exposure of Admin Interface (if enabled insecurely)

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Authentication/Authorization Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_insecure_authenticationauthorization_configuration__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Bypassing or weakening authentication and authorization mechanisms configured in Envoy. This allows unauthorized access to protected resources.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-Nodes):**
    *   Identify Weak or Missing Authentication Mechanisms (e.g., no authentication, basic auth without HTTPS, weak JWT validation).
    *   Bypass Authentication/Authorization:
        *   Credential Stuffing/Brute-force (if basic auth is used insecurely).
        *   Exploiting Logic Flaws in Auth Filters (if custom filters are used and have vulnerabilities).
        *   Session Hijacking (if session management is weak or insecure).
    *   Gain Unauthorized Access to Application Resources: Accessing APIs, data, or functionalities that should be restricted.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Unauthorized Access to Application Resources:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__gain_unauthorized_access_to_application_resources.md)

*   **Description:** The direct impact of successful authentication/authorization bypass. Attackers can now interact with the application as if they were authorized users.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions, manipulation of application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses in the TLS/SSL configuration of Envoy to intercept or manipulate encrypted traffic.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-Nodes):**
    *   Identify Weak TLS Ciphers or Protocols (e.g., allowing outdated protocols like SSLv3 or weak ciphers).
    *   Perform Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:
        *   Gain Network Position to Intercept Traffic (e.g., ARP poisoning, DNS spoofing, compromised network infrastructure).
        *   Downgrade TLS Connection (forcing the use of weak ciphers if allowed).
    *   Intercept or Modify Sensitive Data in Transit: Stealing or altering data exchanged between clients and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Intercept or Modify Sensitive Data in Transit:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__intercept_or_modify_sensitive_data_in_transit.md)

*   **Description:** The direct impact of a successful MitM attack due to weak TLS configuration.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data integrity compromise, session hijacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Logging/Monitoring Configuration:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_loggingmonitoring_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Leveraging misconfigured logging to access sensitive information inadvertently logged by Envoy.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-Nodes):**
    *   Identify Excessive or Sensitive Data Logging (e.g., logging request bodies, API keys, user credentials).
    *   Access Logs Containing Sensitive Information: Gaining unauthorized access to log files or log management systems.
    *   Extract Sensitive Information (e.g., API keys, user data): Mining logs for valuable secrets or user data.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Extract Sensitive Information (e.g., API keys, user data):](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__extract_sensitive_information__e_g___api_keys__user_data_.md)

*   **Description:** The direct impact of insecure logging practices. Sensitive data is exposed through logs.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, credential compromise, privacy violations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Denial of Service (DoS) via Configuration [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_denial_of_service__dos__via_configuration__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Causing a denial of service by exploiting misconfigurations in Envoy's DoS protection mechanisms (or lack thereof).
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-Nodes):**
    *   Identify Misconfigured Rate Limiting, Circuit Breaking, or Resource Limits (e.g., overly permissive rate limits, disabled circuit breakers, insufficient resource allocation).
    *   Craft Requests to Exhaust Resources:
        *   High Volume of Requests (flooding Envoy with requests).
        *   Resource-Intensive Requests (sending requests that consume excessive CPU, memory, or network bandwidth).
    *   Cause Application Unavailability: Making the application inaccessible to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Cause Application Unavailability:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__cause_application_unavailability.md)

*   **Description:** The direct impact of a successful DoS attack. The application becomes unusable.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, business impact, reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Routing Configuration:](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_routing_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Manipulating or exploiting flaws in Envoy's routing configuration to access unintended backend services or data.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-Nodes):**
    *   Identify Misconfigured Routes or Upstream Clusters (e.g., overly broad routing rules, incorrect upstream definitions).
    *   Manipulate Routing to Access Unintended Backends:
        *   Request Smuggling/Spoofing (crafting requests that bypass routing rules or are misinterpreted by Envoy).
    *   Access Sensitive Internal Services or Data: Gaining access to internal APIs, databases, or other services that should not be publicly accessible.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Access Sensitive Internal Services or Data:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__access_sensitive_internal_services_or_data.md)

*   **Description:** The direct impact of insecure routing configuration exploitation. Attackers gain access to internal, protected resources.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, internal system compromise, privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Exposure of Admin Interface (if enabled insecurely) [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_exposure_of_admin_interface__if_enabled_insecurely___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  Compromising the Envoy admin interface if it is exposed and not properly secured. The admin interface provides powerful control over Envoy.
*   **Attack Vectors (Sub-Nodes):**
    *   Identify Exposed Admin Interface (e.g., default port 9901, publicly accessible without authentication).
    *   Bypass Admin Interface Authentication (if any):
        *   Default Credentials (using default username/password if not changed).
        *   Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Admin Interface (if any vulnerabilities exist in the admin interface itself).
    *   Gain Control over Envoy Configuration and potentially the Application: Modifying Envoy configuration to redirect traffic, inject malicious filters, or disrupt service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Gain Control over Envoy Configuration and potentially the Application:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__gain_control_over_envoy_configuration_and_potentially_the_application.md)

*   **Description:** The most severe impact of compromising the admin interface. Attackers have full control over Envoy and can potentially pivot to compromise the backend application.
*   **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breaches, complete service disruption, long-term persistence.
