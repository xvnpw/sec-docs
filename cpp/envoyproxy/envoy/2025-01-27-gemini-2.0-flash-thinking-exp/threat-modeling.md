## Threat: [1. Misconfiguration of Access Control Policies](./threats/1__misconfiguration_of_access_control_policies.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfigured Access Control
*   **Description:** Attacker exploits incorrect Envoy RBAC, route configurations, or external authorization setups. This allows bypassing intended Envoy access restrictions to reach protected backend services or sensitive data managed by Envoy.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities proxied by Envoy, service disruption, privilege escalation within the application managed by Envoy.
*   **Affected Envoy Component:** Router, RBAC Filter, External Authorization Filter, Route Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement least privilege principle in Envoy access control configurations.
    *   Thoroughly test Envoy access control policies in staging environments.
    *   Conduct regular audits of Envoy access control configurations.
    *   Utilize policy-as-code and automated configuration validation tools for Envoy.

## Threat: [2. Exposure of Envoy Admin Interface](./threats/2__exposure_of_envoy_admin_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposed Admin Interface
*   **Description:** Attacker accesses the Envoy admin interface (e.g., `/stats`, `/config_dump`) if unintentionally exposed. This allows gathering sensitive Envoy configuration and application information, potentially leading to further attacks or manipulation of Envoy itself.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (Envoy configuration details, statistics), potential for Envoy configuration manipulation if write operations are enabled (less common in production).
*   **Affected Envoy Component:** Admin Interface Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to the Envoy admin interface to trusted networks only.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for Envoy admin interface access (if enabled in production).
