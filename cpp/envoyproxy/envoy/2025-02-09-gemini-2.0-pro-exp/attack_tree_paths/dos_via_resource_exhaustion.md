# Deep Analysis: Envoy DoS via Resource Exhaustion

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "DoS via Resource Exhaustion" attack path against an Envoy-based application.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities within Envoy's configuration and the application's architecture that could be exploited, assessing the feasibility and impact of such attacks, and recommending concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to enhance the application's resilience against resource exhaustion attacks.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the following:

*   **Envoy Proxy:**  We will examine Envoy's built-in resource management features, configuration options, and known vulnerabilities related to resource exhaustion.  This includes, but is not limited to, connection limits, request timeouts, buffer limits, rate limiting, and circuit breaking.
*   **Application Architecture:** We will consider how the application's design and interaction with Envoy might contribute to resource exhaustion vulnerabilities. This includes the types of requests handled, the backend services accessed, and the overall traffic patterns.
*   **Malformed Request Exploitation:**  We will deeply analyze the "Send malformed requests to exhaust resources" attack step, identifying specific types of malformed requests that could be particularly effective against Envoy.
*   **Detection and Monitoring:** We will explore how Envoy's logging, metrics, and tracing capabilities can be used to detect and diagnose resource exhaustion attacks.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   DoS attacks that do not target resource exhaustion (e.g., network-level flooding attacks that saturate bandwidth before reaching Envoy).
*   Vulnerabilities in backend services themselves, *except* where those vulnerabilities are amplified by Envoy's configuration or behavior.
*   Attacks targeting the control plane (e.g., xDS server compromise), although the impact of a compromised control plane on resource exhaustion will be briefly considered.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Expand the provided attack tree path with more specific attack vectors and scenarios.
2.  **Envoy Configuration Review:**  Analyze relevant Envoy configuration options and their default values, identifying potential weaknesses.
3.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigate known Envoy vulnerabilities (CVEs) and common misconfigurations related to resource exhaustion.
4.  **Code Review (if applicable):** If custom Envoy filters or extensions are used, review their code for potential resource exhaustion vulnerabilities.
5.  **Testing (Conceptual):**  Describe potential testing strategies (e.g., fuzzing, load testing) to validate the effectiveness of mitigations.  This will be conceptual, as actual testing is outside the scope of this document.
6.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  Propose specific, actionable recommendations to mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.
7.  **Detection and Response:**  Outline strategies for detecting and responding to resource exhaustion attacks in real-time.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Tree Path: DoS via Resource Exhaustion

### 2.1 Threat Modeling Refinement

The "Send malformed requests to exhaust resources" attack step can be further broken down into these specific attack vectors:

*   **Slowloris-style Attacks:**  Sending HTTP requests very slowly, keeping connections open for extended periods.  This exhausts connection pools and can prevent legitimate clients from connecting.  Envoy's connection management is crucial here.
*   **Large Request Body Attacks:**  Sending requests with extremely large bodies (e.g., gigabytes of data).  This consumes memory and potentially disk space if buffering is enabled.  Envoy's buffer limits and request body handling are key.
*   **Large Header Attacks:**  Sending requests with numerous or very large HTTP headers.  This can consume memory and processing time during header parsing.  Envoy's header size limits are relevant.
*   **HTTP/2 PING Flood:**  Sending a large number of HTTP/2 PING frames, forcing Envoy to respond with PONG frames.  This consumes CPU and network bandwidth.  Envoy's HTTP/2 connection management is important.
*   **HTTP/2 SETTINGS Flood:**  Sending a large number of HTTP/2 SETTINGS frames, forcing Envoy to process and acknowledge them.  Similar to PING floods, this consumes resources.
*   **HTTP/2 HEADERS Flood (HPACK Bomb):**  Sending specially crafted compressed HTTP/2 headers that expand to a very large size when decompressed.  This can lead to memory exhaustion.  Envoy's HPACK implementation and limits are critical.
*   **Resource-Intensive Route Exploitation:**  If the application has specific routes or endpoints that are known to be computationally expensive (e.g., complex database queries, image processing), the attacker can repeatedly request these resources to exhaust backend resources *through* Envoy.  Rate limiting and circuit breaking are important here.
*   **Amplification Attacks (via Upstream Services):**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in upstream services that Envoy proxies to.  For example, if an upstream service has a vulnerability that allows a small request to trigger a large response, the attacker can use Envoy to amplify the attack.  Envoy's role as a proxy makes it a potential amplifier.
*  **Connection Leak:** Sending requests that cause Envoy or the upstream server to leak connections, eventually exhausting the available connection pool.

### 2.2 Envoy Configuration Review

Several Envoy configuration options are crucial for mitigating resource exhaustion:

*   **`max_connections` (Listener and Cluster):**  Limits the maximum number of concurrent connections.  Setting this too high can lead to exhaustion, while setting it too low can impact legitimate traffic.  This needs to be tuned based on expected load and system resources.
*   **`per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes` (Listener and Cluster):**  Limits the size of the read and write buffers for each connection.  Setting this too high can lead to memory exhaustion.
*   **`request_timeout` (Route):**  Sets a timeout for the entire request.  This prevents slowloris-style attacks and protects against slow or unresponsive upstream services.
*   **`idle_timeout` (HTTP Connection Manager):**  Sets a timeout for idle connections.  This helps to reclaim resources from inactive connections.
*   **`max_request_headers_kb` (HTTP Connection Manager):**  Limits the maximum size of request headers.  This protects against large header attacks.
*   **`max_requests_per_connection` (HTTP Connection Manager):** Limits the number of requests that can be served over a single connection. This can help mitigate some HTTP/2-specific attacks.
*   **Rate Limiting (Global and Local):**  Envoy supports both global (using an external rate limiting service) and local (in-memory) rate limiting.  This is crucial for preventing attackers from overwhelming the system with requests.  Rate limiting can be applied per route, per IP address, or based on other request attributes.
*   **Circuit Breaking (Cluster):**  Envoy's circuit breaking feature monitors the health of upstream services and stops sending requests if they become overloaded or unresponsive.  This prevents Envoy from contributing to the exhaustion of backend resources.
*   **Outlier Detection (Cluster):** Detects and ejects unhealthy hosts from the load balancing pool.
*   **Retry Policies:** Carefully configured retry policies are important.  Aggressive retries can exacerbate resource exhaustion.  Exponential backoff and jitter are essential.
*   **HTTP/2 Settings:**  Envoy's HTTP/2 settings (`h2_settings` in the HTTP Connection Manager) control various aspects of HTTP/2 behavior, including:
    *   `max_concurrent_streams`: Limits the number of concurrent streams per connection.
    *   `initial_stream_window_size`: Controls the initial flow control window size for streams.
    *   `initial_connection_window_size`: Controls the initial flow control window size for the connection.
    *   `max_frame_size`: Limits the maximum size of HTTP/2 frames.
    *   `max_header_list_size`: Limits the maximum size of the header list (similar to `max_request_headers_kb`).

### 2.3 Vulnerability Research

*   **CVEs:**  A search for Envoy CVEs related to "denial of service" or "resource exhaustion" should be conducted regularly.  Examples (these may be outdated, always check the latest CVE database):
    *   CVE-2020-8663:  DoS via large header values in HTTP/2.
    *   CVE-2019-18801:  DoS via slow reads.
    *   CVE-2023-27487: DoS via a specially crafted HTTP/2 SETTINGS frame.
*   **Common Misconfigurations:**
    *   **Missing or overly permissive rate limits:**  This is the most common and critical misconfiguration.
    *   **High connection limits:**  Setting `max_connections` too high without adequate system resources.
    *   **Large buffer limits:**  Setting `per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes` too high.
    *   **Missing or long timeouts:**  Not setting `request_timeout` or `idle_timeout`, or setting them too high.
    *   **Disabled or misconfigured circuit breaking:**  Not using circuit breaking or setting thresholds too high.
    *   **Aggressive retry policies:**  Using retry policies without proper backoff and jitter.

### 2.4 Code Review (Conceptual)

If custom Envoy filters or extensions are used, the code should be reviewed for:

*   **Memory leaks:**  Ensure that memory allocated by the filter is properly released.
*   **Unbounded data structures:**  Avoid using data structures that can grow indefinitely based on untrusted input.
*   **Expensive operations:**  Identify and optimize any operations that consume significant CPU or memory.
*   **Blocking calls:**  Minimize or eliminate blocking calls that could tie up Envoy's worker threads.
*   **Proper error handling:**  Ensure that errors are handled gracefully and do not lead to resource leaks.

### 2.5 Testing (Conceptual)

*   **Load Testing:**  Use load testing tools (e.g., `wrk`, `hey`, `k6`) to simulate realistic and high-volume traffic.  Monitor Envoy's resource usage (CPU, memory, connections) during the tests.
*   **Fuzz Testing:**  Use fuzzing tools (e.g., `AFL`, `libFuzzer`, Envoy's built-in fuzzers) to send malformed requests to Envoy and observe its behavior.  This can help to identify vulnerabilities that might not be apparent during normal operation.  Focus on fuzzing:
    *   HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 header parsing.
    *   Request body parsing.
    *   Custom filter input.
*   **Slowloris Simulation:**  Use tools specifically designed to simulate Slowloris attacks (e.g., `slowhttptest`) to test Envoy's connection handling.
*   **Chaos Engineering:**  Introduce controlled failures into the system (e.g., network latency, upstream service failures) to observe Envoy's resilience.

### 2.6 Mitigation Recommendations

Based on the analysis above, the following mitigation strategies are recommended:

1.  **Implement Rate Limiting:**  This is the *most critical* mitigation.  Use Envoy's global or local rate limiting features to limit the number of requests from individual clients or IP addresses.  Configure rate limits based on expected traffic patterns and application requirements.
2.  **Configure Connection Limits:**  Set appropriate values for `max_connections` (listener and cluster) based on system resources and expected load.
3.  **Set Buffer Limits:**  Set appropriate values for `per_connection_buffer_limit_bytes` to prevent excessive memory consumption.
4.  **Implement Timeouts:**  Use `request_timeout` and `idle_timeout` to prevent slowloris attacks and reclaim resources from inactive connections.
5.  **Limit Header Size:**  Use `max_request_headers_kb` to protect against large header attacks.
6.  **Configure Circuit Breaking:**  Enable and configure circuit breaking to protect upstream services from overload.  Set appropriate thresholds for failure detection and recovery.
7.  **Tune HTTP/2 Settings:**  Carefully configure Envoy's HTTP/2 settings (`h2_settings`) to mitigate HTTP/2-specific attacks.  Pay particular attention to `max_concurrent_streams`, `max_header_list_size`, and flow control settings.
8.  **Use Outlier Detection:** Enable and configure outlier detection to automatically remove unhealthy upstream hosts.
9.  **Implement Retry Policies with Backoff and Jitter:**  Use exponential backoff and jitter in retry policies to avoid exacerbating resource exhaustion.
10. **Regularly Update Envoy:**  Stay up-to-date with the latest Envoy releases to benefit from security patches and performance improvements.
11. **Monitor Resource Usage:**  Continuously monitor Envoy's resource usage (CPU, memory, connections) using its built-in metrics and logging capabilities.  Set up alerts for unusual resource consumption.
12. **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF in front of Envoy to provide an additional layer of defense against common web attacks, including some DoS attacks.
13. **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Utilize a CDN to cache static content and absorb some of the load, reducing the burden on Envoy and the origin servers.
