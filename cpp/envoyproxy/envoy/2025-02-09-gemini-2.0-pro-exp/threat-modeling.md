# Threat Model Analysis for envoyproxy/envoy

## Threat: [Malicious xDS Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious_xds_configuration_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious xDS Configuration Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the xDS server (control plane) or the communication channel between Envoy and the xDS server. They inject a malicious configuration that redirects traffic, disables security features, or exposes internal services. This could involve modifying Listeners, Clusters, Routes, or Endpoints.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete traffic hijacking.
        *   Exposure of sensitive internal services.
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Envoy Component:** xDS API (Listener, Cluster, RouteConfiguration, Endpoint, Secret Discovery Service (SDS)), Configuration parsing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **mTLS:** Enforce mutual TLS (mTLS) between Envoy and the xDS server.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement strict schema validation and semantic checks on all configurations received from the xDS server.
        *   **Digital Signatures:** Use digital signatures to verify the integrity and authenticity of configurations.
        *   **Access Control:** Implement strong authentication and authorization for the xDS server.
        *   **Auditing:** Log all configuration changes and access attempts to the xDS server.
        *   **Secure Configuration Source:** Use a secure, trusted source for configurations (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).

## Threat: [Rogue Envoy Instance Joining Mesh](./threats/rogue_envoy_instance_joining_mesh.md)

*   **Threat:** Rogue Envoy Instance Joining Mesh
    *   **Description:** An attacker introduces a malicious Envoy proxy instance into the service mesh. This rogue instance can intercept, modify, or drop traffic.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Service disruption.
    *   **Affected Envoy Component:** Service Discovery, Mesh Communication (inter-Envoy communication), potentially xDS if the rogue instance attempts to register.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **mTLS:** Enforce mTLS for all inter-Envoy communication within the mesh.  This ensures only authorized Envoy instances can communicate.
        *   **SPIFFE/SPIRE:** Use SPIFFE/SPIRE or a similar system to provide strong, verifiable identities to Envoy instances.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Use network policies to restrict communication between Envoy instances to only authorized paths.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor for unexpected Envoy instances joining the mesh and alert on anomalies.

## Threat: [Admin Interface Exposure](./threats/admin_interface_exposure.md)

*   **Threat:** Admin Interface Exposure
    *   **Description:** The Envoy admin interface (typically on port 9901) is exposed to unauthorized access, allowing an attacker to view configuration, statistics, and potentially modify runtime settings.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information disclosure (configuration, metrics).
        *   Potential for denial of service by manipulating runtime settings.
        *   Gaining insights for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Envoy Component:** Admin interface (/listeners, /clusters, /stats, etc.).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable in Production:** Disable the admin interface in production environments unless absolutely necessary.
        *   **Network Restrictions:** Restrict access to the admin interface to trusted networks and IP addresses using network policies or firewall rules.
        *   **Authentication:** Implement strong authentication (e.g., OAuth2, basic auth with strong passwords) for the admin interface.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Remote code execution.
        *   Denial of service.
        *   Privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Envoy Component:** Custom filters or extensions, particularly those written in languages susceptible to memory safety issues (C/C++).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Memory-Safe Languages:** Use memory-safe languages (e.g., Rust, Go) for custom filters and extensions whenever possible.
        *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom filters and extensions, focusing on memory safety.
        *   **Fuzzing:** Use fuzzing techniques to test custom filters and extensions for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential buffer overflows and other memory safety issues.
        *   **Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) and Data Execution Prevention (DEP):** Ensure these operating system security features are enabled.

## Threat: [HTTP/2 Header Smuggling](./threats/http2_header_smuggling.md)

*   **Threat:** HTTP/2 Header Smuggling
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits discrepancies in how Envoy and the upstream server handle HTTP/2 headers, allowing them to inject malicious headers or bypass security controls.  *While the upstream server is involved, the vulnerability exists because of how Envoy handles and forwards these headers.*
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Request smuggling.
        *   Bypass of security filters.
        *   Potential for data exfiltration or command injection.
    *   **Affected Envoy Component:** HTTP/2 codec (`envoy.http_connection_manager`), upstream connection handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Upstream Server Compatibility:** Ensure the upstream server is fully compliant with the HTTP/2 specification and handles headers correctly.
        *   **Header Validation:** Implement strict validation of HTTP/2 headers in Envoy, including header name and value sanitization.
        *   **Envoy Updates:** Keep Envoy up-to-date to benefit from the latest security fixes and improvements in the HTTP/2 codec.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF in front of Envoy to provide an additional layer of protection against HTTP/2 smuggling attacks. (Note: WAF is an additional layer, not a direct Envoy mitigation).

## Threat: [TLS Downgrade Attack](./threats/tls_downgrade_attack.md)

*   **Threat:** TLS Downgrade Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the initial connection and forces Envoy to use a weaker TLS protocol or cipher suite, making the connection vulnerable to eavesdropping.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
        *   Data breaches.
    *   **Affected Envoy Component:** TLS configuration (`envoy.transport_sockets.tls`), Listener.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Weak Protocols and Ciphers:** Configure Envoy to only support strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.3, TLS 1.2) and cipher suites.
        *   **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Use HSTS to instruct browsers to always connect to the server using HTTPS.
        *   **Certificate Pinning:** Consider certificate pinning for critical services to prevent MITM attacks using forged certificates.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_in_logs.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Leakage in Logs
    *   **Description:** Envoy logs contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords, PII) due to misconfiguration, verbose logging, or logging of request/response bodies.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breaches.
        *   Compliance violations.
        *   Reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Envoy Component:** Access logging configuration, custom filters that log data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Log Redaction:** Implement log redaction techniques to mask sensitive data before it is written to logs.
        *   **Logging Levels:** Carefully configure logging levels to avoid unnecessary verbosity.
        *   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:** Avoid logging sensitive headers, request/response bodies, or other data that could contain PII or credentials.
        *   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP):** Use DLP tools to monitor logs for sensitive data and alert on potential leaks.
        *   **Structured Logging:** Use a structured logging format (e.g., JSON) to make it easier to parse and filter logs.
