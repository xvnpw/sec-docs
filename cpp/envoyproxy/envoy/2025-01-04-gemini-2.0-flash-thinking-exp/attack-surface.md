# Attack Surface Analysis for envoyproxy/envoy

## Attack Surface: [Insecurely Exposed Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/insecurely_exposed_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** The Envoy admin interface, if not properly secured, allows access to sensitive information and control functionalities.

**How Envoy Contributes:** Envoy provides a built-in admin interface (typically on port 9901) for inspecting its state, statistics, and even making configuration changes. Leaving this interface accessible without authentication or authorization controls creates a direct attack vector.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the `/certs` endpoint on the admin interface, revealing the private keys for TLS certificates used by Envoy.

**Impact:** Full compromise of Envoy's security posture, potential for data theft, service disruption, and configuration manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Disable the admin interface in production environments** if not absolutely necessary.
- **Implement strong authentication and authorization** for accessing the admin interface (e.g., using the `--admin-address-path` option with a Unix domain socket and restricting access via file system permissions, or using a dedicated authentication mechanism).
- **Restrict access to the admin port** using network firewalls or access control lists (ACLs).
- **Avoid exposing the admin interface to the public internet.**

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Mismanagement Leading to Open Proxies or Routing Errors](./attack_surfaces/configuration_mismanagement_leading_to_open_proxies_or_routing_errors.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured Envoy routing rules or listeners can inadvertently create open proxies or expose internal services.

**How Envoy Contributes:** Envoy's powerful routing capabilities, if misconfigured, can forward traffic to unintended destinations or allow external access to internal resources. Incorrectly defined listeners can bind to public interfaces without proper security controls.

**Example:** A routing rule is configured to forward all requests to a specific backend service without proper authentication, allowing unauthorized external access to that service. A listener is bound to `0.0.0.0` on a public interface without TLS termination or authentication, effectively creating an open proxy.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive internal services, data breaches, potential for abuse as an open proxy for malicious activities.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Implement the principle of least privilege** when configuring routing rules and listeners.
- **Thoroughly review and test all configuration changes** before deploying them.
- **Use explicit routing rules** instead of overly broad wildcard configurations.
- **Enforce TLS termination and authentication** on all external-facing listeners.
- **Regularly audit Envoy configurations** for potential misconfigurations.

## Attack Surface: [Request Smuggling due to Parsing Discrepancies](./attack_surfaces/request_smuggling_due_to_parsing_discrepancies.md)

**Description:** Differences in how Envoy and backend servers parse HTTP requests can be exploited to inject malicious requests.

**How Envoy Contributes:** Envoy sits as a proxy in front of backend servers. If Envoy and the backend have different interpretations of HTTP request boundaries (e.g., Content-Length vs. Transfer-Encoding), an attacker can craft a request that Envoy interprets differently than the backend, leading to the smuggling of additional requests.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a request with ambiguous Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding headers. Envoy might forward one request, while the backend interprets it as two separate requests, allowing the attacker to inject a malicious second request.

**Impact:** Bypass security controls on the backend, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, or access to restricted resources.

**Risk Severity:** **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Configure Envoy to strictly adhere to HTTP standards** and reject ambiguous requests.
- **Ensure backend servers have consistent HTTP parsing behavior** with Envoy.
- **Enable request normalization features in Envoy** where available.
- **Implement end-to-end request signing or encryption** to ensure integrity.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom or Third-Party Filters](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom_or_third-party_filters.md)

**Description:** Security flaws in custom-developed or third-party Envoy filters can introduce vulnerabilities.

**How Envoy Contributes:** Envoy's extensibility through filters allows developers to add custom logic. However, vulnerabilities in these filters can be exploited.

**Example:** A custom filter has a buffer overflow vulnerability that can be triggered by a specially crafted request, leading to a crash or remote code execution. A third-party authentication filter has a bypass vulnerability allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Service disruption, information disclosure, remote code execution on the Envoy instance.

**Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Thoroughly review and security test all custom filters.**
- **Keep third-party filters up-to-date** with the latest security patches.
- **Implement secure coding practices** when developing custom filters.
- **Consider using WebAssembly (WASM) filters with appropriate sandboxing and resource limits.**

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting Envoy](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_targeting_envoy.md)

**Description:** Attackers can overwhelm Envoy with requests or exploit vulnerabilities to cause service disruption.

**How Envoy Contributes:** As a front-facing proxy, Envoy is a target for DoS attacks. Vulnerabilities in its request processing or connection handling can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker sends a large volume of requests to exhaust Envoy's resources. An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Envoy's HTTP/2 handling to cause excessive CPU usage.

**Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting all applications proxied by Envoy.

**Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Implement rate limiting and connection limits** in Envoy.
- **Configure appropriate timeouts** for connections and requests.
- **Deploy Envoy behind a DDoS mitigation service.**
- **Keep Envoy updated** with the latest security patches addressing DoS vulnerabilities.
- **Monitor Envoy's resource usage** and set up alerts for anomalies.
