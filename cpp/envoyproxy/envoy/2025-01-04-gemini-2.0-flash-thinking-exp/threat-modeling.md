# Threat Model Analysis for envoyproxy/envoy

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Envoy Filters](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_envoy_filters.md)

**Description:** If an application uses custom-built Envoy filters, vulnerabilities within these filters (e.g., buffer overflows, injection flaws) could be exploited by an attacker sending specially crafted requests. This could lead to remote code execution on the Envoy instance or other unintended consequences.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** Filter Chain (specifically the custom filter module).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom filters.
* Implement thorough testing and code reviews for all custom filters.
* Consider using well-vetted, open-source filter implementations where possible.
* Implement sandboxing or isolation techniques for custom filters if feasible.

## Threat: [Control Plane Compromise](./threats/control_plane_compromise.md)

**Description:** If the control plane responsible for managing Envoy's configuration is compromised, an attacker could push malicious configurations, effectively taking control of the Envoy instances and the traffic they handle.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application's traffic flow, data breaches, denial of service, potential for further lateral movement.

**Affected Component:** Control Plane API, Configuration Discovery Service (CDS), Listener Discovery Service (LDS), Route Discovery Service (RDS), Endpoint Discovery Service (EDS).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the control plane infrastructure with strong authentication and authorization.
* Implement network segmentation to isolate the control plane.
* Use mutual TLS (mTLS) for communication between Envoy instances and the control plane.
* Implement audit logging for all control plane activities.

## Threat: [Weak TLS Configuration](./threats/weak_tls_configuration.md)

**Description:** If Envoy's TLS configuration is weak (e.g., using outdated protocols like SSLv3 or weak ciphers), an attacker could perform man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks to intercept and potentially modify traffic between clients and Envoy, or between Envoy and upstream services.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, data tampering, potential credential compromise.

**Affected Component:** Listener (specifically the TLS context configuration), Upstream Connection Manager (for upstream TLS).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce the use of strong TLS protocols (TLS 1.2 or higher).
* Configure a strong set of cipher suites, prioritizing forward secrecy.
* Regularly update Envoy and its dependencies to benefit from security patches.
* Use tools like `testssl.sh` to verify the TLS configuration.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Lack of Rate Limiting](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_lack_of_rate_limiting.md)

**Description:** Without proper rate limiting configured in Envoy, an attacker could flood the proxy with requests, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and causing a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Impact:** Denial of service, impacting application availability.

**Affected Component:** Rate Limiter module, HTTP Connection Manager.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement global and local rate limiting rules within Envoy.
* Configure connection limits and timeouts to prevent resource exhaustion.
* Monitor Envoy's resource usage and configure alerts for abnormal behavior.

## Threat: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass](./threats/authentication_and_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** If authentication and authorization filters in Envoy are misconfigured or have vulnerabilities, an attacker might be able to bypass these checks and gain unauthorized access to backend services.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality.

**Affected Component:** Authentication Filters (e.g., JWT AuthN, External Auth), Authorization Filters (e.g., RBAC).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test authentication and authorization configurations.
* Regularly update authentication and authorization filter implementations.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring authorization policies.
* Consider using a dedicated authorization service for more complex scenarios.

## Threat: [Secrets Management Vulnerabilities](./threats/secrets_management_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If secrets (e.g., TLS private keys, API keys) used by Envoy are not managed securely (e.g., hardcoded in configuration files, stored in version control), they could be exposed to attackers.

**Impact:** Compromise of sensitive credentials, leading to further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Secret Discovery Service (SDS), Configuration Loader.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid hardcoding secrets in Envoy configurations.
* Use a dedicated secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to securely store and retrieve secrets.
* Utilize Envoy's Secret Discovery Service (SDS) to dynamically fetch secrets.
* Implement strict access controls for secret storage.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Envoy Core or Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_envoy_core_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Like any software, Envoy itself or its underlying dependencies may contain security vulnerabilities. If these vulnerabilities are not patched promptly, attackers could exploit them to compromise the Envoy instance.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Core Envoy process, various modules and libraries.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay up-to-date with the latest Envoy releases and security patches.
* Subscribe to security advisories for Envoy and its dependencies.
* Implement a process for regularly updating Envoy and its dependencies.
* Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
