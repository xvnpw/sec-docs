## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Control Plane Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_control_plane_vulnerabilities.md)

* Exploit Vulnerabilities in Admin API (If Enabled):
    * Attack Vector: Identify and exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Admin API endpoints. This could involve sending crafted requests to trigger unexpected behavior, bypass security checks, or achieve remote code execution.
    * Bypass Authentication/Authorization (If Weak or Misconfigured):
        * Attack Vector: Attempt to use default credentials, common passwords, or exploit known authentication bypass vulnerabilities. If authorization is weak, an attacker with limited access might be able to escalate privileges or access sensitive endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Envoy Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_envoy_misconfigurations.md)

* Weak Authentication/Authorization on Admin API (If Enabled):
    * Attack Vector: Attempt to access the Admin API using default credentials, easily guessable passwords, or by exploiting the lack of proper authentication mechanisms.
    * Insecurely Stored or Managed Certificates/Keys:
        * Attack Vector: Target the storage location of TLS certificates and private keys used by Envoy. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the key management system, accessing files with weak permissions, or using social engineering to obtain credentials for accessing the storage.
    * Using Deprecated or Vulnerable Envoy Versions:
        * Attack Vector: Identify the running version of Envoy and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities associated with that version. Exploit code might be readily available for common vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Buffer Overflow in Request/Response Handling](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_buffer_overflow_in_requestresponse_handling.md)

* Attack Vector: Send specially crafted, oversized requests or responses to Envoy that exceed the allocated buffer size. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution if the attacker can control the overwritten data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries used by Envoy](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_libraries_used_by_envoy.md)

* Attack Vector: Identify the specific versions of third-party libraries used by Envoy and research known vulnerabilities affecting those versions. Then, craft requests or interactions that trigger the vulnerable code path in the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Admin API (If Enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_admin_api__if_enabled_.md)

* Attack Vector: Identify and exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the Admin API endpoints. This could involve sending crafted requests to trigger unexpected behavior, bypass security checks, or achieve remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization on Admin API](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization_on_admin_api.md)

* Attack Vector: Attempt to use default credentials, common passwords, or exploit known authentication bypass vulnerabilities. If authorization is weak, an attacker with limited access might be able to escalate privileges or access sensitive endpoints.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication/Authorization on Admin API (If Enabled)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authenticationauthorization_on_admin_api__if_enabled_.md)

* Attack Vector: Attempt to access the Admin API using default credentials, easily guessable passwords, or by exploiting the lack of proper authentication mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecurely Stored or Managed Certificates/Keys](./attack_tree_paths/insecurely_stored_or_managed_certificateskeys.md)

* Attack Vector: Target the storage location of TLS certificates and private keys used by Envoy. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the key management system, accessing files with weak permissions, or using social engineering to obtain credentials for accessing the storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Deprecated or Vulnerable Envoy Versions](./attack_tree_paths/using_deprecated_or_vulnerable_envoy_versions.md)

* Attack Vector: Identify the running version of Envoy and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities associated with that version. Exploit code might be readily available for common vulnerabilities.
