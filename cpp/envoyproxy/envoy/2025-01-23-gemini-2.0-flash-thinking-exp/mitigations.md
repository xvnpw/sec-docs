# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for envoyproxy/envoy

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for **Envoy Configuration**](./mitigation_strategies/implement_infrastructure-as-code__iac__for_envoy_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose an IaC tool:** Select an Infrastructure-as-Code tool suitable for your environment (e.g., Kubernetes manifests, Terraform, Pulumi).
    2.  **Define Envoy Configuration in IaC:** Represent all **Envoy-specific configurations** (listeners, routes, clusters, filters, RBAC policies, etc.) within IaC files. For Kubernetes, this involves YAML manifests for ConfigMaps, Secrets, and Deployments/StatefulSets that define **Envoy's configuration**. For Terraform/Pulumi, use their respective configuration languages to manage **Envoy's deployment and configuration**.
    3.  **Version Control:** Store all IaC configuration files, including **Envoy configurations**, in a version control system (e.g., Git).
    4.  **Automated Deployment:** Integrate IaC with your CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of **Envoy configurations**. This ensures consistent and repeatable deployments of **Envoy**.
    5.  **Configuration Reviews:** Implement a code review process specifically for all IaC changes related to **Envoy configuration**.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Configuration Drift (Medium Severity):** Inconsistencies in **Envoy configurations** across environments.
        *   **Manual Configuration Errors (High Severity):** Human errors during manual configuration of **Envoy**, leading to vulnerabilities.
        *   **Lack of Auditability (Medium Severity):** Difficulty tracking changes to **Envoy configurations**.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Configuration Drift: **High Reduction**. IaC enforces consistent **Envoy configurations**.
        *   Manual Configuration Errors: **High Reduction**. Automation and code review minimize errors in **Envoy configuration**.
        *   Lack of Auditability: **High Reduction**. Version control provides audit trail for **Envoy configuration changes**.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Kubernetes manifests are used for basic Envoy deployment and service definitions, stored in `git repository/infrastructure/kubernetes`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Detailed **Envoy configurations** (filters, complex routing rules, security policies) are still partially managed manually. Need to migrate all **Envoy configuration definitions** into IaC and fully automate the deployment process for **Envoy configurations**.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Mutual TLS (mTLS) for **Envoy Control Plane (xDS) Communication**](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_mutual_tls__mtls__for_envoy_control_plane__xds__communication.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Certificate Authority (CA):** Establish a CA to issue certificates for **Envoy instances** and the Control Plane.
    2.  **Certificate Generation:** Generate unique certificates for each **Envoy instance** and Control Plane component, signed by the CA.
    3.  **Envoy Configuration (mTLS for xDS):** Configure **Envoy** to use mTLS for xDS communication with the Control Plane. This involves specifying paths to **Envoy's** certificate and key, and the CA certificate for verifying the Control Plane.  Utilize **Envoy's xDS configuration options** to enable mTLS.
    4.  **Control Plane Configuration (mTLS Enforcement):** Configure the Control Plane to require mTLS connections from **Envoy instances**. The Control Plane should verify client certificates presented by **Envoy**.
    5.  **Certificate Rotation:** Implement regular certificate rotation for **Envoy and Control Plane certificates**.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Control Plane Impersonation (High Severity):** Attackers impersonating the Control Plane to send malicious configurations to **Envoy**.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Control Plane Communication (High Severity):** Intercepting communication between **Envoy** and the Control Plane.
        *   **Unauthorized Envoy Registration (Medium Severity):** Unauthorized **Envoy instances** connecting to the Control Plane.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Control Plane Impersonation: **High Reduction**. mTLS ensures only authorized Control Planes configure **Envoys**.
        *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Control Plane Communication: **High Reduction**. TLS encryption protects **Envoy's control plane communication**.
        *   Unauthorized Envoy Registration: **Medium Reduction**. mTLS limits unauthorized **Envoy** connections.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Currently, **Envoy instances** connect to the Control Plane using plain TLS (server-side TLS only) without client certificate authentication.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** mTLS needs to be implemented for all xDS communication between **Envoy** and the Control Plane. This requires configuring both **Envoy** and the Control Plane for mTLS, setting up certificate management, and deploying certificates to **Envoy instances** and the Control Plane.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Input Validation and Sanitization in **Custom Envoy Filters**](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_in_custom_envoy_filters.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points in Filters:** Analyze custom **Envoy filters** to identify input points (request headers, body, query parameters, metadata).
    2.  **Define Validation Rules for Filters:** Define strict validation rules for each input point in **custom Envoy filters**.
    3.  **Implement Validation Logic in Filters:** Incorporate validation logic within the **custom Envoy filter code**, using **Envoy's filter APIs** to access and validate input.
    4.  **Sanitize Input Data in Filters:** Sanitize input data within **custom Envoy filters** after validation.
    5.  **Error Handling in Filters:** Implement robust error handling in **custom Envoy filters** for invalid input.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Header Injection Attacks (High Severity):** Malicious headers injected into requests processed by **Envoy**.
        *   **Request Smuggling (Medium Severity):** Exploiting HTTP request parsing discrepancies between **Envoy** and backends.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Headers (Medium Severity):** XSS vulnerabilities through headers processed by **Envoy**.
        *   **Command/SQL Injection (High Severity) (in custom filters):** Injection vulnerabilities if **custom filters** interact with external systems based on unsanitized input.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Header Injection Attacks: **High Reduction**. Validation in **Envoy filters** prevents header injection.
        *   Request Smuggling: **Medium Reduction**. Input validation in **Envoy filters** can mitigate some smuggling techniques.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Headers: **Medium Reduction**. Sanitization in **Envoy filters** reduces XSS risk.
        *   Command/SQL Injection: **High Reduction**. Sanitization in **Envoy filters** significantly reduces injection risks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic input validation is present in some custom filters, primarily focused on data type checks and length limits.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive input validation and sanitization are missing across all **custom Envoy filters**. Need a thorough review of **custom filters**, detailed validation rules, and robust validation/sanitization logic within **Envoy filters**.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement **Envoy's Resource Limits and Rate Limiting**](./mitigation_strategies/implement_envoy's_resource_limits_and_rate_limiting.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Resource Limit Definition for Envoy:** Determine resource limits for **Envoy instances** (CPU, memory, connections).
    2.  **Container Resource Limits (for containerized Envoy):** Configure container resource limits for **Envoy** in containerized deployments (e.g., Kubernetes).
    3.  **Envoy Connection Limits:** Configure **Envoy's** `max_connections` listener setting.
    4.  **Envoy Request Rate Limiting:** Implement request rate limiting within **Envoy** using rate limiting filters (`envoy.filters.http.ratelimit`). Configure **Envoy's rate limiting** based on criteria like client IP, path, headers.
    5.  **Envoy Circuit Breaking:** Configure **Envoy's circuit breakers** for upstream clusters to prevent cascading failures. Set limits on pending/active requests and connection failures within **Envoy**.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (High Severity):** DoS attacks overwhelming **Envoy instances**.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):** Legitimate traffic spikes exhausting **Envoy resources**.
        *   **Cascading Failures (Medium Severity):** Failures propagating due to **Envoy overload**.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: **Medium Reduction**. **Envoy's rate limiting** and resource limits mitigate some DoS attacks.
        *   Resource Exhaustion: **High Reduction**. **Envoy's resource limits** prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   Cascading Failures: **High Reduction**. **Envoy's circuit breaking** prevents cascading failures.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Container resource limits are defined in Kubernetes deployments for **Envoy**. Basic connection limits are configured in **Envoy listeners**.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Request rate limiting is not consistently implemented across all **Envoy routes**. **Envoy circuit breaking** is not fully configured for all upstream clusters. Need to implement granular **Envoy rate limiting** policies and configure **Envoy circuit breakers** for all upstream dependencies.
