# Threat Model Analysis for envoyproxy/envoy

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Access to Admin Interface](./threats/unauthenticated_access_to_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to access the Envoy admin interface if it's exposed without proper authentication. They might try default credentials or exploit known vulnerabilities in the admin interface if present. Successful access allows them to inspect configurations, statistics, and potentially modify settings or even shut down the proxy.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the Envoy instance, leading to service disruption, data exfiltration (by observing traffic), or manipulation of routing and other critical configurations.

**Affected Component:** Admin Interface Listener, Admin Handlers

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable authentication and authorization for the admin interface.
* Restrict access to the admin interface to trusted networks or IP addresses.
* Change default credentials if they exist.
* Consider disabling the admin interface in production environments if not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [HTTP Header Manipulation for Bypass](./threats/http_header_manipulation_for_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious HTTP requests with specific header values to bypass security filters or routing rules configured in Envoy. They might try to inject headers that are interpreted by backend services in unintended ways, leading to unauthorized access or actions.

**Impact:** Bypassing authentication or authorization checks, gaining access to restricted resources, or triggering vulnerabilities in backend services.

**Affected Component:** HTTP Connection Manager, Router, HTTP Filters (e.g., `envoy.filters.http.rbac`, custom filters)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict header validation and sanitization within Envoy filters.
* Avoid relying solely on client-provided headers for critical security decisions.
* Carefully design routing rules to prevent unintended matching based on manipulated headers.
* Regularly review and update filter configurations.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Misconfigured Limits](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_misconfigured_limits.md)

**Description:** An attacker could send a large number of requests or requests with excessively large bodies to overwhelm Envoy if resource limits (e.g., connection limits, request body size limits, buffer sizes) are not properly configured. This could lead to denial of service.

**Impact:** Service disruption, impacting availability for legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** Listener, HTTP Connection Manager, Network Filters

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure appropriate connection limits, request body size limits, and buffer sizes based on expected traffic and system capacity.
* Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
* Utilize circuit breaking to prevent cascading failures to backend services.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom Envoy Filters](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom_envoy_filters.md)

**Description:** If the application uses custom Envoy filters (written in Lua, WASM, or as native extensions), vulnerabilities in the filter code could be exploited by attackers. This could involve code injection, buffer overflows, or other common software vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution within the Envoy process, data breaches, or service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Custom HTTP Filters, Custom Network Filters

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for other vulnerabilities)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Follow secure coding practices when developing custom filters.
* Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of custom filter implementations.
* Implement input validation and sanitization within custom filters.
* Keep custom filter dependencies up-to-date.
