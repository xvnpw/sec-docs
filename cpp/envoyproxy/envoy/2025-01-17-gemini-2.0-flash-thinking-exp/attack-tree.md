## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___critical_node_.md)

* Description: Exploit a vulnerability in Envoy's code (e.g., parsing, processing) to execute arbitrary code on the Envoy instance.
* Impact: **High** - Full control over the Envoy instance, potentially allowing access to sensitive data, manipulation of traffic, and further exploitation of the application.
* Likelihood: **Low** - Requires discovery of a new or unpatched vulnerability.
* Effort: **High** - Requires significant reverse engineering and exploit development skills.
* Skill Level: **Expert**
* Detection Difficulty: **Medium** - Can be detected through unusual process activity or network connections if proper monitoring is in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfiguration of Routing Rules (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/misconfiguration_of_routing_rules__high_risk_path_.md)

* Description: Exploit incorrectly configured routing rules to redirect traffic to unintended destinations, potentially exposing internal services or sensitive data.
* Impact: **Medium to High** - Access to internal resources, data breaches, and potential for further attacks.
* Likelihood: **Medium** - Human error in configuration is common.
* Effort: **Low to Medium** - Requires understanding of routing concepts and Envoy's configuration syntax.
* Skill Level: **Intermediate**
* Detection Difficulty: **Medium to High** - Requires careful monitoring of traffic flow and routing decisions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Authentication/Authorization Policies (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/weak_authenticationauthorization_policies__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* Description: Bypass or exploit weak authentication or authorization mechanisms configured in Envoy, gaining unauthorized access to protected resources.
* Impact: **Medium to High** - Unauthorized access to application functionalities and data.
* Likelihood: **Medium** - Organizations might implement weak or flawed authentication/authorization.
* Effort: **Low to Medium** - Depends on the specific weakness, could involve brute-forcing or exploiting logical flaws.
* Skill Level: **Beginner to Intermediate**
* Detection Difficulty: **Medium** - Requires monitoring of authentication attempts and authorization decisions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Access to Admin Interface (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_access_to_admin_interface__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* Description: Gain unauthorized access to Envoy's administrative interface (if enabled) due to weak credentials or lack of proper access controls.
* Impact: **High** - Full control over Envoy configuration and potentially the underlying system.
* Likelihood: **Low to Medium** - Depends on whether the admin interface is exposed and if default credentials are used.
* Effort: **Low** - If default credentials are used, otherwise might require some effort to find or brute-force credentials.
* Skill Level: **Beginner to Intermediate**
* Detection Difficulty: **Low** - Accessing the admin interface should be logged and easily detectable if monitoring is in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP Request Smuggling (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/http_request_smuggling__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* Description: Craft malicious HTTP requests that exploit discrepancies in how Envoy and backend servers parse request boundaries, allowing the attacker to inject requests into other users' connections.
* Impact: **Medium to High** - Bypassing security controls, session hijacking, and potential for data manipulation.
* Likelihood: **Medium** - Requires understanding of HTTP protocol intricacies and potential backend server vulnerabilities.
* Effort: **Medium** - Requires crafting specific HTTP requests.
* Skill Level: **Intermediate to Advanced**
* Detection Difficulty: **High** - Can be difficult to detect without deep inspection of HTTP traffic and understanding of expected request patterns.
