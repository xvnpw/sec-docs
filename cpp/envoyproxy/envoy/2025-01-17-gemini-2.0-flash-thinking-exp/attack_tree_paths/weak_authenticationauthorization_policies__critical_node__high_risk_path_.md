**Attack Path Breakdown:**

The "Weak Authentication/Authorization Policies" attack path encompasses various scenarios where an attacker can bypass or exploit flaws in how the application, fronted by Envoy, verifies user identity and grants access to resources. Here's a breakdown of potential sub-paths and attack vectors:

* **Missing or Weak Authentication:**
    * **No Authentication Required:**  Certain endpoints or functionalities might be exposed without requiring any form of authentication.
    * **Default Credentials:**  Envoy or the application might be deployed with default usernames and passwords that are easily guessable or publicly known.
    * **Basic Authentication without HTTPS:**  Credentials transmitted in plaintext over an insecure connection, allowing for interception.
    * **Weak Password Policies:**  Lack of complexity requirements, allowing for brute-force attacks.
    * **Missing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Reliance on single-factor authentication makes accounts vulnerable to credential compromise.

* **Flawed Authorization Logic:**
    * **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):**  Attackers can manipulate identifiers to access resources belonging to other users.
    * **Missing Authorization Checks:**  Endpoints or functionalities might not properly verify if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly defined roles or permissions granting excessive access to users.
    * **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) Flaws:**  Vulnerabilities in the logic used to evaluate attributes for access control decisions.
    * **JWT Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Weak or Missing Signature Verification:**  Attackers can forge JWTs to impersonate users.
        * **Algorithm Confusion Attacks:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in JWT libraries to bypass signature verification.
        * **Secret Key Exposure:**  Compromised secret keys used for signing JWTs.
        * **Insufficient Claim Validation:**  Not properly validating claims within the JWT, leading to potential bypasses.

* **Session Management Issues:**
    * **Predictable Session IDs:**  Attackers can guess or predict valid session IDs to hijack user sessions.
    * **Session Fixation:**  Attackers can force a user to authenticate with a known session ID.
    * **Lack of Session Expiration or Inactivity Timeout:**  Sessions remain active indefinitely, increasing the window of opportunity for attackers.
    * **Insecure Session Storage:**  Storing session information insecurely, making it vulnerable to compromise.

* **Exploiting External Authorization Services:**
    * **Communication Vulnerabilities:**  Exploiting weaknesses in the communication between Envoy and the external authorization service.
    * **Logic Flaws in the Authorization Service:**  Bypassing authorization checks within the external service itself.
    * **Misconfiguration of the External Authorization Filter:**  Incorrectly configured Envoy settings for interacting with the external service.

**Potential Attack Vectors:**

Based on the breakdown above, attackers can employ various techniques:

* **Credential Stuffing/Brute-Force Attacks:**  Attempting to guess usernames and passwords.
* **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:**  Intercepting communication to steal credentials or session tokens (especially if HTTPS is not enforced or configured correctly).
* **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing or predicting session IDs to gain unauthorized access.
* **Parameter Tampering:**  Manipulating request parameters to bypass authorization checks (e.g., exploiting IDOR).
* **JWT Forgery/Manipulation:**  Creating or modifying JWTs to gain unauthorized access.
* **Exploiting Logic Flaws:**  Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's authorization logic.
