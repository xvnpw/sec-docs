# Attack Surface Analysis for envoyproxy/envoy

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Admin API Access](./attack_surfaces/insecure_admin_api_access.md)

- **Description:** The Envoy Admin API provides runtime configuration and inspection capabilities. If not properly secured, it allows unauthorized access to control and potentially compromise the proxy.
    - **How Envoy Contributes to Attack Surface:** Envoy exposes this API by default on a configured port. Lack of strong authentication or authorization on this endpoint directly introduces a control plane vulnerability.
    - **Example:** An attacker gains access to the Admin API (e.g., through default credentials or lack of authentication) and reconfigures routing rules to redirect traffic to a malicious server or exfiltrate sensitive information.
    - **Impact:** Critical
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the Admin API (e.g., mutual TLS, API keys).
        - Disable the Admin API on production instances if not strictly necessary.
        - Restrict access to the Admin API to trusted networks or specific IP addresses.
        - Regularly review and rotate any API keys or credentials used for authentication.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Envoy's HTTP/2 or gRPC Implementation](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_envoy's_http2_or_grpc_implementation.md)

- **Description:**  Envoy's handling of HTTP/2 and gRPC protocols might contain implementation flaws that can be exploited by sending specially crafted requests.
    - **How Envoy Contributes to Attack Surface:** Envoy acts as a termination point for these protocols. Vulnerabilities in its parsing or processing logic can lead to denial of service, resource exhaustion, or even remote code execution.
    - **Example:** An attacker sends a malformed HTTP/2 frame that triggers a buffer overflow in Envoy, causing it to crash or potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.
    - **Impact:** High
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly update Envoy to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        - Monitor Envoy's security advisories and apply recommended updates promptly.
        - Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) in front of Envoy to filter out potentially malicious requests.
        - Implement rate limiting to mitigate potential denial-of-service attacks exploiting protocol vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [TLS Configuration and Implementation Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/tls_configuration_and_implementation_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** Misconfigured or vulnerable TLS settings on Envoy can expose communication to eavesdropping or man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - **How Envoy Contributes to Attack Surface:** Envoy is responsible for terminating TLS connections. Weak cipher suites, improper certificate validation, or vulnerabilities in the underlying TLS library (BoringSSL) can be exploited.
    - **Example:** Envoy is configured to allow weak cipher suites like RC4. An attacker performs a BEAST attack to decrypt the communication between the client and Envoy.
    - **Impact:** High
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Enforce the use of strong and modern TLS cipher suites.
        - Ensure proper certificate validation is enabled and configured correctly.
        - Regularly update Envoy to benefit from updates to the underlying TLS library.
        - Consider using tools to scan Envoy's TLS configuration for potential weaknesses.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom Envoy Filters](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_envoy_filters.md)

- **Description:** If custom Envoy filters are developed, they might contain security vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
    - **How Envoy Contributes to Attack Surface:** Envoy's extensibility allows for custom filters. Bugs or security flaws in these custom filters become part of Envoy's attack surface.
    - **Example:** A custom authentication filter has a flaw that allows bypassing authentication checks by manipulating specific request headers.
    - **Impact:** High to Critical (depending on the filter's function)
    - **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the filter's function and exposure)
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Follow secure development practices when creating custom Envoy filters.
        - Conduct thorough security testing and code reviews of custom filters.
        - Implement proper input validation and sanitization within custom filters.
        - Keep custom filter dependencies up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [Control Plane Communication Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/control_plane_communication_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Description:** If Envoy is managed by a control plane, vulnerabilities in the communication between Envoy and the control plane can be exploited.
    - **How Envoy Contributes to Attack Surface:** Envoy relies on the control plane for configuration updates. If this communication is not secured, attackers could intercept or manipulate configuration data.
    - **Example:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack on the communication channel between Envoy and the xDS server, injecting malicious configuration updates that redirect traffic or disable security features.
    - **Impact:** Critical
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Secure the communication channels between Envoy and the control plane using mutual TLS or other strong authentication and encryption mechanisms.
        - Implement integrity checks on configuration updates received from the control plane.
        - Restrict access to the control plane infrastructure.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service_through_resource_exhaustion.md)

- **Description:** Attackers can send a large number of requests or specially crafted requests to exhaust Envoy's resources (CPU, memory, connections).
    - **How Envoy Contributes to Attack Surface:** As a central point for traffic, Envoy is a target for DoS attacks. Vulnerabilities in its connection handling or request processing can be exploited to amplify the impact of such attacks.
    - **Example:** An attacker sends a flood of SYN packets to Envoy, exhausting its connection tracking resources and preventing legitimate connections.
    - **Impact:** High
    - **Risk Severity:** Medium
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Implement rate limiting and connection limits on Envoy listeners.
        - Configure appropriate timeouts for connections and requests.
        - Consider using upstream connection pooling and circuit breaking to protect backend services.
        - Deploy Envoy behind a DDoS mitigation service.
