Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving uWebSockets, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** HTTP Request Smuggling
    *   **Description:** Discrepancies in how uWebSockets parses HTTP requests compared to other web servers or proxies can be exploited to inject additional, unintended requests.
    *   **How uWebSockets Contributes:** uWebSockets' specific implementation of the HTTP parsing logic might have subtle differences or edge cases that an attacker can leverage. This often involves manipulating `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request that is interpreted as two separate requests by the backend server but as a single request by a front-end proxy. This can bypass security checks or access restricted resources.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access to resources, cache poisoning, and potentially executing arbitrary code on backend servers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Attack Surface:** Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** As a C++ library, uWebSockets is susceptible to memory corruption bugs (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) if not implemented and used carefully.
    *   **How uWebSockets Contributes:**  The core of uWebSockets is written in C++. Bugs in this code, especially in handling network data or internal data structures, can lead to memory corruption.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted HTTP request or WebSocket message triggers a buffer overflow in uWebSockets' parsing logic, allowing an attacker to overwrite memory and potentially execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, denial of service, and information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** Attackers can overwhelm the server by exhausting its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) through malicious requests or connections.
    *   **How uWebSockets Contributes:** uWebSockets handles a large number of concurrent connections and message processing. If not configured with appropriate limits, it can be susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks.
    *   **Example:** An attacker opens a large number of WebSocket connections or sends a flood of HTTP requests, consuming server resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure TLS Configuration
    *   **Description:**  If uWebSockets is configured with weak or outdated TLS settings, it can be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks and eavesdropping.
    *   **How uWebSockets Contributes:** uWebSockets handles TLS/SSL termination. The configuration options provided by uWebSockets determine the security of the TLS connection.
    *   **Example:** uWebSockets is configured to allow the use of outdated TLS versions (e.g., TLS 1.0) or weak cipher suites, making it susceptible to known vulnerabilities like POODLE or BEAST.
    *   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS/WSS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
