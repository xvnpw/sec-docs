## Attack Tree Path: [HTTP/HTTPS Server (Poco::Net::HTTPServer) - Request Header/Body Parsing [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/httphttps_server__poconethttpserver__-_request_headerbody_parsing__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request to the Poco-based HTTPServer. This request contains overly long headers or body data that, when parsed by Poco::Net::HTTPServer, causes a buffer overflow in memory.
*   **Poco Specifics:** Exploits vulnerabilities in how Poco::Net::HTTPServer handles incoming HTTP requests, specifically in its parsing logic for headers and body content. This could be due to insufficient bounds checking when copying data into fixed-size buffers during parsing.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. The attacker can gain complete control of the server by injecting and executing malicious code through the buffer overflow.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection (Poco::Data) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__pocodata___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.2.1.1.1. Direct SQL Query Construction - Application directly concatenates user input into SQL queries using Poco::Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application uses Poco::Data to interact with a database. Instead of using parameterized queries or prepared statements, the application directly embeds user-provided input into SQL query strings. An attacker injects malicious SQL code within the user input.
    *   **Poco Specifics:**  While Poco::Data provides mechanisms for secure SQL interaction (parameterized queries), the vulnerability arises from *developer misuse* of the library. If developers construct SQL queries by string concatenation, they bypass Poco's security features and create a SQL injection vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Database compromise. Attackers can read, modify, or delete data in the database, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or disrupting application functionality. In some cases, depending on database privileges and configuration, it can lead to operating system command execution on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection (Poco::Process) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection__pocoprocess___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.2.1.2.1. Unsafe Process Execution - Application uses Poco::Process to execute commands with user-controlled input without proper sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application uses Poco::Process to execute system commands. User-provided input is directly incorporated into the command string without proper sanitization or validation. An attacker injects malicious commands into the user input.
    *   **Poco Specifics:** Poco::Process itself is a utility for process management. The vulnerability is not in Poco::Process but in how the *application* uses it. If the application doesn't sanitize user input before passing it to Poco::Process's `launch` or similar functions, command injection becomes possible.
    *   **Impact:** System compromise. Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server operating system with the privileges of the application process. This can lead to complete server takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal (Poco::File, Poco::FileInputStream, Poco::FileOutputStream) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal__pocofile__pocofileinputstream__pocofileoutputstream___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.2.1.3.1. Unsanitized File Paths - Application uses user-provided paths directly with Poco file system operations, allowing access to arbitrary files [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application uses Poco::File, Poco::FileInputStream, or Poco::FileOutputStream to interact with the file system. User-provided input is used to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. An attacker provides a malicious path (e.g., "../../../etc/passwd") to access files outside the intended application directory.
    *   **Poco Specifics:** Poco's file system components (Poco::File, etc.) provide functionalities to interact with files. The vulnerability is in the *application logic* that uses these components. If the application directly uses user-provided paths without validation, it becomes vulnerable to path traversal.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure and unauthorized file access. Attackers can read sensitive files on the server, potentially including configuration files, source code, or user data. In some cases, they might also be able to write or modify files, leading to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Poco::XML) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__pocoxml___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **1.2.1.4.1. Unsafe XML Parsing Configuration - Application uses Poco::XML parsers with default settings that allow external entity resolution, leading to XXE [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application uses Poco::XML to parse XML documents, potentially from user input or external sources. The Poco::XML parser is configured (or defaults to) allow external entity resolution. An attacker crafts a malicious XML document that includes an external entity definition pointing to a local or remote resource.
    *   **Poco Specifics:** Poco::XML parsers (SAXParser, DOMParser) by default might allow external entity resolution. If the application doesn't explicitly disable this feature using `setFeature(XMLReader::FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true)`, it becomes vulnerable to XXE.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, Denial of Service (DoS), and potentially Remote Code Execution (in less common scenarios). Attackers can read local files on the server, cause the application to make requests to arbitrary external servers (potentially leading to SSRF), or trigger DoS by exploiting entity expansion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Configuration of Poco Components [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/improper_configuration_of_poco_components__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **2.1.1. Insecure Defaults - Application relies on default Poco configurations that are not secure for production environments [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers rely on the default configurations of Poco components without reviewing or hardening them for a production environment. These defaults might be convenient for development but lack security hardening.
    *   **Poco Specifics:**  Poco, like many libraries, might have default configurations that prioritize ease of use over security. For example, default TLS settings in Poco::Net::HTTPServer might use weaker cipher suites or older TLS versions.
    *   **Impact:** Weakened security posture. The application becomes more vulnerable to various attacks due to the use of insecure defaults. This could include weaker encryption, exposed management interfaces, or less restrictive access controls.
*   **2.1.2. Weak Security Settings - Application configures Poco components with weak security settings (e.g., weak TLS configuration in Poco::Net::HTTPServer) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers explicitly configure Poco components with weak security settings due to misunderstanding security best practices, prioritizing compatibility over security, or simply making configuration errors.
    *   **Poco Specifics:** When configuring Poco components like Poco::Net::HTTPServer or Poco::Crypto, developers might choose weaker TLS cipher suites, disable important security features, or use insecure cryptographic algorithms.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised confidentiality and integrity. Weak TLS configurations can make the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on or modify communication. Weak crypto settings can lead to data breaches or authentication bypass.

## Attack Tree Path: [Incorrect API Usage [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/incorrect_api_usage__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **2.2.1. Unsafe API Calls - Application uses Poco APIs in a way that introduces vulnerabilities (e.g., passing unsanitized input to Poco functions) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers use Poco APIs incorrectly, leading to security vulnerabilities. This often involves passing unsanitized user input directly to Poco functions that expect validated data or making API calls in an insecure sequence.
    *   **Poco Specifics:**  Many Poco APIs, especially those dealing with network communication, data parsing, and system interaction, require careful usage. For example, passing unsanitized input to Poco::Net functions could lead to injection vulnerabilities or unexpected behavior. Incorrect usage of threading APIs could lead to race conditions.
    *   **Impact:** Various vulnerabilities depending on the misused API. This could range from injection vulnerabilities and memory corruption to race conditions and denial of service.

*   **2.3.1. Application-Level Injection Flaws - Application fails to validate user input *before* passing it to Poco components, leading to injection vulnerabilities even if Poco itself is not vulnerable [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The application fails to implement proper input validation *before* user-provided data is passed to Poco components. Even if Poco itself is secure, the lack of application-level validation allows attackers to inject malicious data that is then processed by Poco components in an unintended way.
    *   **Poco Specifics:**  Poco is a library, and it relies on the application to use it securely. If the application doesn't validate input before using Poco's functionalities (e.g., before constructing SQL queries with Poco::Data, before using file paths with Poco::File, before parsing XML with Poco::XML), vulnerabilities will arise regardless of Poco's internal security.
    *   **Impact:** Injection vulnerabilities (SQLi, Command Injection, Path Traversal, XXE, etc.).  The impact is similar to the specific injection types described in section 1.2.1, but the root cause is in the application's input handling, not necessarily in Poco itself.
