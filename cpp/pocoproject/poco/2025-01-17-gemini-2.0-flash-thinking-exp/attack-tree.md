## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Buffer Overflow in Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_buffer_overflow_in_data_handling.md)

* **Exploit Buffer Overflow in Data Handling:**
    * Attack Vector: Sending network packets with sizes exceeding the allocated buffer on the receiving end.
    * How: Crafting packets with excessively long data fields when communicating over sockets.
    * Impact: Can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if custom serialization used with Poco::Net)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deserialization__if_custom_serialization_used_with_poconet_.md)

* **Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if custom serialization used with Poco::Net):**
    * Attack Vector: Sending maliciously crafted serialized data to be deserialized by the application.
    * How: If the application uses custom serialization with Poco sockets, attackers can inject malicious objects that, upon deserialization, execute arbitrary code.
    * Impact: Can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit known vulnerabilities in used TLS/SSL versions.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_used_tlsssl_versions.md)

* **Exploit known vulnerabilities in used TLS/SSL versions:**
            * Attack Vector: Exploiting known security flaws in outdated versions of TLS/SSL protocols.
            * How: Forcing the server to negotiate a vulnerable TLS/SSL version and then exploiting its weaknesses (e.g., BEAST, POODLE).
            * Impact: Can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks, allowing attackers to intercept and decrypt sensitive communication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

* **Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:**
            * Attack Vector: Injecting malicious XML entities that reference external resources (local files or internal network resources).
            * How: Providing crafted XML input to the application that includes external entity declarations pointing to sensitive files or internal services.
            * Impact: Can lead to disclosure of local files, Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and potentially Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if custom object mapping used with Poco::JSON)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deserialization__if_custom_object_mapping_used_with_pocojson_.md)

* **Exploit Insecure Deserialization (if custom object mapping used with Poco::JSON):**
            * Attack Vector: Sending malicious JSON data that, when deserialized into objects, leads to unintended actions.
            * How: If the application uses custom object mapping with Poco's JSON classes, attackers can craft JSON payloads that, upon deserialization, instantiate malicious objects or manipulate application state.
            * Impact: Can lead to arbitrary code execution or data manipulation.

        * Attack Vector: Manipulating file paths provided by users to access files or directories outside of the intended scope.
        * How: Providing input containing ".." sequences or absolute paths to access sensitive files or directories that the application should not have access to.
        * Impact: Can lead to the disclosure of sensitive files or the modification of critical application data.

            * Attack Vector: The application is configured to use outdated or insecure cryptographic algorithms.
            * How: Identifying the algorithms used by the application and exploiting known weaknesses in those algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1, RC4).
            * Impact: Can lead to the compromise of encrypted data, authentication bypass, and other security breaches.

            * How: Finding cryptographic keys stored in easily accessible locations (e.g., configuration files, source code) or exploiting weak key derivation functions.
            * Impact: Can lead to the complete compromise of encrypted data and the ability to impersonate users.

* **Exploit Command Injection via Process Execution:**
            * Attack Vector: Injecting malicious commands into the arguments passed to `Poco::Process::launch()`.
            * How: If the application uses user-provided input to construct commands that are then executed using `Poco::Process::launch()`, an attacker can inject arbitrary commands.
            * Impact: Can lead to arbitrary command execution on the server.
