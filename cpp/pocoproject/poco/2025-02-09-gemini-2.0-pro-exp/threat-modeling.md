# Threat Model Analysis for pocoproject/poco

## Threat: [Configuration File Manipulation](./threats/configuration_file_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the application's configuration files (XML, INI, properties) loaded by POCO. They could change database connection strings, redirect network traffic to a malicious server, disable security features, or alter logging settings to hide their activities. The attacker might achieve this through a separate vulnerability (e.g., directory traversal, insufficient file permissions) or by exploiting a compromised system account.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete application compromise.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Loss of audit trail.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **POCO Component Affected:** `Poco::Util::Application`, `Poco::Util::ServerApplication`, `Poco::Util::AbstractConfiguration` and its implementations (e.g., `Poco::Util::XMLConfiguration`, `Poco::Util::PropertyFileConfiguration`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Permissions:** Ensure configuration files have the most restrictive permissions possible. Only the application's user (and *not* the web server user) should have read access.
    *   **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign configuration files and verify the signature before loading using `Poco::Crypto`.
    *   **Configuration Management:** Use a dedicated, secure configuration management system with access controls and auditing.
    *   **Input Validation:** If configuration values are ever derived from external input (highly discouraged), rigorously validate them.
    *   **Avoid User-Supplied Paths:** Never load configuration files from paths provided by untrusted users.

## Threat: [Cryptographic Misuse](./threats/cryptographic_misuse.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses `Poco::Crypto` incorrectly.  This could involve using weak cryptographic algorithms, generating predictable keys or initialization vectors (IVs), using inappropriate cipher modes, or failing to handle cryptographic exceptions properly.  An attacker could exploit these weaknesses to decrypt sensitive data, forge digital signatures, or bypass authentication mechanisms.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches (confidentiality violation).
    *   Data tampering (integrity violation).
    *   Authentication bypass.
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **POCO Component Affected:** `Poco::Crypto` (various classes and functions, including `Cipher`, `CipherKey`, `RSAKey`, `X509Certificate`, `DigestEngine`, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Cryptographic Best Practices:**  Adhere strictly to established cryptographic best practices.  Consult NIST guidelines and other reputable sources.
    *   **Strong Algorithms:** Use strong, modern cryptographic algorithms (e.g., AES-256, RSA with at least 2048-bit keys).
    *   **Secure Key Management:**  Generate keys securely using a cryptographically secure random number generator (`Poco::Crypto::Random`). Store keys securely and protect them from unauthorized access.
    *   **Proper IV Handling:**  Use unique and unpredictable IVs for each encryption operation.  Never reuse IVs with the same key.
    *   **Correct Cipher Modes:**  Choose appropriate cipher modes (e.g., GCM, CTR) and padding schemes based on the security requirements.
    *   **Regular Review:**  Regularly review and update cryptographic implementations to address new vulnerabilities and evolving best practices.
    *   **Higher-Level Libraries:** Consider using higher-level cryptographic libraries built on top of POCO if complex cryptographic operations are required.

## Threat: [Path Traversal](./threats/path_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides input that, when used to construct file paths with `Poco::File` or `Poco::Path`, allows them to access files outside the intended directory.  They might use ".." sequences or other path manipulation techniques to read sensitive files (e.g., configuration files, source code) or write to arbitrary locations on the file system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure (reading sensitive files).
    *   Code execution (if the attacker can write to executable locations).
    *   System compromise.
*   **POCO Component Affected:** `Poco::File`, `Poco::Path`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid User-Supplied Paths:**  Minimize the use of user-supplied input when constructing file paths.
    *   **Path Normalization:**  Use `Poco::Path::normalize()` to resolve relative paths and remove redundant components.
    *   **Path Validation:**  After normalization, explicitly check that the resulting path is within the allowed directory (a "sandbox").  Reject any paths that attempt to escape the sandbox.
    *   **Strict File Permissions:**  Implement strict file system permissions to limit the impact of a successful path traversal attack.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Paths:** If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed file paths and reject any requests that don't match.

## Threat: [Unbounded JSON Parsing (DoS)](./threats/unbounded_json_parsing__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large or deeply nested JSON document to the application.  `Poco::JSON` attempts to parse the entire document in memory, leading to excessive memory consumption and potentially a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of service (application becomes unresponsive).
    *   System instability.
*   **POCO Component Affected:** `Poco::JSON::Parser`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Size Limits:**  Enforce strict limits on the maximum size of JSON documents that the application will accept.
    *   **Parsing Timeouts:**  Implement timeouts for JSON parsing operations.  Terminate parsing if it takes too long.
    *   **Streaming Parser:**  If feasible, consider using a streaming JSON parser (not directly part of POCO's core JSON library, but potentially a third-party library) to process large documents incrementally without loading the entire document into memory.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor memory and CPU usage to detect and respond to potential DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Uncontrolled Thread Creation (DoS)](./threats/uncontrolled_thread_creation__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** The application creates new threads using `Poco::Thread` without any limits, potentially in response to incoming requests. An attacker can flood the application with requests, causing it to create a large number of threads, exhausting system resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors) and leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of service.
    *   System instability.
*   **POCO Component Affected:** `Poco::Thread`, `Poco::Runnable`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thread Pool:** Use `Poco::ThreadPool` to manage a fixed-size pool of threads.  This limits the number of concurrent threads and prevents resource exhaustion.
    *   **Request Queuing:**  Queue incoming requests and process them using the thread pool.
    *   **Timeouts:**  Implement timeouts for thread operations to prevent long-running threads from blocking resources.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:**  Monitor thread count and resource usage.

## Threat: [Plugin Loading Vulnerability (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/plugin_loading_vulnerability__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

* **Description:** The application uses `Poco::ClassLoader` to load plugins dynamically. If the application loads plugins from untrusted sources (e.g., a directory writable by a less privileged user, a network share) or fails to verify the integrity of the plugins, an attacker could provide a malicious plugin that executes arbitrary code with the application's privileges.
* **Impact:**
    *   Complete system compromise.
    *   Code execution with elevated privileges.
    *   Data breaches.
* **POCO Component Affected:** `Poco::ClassLoader`, `Poco::SharedLibrary`.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Sources:** Only load plugins from trusted, read-only locations.
    *   **Digital Signatures:** Digitally sign plugins and verify the signature before loading using `Poco::Crypto`.
    *   **Sandboxing:** If possible, run plugins in a sandboxed environment with restricted privileges.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the code of any plugins before deploying them.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the application itself runs with the least privilege necessary, limiting the potential damage from a compromised plugin.

## Threat: [Network Connection Spoofing (with custom networking logic)](./threats/network_connection_spoofing__with_custom_networking_logic_.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses custom logic built on top of `Poco::Net` for creating or managing network connections (e.g., custom socket factories, connection strategies). Errors in this custom logic could allow an attacker to intercept or redirect network traffic, potentially leading to man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Data tampering.
    *   Authentication bypass.
*   **POCO Component Affected:** `Poco::Net` (lower-level components like `Socket`, `SocketAddress`, custom implementations of `SocketImpl`, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prefer Built-in Classes:** Whenever possible, use the built-in, well-tested POCO networking classes (e.g., `HTTPClientSession`, `HTTPSClientSession`) instead of implementing custom networking logic.
    *   **Thorough Code Review:** If custom networking logic is unavoidable, conduct rigorous code reviews and security testing.
    *   **Secure Protocols:** Always use secure protocols (HTTPS) and validate server certificates properly.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate all input used in network operations (e.g., hostnames, ports).
