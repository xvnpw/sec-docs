# Threat Model Analysis for pocoproject/poco

## Threat: [SSL/TLS Certificate Validation Bypass](./threats/ssltls_certificate_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker performs a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack by presenting a fraudulent SSL/TLS certificate. If the application doesn't properly validate the server certificate using Poco's networking components, the attacker can intercept and potentially modify communication.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (eavesdropping on encrypted communication), data tampering (modifying data in transit).
*   **Affected Poco Component:** `Poco::Net::Context`, `Poco::Net::SecureServerSocket`, `Poco::Net::HTTPSClientSession`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Ensure proper configuration of `Poco::Net::Context` with options like `VERIFY_PEER` and a valid CA certificate store. Consider implementing certificate pinning for critical connections.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Network Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_through_network_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the application with a large number of network requests, exploiting potential inefficiencies or lack of resource limits in Poco's networking components. This can overwhelm the application, making it unresponsive to legitimate users.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application becomes unavailable).
*   **Affected Poco Component:** `Poco::Net::ServerSocket`, `Poco::Net::TCPServer`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting and connection throttling. Configure appropriate timeouts and resource limits for network operations. Consider using load balancing.

## Threat: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./threats/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious XML document to the application, which is parsed using Poco's XML parser. This XML document contains external entity declarations that, if not properly disabled, can allow the attacker to read local files on the server, access internal network resources, or cause denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading server files), potential access to internal network, Denial of Service.
*   **Affected Poco Component:** `Poco::XML::SAXParser`, `Poco::XML::DOMParser`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Disable external entity processing in the XML parser configuration. Sanitize and validate XML input.

## Threat: [Billion Laughs Attack (XML Bomb)](./threats/billion_laughs_attack__xml_bomb_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted XML document with deeply nested entities that, when parsed by Poco's XML parser, consume excessive memory and CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (application becomes unresponsive).
*   **Affected Poco Component:** `Poco::XML::SAXParser`, `Poco::XML::DOMParser`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement limits on the depth and size of XML documents being parsed. Consider using a streaming XML parser if appropriate.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Poco Data](./threats/sql_injection_via_poco_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides malicious input that is used to construct SQL queries through Poco's Data library without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (unauthorized access to sensitive data), data manipulation (modifying or deleting data), potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Poco Component:** `Poco::Data::Session`, `Poco::Data::Statement`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases through Poco Data. Implement strict input validation and sanitization.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of Database Connection Strings in Poco Data](./threats/improper_handling_of_database_connection_strings_in_poco_data.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive database credentials stored insecurely in connection strings used by Poco Data. This could happen if connection strings are hardcoded, stored in easily accessible configuration files without encryption, or exposed through other means.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.
*   **Affected Poco Component:** `Poco::Data::SessionPool`, connection string handling within `Session`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Store database connection strings securely, preferably using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions. Avoid hardcoding credentials. Encrypt sensitive information in configuration files.

## Threat: [Use of Weak or Deprecated Cryptographic Algorithms in Poco Crypto](./threats/use_of_weak_or_deprecated_cryptographic_algorithms_in_poco_crypto.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits weaknesses in outdated or insecure cryptographic algorithms used by the application through Poco's Crypto library. This can compromise the confidentiality or integrity of encrypted data.
*   **Impact:** Data breach (decryption of sensitive data), tampering (forging signatures or manipulating encrypted data).
*   **Affected Poco Component:** `Poco::Crypto::Cipher`, `Poco::Crypto::DigestEngine`, `Poco::Crypto::RSAKey`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Use strong and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and libraries. Follow industry best practices for cryptographic key management.

## Threat: [Insecure Key Management with Poco Crypto](./threats/insecure_key_management_with_poco_crypto.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to cryptographic keys used by Poco's Crypto library due to insecure storage or handling. This could allow them to decrypt data, forge signatures, or impersonate entities.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of encryption, ability to forge signatures, loss of trust and integrity.
*   **Affected Poco Component:** `Poco::Crypto::Key`, key generation and storage mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Store cryptographic keys securely, preferably using hardware security modules (HSMs) or secure key management systems. Implement proper key rotation policies.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File System Operations using Poco File](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_file_system_operations_using_poco_file.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a manipulated file path to the application, which uses Poco's `File` class to access files. By using special characters like "..", the attacker can potentially access files outside of the intended directories, leading to information disclosure or unauthorized modification.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading sensitive files), potential for unauthorized file modification or deletion.
*   **Affected Poco Component:** `Poco::File`, file manipulation functions (e.g., `open`, `createDirectories`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of file paths received from users or external sources. Use absolute paths or canonicalize paths to prevent traversal. Operate with the least privileges necessary for file system access.

## Threat: [Storing Sensitive Information in Configuration Files Managed by Poco Util](./threats/storing_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files_managed_by_poco_util.md)

*   **Description:** The application stores sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, or other secrets directly in configuration files managed by `Poco::Util::PropertyFileConfiguration`. If these files are not properly secured, an attacker could gain access to this sensitive information.
*   **Impact:** Credential compromise, unauthorized access to resources.
*   **Affected Poco Component:** `Poco::Util::PropertyFileConfiguration`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files. Use environment variables, dedicated secrets management solutions, or encrypted configuration files.
