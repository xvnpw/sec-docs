# Attack Surface Analysis for pocoproject/poco

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious external entities into XML documents processed by the application, potentially leading to disclosure of local files, internal network access, or denial of service.
*   **How Poco Contributes:** Poco's XML parser (e.g., `Poco::XML::SAXParser`, `Poco::XML::DOMParser`) might be configured by default to resolve external entities, making the application vulnerable if it processes untrusted XML data.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends an XML payload like:
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
    <data>&xxe;</data>
    ```
    If the application parses this with default Poco settings, it might attempt to read and process `/etc/passwd`.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (reading sensitive files), potential for remote code execution (in certain scenarios), denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable External Entity Resolution: Configure Poco's XML parsers to disallow or ignore external entities. For example, using `parser.setFeature(XMLReader::FEATURE_EXTERNAL_GENERAL_ENTITIES, false)` and `parser.setFeature(XMLReader::FEATURE_EXTERNAL_PARAMETER_ENTITIES, false)`.
    *   Input Sanitization:  If possible, sanitize or validate XML input to remove potentially malicious entity declarations.
    *   Use a Secure Parser Configuration: Ensure the XML parser is initialized with secure defaults.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow in Socket Handling](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflow_in_socket_handling.md)

*   **Description:**  Insufficient bounds checking when receiving data over network sockets can lead to writing data beyond the allocated buffer, potentially causing crashes or allowing arbitrary code execution.
*   **How Poco Contributes:** If the application uses Poco's socket classes (e.g., `Poco::Net::StreamSocket`, `Poco::Net::ServerSocket`) to read data into fixed-size buffers without proper size validation, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An application using `socket.receiveBytes(buffer, bufferSize)` where `bufferSize` is smaller than the data sent by the attacker, leading to data overwriting adjacent memory.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash), potential for remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Dynamic Buffers: Employ dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `std::vector`) or Poco's `MemoryStream` to handle incoming data of unknown size.
    *   Validate Received Data Size: Always check the return value of `receiveBytes` and ensure it doesn't exceed the buffer's capacity before processing.
    *   Use Safe Read Operations: Consider using higher-level abstractions or libraries that provide built-in bounds checking.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Request Smuggling](./attack_surfaces/http_request_smuggling.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting discrepancies in how different HTTP intermediaries (e.g., proxies, load balancers) and the application server interpret HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to "smuggle" malicious requests.
*   **How Poco Contributes:** If the application uses Poco's HTTP server or client components (`Poco::Net::HTTPServer`, `Poco::Net::HTTPClientSession`) and doesn't strictly adhere to HTTP specifications regarding content length and transfer encoding, it might be susceptible.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a request with ambiguous `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding` headers. An intermediary might forward part of the malicious request as a separate, unexpected request to the backend server.
*   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, gaining unauthorized access, cache poisoning.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strict HTTP Compliance: Ensure the application strictly adheres to HTTP specifications, especially regarding `Content-Length` and `Transfer-Encoding`.
    *   Normalize Requests: If acting as an intermediary, normalize incoming requests before forwarding them.
    *   Disable Keep-Alive (Carefully): While potentially impacting performance, disabling keep-alive connections can mitigate some smuggling techniques.
    *   Use Consistent Infrastructure: Ensure all HTTP intermediaries in the path interpret requests consistently.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via File System Access](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_file_system_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate file paths provided as input to access files or directories outside the intended scope.
*   **How Poco Contributes:** If the application uses Poco's file system classes (e.g., `Poco::File`, `Poco::Path`) to access files based on user-provided input without proper sanitization, it can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An application uses user input to construct a file path like `Poco::File(basePath + userInput)`. If `userInput` is `../../sensitive_data.txt`, the application might access a file outside the intended `basePath`.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (accessing sensitive files), potential for data modification or deletion.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization:  Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided file paths. Reject paths containing ".." or absolute paths.
    *   Canonicalization: Convert paths to their canonical form to resolve symbolic links and relative paths.
    *   Restrict Access:  Operate the application with the least privileges necessary.
    *   Chroot Jails (where applicable): Restrict the application's view of the file system.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Cryptographic Operations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_cryptographic_operations.md)

*   **Description:**  Using weak or outdated cryptographic algorithms, improper key management, or incorrect implementation of cryptographic functions can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of data.
*   **How Poco Contributes:** If the application relies on Poco's cryptography classes (e.g., `Poco::Crypto::Cipher`, `Poco::Crypto::DigestEngine`) and uses insecure configurations or practices, it becomes vulnerable.
*   **Example:** Using a deprecated hashing algorithm like MD5, storing encryption keys directly in the code, or failing to properly initialize cryptographic contexts.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, loss of data integrity, authentication bypass.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use Strong and Modern Algorithms: Employ recommended and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Secure Key Management: Store and manage cryptographic keys securely (e.g., using dedicated key management systems or secure enclaves).
    *   Follow Best Practices: Adhere to established cryptographic best practices and avoid implementing custom cryptographic solutions unless absolutely necessary.
    *   Regularly Update Libraries: Keep Poco and any underlying cryptographic libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
