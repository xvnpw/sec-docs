## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Poco CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_poco_critical_node.md)

*   This is the root goal. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved significant control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Communication Vulnerabilities (Poco::Net) CRITICAL NODE](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_communication_vulnerabilities__poconet__critical_node.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in how the application handles network requests and responses using Poco's networking components.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to remote code execution, data interception, denial of service, and unauthorized access.
*   **Focus Areas for Mitigation:** Secure HTTP/HTTPS parsing, robust TLS/SSL configuration, protection against socket flooding, and careful handling of WebSocket communications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit HTTP/HTTPS Parsing Vulnerabilities HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_httphttps_parsing_vulnerabilities_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending specially crafted HTTP/HTTPS requests that exploit flaws in Poco's parsing logic.
*   **Impact:** Can result in buffer overflows leading to code execution or application crashes.
*   **Focus Areas for Mitigation:** Input validation, using the latest stable version of Poco with security patches, and potentially using a dedicated HTTP parsing library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Buffer Overflow in Request Header Parsing HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_buffer_overflow_in_request_header_parsing_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Sending HTTP requests with excessively long headers, overflowing buffers in the parsing process.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, application crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in TLS/SSL Implementation (Poco::Net::SecureStreamSocket) HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_tlsssl_implementation__poconetsecurestreamsocket__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Leveraging weaknesses in the TLS/SSL implementation within Poco to compromise secure communication.
*   **Impact:** Data interception (man-in-the-middle attacks), session hijacking, and potentially decryption of sensitive information.
*   **Focus Areas for Mitigation:** Using strong TLS configurations, up-to-date TLS libraries, proper certificate validation, and mitigating known TLS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known TLS Vulnerabilities (e.g., BEAST, CRIME, POODLE - if using older versions) HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_tls_vulnerabilities__e_g___beast__crime__poodle_-_if_using_older_versions__high_risk_p_0d826206.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Initiating connections with vulnerable TLS parameters to exploit known weaknesses in older TLS protocols or implementations.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, session hijacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XML Processing Vulnerabilities (Poco::XML) CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xml_processing_vulnerabilities__pocoxml__critical_node__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting flaws in how the application parses and processes XML data using Poco's XML library.
*   **Impact:** Can lead to information disclosure (XXE), server-side request forgery (SSRF), and denial of service.
*   **Focus Areas for Mitigation:** Disabling external entity resolution, sanitizing XML input, and protecting against XPath injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit XML External Entity (XXE) Injection HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_xml_external_entity__xxe__injection_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious XML that references external entities, allowing the attacker to access local files or internal network resources.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure (reading local files), server-side request forgery (SSRF).

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Local Files HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/read_local_files_high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using XXE to force the application to read and return the contents of local files on the server.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, configuration files, or even source code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/perform_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Using XXE to make the server initiate requests to internal or external resources controlled by the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal services, port scanning, or launching attacks against other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit JSON Processing Vulnerabilities (Poco::JSON)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_json_processing_vulnerabilities__pocojson_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses in how the application processes JSON data using Poco's JSON library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if custom object mapping is used) HIGH RISK PATH](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_custom_object_mapping_is_used__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JSON payloads that, when deserialized into objects, can lead to arbitrary code execution. This is particularly relevant if the application uses custom object mapping without proper safeguards.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution.
