# Threat Model Analysis for mariadb/server

## Threat: [Default MariaDB Credentials](./threats/default_mariadb_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Default MariaDB Credentials
*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to log in using default usernames (e.g., `root`) and known default or empty passwords that are often present in fresh MariaDB installations if not changed.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the MariaDB server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, Default User Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately change default passwords for all default MariaDB users during initial setup.
    *   Remove or disable default users that are not required.
    *   Run the `mysql_secure_installation` script after installation to secure default settings.

    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block exploitation attempts.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known CVEs in MariaDB Server](./threats/exploiting_known_cves_in_mariadb_server.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Known CVEs in MariaDB Server
*   **Description:** Attackers scan for and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the deployed version of MariaDB server. Exploit code is often publicly available, making exploitation easier.
*   **Impact:** Range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including unauthorized access, data breaches, denial of service, remote code execution, full server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Varies depending on the CVE, can affect any module or function.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on CVE)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain an up-to-date MariaDB server by promptly applying security patches and updates.
    *   Regularly scan for known vulnerabilities using vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor CVE databases for MariaDB vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems to detect and block exploitation attempts.

## Threat: [Exposing MariaDB Directly to the Internet](./threats/exposing_mariadb_directly_to_the_internet.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposing MariaDB Directly to the Internet
*   **Description:** Making the MariaDB server directly accessible from the public internet without proper network security controls. This significantly increases the attack surface and exposes the server to a wide range of internet-based threats.
*   **Impact:** Increased risk of attacks from the internet, including brute-force attacks, vulnerability exploitation, denial of service, data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:** Network Interface, Network Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Never expose MariaDB directly to the public internet.
    *   Place MariaDB server behind a firewall and restrict access to only authorized networks and IP addresses.
    *   Use a VPN or bastion host for remote administration if necessary.
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate the database server.

## Threat: [Weak MariaDB User Passwords](./threats/weak_mariadb_user_passwords.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak MariaDB User Passwords
*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to brute-force or guess weak passwords for MariaDB user accounts (e.g., `root`, application users). Upon successful password cracking, they gain unauthorized access to the database server.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, full server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, User Account Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation).
    *   Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts.
    *   Regularly audit and rotate passwords.
    *   Consider multi-factor authentication for privileged accounts (if supported by plugins or external authentication mechanisms).

## Threat: [Insufficiently Granular User Permissions](./threats/insufficiently_granular_user_permissions.md)

*   **Threat:** Insufficiently Granular User Permissions
*   **Description:** Attackers exploit compromised application code or insider threats with over-privileged MariaDB accounts. These accounts have excessive permissions (e.g., `GRANT ALL`), allowing attackers to perform actions beyond their intended scope.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, privilege escalation, wider system compromise due to excessive access rights.
*   **Affected Component:** Access Control Module, Privilege Management System
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege. Grant only necessary permissions to each user.
    *   Utilize roles to manage permissions efficiently and consistently.
    *   Regularly review and audit user permissions.
    *   Separate application users from administrative users with distinct permission sets.

## Threat: [Data at Rest Encryption Not Enabled](./threats/data_at_rest_encryption_not_enabled.md)

*   **Threat:** Data at Rest Encryption Not Enabled or Improperly Configured
*   **Description:** Sensitive data stored in MariaDB is not encrypted at rest. If storage media (disks, backups) is compromised (e.g., stolen server, backup tapes), attackers can directly access and read the unencrypted data.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data if database files are accessed by unauthorized parties.
*   **Affected Component:** Storage Engine (InnoDB, MyISAM), Data File System
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable MariaDB's data-at-rest encryption features (e.g., InnoDB encryption).
    *   Properly manage encryption keys and ensure their secure storage and rotation.
    *   Regularly verify encryption configuration and status.
    *   Encrypt database backups.

## Threat: [Data in Transit Encryption (TLS/SSL) Not Enforced](./threats/data_in_transit_encryption__tlsssl__not_enforced.md)

*   **Threat:** Data in Transit Encryption (TLS/SSL) Not Enforced or Weak Ciphers Used
*   **Description:** Communication between the application and MariaDB server is not encrypted using TLS/SSL, or weak cipher suites are used. Attackers can eavesdrop on network traffic to intercept sensitive data transmitted between the application and the database. Man-in-the-middle attacks become possible.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data during transmission, man-in-the-middle attacks, data interception.
*   **Affected Component:** Network Communication Module, TLS/SSL Implementation
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for all client connections to MariaDB.
    *   Configure MariaDB to use strong cipher suites and disable weak or outdated ones.
    *   Regularly review and update TLS/SSL configurations.
    *   Ensure client applications are configured to use TLS/SSL when connecting to MariaDB.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Against MariaDB Server](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__attacks_against_mariadb_server.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Against MariaDB Server
*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities or misconfigurations to overload the MariaDB server with requests, consume resources (CPU, memory, network), or trigger server crashes. This renders the database and dependent applications unavailable.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, loss of service availability, potential data integrity issues if transactions are interrupted, financial losses due to service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** Network Communication Module, Query Processing Engine, Resource Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting and connection limits in MariaDB configuration.
    *   Harden MariaDB server against known DoS vulnerabilities (patching).
    *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or network firewall to filter malicious traffic.
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for server resource utilization and performance.
    *   Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and load balancers to distribute traffic.
