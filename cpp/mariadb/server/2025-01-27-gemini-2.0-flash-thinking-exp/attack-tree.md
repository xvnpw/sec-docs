## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit MariaDB Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mariadb_server_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** This path encompasses exploiting various types of vulnerabilities within the MariaDB server software itself. This includes:
    *   **Known CVEs:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with existing exploits.
    *   **Memory Corruption:** Exploiting buffer overflows or other memory safety issues to gain control or cause denial of service.
    *   **Logical Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting flaws in the design or implementation logic of MariaDB features.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities, requiring advanced attacker capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known MariaDB Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_mariadb_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Focusing specifically on leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in MariaDB. This is a high-risk path because exploits are often readily available, and outdated or unpatched servers are vulnerable.
    *   **SQL Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in application code or database configurations that allow attackers to inject malicious SQL queries.
    *   **Memory Corruption CVEs:** Exploiting known memory corruption vulnerabilities in specific MariaDB versions.
    *   **Authentication Bypass CVEs:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities that allow bypassing authentication mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Targeting SQL injection flaws, a prevalent web application vulnerability that can directly impact the MariaDB server.
    *   **Application Input Fields:** Injecting malicious SQL through web forms, API parameters, or other user-controlled inputs.
    *   **Stored Procedures/Functions:** Injecting malicious SQL through vulnerable custom stored procedures or functions.
    *   **Via Application Interface:** Exploiting SQL injection through the normal application interaction points.
    *   **Via Direct Database Connection (if exposed):** Exploiting SQL injection by directly connecting to the database if network access is misconfigured.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit MariaDB Server Misconfigurations](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mariadb_server_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting weaknesses arising from improper configuration of the MariaDB server.
    *   **Weak Authentication:** Exploiting weak passwords, default credentials, or lack of multi-factor authentication.
    *   **Insecure Network Configuration:** Exploiting exposed database ports or lack of firewall protection.
    *   **Insufficient Access Controls:** Exploiting over-privileged database accounts or lack of proper permission management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_authentication.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Focusing on vulnerabilities related to weak or bypassed authentication mechanisms.
    *   **Default Credentials:** Using default usernames and passwords that are often left unchanged.
    *   **Brute-Force/Dictionary Attacks:** Attempting to guess passwords through automated attacks.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Using compromised credentials from other breaches.
    *   **Authentication Bypass Vulnerabilities (CVEs):** Exploiting known vulnerabilities that allow bypassing authentication.
    *   **Misconfigured Authentication Plugins:** Exploiting misconfigurations in authentication plugins that weaken security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Network Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_network_configuration.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting vulnerabilities due to improper network setup and exposure of the MariaDB server.
    *   **Exposed MariaDB Ports:** Directly accessing the database port (typically 3306) from untrusted networks.
    *   **Bypass Firewall Rules:** Circumventing firewall protections to gain direct access.
    *   **Connect from Trusted Network (if compromised):** Leveraging a compromised system within a "trusted" network to access the database.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Exposed MariaDB Service:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the MariaDB service itself when directly exposed to the network.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:** Launching DoS attacks against the exposed database service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Lack of Security Updates/Patching](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_security_updatespatching.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Exploiting vulnerabilities present in outdated and unpatched MariaDB server versions.
    *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated Version:** Leveraging publicly known exploits for vulnerabilities present in the specific outdated MariaDB version being used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated Version](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_outdated_version.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** Directly utilizing known exploits against an identified outdated MariaDB server.
    *   **Utilize Publicly Available Exploits:** Using readily available exploit code to compromise the vulnerable server.
