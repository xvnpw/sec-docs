# Threat Model Analysis for mariadb/server

## Threat: [Weak or Default Root Password](./threats/weak_or_default_root_password.md)

**Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the MariaDB server using the default root password or a weak, easily guessable password. This could be done through direct connection if the port is exposed or through other vulnerabilities allowing command execution on the server.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the database server, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete any data, create new users, and potentially gain control of the underlying operating system.

**Affected Component:** `sql/auth/account.cc` (Authentication System)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Immediately change the default root password to a strong, unique password during initial setup.
*   Enforce strong password policies for all MariaDB users.
*   Regularly rotate administrative passwords.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in MariaDB Server](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_mariadb_server.md)

**Description:** An attacker could leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of MariaDB server being used. This could involve sending specially crafted network packets or exploiting flaws in specific SQL commands or features.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, or privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** Varies depending on the specific CVE, could affect various modules like `sql/`, `vio/`, `pcre/`, etc.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the MariaDB server updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
*   Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor for new vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a vulnerability management process to regularly scan and patch the server.

## Threat: [SQL Injection via Stored Procedures or Functions](./threats/sql_injection_via_stored_procedures_or_functions.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in custom stored procedures or functions within MariaDB. This involves injecting malicious SQL code through parameters or input that is not properly sanitized within the stored procedure/function logic.

**Impact:**  Allows the attacker to bypass application-level security and directly execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or privilege escalation within the database.

**Affected Component:** `sql/stored_routines.cc` (Stored Procedure Execution), potentially custom stored procedures/functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input parameters within stored procedures and functions.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements within stored procedures to prevent SQL injection.
*   Regularly review and audit custom stored procedures and functions for security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation through `GRANT` Command Abuse](./threats/privilege_escalation_through__grant__command_abuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker with sufficient privileges (but not necessarily administrative) could potentially escalate their privileges by abusing the `GRANT` command if not properly restricted or if vulnerabilities exist in the privilege management system.

**Impact:** The attacker could gain higher-level access to the database, allowing them to perform actions they are not authorized for, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `sql/sql_acl.cc` (Access Control and Privilege Management)

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the initial privileges and the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to database users.
*   Carefully review and restrict the ability to grant privileges, especially for non-administrative users.
*   Monitor `GRANT` command usage for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Exploiting Weaknesses in Authentication Plugins](./threats/exploiting_weaknesses_in_authentication_plugins.md)

**Description:** If using custom or third-party authentication plugins for MariaDB, vulnerabilities within these plugins could be exploited to bypass authentication or gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the database, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `plugin/` (Authentication Plugin Interface), specific authentication plugin in use.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the vulnerability in the plugin)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet and audit any third-party authentication plugins before using them.
*   Keep authentication plugins updated to the latest versions with security patches.
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms even with plugins.
