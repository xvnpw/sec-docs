### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit SQL Injection for Privilege Escalation

**ATTACK TREE PATH:**

Exploit SQL Injection for Privilege Escalation

* **[CRITICAL NODE]** Gain Unauthorized Access to MariaDB **[HIGH-RISK PATH START]**
    * **[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Authorization Weaknesses
        * Privilege Escalation
            * **[HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]** Exploit SQL Injection to Grant Higher Privileges **[HIGH-RISK PATH NODE]**

**Detailed Analysis of the Target Node: [HIGH-RISK PATH NODE] Exploit SQL Injection to Grant Higher Privileges**

This node represents a critical stage in the attack where an attacker, having already gained some level of unauthorized access through SQL injection, attempts to elevate their privileges within the MariaDB database. This is a significant escalation as it allows the attacker to perform actions beyond their initial access level, potentially leading to complete database compromise.

**Technical Details:**

* **Mechanism:** The attacker leverages SQL injection vulnerabilities in the application's code to inject malicious SQL commands that manipulate MariaDB's privilege system.
* **Target SQL Commands:** The primary SQL commands targeted in this attack are those related to user and privilege management, specifically:
    * **`GRANT` statement:** This command is used to grant specific privileges to users or roles. An attacker could inject a `GRANT` statement to assign themselves powerful roles like `SUPER`, `REPLICATION SLAVE`, `REPLICATION CLIENT`, or specific privileges on sensitive tables or databases.
    * **`CREATE USER` statement:**  In some scenarios, an attacker might attempt to create a new user with elevated privileges if the application logic allows for such injection points.
    * **`UPDATE` statement on `mysql.user` table (less common but possible with sufficient initial privileges):**  While generally restricted, if the attacker has sufficient initial privileges (e.g., `UPDATE` on the `mysql` database), they could directly modify the `mysql.user` table to change their own or other users' privileges. This is highly unlikely in a well-secured environment.
* **Example Attack Scenarios:**
    * **Scenario 1: Injecting `GRANT` statement:** An application might have a vulnerable search functionality that doesn't properly sanitize user input. An attacker could inject the following payload:
        ```sql
        ' OR 1=1; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'attacker'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'P@$$wOrd'; --
        ```
        If successfully executed, this would grant all privileges on all databases and tables to a new user 'attacker' from any host.
    * **Scenario 2: Injecting `GRANT` statement to an existing user:**  If the attacker has identified an existing user with limited privileges, they might inject a command to grant that user additional privileges:
        ```sql
        ' OR 1=1; GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON sensitive_data.* TO 'vulnerable_user'@'localhost'; --
        ```
* **Prerequisites:**
    * **Existing SQL Injection Vulnerability:** The application must have a SQL injection vulnerability that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands.
    * **Database User with Sufficient Initial Privileges (Indirectly):** While the attacker might not initially have high privileges, the *application's database user* used to connect to MariaDB must have sufficient privileges to execute the injected `GRANT` or `CREATE USER` statements. This is a critical point â€“ if the application uses a least-privilege principle for its database user, this attack becomes significantly harder.
    * **Knowledge of Database Structure (Helpful):** While not strictly necessary for basic privilege escalation, knowledge of database names, table names, and existing users can help the attacker craft more targeted and effective injection payloads.

**Impact of Successful Attack:**

* **Full Database Compromise:** Granting `ALL PRIVILEGES` effectively gives the attacker complete control over the MariaDB instance. They can read, modify, and delete any data, create or drop databases, and even potentially disrupt the database service.
* **Data Breach:** The attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the database.
* **Data Manipulation and Corruption:** The attacker can modify or delete critical data, leading to data integrity issues and potential application malfunction.
* **Account Takeover:** The attacker can create new administrative accounts or elevate existing ones, allowing for persistent access even after the initial vulnerability is patched.
* **Lateral Movement:**  Compromising the database can provide a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network if the database server has access to them.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack can severely damage the organization's reputation and customer trust.
* **Compliance Violations:** Data breaches resulting from this attack can lead to significant fines and penalties under various data privacy regulations.

**Detection Methods:**

* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can be configured with rules to detect and block common SQL injection patterns, including attempts to use `GRANT`, `CREATE USER`, or manipulate privilege-related tables.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Network-based IDS/IPS can monitor database traffic for suspicious SQL commands.
* **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):** DAM solutions can track and audit all database activities, flagging unusual or unauthorized privilege changes.
* **Log Analysis:** Analyzing application and database logs for suspicious SQL queries, error messages related to privilege issues, or unexpected user creation events.
* **Code Review and Static Analysis:** Regularly reviewing the application's codebase and using static analysis tools to identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
* **Penetration Testing and Vulnerability Scanning:**  Simulating real-world attacks to identify exploitable SQL injection points and assess the effectiveness of security controls.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most effective way to prevent SQL injection. By using parameterized queries, user input is treated as data, not executable code, preventing malicious SQL from being injected.
* **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before incorporating them into SQL queries. This includes checking data types, formats, and lengths, and escaping special characters.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant the application's database user only the minimum necessary privileges required for its operation. Avoid using highly privileged accounts for routine database interactions.
* **Stored Procedures:** Using stored procedures can help encapsulate SQL logic and reduce the attack surface for SQL injection.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Implement a WAF to filter malicious traffic and block known SQL injection attempts.
* **Database Hardening:**  Follow security best practices for configuring and hardening the MariaDB server, including strong password policies, disabling unnecessary features, and keeping the server software up-to-date.
* **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to avoid revealing sensitive database information in error messages that could aid attackers.
* **Regular Security Training for Developers:** Educate developers on secure coding practices and the risks of SQL injection.

**Conclusion:**

The "Exploit SQL Injection to Grant Higher Privileges" attack path represents a significant threat to applications using MariaDB. A successful exploitation can lead to complete database compromise and severe consequences. Implementing robust mitigation strategies, particularly parameterized queries and the principle of least privilege, is crucial to prevent this type of attack. Continuous monitoring, regular security assessments, and developer training are also essential for maintaining a strong security posture against SQL injection vulnerabilities. This deep analysis provides the development team with the necessary understanding to prioritize and implement effective security measures to protect their application and data.
