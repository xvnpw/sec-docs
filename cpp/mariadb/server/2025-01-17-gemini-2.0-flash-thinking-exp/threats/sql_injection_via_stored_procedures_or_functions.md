### 4. Deep Analysis of SQL Injection via Stored Procedures or Functions

#### 4.1 Introduction

SQL Injection via Stored Procedures or Functions is a critical security vulnerability that allows attackers to bypass application-level security measures and directly interact with the underlying database. This threat specifically targets the logic within stored procedures and functions, which are pre-compiled SQL code stored within the database. If these routines are not carefully designed and implemented, they can become entry points for malicious SQL commands.

#### 4.2 Mechanism of Exploitation

The core of this vulnerability lies in the failure to properly sanitize or parameterize user-supplied input that is used within the dynamic SQL statements constructed within the stored procedure or function.

**Scenario:**

Imagine a stored procedure designed to retrieve user details based on a username. A vulnerable implementation might look something like this (simplified example):

```sql
-- Vulnerable Stored Procedure (Conceptual)
CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserDetails (IN username VARCHAR(255))
BEGIN
    SET @sql = CONCAT('SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = "', username, '"');
    PREPARE stmt FROM @sql;
    EXECUTE stmt;
    DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
END;
```

In this scenario, if an attacker provides an input like `' OR 1=1 --`, the constructed SQL query becomes:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '' OR 1=1 --'
```

The `--` comments out the rest of the query. The `OR 1=1` condition is always true, effectively bypassing the intended filtering and potentially returning all user records.

**Key Elements of Exploitation:**

*   **Unsanitized Input:** The `username` parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Dynamic SQL Construction:** The use of `CONCAT` or similar functions to build SQL queries dynamically makes the code susceptible to injection if input is not handled carefully.
*   **Lack of Parameterization:**  Prepared statements with placeholders for parameters are not used, which is a primary defense against SQL injection.

#### 4.3 Affected Component: `sql/stored_routines.cc` and Custom Logic

The provided affected component, `sql/stored_routines.cc`, is a core part of the MariaDB server responsible for the execution of stored procedures and functions. While the vulnerability itself often resides within the *custom* stored procedure or function logic, `sql/stored_routines.cc` plays a crucial role in the execution process and how it handles the constructed SQL statements.

**Role of `sql/stored_routines.cc`:**

*   **Parsing and Execution:** This component is responsible for parsing the SQL code within the stored procedure or function and executing it against the database engine.
*   **Parameter Handling:** It manages the input parameters passed to the stored procedure or function.
*   **Security Context:** It operates within the security context of the user executing the stored procedure.

**Vulnerability Context:**

While `sql/stored_routines.cc` itself is generally robust against direct manipulation, the vulnerability arises from the *data* it receives from the custom stored procedure logic. If the custom code constructs malicious SQL and passes it to the execution engine via `sql/stored_routines.cc`, the engine will execute it.

**Therefore, the vulnerability is a combination of:**

1. **Flawed logic in custom stored procedures/functions:**  Failure to sanitize or parameterize input.
2. **The execution mechanism provided by `sql/stored_routines.cc`:**  Which faithfully executes the potentially malicious SQL passed to it.

#### 4.4 Attack Vectors

Attackers can exploit this vulnerability through various entry points where user input is passed to stored procedures or functions:

*   **Web Application Forms:** Input fields in web forms that are directly passed as parameters to stored procedures.
*   **API Endpoints:** Parameters passed through API calls that trigger the execution of stored procedures.
*   **Command-Line Interfaces (CLIs):** Input provided through command-line arguments that are used as parameters.
*   **Internal Application Logic:** Data processed within the application and then passed to stored procedures without proper sanitization.
*   **Indirect Injection:** In some cases, an attacker might be able to inject malicious data into other database tables that are subsequently used by the vulnerable stored procedure, leading to an indirect injection.

#### 4.5 Impact Assessment

A successful SQL Injection attack via stored procedures or functions can have severe consequences:

*   **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive data, including user credentials, financial information, and confidential business data. They can then exfiltrate this data for malicious purposes.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database, leading to data corruption, loss of integrity, and disruption of business operations.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If the stored procedure runs with elevated privileges, an attacker can leverage the injection to execute commands with those privileges, potentially gaining administrative control over the database server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers might be able to execute resource-intensive queries that overload the database server, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.
*   **Application Bypass:** Attackers can bypass application-level security checks and business logic by directly manipulating the database.

#### 4.6 Mitigation Analysis

The proposed mitigation strategies are crucial for preventing SQL Injection via Stored Procedures or Functions:

*   **Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input parameters within stored procedures and functions:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** This is a fundamental security practice. Input validation ensures that the data received conforms to the expected format, length, and type. Sanitization involves escaping or removing potentially harmful characters.
    *   **Implementation:** Implement robust validation checks at the beginning of the stored procedure or function. Use appropriate escaping functions provided by MariaDB (e.g., `QUOTE()`).
    *   **Limitations:**  While effective, relying solely on sanitization can be error-prone. New attack vectors might emerge that bypass current sanitization techniques.

*   **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements within stored procedures to prevent SQL injection:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** This is the most effective defense against SQL injection. Parameterized queries treat user input as data, not executable code. The database driver handles the proper escaping and quoting of parameters.
    *   **Implementation:**  Instead of concatenating strings to build SQL queries, use placeholders (`?`) for parameters and bind the input values separately.
    *   **Example (using prepared statements):**
        ```sql
        -- Secure Stored Procedure (Conceptual)
        CREATE PROCEDURE GetUserDetailsSecure (IN p_username VARCHAR(255))
        BEGIN
            PREPARE stmt FROM 'SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?';
            SET @username = p_username;
            EXECUTE stmt USING @username;
            DEALLOCATE PREPARE stmt;
        END;
        ```
    *   **Benefits:**  Significantly reduces the risk of SQL injection and improves code readability.

*   **Regularly review and audit custom stored procedures and functions for security vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Effectiveness:** Proactive security reviews can identify potential vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
    *   **Implementation:**  Establish a process for regular code reviews, including security-focused reviews. Utilize static analysis tools to automatically detect potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Considerations:** Requires dedicated resources and expertise in secure coding practices.

**Additional Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that database users and the accounts used by the application have only the necessary privileges to perform their tasks. This limits the potential damage if an injection occurs.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL injection attempts before they reach the database.
*   **Database Activity Monitoring (DAM):** DAM tools can monitor database activity and alert on suspicious queries or access patterns.
*   **Error Handling:** Avoid displaying detailed database error messages to users, as this can provide attackers with valuable information about the database structure.

#### 4.7 Developer Considerations

For the development team, the following considerations are crucial:

*   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Educate developers on secure coding practices, specifically regarding SQL injection prevention.
*   **Mandatory Parameterized Queries:** Enforce the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions within stored procedures and functions.
*   **Input Validation Framework:** Implement a consistent and robust input validation framework across the application and within stored procedures.
*   **Code Review Process:** Integrate security-focused code reviews into the development workflow.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools to automatically identify potential SQL injection vulnerabilities during development.
*   **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including penetration testing, to identify and address SQL injection vulnerabilities.

#### 4.8 Security Team Considerations

The security team should focus on:

*   **Security Audits:** Regularly audit custom stored procedures and functions for potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Utilize vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the MariaDB server and related components.
*   **Security Training:** Provide ongoing security training to developers and other relevant personnel.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Have a clear incident response plan in place to handle potential SQL injection attacks.
