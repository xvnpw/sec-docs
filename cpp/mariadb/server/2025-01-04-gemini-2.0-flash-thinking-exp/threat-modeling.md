# Threat Model Analysis for mariadb/server

## Threat: [Brute-Force Attack on Weak User Credentials](./threats/brute-force_attack_on_weak_user_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to the MariaDB server by systematically trying numerous username and password combinations. This can be automated using specialized tools.

**Impact:** Successful brute-force can grant the attacker full access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data, disrupt operations, or use the database as a launchpad for further attacks.

**Component Affected:** Authentication System

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, expiration).
- Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
- Consider using multi-factor authentication for database access.
- Monitor login attempts and alert on suspicious activity.
- Limit the number of allowed login attempts from a single IP address within a timeframe.

## Threat: [Data at Rest Encryption Failure or Weakness](./threats/data_at_rest_encryption_failure_or_weakness.md)

**Description:** If data at rest encryption is not implemented or uses weak encryption algorithms or key management practices, an attacker who gains physical access to the server's storage or database files can potentially decrypt and access sensitive data.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data stored within the database, leading to confidentiality breaches, regulatory violations, and reputational damage.

**Component Affected:** Storage Engine (e.g., InnoDB with encryption features)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Enable and properly configure data at rest encryption using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
- Implement robust key management practices, storing encryption keys securely and separately from the database.
- Regularly rotate encryption keys.
- Ensure proper access controls to the underlying storage and database files.

## Threat: [Data in Transit Interception (Man-in-the-Middle)](./threats/data_in_transit_interception__man-in-the-middle_.md)

**Description:** If the connection between the application and the MariaDB server is not encrypted using TLS/SSL, an attacker positioned on the network can intercept communication and potentially eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted, including credentials and query results.

**Impact:** Compromise of sensitive data being transmitted, including user credentials, application data, and potentially business secrets.

**Component Affected:** Network Communication Layer

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Enforce the use of TLS/SSL for all connections between the application and the MariaDB server.
- Ensure that the TLS/SSL configuration is strong, using up-to-date protocols and cipher suites.
- Properly manage and secure TLS/SSL certificates.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Server Bugs Leading to Denial of Service or Code Execution](./threats/exploitation_of_server_bugs_leading_to_denial_of_service_or_code_execution.md)

**Description:** Undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities within the MariaDB server code can be exploited by attackers to cause the server to crash (DoS) or, in more severe cases, execute arbitrary code on the server's operating system.

**Impact:** Server crashes leading to service disruption, or in the case of remote code execution, complete compromise of the server and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

**Component Affected:** Core Server Functionality (various modules depending on the specific bug)

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep the MariaDB server updated with the latest security patches and stable releases.
- Subscribe to security mailing lists and advisories for MariaDB.
- Implement a robust patching process.
- Consider using intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDPS) to detect and block exploitation attempts.

## Threat: [Insecure Plugin Management](./threats/insecure_plugin_management.md)

**Description:** If the MariaDB server allows the installation of untrusted or vulnerable plugins, an attacker could install a malicious plugin that compromises the server's security, potentially allowing for data theft, DoS, or remote code execution.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the MariaDB server and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

**Component Affected:** Plugin Management System

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Restrict the installation of plugins to trusted sources.
- Implement a process for vetting and reviewing plugins before installation.
- Keep installed plugins updated to the latest versions.
- Disable or remove unnecessary plugins.
