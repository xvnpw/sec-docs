## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server_vulnerabilities.md)

This path represents attacks that directly target flaws within the MariaDB server software. Successful exploitation can grant the attacker significant control over the server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses.md)

This path focuses on bypassing or subverting the mechanisms designed to control access to the database. Success here allows unauthorized individuals to interact with the database, potentially reading, modifying, or deleting data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_manipulation_vulnerabilities.md)

This path involves manipulating data within the database in an unauthorized manner. Server-side SQL injection is a prime example, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_insecure_default_configurations.md)

This path highlights the risks associated with using default settings that are not secure. Leaving default ports open or using weak default credentials can provide easy entry points for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Communication Channels](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_communication_channels.md)

This path focuses on the vulnerability of data transmitted between the client and the server. If communication is not encrypted, attackers can intercept sensitive information like credentials and data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Code Execution via External Libraries/Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_code_execution_via_external_librariesplugins.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities in external components used by the MariaDB server. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code within the server's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerability.md)

This node represents the act of leveraging publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the MariaDB server. Attackers can use readily available exploits to compromise systems that haven't been properly patched.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

This node signifies the attacker's ability to execute arbitrary commands on the MariaDB server. Achieving RCE is a critical compromise, granting the attacker full control over the server and its resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bug in Privilege Management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bug_in_privilege_management.md)

This node represents the exploitation of flaws in the way MariaDB manages user privileges. Success here can allow an attacker to elevate their privileges, potentially gaining full administrative control over the database.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authentication.md)

This node signifies the attacker's ability to circumvent the normal login process and gain access to the database without valid credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Credentials (If Not Changed)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__if_not_changed_.md)

This node represents the simplest form of authentication bypass, where attackers use the default usernames and passwords that are often present after installation if not changed by the administrator.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_bypass_vulnerability.md)

This node represents the exploitation of specific flaws in the authentication mechanism itself, allowing attackers to gain access without providing valid credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SQL Injection (Server-Side)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sql_injection__server-side_.md)

This node represents the injection of malicious SQL code into server-side logic, such as stored procedures or functions. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to data breaches or modifications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept Unencrypted Traffic to Steal Credentials or Data](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_unencrypted_traffic_to_steal_credentials_or_data.md)

This node signifies the successful interception of communication between the client and the server when encryption (like TLS/SSL) is not used. Attackers can eavesdrop on this traffic to steal sensitive information, including login credentials and application data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in External Library/Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_external_libraryplugin.md)

This node represents the exploitation of security flaws within external libraries or plugins used by the MariaDB server. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution within the server's context.
