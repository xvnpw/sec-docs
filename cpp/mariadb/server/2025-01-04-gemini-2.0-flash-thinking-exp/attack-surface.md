# Attack Surface Analysis for mariadb/server

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Network Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_network_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** The MariaDB server listens on network ports, making it accessible to potential attackers on the network.
*   **How Server Contributes:** The server process actively binds to specified network interfaces and ports, waiting for incoming connections. This inherent functionality creates the entry point.
*   **Example:** An attacker scans open ports on a server and finds the MariaDB port (default 3306) accessible from the public internet.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate the MariaDB server within a private network, restricting access from untrusted networks.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement strict firewall rules to allow connections only from authorized IP addresses or networks.
    *   **Disable Remote Access:** If remote access is not required, configure the server to listen only on the loopback interface (localhost).
    *   **Use VPN:** For legitimate remote access, require connections through a Virtual Private Network (VPN).

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Using easily guessable or default usernames and passwords for MariaDB accounts.
*   **How Server Contributes:** The server relies on username/password authentication for access control. If these credentials are weak, the server's security is compromised.
*   **Example:** An administrator uses the default `root` account with a simple password like "password" or leaves default accounts enabled.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, including access to all data and the ability to execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Passwords:** Enforce the use of strong, unique passwords that meet complexity requirements.
    *   **Regular Password Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular password changes.
    *   **Disable Default Accounts:** Disable or rename default administrative accounts.
    *   **Password Management Tools:** Encourage the use of password managers.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Storage Engines](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_storage_engines.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or weaknesses within the specific storage engine used by MariaDB (e.g., InnoDB, MyISAM, Aria).
*   **How Server Contributes:** The server relies on the storage engine to manage data storage and retrieval. Vulnerabilities in the storage engine's code can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in a specific version of the InnoDB storage engine when handling certain types of large data inserts.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, denial of service, potential for arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep MariaDB Updated:** Regularly update MariaDB to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities in storage engines.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to MariaDB and its storage engines.
    *   **Choose Storage Engines Wisely:** Select storage engines based on security considerations and the specific needs of the application.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Server Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_server_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfigurations in the MariaDB server settings that weaken its security posture.
*   **How Server Contributes:** The server's behavior and security are heavily influenced by its configuration settings. Insecure settings create opportunities for exploitation.
*   **Example:** The `general_log` is enabled without proper access control, potentially exposing sensitive data in the log files.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, unauthorized access, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (depending on the misconfiguration)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Follow Security Hardening Guides:** Implement security hardening recommendations for MariaDB.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable features or plugins that are not required to reduce the attack surface.
    *   **Restrict File System Access:** Ensure appropriate file system permissions are set for MariaDB data and configuration files.
    *   **Secure Logging:** Configure logging securely, restricting access to log files and potentially using remote syslog.
    *   **Review Configuration Regularly:** Periodically review the server configuration to identify and rectify any insecure settings.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Authentication Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_authentication_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the specific authentication plugins used by MariaDB (e.g., `mysql_native_password`, `ed25519`).
*   **How Server Contributes:** The server relies on these plugins to handle the authentication process. Vulnerabilities can allow bypassing authentication.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific version of the `mysql_native_password` plugin allows an attacker to authenticate without providing the correct password.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the severity of the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep MariaDB Updated:** Regularly update MariaDB to patch vulnerabilities in authentication plugins.
    *   **Use Strong Authentication Methods:**  Prefer more secure authentication plugins if available.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities affecting MariaDB authentication plugins.
