#### 4.2. Overall Impact Assessment Review

*   **Vulnerability exploitation:** **High reduction.**  Regular patching directly addresses known vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the attack surface and the likelihood of exploitation.
*   **Zero-day attacks:** **Medium reduction.** While patching cannot prevent zero-day attacks, a proactive patching posture reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities. By patching promptly after advisories are released, the organization is less likely to be vulnerable to exploits that emerge shortly after a zero-day is disclosed and patched by the vendor.
*   **Data breaches/compromise:** **High reduction.** Patching is a critical control for preventing data breaches and system compromise resulting from exploitable vulnerabilities in the MariaDB server. By addressing vulnerabilities, the risk of unauthorized access, data exfiltration, and system takeover is significantly reduced.

#### 4.3. Gap Analysis Summary

Based on the "Currently Implemented" and "Missing Implementation" sections, the key gaps are:

*   **Lack of a Formal MariaDB Patch Management Process:** This is the most significant gap. Without a documented and implemented process, patching is likely to be inconsistent and ad-hoc.
*   **Inconsistent Monitoring of Security Advisories:**  Failure to consistently monitor MariaDB security advisories means the organization may be unaware of critical vulnerabilities and patches.
*   **Lack of Consistent Non-Production Testing:**  Skipping testing increases the risk of patch-related issues in production, potentially leading to instability and downtime.
*   **No Automation of MariaDB Patching:**  Manual patching is inefficient, error-prone, and slow, hindering the ability to patch promptly and consistently.
