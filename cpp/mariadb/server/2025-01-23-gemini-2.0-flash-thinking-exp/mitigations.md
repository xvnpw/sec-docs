# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mariadb/server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Password Policies (MariaDB Plugin)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_password_policies__mariadb_plugin_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Password Validation Plugin:** Install and enable MariaDB's `validate_password` plugin (or similar plugin like `cracklib_password`) by adding `plugin-load-add=validate_password.so` to your `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d` configuration file and restarting the MariaDB server.
    2.  **Configure Password Policy:** Set password policy parameters in `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d` under the `[mysqld]` section.  Example configurations include:
        ```
        validate_password.policy=STRONG
        validate_password.length=12
        validate_password.mixed_case_count=1
        validate_password.number_count=1
        validate_password.special_char_count=1
        ```
        Adjust these values based on your organization's security requirements.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Brute-force attacks on MariaDB user accounts (High Severity)
        *   Credential stuffing attacks (High Severity)
        *   Unauthorized access due to weak or default passwords (High Severity)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Brute-force attacks: High reduction in risk. Strong passwords significantly increase the time and resources required for successful brute-force attacks.
        *   Credential stuffing attacks: Medium to High reduction. While strong passwords help, they don't completely eliminate the risk if users reuse passwords across multiple services.
        *   Unauthorized access: High reduction. Significantly reduces the likelihood of unauthorized access due to easily guessable or default passwords *at the MariaDB level*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Password complexity requirements are enforced for new administrative users during initial server setup, but not using the plugin.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Password validation plugin is not enabled for all MariaDB instances.
        *   Password policy configuration via plugin is not consistently applied across all environments (development, staging, production).
        *   Existing user accounts do not have enforced password complexity requirements *via the plugin*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) (MariaDB Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_role-based_access_control__rbac___mariadb_feature_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Roles:** Define roles based on job functions and required database access within MariaDB. Examples: `application_read_write`, `application_read_only`, `database_administrator`, `reporting_user`.
    2.  **Create Roles in MariaDB:** Use `CREATE ROLE` statements to define these roles in MariaDB. For example: `CREATE ROLE 'application_read_write';`
    3.  **Grant Privileges to Roles:** Grant specific privileges to each role using `GRANT` statements within MariaDB. For example: `GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON application_database.* TO 'application_read_write';`
    4.  **Assign Roles to Users:** Assign roles to MariaDB users using `GRANT role TO user` statements. For example: `GRANT 'application_read_write' TO 'app_user'@'localhost';`
    5.  **Revoke Direct Privileges (Within MariaDB):**  Remove any directly granted privileges to users that are now covered by roles to ensure access is managed solely through MariaDB roles.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Privilege escalation within MariaDB (Medium to High Severity)
        *   Unauthorized data access within MariaDB (Medium to High Severity)
        *   Accidental data modification or deletion by users with excessive MariaDB privileges (Medium Severity)
        *   Lateral movement within the MariaDB system after initial compromise (Medium Severity)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Privilege escalation: Medium to High reduction. RBAC within MariaDB limits the scope of privileges, making it harder for an attacker to escalate privileges from a compromised MariaDB account.
        *   Unauthorized data access: Medium to High reduction. Ensures MariaDB users only have access to the data they need for their specific roles *within the database*.
        *   Accidental data modification/deletion: Medium reduction. Reduces the risk of accidental damage by limiting write access to necessary roles *within MariaDB*.
        *   Lateral movement: Medium reduction. Limits the potential damage if a MariaDB account is compromised, as the compromised account will have restricted privileges *within the database*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. RBAC is used for administrative users within MariaDB, separating DBA duties from general access.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   RBAC is not fully implemented for application users within MariaDB. Many application users still have directly granted privileges instead of role-based access *in MariaDB*.
        *   Roles within MariaDB are not granular enough and need further refinement to align with the principle of least privilege for different application modules accessing the database.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure `sql_mode` for Security (MariaDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/configure__sql_mode__for_security__mariadb_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Edit `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d`:** Open the MariaDB server configuration file.
    2.  **Set `sql_mode`:** Under the `[mysqld]` section, set the `sql_mode` variable to a strict and secure configuration.  Recommended options include:
        ```
        sql_mode = STRICT_TRANS_TABLES,ERROR_FOR_DIVISION_BY_ZERO,NO_AUTO_CREATE_USER,NO_ENGINE_SUBSTITUTION
        ```
        You can customize this further based on specific application needs, but generally, including `STRICT_TRANS_TABLES` is beneficial for security.
    3.  **Restart MariaDB Server:** Restart the MariaDB server for the changes to take effect.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Subtle SQL injection vulnerabilities due to permissive SQL syntax (Medium Severity)
        *   Data integrity issues due to lenient data validation (Medium Severity)
        *   Unexpected behavior from SQL queries that could be exploited (Low to Medium Severity)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   SQL injection: Low to Medium reduction. `sql_mode` is not a primary defense against SQL injection, but stricter modes can help prevent some less obvious injection vectors by enforcing stricter syntax and data handling.
        *   Data integrity: Medium reduction. Strict modes improve data integrity by enforcing stricter data validation and preventing silent data truncation or incorrect data type conversions.
        *   Unexpected behavior: Medium reduction. Reduces the likelihood of unexpected SQL query behavior that could be exploited by attackers.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Default `sql_mode` is used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `sql_mode` is not configured to a strict setting in `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d` across any environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limits (MariaDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limits__mariadb_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Edit `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d`:** Open the MariaDB server configuration file.
    2.  **Set `max_connections`:** Under the `[mysqld]` section, set the `max_connections` variable to limit the total number of concurrent connections to the MariaDB server. Choose a value appropriate for your server's resources and expected workload. Example: `max_connections = 500`
    3.  **Set `max_user_connections` (Optional):**  You can also set `max_user_connections` to limit the number of concurrent connections per MariaDB user. This can be useful to prevent a single compromised user from exhausting all connections. Example: `max_user_connections = 50`
    4.  **Restart MariaDB Server:** Restart the MariaDB server for the changes to take effect.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting MariaDB connection resources (Medium to High Severity)
        *   Resource exhaustion due to excessive connections (Medium Severity)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS attacks: Medium reduction. Connection limits can help mitigate connection flood DoS attacks by preventing attackers from opening an unlimited number of connections and overwhelming the server.
        *   Resource exhaustion: Medium reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion due to legitimate or malicious spikes in connection requests.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `max_connections` is set to a default value, but not specifically tuned for security.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `max_connections` and `max_user_connections` are not explicitly configured and tuned in `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d` for optimal security and resource management across environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Timeouts (MariaDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/query_timeouts__mariadb_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Edit `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d`:** Open the MariaDB server configuration file.
    2.  **Set `max_execution_time`:** Under the `[mysqld]` section, set the `max_execution_time` variable to limit the maximum execution time for `SELECT` statements (in milliseconds). Example: `max_execution_time = 30000` (30 seconds).
    3.  **Set `connect_timeout`:** Set the `connect_timeout` variable to limit the time (in seconds) the server waits for a connection attempt before giving up. Example: `connect_timeout = 10`
    4.  **Restart MariaDB Server:** Restart the MariaDB server for the changes to take effect.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks using slow or long-running queries (Medium Severity)
        *   Resource exhaustion due to runaway queries (Medium Severity)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS attacks (slow queries): Medium reduction. Query timeouts prevent long-running queries from consuming server resources indefinitely, mitigating some types of slow-query DoS attacks.
        *   Resource exhaustion: Medium reduction. Prevents resource exhaustion caused by accidental or malicious runaway queries.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Default timeout settings are used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `max_execution_time` and `connect_timeout` are not explicitly configured in `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d` to protect against slow query DoS and resource exhaustion across environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Thread Pool Configuration (MariaDB Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/thread_pool_configuration__mariadb_feature_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable Thread Pool:** If not already enabled, enable the thread pool plugin in MariaDB by adding `plugin-load-add=thread_pool.so` to your `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d` configuration file and restarting the MariaDB server.
    2.  **Configure Thread Pool Parameters:** Configure thread pool parameters in `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d` under the `[thread_pool]` section. Key parameters include:
        *   `thread_pool_size`:  Number of thread groups.
        *   `thread_pool_max_threads`: Maximum number of threads in the pool.
        *   `thread_pool_idle_timeout`: Time (in seconds) idle threads are kept alive.
        Adjust these values based on your server's CPU cores, expected workload, and performance testing.
    3.  **Monitor Thread Pool Performance:** Monitor thread pool performance using MariaDB status variables to ensure it is effectively managing connections and preventing resource exhaustion.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) attacks targeting MariaDB thread resources (Medium to High Severity)
        *   Performance degradation under heavy load, potentially leading to service unavailability (Medium Severity)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   DoS attacks (thread exhaustion): Medium to High reduction. Thread pool helps manage and limit the number of threads used for connections, preventing thread exhaustion DoS attacks.
        *   Performance degradation: Medium to High reduction. Improves server performance and stability under heavy load by efficiently managing threads and preventing thread contention.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Default thread handling is used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Thread pool plugin is not enabled in MariaDB.
        *   Thread pool parameters are not configured in `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d` to optimize performance and security under load across environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Encryption at Rest (InnoDB Transparent Data Encryption - MariaDB Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/data_encryption_at_rest__innodb_transparent_data_encryption_-_mariadb_feature_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable InnoDB Encryption:** Configure InnoDB Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) in MariaDB by setting `innodb_encrypt_tables=ON` and `innodb_encryption_threads=4` (adjust thread count as needed) in your `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d` configuration file under the `[mysqld]` section.
    2.  **Configure Encryption Key Management:** Choose a key management method. MariaDB supports using a keyring plugin (recommended for production) or file-based key management (less secure, suitable for testing). Configure the chosen keyring plugin (e.g., `keyring_file.so`, `keyring_encrypted_file.so`, or a dedicated key management system plugin) in `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d`.
    3.  **Encrypt Existing Tables (Optional but Recommended):** For existing tables, use `ALTER TABLE table_name ENCRYPT='Y';` to encrypt them. New tables created after enabling `innodb_encrypt_tables` will be encrypted by default.
    4.  **Restart MariaDB Server:** Restart the MariaDB server for the changes to take effect.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Data breaches due to physical theft of storage media (High Severity)
        *   Unauthorized access to data files on disk (High Severity)
        *   Compliance violations related to data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) (High Severity)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breaches (physical theft): High reduction. Encrypting data at rest renders the data unreadable if storage media is stolen or accessed without authorization.
        *   Unauthorized file access: High reduction. Protects data even if attackers gain access to the underlying file system.
        *   Compliance: High reduction. Helps meet compliance requirements for data protection by ensuring sensitive data is encrypted at rest.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Data at rest is not currently encrypted.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   InnoDB Transparent Data Encryption is not enabled in MariaDB.
        *   Encryption key management is not configured.
        *   Existing tables are not encrypted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Encrypted Connections (TLS/SSL) (MariaDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_encrypted_connections__tlsssl___mariadb_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS/SSL Certificates:** Acquire TLS/SSL certificates for the MariaDB server.
    2.  **Configure MariaDB for TLS/SSL:** Configure MariaDB to use TLS/SSL by modifying the `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d` configuration file. Specify the paths to the server certificate, private key, and CA certificate (if using CA-signed certificates). Example configuration:
        ```
        ssl-cert=/path/to/server-cert.pem
        ssl-key=/path/to/server-key.pem
        ssl-ca=/path/to/ca-cert.pem
        ssl=true
        ```
    3.  **Require TLS/SSL Connections:**  Enforce TLS/SSL connections by setting `require_secure_transport=ON` in the MariaDB configuration. This will reject connections that do not use encryption.
    4.  **Restart MariaDB Server:** Restart the MariaDB server for the changes to take effect.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks on MariaDB connections (High Severity)
        *   Eavesdropping on MariaDB database traffic (High Severity)
        *   Data breaches due to interception of unencrypted MariaDB database credentials or sensitive data in transit (High Severity)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   MITM attacks: High reduction. TLS/SSL encryption makes it extremely difficult for attackers to intercept and modify data in transit to/from MariaDB.
        *   Eavesdropping: High reduction. Encrypts all communication, preventing eavesdropping on sensitive data transmitted between applications and MariaDB.
        *   Data breaches (in transit): High reduction. Protects sensitive data and credentials from being intercepted during transmission to/from MariaDB.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in production environment for connections from application servers to the MariaDB server.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   TLS/SSL encryption is not consistently enforced in development and staging MariaDB environments.
        *   Connections from administrative tools and workstations to the MariaDB server are not always encrypted.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Data Exposure in MariaDB Logs (MariaDB Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_data_exposure_in_mariadb_logs__mariadb_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review MariaDB Log Configuration:** Examine the MariaDB server's logging configuration in `my.cnf` or `mariadb.conf.d`. Pay attention to settings like `general_log`, `slow_query_log`, and `error_log`.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Logging:** Disable `general_log` unless it is specifically required for auditing or debugging, as it logs all SQL statements, potentially including sensitive data. If needed, ensure it's rotated and access-controlled.
    3.  **Configure `log_slow_verbosity` (for slow query log):** If using the slow query log, configure `log_slow_verbosity` to minimize the amount of potentially sensitive information logged in slow query logs. Avoid logging `query_sample` or `explain_analyzer` in production unless absolutely necessary for performance analysis.
    4.  **Restrict Log File Permissions:** Ensure MariaDB log files have restrictive permissions (e.g., 600 or 640) to prevent unauthorized access.
    5.  **Log Rotation and Retention:** Implement log rotation and retention policies to manage log file size and prevent logs from being stored indefinitely. Use tools like `logrotate`.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Information disclosure through MariaDB log files (Medium Severity)
        *   Data breaches due to exposure of sensitive data in logs (Medium Severity)
        *   Compliance violations related to logging sensitive data (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) (Medium Severity)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information disclosure: Medium reduction. Minimizing logged data and securing log files reduces the risk of sensitive information being exposed through logs.
        *   Data breaches (via logs): Medium reduction. Reduces the potential for data breaches originating from compromised or inadvertently exposed log files.
        *   Compliance: Medium reduction. Helps meet compliance requirements related to logging and data protection.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Log rotation is configured, but detailed log configuration and access controls are not fully optimized for security.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   `general_log` is enabled in some environments and not properly secured.
        *   `log_slow_verbosity` is not configured to minimize sensitive data logging in slow query logs.
        *   Log file permissions are not consistently restrictive across all environments.
        *   Formal log review and audit processes are not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Security Updates and Patching (MariaDB Server Software)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_security_updates_and_patching__mariadb_server_software_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Patch Management Process:** Implement a process for regularly checking for and applying security updates and patches for the MariaDB server software.
    2.  **Subscribe to Security Advisories:** Subscribe to MariaDB security mailing lists or security advisory feeds to receive timely notifications about security vulnerabilities and updates.
    3.  **Test Patches in Non-Production:** Before applying patches to production servers, thoroughly test them in non-production environments (staging, testing) to ensure compatibility and prevent regressions.
    4.  **Apply Patches Promptly:** Once patches are tested and validated, apply them to production MariaDB servers as quickly as possible, following a defined change management process.
    5.  **Automate Patching (Where Possible):** Explore automation tools and techniques for streamlining the patch management process, such as using package managers (e.g., `apt`, `yum`) or configuration management systems (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet).

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Exploitation of known MariaDB server vulnerabilities (High Severity)
        *   Zero-day attacks targeting unpatched vulnerabilities (High Severity - reduced by proactive patching)
        *   Data breaches and system compromise due to unpatched vulnerabilities (High Severity)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Vulnerability exploitation: High reduction. Regularly patching eliminates known vulnerabilities, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation.
        *   Zero-day attacks: Medium reduction. While patching doesn't prevent zero-day attacks, proactive patching reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   Data breaches/compromise: High reduction. Patching is crucial for preventing data breaches and system compromise resulting from exploitable vulnerabilities in the MariaDB server.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. OS-level updates are applied regularly, but MariaDB-specific patching is not always prioritized or consistently tracked.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal patch management process for MariaDB server is not fully defined and implemented.
        *   Subscription to MariaDB security advisories is not consistently monitored.
        *   Testing of MariaDB patches in non-production environments is not always performed before production deployment.
        *   Automation of MariaDB patching is not implemented.
