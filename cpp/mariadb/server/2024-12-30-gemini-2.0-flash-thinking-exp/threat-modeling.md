### High and Critical MariaDB Server Threats

This list focuses on high and critical severity threats directly involving the MariaDB server codebase.

*   **Threat:** Weak Default Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to log in to the MariaDB server using default, well-known credentials (e.g., root with no password or a common password). If successful, they gain full administrative access due to the server's initial configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database server, including access to all data, ability to modify or delete data, and potentially execute operating system commands if `sys_exec` is enabled or via `LOAD DATA INFILE`.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication System (user account management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change all default passwords upon installation.
        *   Disable or remove default accounts that are not needed.

*   **Threat:** Brute-Force Attack on User Accounts
    *   **Description:** An attacker might use automated tools to try numerous username and password combinations to gain unauthorized access to MariaDB accounts. This targets the server's authentication mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** Successful brute-force can lead to unauthorized access to specific databases and tables, allowing data theft, modification, or deletion, depending on the compromised account's privileges.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication System (login process).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies (minimum length, complexity, expiration) within MariaDB's configuration.
        *   Implement account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts (configurable within MariaDB).
        *   Consider using two-factor authentication for database access (if supported by the client application and MariaDB configuration).
        *   Rate-limit connection attempts from specific IP addresses (can be done via firewall or MariaDB plugins).

*   **Threat:** Privilege Escalation via Exploitable Bugs
    *   **Description:** An attacker with limited privileges might exploit vulnerabilities within MariaDB's privilege management system or stored procedures to gain higher-level privileges, potentially reaching `SUPER` or `SYSTEM_USER` level. This directly targets flaws in the server's code.
    *   **Impact:**  Gaining elevated privileges allows the attacker to bypass access controls, access sensitive data, modify database structure, create or drop users, and potentially execute operating system commands.
    *   **Affected Component:** Privilege Management System, Stored Procedure Execution Engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the MariaDB server updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting database permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit user privileges.
        *   Disable or restrict the use of features that can be exploited for privilege escalation if not strictly necessary.

*   **Threat:** SQL Injection Vulnerabilities within MariaDB Features
    *   **Description:** While often an application-level issue, vulnerabilities within MariaDB's query parsing, stored procedures, or user-defined functions could allow an attacker to inject malicious SQL code that is executed with the privileges of the MariaDB server itself. This indicates a flaw in the server's handling of SQL.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to data breaches, data modification, denial of service, or even remote code execution on the database server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Query Parser, Stored Procedure Execution Engine, User-Defined Function Interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the MariaDB server updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Carefully review and sanitize inputs within stored procedures and user-defined functions.
        *   Avoid dynamic SQL construction within stored procedures where possible.

*   **Threat:** Data Corruption due to Server Bugs
    *   **Description:**  Bugs within the MariaDB server's storage engine (e.g., InnoDB, MyISAM) or other core components could lead to data corruption or inconsistencies. An attacker might trigger these bugs through specific actions or crafted queries that exploit server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Loss of data integrity, potentially leading to application errors, incorrect data processing, and unreliable information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Storage Engines (InnoDB, MyISAM, etc.), Transaction Management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the MariaDB server updated with the latest stable releases and bug fixes.
        *   Regularly perform database integrity checks (e.g., `CHECK TABLE`).
        *   Implement robust backup and recovery procedures.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** An attacker might send a large number of malicious or resource-intensive queries directly to the MariaDB server, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O, connections) and causing it to become unresponsive or crash. This targets the server's ability to handle requests.
    *   **Impact:**  Database unavailability, leading to application downtime and service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Query Processing Engine, Connection Management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement query timeouts and resource limits within MariaDB's configuration.
        *   Use connection pooling and limit the maximum number of connections within MariaDB's configuration.
        *   Implement rate limiting at the network level to block excessive requests.
        *   Optimize database queries and schema to improve performance.

*   **Threat:** Replication Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** If MariaDB replication is used, vulnerabilities in the replication protocol or configuration within the MariaDB server itself could allow an attacker to intercept or manipulate replicated data, potentially compromising replica servers or the master server.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption or manipulation across multiple database instances, unauthorized access to replicated data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Replication Protocol, Binary Logging.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the replication channel using encryption (e.g., SSL/TLS) configured within MariaDB.
        *   Implement strong authentication for replication users within MariaDB.
        *   Restrict network access to replication ports.
        *   Regularly monitor the replication status and logs for anomalies.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in MariaDB Plugins or Extensions
    *   **Description:** If the application utilizes MariaDB plugins or extensions, vulnerabilities within these third-party components that are integrated into the MariaDB server could be exploited to compromise the database server.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the nature of the vulnerability and the privileges of the plugin, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin Interface, Specific Plugin Modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install necessary and trusted plugins.
        *   Keep plugins updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Regularly review the security of installed plugins.
