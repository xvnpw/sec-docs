Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve the MariaDB server, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Unencrypted Network Connections
    *   **Description:** Communication between clients and the MariaDB server occurs without encryption.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server, by default, might not enforce or require TLS/SSL encryption for connections.
    *   **Example:** An attacker on the same network intercepts login credentials or sensitive data transmitted during a query.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data, potential for account compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Configure the MariaDB server to require TLS/SSL for all connections.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Ensure client applications are configured to connect using TLS/SSL.

*   **Attack Surface:** Brute-Force Attacks on User Accounts
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess user passwords to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server's authentication mechanism, if not properly protected, can be targeted by brute-force attempts.
    *   **Example:** Attackers use automated tools to try numerous password combinations against a MariaDB user account.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, expiration) on the server.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Implement account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts on the server.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Consider using multi-factor authentication for database access.

*   **Attack Surface:** SQL Injection Vulnerabilities (Server's Role)
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into application queries, which is then executed by the MariaDB server.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server's responsibility to execute any valid SQL query, without inherently distinguishing between legitimate and malicious code, makes it vulnerable when applications don't sanitize inputs.
    *   **Example:** A web application fails to sanitize user input in a search field, allowing an attacker to inject SQL code to extract sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential for remote code execution (in some scenarios).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Regularly update the MariaDB server to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Privilege Escalation
    *   **Description:** An attacker with limited database privileges gains higher-level access.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** Vulnerabilities in the server's privilege management system or insecure default permissions can allow this.
    *   **Example:** A bug in a stored procedure or a flaw in the grant system allows a user to acquire DBA privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, ability to access and modify all data, potential for server takeover.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege when granting database permissions on the server.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Regularly review and audit database user permissions on the server.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Disable or restrict the use of features that can be misused for privilege escalation (e.g., `LOAD DATA INFILE` from arbitrary locations) on the server.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Keep the MariaDB server updated to patch privilege escalation vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion
    *   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the server with requests, causing it to become unavailable.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server's resource management (e.g., connection limits, memory allocation) can be targeted to cause exhaustion.
    *   **Example:** An attacker opens a large number of connections to the MariaDB server, exceeding its connection limit and preventing legitimate users from connecting.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, inability for applications to access the database, potential financial losses.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Configure appropriate connection limits and timeouts on the server.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Use firewalls to block malicious traffic and limit access to the database server.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in User-Defined Functions (UDFs)
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit security flaws in custom functions loaded into the MariaDB server.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The server allows loading and executing external code through UDFs, which can introduce vulnerabilities if not properly developed.
    *   **Example:** A poorly written UDF contains a buffer overflow vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Exercise extreme caution when using UDFs from untrusted sources on the server.
        *   **Developers:** Thoroughly review and test UDF code for security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Restrict the privileges required to create and execute UDFs on the server.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Consider disabling UDF functionality if it's not essential on the server.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Default Configurations
    *   **Description:** The server is running with default settings that are not secure.
    *   **How Server Contributes:** The default configuration of the server might include weak passwords, open ports, or overly permissive access controls.
    *   **Example:** The `root` user has a default or easily guessable password, allowing unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/Users:** Change all default passwords immediately after installation of the server.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Review and harden the server configuration based on security best practices.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Disable unnecessary features and services on the server.
        *   **Developers/Users:** Limit network access to the database server to only authorized hosts.
