# Deep Analysis of MariaDB Attack Tree Path: 3.3.1 (Load Malicious Plugin)

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the threat posed by the "Load Malicious Plugin" attack vector (3.3.1) against a MariaDB server.  This includes identifying the preconditions for a successful attack, the technical steps involved, potential mitigation strategies, and detection methods.  We aim to provide actionable insights for developers and security engineers to harden the MariaDB deployment against this specific threat.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on attack path 3.3.1:  "Load Malicious Plugin."  We will consider:

*   **MariaDB Server Versions:**  While the analysis is general, we will highlight any version-specific vulnerabilities or mitigations where relevant.  We assume a relatively recent, actively supported version of MariaDB (e.g., 10.6, 10.11, 11.x).  Older, unsupported versions are inherently more vulnerable.
*   **Operating Systems:**  The analysis will consider both Linux and Windows environments, as MariaDB runs on both.  OS-specific attack techniques and defenses will be noted.
*   **Plugin Types:**  We will consider all types of MariaDB plugins that can be loaded, including storage engines, authentication plugins, audit plugins, and general-purpose plugins.
*   **Privilege Levels:**  We will analyze the attack from the perspective of an attacker with varying levels of initial access, from unauthenticated remote access to local user access with limited privileges.
*   **Exclusion:** We will *not* delve into vulnerabilities within specific, legitimate plugins (that would be 3.3, not 3.3.1).  We are focused on the *loading* of a *malicious* plugin itself.  We also exclude social engineering or physical access attacks that might lead to plugin installation.

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Define the attacker's capabilities, motivations, and potential entry points.
2.  **Technical Analysis:**  Examine the MariaDB plugin loading mechanism, including relevant configuration files, system calls, and security checks.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify potential weaknesses in the plugin loading process that could be exploited.
4.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describe realistic scenarios in which an attacker could successfully load a malicious plugin.
5.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Recommend specific security measures to prevent or mitigate the attack.
6.  **Detection Methods:**  Outline techniques for detecting attempts to load malicious plugins.
7.  **Code Review Guidance:** Provide specific recommendations for developers to avoid introducing vulnerabilities related to plugin loading.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Path 3.3.1 (Load Malicious Plugin)

**2.1 Threat Modeling:**

*   **Attacker Profile:**  The attacker is likely to be highly skilled, with a deep understanding of MariaDB internals, operating system security, and potentially, exploit development.  They may be motivated by financial gain (e.g., ransomware, data theft), espionage, or sabotage.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to achieve two primary goals:
    1.  **Gain Write Access:**  The attacker must gain write access to a directory where MariaDB searches for plugins. This is the *critical* prerequisite.
    2.  **Trigger Plugin Loading:** The attacker must then cause MariaDB to load the malicious plugin.
*   **Entry Points:**  The attacker might gain initial access through various means, including:
    *   **SQL Injection:**  Exploiting a SQL injection vulnerability in a web application that interacts with the MariaDB server.  This might allow the attacker to write to the file system (e.g., using `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`).
    *   **Compromised Web Server:**  Gaining control of the web server hosting the application that uses MariaDB.  This provides direct file system access.
    *   **Compromised User Account:**  Obtaining credentials for a user account (OS or MariaDB) with sufficient privileges to write to the plugin directory.
    *   **Vulnerable Third-Party Software:**  Exploiting a vulnerability in other software running on the same server as MariaDB to gain file system access.
    *   **Misconfigured File Permissions:**  Exploiting overly permissive file or directory permissions on the MariaDB server.

**2.2 Technical Analysis:**

*   **Plugin Loading Mechanism:**
    *   MariaDB searches for plugins in specific directories, typically defined by the `plugin_dir` variable in the `my.cnf` (or `my.ini`) configuration file.  The default location often varies by OS and installation method (e.g., `/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/` on Linux, `C:\Program Files\MariaDB <version>\lib\plugin\` on Windows).
    *   Plugins are typically shared object files (`.so` on Linux, `.dll` on Windows).
    *   Plugins can be loaded at server startup (specified in `my.cnf`) or dynamically at runtime using the `INSTALL PLUGIN` SQL statement.  `INSTALL SONAME` is another, more direct way to load a plugin by its shared object filename.
    *   MariaDB performs some basic checks on plugins before loading them (e.g., verifying the file is a valid shared object), but these checks are not foolproof against a crafted malicious plugin.
    *   Once loaded, the plugin's code executes within the context of the `mysqld` process, inheriting its privileges (typically a dedicated `mysql` user, but potentially `root` in misconfigured setups).

*   **Relevant Configuration Files:**
    *   `my.cnf` (or `my.ini`):  Contains the `plugin_dir` setting and may list plugins to be loaded at startup.
    *   `mysql.plugin` table:  Stores information about installed plugins.

*   **Relevant System Calls (Linux Example):**
    *   `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`:  Used for file system operations.
    *   `dlopen()`, `dlsym()`, `dlclose()`:  Used for dynamic loading of shared objects (plugins).
    *   `stat()`, `fstat()`: Used to get file information.

**2.3 Vulnerability Analysis:**

The core vulnerability lies in the ability of an attacker to place a malicious shared object file in a directory where MariaDB will load it.  Several factors can contribute to this:

*   **Insufficient File System Permissions:**  The most common vulnerability.  If the `plugin_dir` or any of its parent directories have overly permissive write permissions (e.g., world-writable), any user on the system can place a malicious plugin.
*   **SQL Injection with `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`:**  If an attacker can inject SQL code and the MariaDB user has the `FILE` privilege, they might be able to write a malicious plugin file directly to the `plugin_dir`.  This is particularly dangerous if the web application runs as a user with broad file system access.
*   **Misconfigured `secure_file_priv`:**  The `secure_file_priv` system variable restricts the directories from which MariaDB can load files (using `LOAD DATA INFILE` and `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`).  If this variable is not set or is set to a directory that the attacker can write to, it increases the risk.
*   **Vulnerabilities in `INSTALL PLUGIN` or `INSTALL SONAME`:** While less likely, a vulnerability in the plugin loading logic itself could allow an attacker to bypass security checks.
*   **Shared Hosting Environments:**  In shared hosting environments, if one website is compromised, the attacker might be able to access the plugin directory of other websites using the same MariaDB instance.

**2.4 Exploitation Scenarios:**

*   **Scenario 1: SQL Injection and `FILE` Privilege:**
    1.  Attacker finds a SQL injection vulnerability in a web application.
    2.  Attacker uses `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE '/usr/lib/mysql/plugin/malicious.so'` to write a crafted shared object file to the plugin directory.  This requires the MariaDB user to have the `FILE` privilege.
    3.  Attacker uses `INSTALL SONAME 'malicious.so';` (possibly through further SQL injection) to load the plugin.
    4.  The malicious plugin executes, granting the attacker control over the MariaDB server.

*   **Scenario 2: Compromised Web Server:**
    1.  Attacker compromises the web server through a vulnerability (e.g., outdated CMS, weak credentials).
    2.  Attacker gains file system access and navigates to the MariaDB plugin directory.
    3.  Attacker uploads a malicious plugin file (`.so` or `.dll`).
    4.  Attacker restarts the MariaDB server (if the plugin is configured to load at startup) or uses `INSTALL PLUGIN` or `INSTALL SONAME` (if they have database access) to load the plugin.

*   **Scenario 3: Misconfigured Permissions:**
    1.  The MariaDB `plugin_dir` has overly permissive permissions (e.g., `777`).
    2.  A low-privileged user on the system (perhaps compromised through another vulnerability) places a malicious plugin file in the directory.
    3.  The attacker triggers the plugin loading (e.g., by restarting MariaDB or using `INSTALL PLUGIN` if they have some database access).

**2.5 Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **File System Permissions:**  Ensure the `plugin_dir` and its parent directories have the *most restrictive* permissions possible.  Only the MariaDB user (e.g., `mysql`) should have write access.  Absolutely *no* world-writable permissions.  Use `chmod` and `chown` appropriately.
    *   **MariaDB User Privileges:**  The MariaDB user should *not* have the `FILE` privilege unless absolutely necessary.  Revoke it if it's not in use.  Grant privileges on a per-database and per-table basis, not globally.
    *   **OS User Privileges:**  Limit the privileges of the user account running the web server or other applications that interact with MariaDB.

*   **Secure Configuration:**
    *   **`plugin_dir`:**  Ensure this is set to a dedicated, secure directory.
    *   **`secure_file_priv`:**  Set this variable to a specific, restricted directory to limit the locations from which MariaDB can load files.  This mitigates `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE` attacks.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Plugins:**  Only load the plugins that are absolutely required.  Remove or disable any unused plugins.
    *   **Regularly Audit Configuration:**  Periodically review the `my.cnf` file and the `mysql.plugin` table to ensure that only authorized plugins are loaded.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Prevent SQL Injection:**  Implement robust input validation and parameterized queries (prepared statements) in all applications that interact with MariaDB.  This is the *most critical* defense against many attack vectors, including this one.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Use a WAF to filter malicious requests that might attempt SQL injection or file system access.

*   **Regular Security Updates:**
    *   **MariaDB Updates:**  Apply security updates and patches for MariaDB promptly.
    *   **Operating System Updates:**  Keep the operating system and all other software on the server up to date.
    *   **Plugin Updates:** If you are using third-party plugins, ensure they are from trusted sources and keep them updated.

*   **Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):**
    *   Monitor for suspicious file system activity, especially in the `plugin_dir`.
    *   Monitor for unusual SQL queries, particularly those involving `INSTALL PLUGIN`, `INSTALL SONAME`, and `SELECT ... INTO OUTFILE`.

* **AppArmor/SELinux:** Use mandatory access control systems like AppArmor (Ubuntu/Debian) or SELinux (Red Hat/CentOS) to confine the `mysqld` process and restrict its access to the file system. This can prevent even a compromised MariaDB process from writing to unauthorized locations.

**2.6 Detection Methods:**

*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Use a FIM tool (e.g., AIDE, Tripwire, OSSEC) to monitor the `plugin_dir` for any changes.  This will alert you if a new file is added or an existing file is modified.
*   **Audit Logging:**  Enable MariaDB's audit logging (using the `server_audit` plugin or a similar mechanism) to record all SQL statements, including `INSTALL PLUGIN` and `INSTALL SONAME`.  Regularly review the audit logs for suspicious activity.
*   **System Call Monitoring:**  Use system call monitoring tools (e.g., `auditd` on Linux) to track calls to `dlopen()`, `dlsym()`, and file system operations related to the `plugin_dir`.
*   **Network Monitoring:**  Monitor network traffic for unusual connections or data transfers that might indicate an attacker attempting to upload a malicious plugin.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):**  Use a SIEM system to collect and correlate logs from various sources (MariaDB, operating system, web server, firewall) to detect patterns of malicious activity.
* **Regular Vulnerability Scanning:** Perform regular vulnerability scans of the server and applications to identify potential entry points for attackers.

**2.7 Code Review Guidance (for Developers):**

*   **Never Trust User Input:**  Assume all user input is potentially malicious.  Use parameterized queries (prepared statements) *exclusively* for all database interactions.  Avoid dynamic SQL generation based on user input.
*   **Sanitize Output:**  Properly encode any data retrieved from the database before displaying it to the user, to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities that could be leveraged to inject SQL.
*   **Avoid `FILE` Privilege:**  Do not grant the `FILE` privilege to the MariaDB user used by your application unless it is absolutely essential.  If you must use it, restrict it as much as possible using `secure_file_priv`.
*   **Secure File Uploads:**  If your application allows file uploads, implement strict validation of file types, sizes, and names.  Store uploaded files outside the web root and use a randomly generated filename to prevent direct access.
*   **Follow Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to general secure coding principles, such as the OWASP Top 10, to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities.
* **Regular Code Reviews and Security Audits:** Conduct regular code reviews and security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
