# Deep Analysis: MariaDB Account Lockout and Password Policy Enforcement

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly evaluate the effectiveness, implementation details, potential weaknesses, and overall security posture improvement provided by the "Enforce Robust Account Lockout and Password Policies" mitigation strategy within a MariaDB server environment (based on https://github.com/mariadb/server).  We aim to identify best practices, potential pitfalls, and areas for improvement.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the server-side enforcement of account lockout and password policies as described in the provided mitigation strategy.  It encompasses the following:

*   Configuration parameters: `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`, `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME`, `password_history`, `password_lifetime`.
*   Optional plugin: `user_lock`.
*   Monitoring of locked accounts.
*   Impact on mitigating brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and account takeover.
*   Analysis of server-side implementation, not client-side validation.
*   MariaDB server configuration and behavior, not application-level logic.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Client-side password strength enforcement (e.g., JavaScript validation).
*   Two-factor authentication (2FA) or multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   Network-level security measures (firewalls, intrusion detection systems).
*   Other MariaDB security features unrelated to account lockout and password policies (e.g., encryption, auditing).

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will be conducted using the following methodology:

1.  **Documentation Review:**  Thorough review of official MariaDB documentation for each configuration parameter and the `user_lock` plugin.
2.  **Configuration Analysis:** Examination of the recommended configuration settings and their implications.
3.  **Threat Modeling:**  Assessment of how the mitigation strategy addresses the specified threats (brute-force, credential stuffing, account takeover).
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  Evaluation of the positive and negative impacts of implementing the strategy.
5.  **Best Practices Identification:**  Determination of best practices for configuration and monitoring.
6.  **Gap Analysis:**  Identification of potential weaknesses or areas for improvement.
7.  **Testing Considerations:** Outline of testing strategies to validate the effectiveness of the implemented policies.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Mitigation Strategy

### 2.1 Configuration Parameters

Let's break down each configuration parameter:

*   **`FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` (Global Variable):**
    *   **Purpose:** Specifies the number of consecutive failed login attempts allowed before an account is temporarily locked.
    *   **Data Type:** Integer.
    *   **Default Value:**  Typically 0 (disabled).  This *must* be changed to enable lockout.
    *   **Recommendation:** Set to a low value (e.g., 3-5).  Too low a value can lead to accidental lockouts; too high a value reduces effectiveness against brute-force attacks.
    *   **Implementation:**  Set in `my.cnf` (or equivalent configuration file) under the `[mysqld]` section:
        ```
        [mysqld]
        failed_login_attempts = 4
        ```
        Alternatively, use `SET GLOBAL failed_login_attempts = 4;` (requires `SUPER` privilege and does not persist across restarts unless also set in the configuration file).
    *   **Caveats:**  Applies to *all* users.  Consider using the `user_lock` plugin for per-user settings.

*   **`PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` (Global Variable):**
    *   **Purpose:**  Determines the duration (in seconds or `UNBOUNDED`) for which an account remains locked after exceeding `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`.
    *   **Data Type:** Integer or `UNBOUNDED`.
    *   **Default Value:**  Typically 0 (no lock time). This *must* be changed.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Set to a reasonable value (e.g., 300 seconds (5 minutes), 900 seconds (15 minutes), or 3600 seconds (1 hour)).  `UNBOUNDED` requires manual unlocking.  Balance security with usability.
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```
        [mysqld]
        password_lock_time = 900
        ```
        Or `SET GLOBAL password_lock_time = 900;` (requires `SUPER` privilege).
    *   **Caveats:**  `UNBOUNDED` can lead to denial-of-service if not carefully managed.

*   **`password_history` (Global Variable):**
    *   **Purpose:**  Prevents users from reusing recent passwords.  Stores a specified number of previous passwords.
    *   **Data Type:** Integer.
    *   **Default Value:**  Typically 0 (disabled).
    *   **Recommendation:**  Set to a value that aligns with your organization's password policy (e.g., 5-10).
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```
        [mysqld]
        password_history = 6
        ```
        Or `SET GLOBAL password_history = 6;` (requires `SUPER` privilege).
    *   **Caveats:**  Requires the `validate_password` plugin to be enabled.  The history is stored in the `mysql.password_history` table.

*   **`password_lifetime` (Global Variable):**
    *   **Purpose:**  Forces password expiration after a specified number of days.
    *   **Data Type:** Integer.
    *   **Default Value:**  Typically 0 (disabled).
    *   **Recommendation:**  Set according to your organization's password policy (e.g., 90 days).
    *   **Implementation:**
        ```
        [mysqld]
        password_lifetime = 90
        ```
        Or `SET GLOBAL password_lifetime = 90;` (requires `SUPER` privilege).
    *   **Caveats:**  Users must be notified before their passwords expire to avoid unexpected lockouts.  Consider using a lower value for privileged accounts.

*   **`user_lock` Plugin (Optional):**
    *   **Purpose:**  Provides more granular control over account locking, allowing per-user settings for `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` and `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME`.
    *   **Installation:**  Requires installation and configuration.  See MariaDB documentation for specific instructions.
        ```sql
        INSTALL PLUGIN user_lock SONAME 'user_lock.so';
        ```
    *   **Configuration:**  Uses the `mysql.user_lock` table to store per-user settings.
    *   **Recommendation:**  Highly recommended for environments with varying security requirements for different users (e.g., stricter policies for administrative accounts).
    *   **Caveats:**  Adds complexity to the configuration.  Requires careful management of the `mysql.user_lock` table.

### 2.2 Monitoring

*   **`mysql.user` Table:**  The `account_locked` column indicates whether an account is currently locked (Y/N).
    ```sql
    SELECT user, host, account_locked FROM mysql.user;
    ```

*   **Server Logs:**  MariaDB logs failed login attempts and account lockouts.  The location and format of these logs depend on your server configuration (e.g., error log, general query log).  Regularly review these logs for suspicious activity.  Consider using a log management system for centralized monitoring and alerting.

*   **`mysql.password_history` Table:** This table stores the password history for users, if the `password_history` variable is set and the `validate_password` plugin is enabled.

*   **`mysql.user_lock` Table:** If the `user_lock` plugin is installed, this table stores the per-user lockout settings.

### 2.3 Threat Mitigation

*   **Brute-Force Attacks:**  `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` and `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` directly mitigate brute-force attacks by limiting the number of attempts and imposing a delay.  The `user_lock` plugin enhances this by allowing stricter policies for sensitive accounts.

*   **Credential Stuffing:**  `password_history` prevents the reuse of previously compromised passwords, making credential stuffing less effective.  `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` and `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` also provide protection by limiting the number of attempts.

*   **Account Takeover:**  By mitigating brute-force and credential stuffing attacks, the overall risk of account takeover is significantly reduced.  `password_lifetime` adds another layer of defense by forcing regular password changes.

### 2.4 Impact Assessment

*   **Positive Impacts:**
    *   Enhanced security against common attack vectors.
    *   Improved compliance with security standards and regulations.
    *   Reduced risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.

*   **Negative Impacts:**
    *   Increased administrative overhead (configuration, monitoring).
    *   Potential for accidental user lockouts (if policies are too strict).
    *   Possible user frustration (if password policies are overly complex).

### 2.5 Best Practices

*   **Use the `user_lock` plugin:**  For granular control and per-user settings.
*   **Set reasonable values:**  For `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` and `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` to balance security and usability.
*   **Enforce password history:**  To prevent password reuse.
*   **Implement password expiration:**  With appropriate notification to users.
*   **Regularly monitor logs:**  For suspicious activity and locked accounts.
*   **Document your policies:**  Clearly communicate password and lockout policies to users.
*   **Test your configuration:**  Thoroughly test the implemented policies to ensure they are working as expected.

### 2.6 Gap Analysis

*   **Lack of 2FA/MFA:**  This mitigation strategy does not address the need for multi-factor authentication, which is a critical security control.
*   **No client-side validation:**  Relies solely on server-side enforcement.  Client-side validation can provide immediate feedback to users and reduce server load.
*   **Potential for DoS:**  Misconfiguration (e.g., `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME = UNBOUNDED` without proper monitoring) can lead to denial-of-service.
*   **No integration with SIEM:** The logs should be integrated with a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for centralized monitoring and alerting.

### 2.7 Testing Considerations

*   **Attempt failed logins:**  Test different scenarios with varying numbers of incorrect password attempts.
*   **Verify account lockout:**  Ensure accounts are locked after exceeding the configured limit.
*   **Test password history:**  Attempt to reuse old passwords.
*   **Test password expiration:**  Verify that passwords expire after the configured lifetime.
*   **Test `user_lock` plugin (if used):**  Verify per-user settings are enforced.
*   **Monitor logs:**  Confirm that all relevant events are logged correctly.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing to identify any vulnerabilities in the implementation.

## 3. Conclusion

The "Enforce Robust Account Lockout and Password Policies" mitigation strategy is a crucial component of securing a MariaDB server.  By properly configuring the relevant parameters and utilizing the `user_lock` plugin, administrators can significantly reduce the risk of brute-force attacks, credential stuffing, and account takeover.  However, it's essential to remember that this is just one layer of a comprehensive security strategy.  It should be combined with other security measures, such as 2FA/MFA, network security controls, and regular security audits, to achieve a robust security posture.  Continuous monitoring and testing are vital to ensure the ongoing effectiveness of the implemented policies.
