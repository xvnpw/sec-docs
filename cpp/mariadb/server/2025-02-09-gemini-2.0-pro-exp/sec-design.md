Okay, let's create a design document for the MariaDB server project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

MariaDB is a community-developed, commercially supported fork of MySQL, intended to remain free and open-source software under the GNU General Public License.  It's a widely used relational database management system (RDBMS).

Business Priorities:

*   Provide a robust, reliable, and performant database solution.
*   Maintain compatibility with MySQL (to a reasonable extent, allowing for divergence where improvements can be made).
*   Ensure data integrity and availability.
*   Foster a strong community and ecosystem.
*   Offer commercial support and services for enterprise users.
*   Continuously improve performance, security, and features.

Business Goals:

*   Be a leading open-source RDBMS choice for developers and organizations.
*   Attract and retain a vibrant community of contributors.
*   Grow the adoption of MariaDB in various applications and industries.
*   Generate revenue through commercial offerings to sustain development.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches or data loss incidents affecting users.
*   Severe performance degradation or service unavailability.
*   Loss of community trust or developer engagement.
*   Inability to keep pace with evolving technology and user needs.
*   Legal challenges or licensing issues.
*   Competition from other database systems (both open-source and proprietary).
*   Vulnerabilities that could lead to remote code execution or privilege escalation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Authentication mechanisms (native MariaDB authentication, PAM, LDAP, etc.). Implemented in the server's authentication plugins and core authentication logic.
*   security control: Access control lists (ACLs) and granular permissions (GRANT/REVOKE system). Implemented in the privilege system and SQL parser.
*   security control: Encryption at rest (data file encryption, table encryption). Implemented using various encryption plugins and storage engine-specific features.
*   security control: Encryption in transit (TLS/SSL for client-server communication). Implemented using OpenSSL or yaSSL/wolfSSL libraries.
*   security control: Auditing capabilities (audit plugin). Implemented through a plugin interface that logs various database events.
*   security control: Secure coding practices (to varying degrees). Evident throughout the codebase, but continuous improvement is always needed.
*   security control: Regular security reviews and audits (internal and external). Mentioned in community documentation and release notes.
*   security control: Vulnerability disclosure program. Described on the MariaDB website.
*   security control: Use of security-focused compiler flags and build options. Evident in the build system configuration.
*   security control: Support for secure connections using TLS/SSL. Implemented in client libraries and server-side network handling.
*   security control: Input validation to prevent SQL injection. Implemented in the SQL parser and query execution engine.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Complexity of the codebase, making it challenging to guarantee the absence of all vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries (e.g., OpenSSL), which may introduce their own vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration by users, leading to security weaknesses.
*   accepted risk: The inherent risk of zero-day vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Trade-offs between performance and security (e.g., certain security features may have a performance cost).

Recommended Security Controls (High Priority):

*   Implement a comprehensive fuzzing framework to continuously test for vulnerabilities.
*   Integrate static analysis tools (SAST) into the build process to identify potential security issues early.
*   Enhance dynamic analysis capabilities (DAST) for runtime security testing.
*   Strengthen supply chain security by verifying the integrity of third-party dependencies.
*   Consider adopting a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust) for security-critical components.
*   Improve documentation and guidance on secure configuration and deployment.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support strong password hashing algorithms.
    *   Provide options for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Enforce password complexity policies.
    *   Protect against brute-force attacks.
    *   Integrate with external authentication systems (e.g., Kerberos, OAuth).

*   Authorization:
    *   Implement fine-grained access control at the database, table, column, and row levels.
    *   Support role-based access control (RBAC).
    *   Enforce the principle of least privilege.
    *   Provide mechanisms for auditing access control decisions.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Thoroughly validate all user inputs to prevent SQL injection and other injection attacks.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements consistently.
    *   Implement output encoding to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (in web-based management tools).

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and libraries.
    *   Protect cryptographic keys securely.
    *   Support encryption at rest and in transit.
    *   Implement key rotation mechanisms.
    *   Provide options for hardware security module (HSM) integration.

## BUILD

The MariaDB build process is complex and involves multiple steps, tools, and configurations.  It primarily uses CMake as its build system.

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer[("Developer")]
    SourceCode[("Source Code (GitHub)")]
    CMake[("CMake")]
    Compiler[("Compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)")]
    Linker[("Linker")]
    Linters[("Linters (cpplint, etc.)")]
    SAST[("SAST Tools")]
    Tests[("Unit Tests, Integration Tests")]
    Artifacts[("Build Artifacts (binaries, libraries)")]
    Package[("Package (deb, rpm, tar.gz)")]

    Developer -- "Commits code" --> SourceCode
    SourceCode -- "Build system" --> CMake
    CMake -- "Generates build files" --> Compiler
    Compiler -- "Compiles code" --> Linker
    SourceCode -- "Checks style" --> Linters
    SourceCode -- "Static analysis" --> SAST
    Linker -- "Links object files" --> Artifacts
    Artifacts -- "Runs tests" --> Tests
    Artifacts -- "Creates packages" --> Package
```

Build Process Security Controls:

*   security control: Use of CMake for build configuration, allowing for consistent and reproducible builds.
*   security control: Compilation with security-focused compiler flags (e.g., stack protection, FORTIFY_SOURCE).
*   security control: Integration of linters (e.g., cpplint) to enforce coding style and identify potential issues.
*   security control: Use of static analysis tools (SAST) to detect vulnerabilities in the source code. (This is a recommended control, and its current level of integration should be verified).
*   security control: Extensive unit and integration tests to verify the correctness and security of the code.
*   security control: Build automation using CI/CD systems (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions).  This ensures that builds are performed consistently and that security checks are run automatically.
*   security control: Supply chain security: While not explicitly described in readily available documentation, efforts should be made to verify the integrity of third-party dependencies. This is an area for improvement.
*   security control: Code signing: Release packages are typically signed with a GPG key to ensure authenticity and integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Data storage and retrieval: Ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data.
*   Database replication: Maintaining data consistency and availability across multiple servers.
*   User authentication and authorization: Preventing unauthorized access to the database.
*   Backup and recovery: Ensuring the ability to restore data in case of failure or disaster.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   User data stored in the database: This can range from highly sensitive personal information (PII) to less sensitive application data. Sensitivity depends on the specific use case.
*   Database credentials: Usernames, passwords, and other authentication information. Highly sensitive.
*   Database configuration files: May contain sensitive information such as passwords, encryption keys, and network addresses. Highly sensitive.
*   Audit logs: Contain information about database activity, which may be sensitive depending on the context.
*   Replication logs: Contain data changes, which may be sensitive.
