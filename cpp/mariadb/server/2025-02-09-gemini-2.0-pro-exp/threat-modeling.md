# Threat Model Analysis for mariadb/server

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass via Plugin Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_via_plugin_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a loaded authentication plugin (e.g., a custom PAM module, a flawed implementation of a standard authentication method) to bypass authentication entirely or authenticate as a different user without valid credentials. The attacker might send crafted authentication packets or exploit a buffer overflow in the plugin.
*   **Impact:** Complete database compromise. The attacker gains unauthorized access with potentially full privileges, allowing data theft, modification, or deletion.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication plugins (e.g., `auth_socket`, `mysql_native_password`, PAM plugins, custom plugins).  Specifically, the code within the plugin that handles authentication requests and responses.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use only well-vetted and actively maintained authentication plugins from trusted sources.
    *   Regularly update MariaDB and all installed plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   If using custom plugins, conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing.
    *   Minimize the use of custom authentication plugins if standard, well-tested options are available.
    *   Monitor plugin loading and configuration for unauthorized changes.
    *   Implement strict input validation within custom authentication plugins.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via User-Defined Function (UDF)](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_user-defined_function__udf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a User-Defined Function (UDF) to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the MariaDB server process. This could involve a buffer overflow, format string vulnerability, or other code injection flaw within the UDF.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise. The attacker gains control of the operating system running the MariaDB server, potentially leading to access to other systems on the network.
*   **Affected Component:** User-Defined Functions (UDFs), specifically the compiled code of the UDF. The `mysql.func` table, which stores UDF information, is also relevant.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Disable UDFs if they are not absolutely necessary.
    *   If UDFs are required, use only UDFs from trusted sources and ensure they are thoroughly vetted and regularly updated.
    *   Conduct security audits and penetration testing of any custom UDFs.
    *   Restrict the privileges of the MariaDB server process itself (e.g., run MariaDB as a non-root user).
    *   Use a secure compilation environment for UDFs and implement strong compiler security flags.
    *   Implement file system permissions to prevent unauthorized modification of UDF libraries.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Connection Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_via_connection_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the MariaDB server with connection requests, exceeding the configured maximum number of connections (`max_connections`). This prevents legitimate users from connecting to the database.
*   **Impact:** Database unavailability. Legitimate users cannot access the database, causing service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** The connection handling mechanism within MariaDB (network listener, thread pool). The `max_connections` and `max_user_connections` system variables are directly relevant.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure `max_connections` to a reasonable value based on expected load and server resources.
    *   Configure `max_user_connections` to limit the number of connections per user, preventing a single compromised account from exhausting all connections.
    *   Use a firewall to restrict connections to trusted IP addresses.
    *   Implement connection pooling on the application side to reuse existing connections and reduce the overhead of establishing new connections.
    *   Monitor connection counts and implement alerting for unusual spikes.
    *   Consider using a load balancer to distribute connections across multiple MariaDB servers.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource-Intensive Queries](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource-intensive_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker submits complex, poorly optimized, or intentionally malicious queries that consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, I/O), slowing down or crashing the server. This could involve queries with large joins, full table scans, or complex regular expressions.
*   **Impact:** Database slowdown or unavailability. Legitimate users experience poor performance or are unable to access the database.
*   **Affected Component:** The query optimizer, query executor, storage engine (e.g., InnoDB, MyISAM), and the server's resource management mechanisms. System variables like `max_statement_time`, `innodb_buffer_pool_size`, and `tmp_table_size` are relevant.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query timeouts (`max_statement_time`).
    *   Monitor slow queries using the slow query log and optimize them.
    *   Use appropriate indexes to improve query performance.
    *   Limit the size of temporary tables (`tmp_table_size`, `max_heap_table_size`).
    *   Tune the server's configuration parameters (e.g., buffer pool size, thread cache size) for optimal performance.
    *   Restrict the privileges of database users to prevent them from executing potentially harmful queries (e.g., `SELECT BENCHMARK()`).
    *   Use resource limits (e.g., cgroups on Linux) to constrain the resources available to the MariaDB process.
    *   Consider using a query analysis tool to identify and prevent resource-intensive queries.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Unencrypted Connections](./threats/information_disclosure_via_unencrypted_connections.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker eavesdrops on unencrypted network traffic between a client and the MariaDB server, capturing sensitive data such as usernames, passwords, and query results.
*   **Impact:** Data breach. Sensitive information is exposed to the attacker.
*   **Affected Component:** The network communication layer of MariaDB. The TLS/SSL implementation and configuration are critical.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce TLS/SSL encryption for *all* client connections.
    *   Use strong TLS/SSL ciphers and protocols.
    *   Configure clients to *require* encrypted connections and to verify the server's certificate.
    *   Use a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) for server certificates.
    *   Regularly update MariaDB and OpenSSL (or the TLS library used) to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Disable support for older, insecure TLS/SSL protocols (e.g., SSLv3, TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1).

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering](./threats/configuration_file_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the MariaDB configuration file (e.g., `my.cnf`) and modifies it to weaken security, enable unauthorized access, or alter server behavior.  For example, they might disable TLS, enable `skip-grant-tables`, or change the `bind-address`.
*   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the specific changes made, but can range from minor information disclosure to complete database compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** The MariaDB configuration file (`my.cnf` or similar) and the server's configuration parsing and loading mechanism.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict file system access to the MariaDB configuration file using appropriate permissions.
    *   Implement file integrity monitoring (FIM) to detect unauthorized changes to the configuration file.
    *   Regularly audit the server configuration for unauthorized changes.
    *   Use a configuration management system (e.g., Ansible, Puppet, Chef) to enforce a known-good configuration.
    *   Back up the configuration file to a secure location.
