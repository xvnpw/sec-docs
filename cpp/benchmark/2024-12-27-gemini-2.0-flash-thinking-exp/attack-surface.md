*   **Attack Surface:** Benchmark Name Injection
    *   **Description:**  Malicious actors can inject specially crafted strings as benchmark names if these names are derived from external, untrusted sources.
    *   **How Benchmark Contributes:** The library uses strings to identify and register benchmarks. If this registration process doesn't sanitize input, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a benchmark name from a command-line argument. A user provides `"; rm -rf /"` as the benchmark name, hoping the application might execute this if not properly handled during registration or later processing.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or unexpected application behavior depending on how the benchmark name is used internally.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for benchmark names derived from external sources.
        *   Use allow-lists or regular expressions to enforce valid benchmark name formats.
        *   Avoid directly using externally provided strings in system calls or other sensitive operations related to benchmark registration or execution.

*   **Attack Surface:** Benchmark Argument Injection
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious values as arguments passed to benchmark functions if these arguments originate from untrusted input.
    *   **How Benchmark Contributes:** The library allows passing arguments to benchmark functions. If the source of these arguments is not controlled, it creates an injection point.
    *   **Example:** A benchmark function processes a string argument taken from a configuration file. A malicious user modifies the configuration file to include a very long string, potentially causing a buffer overflow in the benchmarked code.
    *   **Impact:** Vulnerabilities within the benchmarked code itself (e.g., buffer overflows, SQL injection if the benchmarked code interacts with a database), leading to crashes, data corruption, or remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input used as benchmark arguments.
        *   Implement input length limits and type checking.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the benchmarked code, limiting its access to sensitive resources.

*   **Attack Surface:** Custom Reporter Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities can exist in custom benchmark reporters if they are not implemented securely.
    *   **How Benchmark Contributes:** The library allows developers to create custom reporters. If these reporters have flaws, they introduce new attack vectors directly related to the benchmark's output and processing.
    *   **Example:** A custom reporter writes benchmark results to a file using a path derived from user input without proper validation, leading to a path traversal vulnerability where an attacker can overwrite arbitrary files.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, arbitrary file write/overwrite, or other vulnerabilities depending on the reporter's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom reporters.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input used by the reporter.
        *   Avoid performing privileged operations within custom reporters unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   Regularly review and audit custom reporter code for potential vulnerabilities.
