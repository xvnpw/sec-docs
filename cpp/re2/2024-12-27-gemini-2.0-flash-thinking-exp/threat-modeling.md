## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `re2`

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected `re2` Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Resource Exhaustion (CPU)** | An attacker crafts a complex regular expression or provides a very large input string that causes `re2` to consume excessive CPU time during the matching process. This can lead to application slowdown or denial of service. | Application becomes unresponsive or very slow, impacting availability for legitimate users. Server resources are tied up. | `re2::RE2::Match()`, `re2::RE2::FullMatch()`, `re2::RE2::PartialMatch()`, potentially the internal matching engine. | High | - **Input Validation:** Limit the size of input strings processed by `re2`. - **Regex Complexity Limits:** If user-provided regex is allowed, implement mechanisms to assess and limit the complexity of the regex (e.g., based on length, number of quantifiers, nested groups). - **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for regex matching operations to prevent indefinite processing. - **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CPU usage and set alerts for unusual spikes during regex operations. |
| **Logic Errors due to Incorrect Matching** | An attacker exploits a subtle flaw or ambiguity in a poorly designed regular expression used for security-critical checks (e.g., input validation, access control). By crafting specific input, they can bypass the intended validation logic due to `re2`'s interpretation of the pattern. | Security controls are bypassed, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other security breaches. | `re2::RE2::Match()`, `re2::RE2::FullMatch()`, `re2::RE2::PartialMatch()`, the specific regex pattern used by `re2`. | High | - **Thorough Testing:** Rigorously test regex patterns with a wide range of valid and invalid inputs, including edge cases and potential attack vectors. - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design regex patterns to be as specific and restrictive as possible, only allowing what is strictly necessary. - **Code Review:** Have experienced developers review regex patterns used for security-critical checks. - **Static Analysis Tools:** Utilize static analysis tools that can identify potential issues in regex patterns. |
| **Regex Injection** | If the application dynamically constructs regular expressions that are then processed by `re2` based on user-provided input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious regex components to alter the intended matching behavior. This can lead to unexpected matches, resource exhaustion, or even information disclosure. | Bypassing intended matching logic, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities or resource exhaustion within `re2`. | `re2::RE2` constructor or any function where a regex pattern is dynamically built and passed to `re2`. | Critical | - **Avoid Dynamic Regex Construction:** Whenever possible, use pre-defined, static regex patterns. - **Parameterization/Escaping:** If dynamic construction is unavoidable, carefully sanitize and escape user-provided components *before* they are used to build the regex string that is passed to `re2`. Treat user input as literal strings. - **Whitelisting:** If possible, allow users to select from a predefined set of safe regex options instead of providing arbitrary patterns. |
| **Vulnerabilities within `re2` itself** | Although `re2` is a mature and well-audited library, it could potentially contain undiscovered bugs or security vulnerabilities within its code. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist. | Unpredictable behavior, including crashes, unexpected matching behavior by `re2`, or potentially even remote code execution (though less likely with `re2`'s design). | Any component of the `re2` library's codebase. | Critical | - **Keep `re2` Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of the `re2` library to benefit from bug fixes and security patches. - **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about any security advisories related to `re2`. - **Consider Sandboxing:** If the application processes untrusted input using `re2`, consider running the regex matching in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities within `re2`. |
