## Attack Surface: [Malformed VDB File Processing](./attack_surfaces/malformed_vdb_file_processing.md)

*Description:* Processing of intentionally crafted or corrupted `.vdb` files (or other supported formats) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in OpenVDB's parsing and data handling routines.
*How OpenVDB Contributes:* This is *the* core attack vector directly related to OpenVDB. The library's primary function is to read, process, and write VDB files, making its parsing and data handling logic a prime target.
*Example:* A `.vdb` file with an invalid grid dimension that causes a buffer overflow when OpenVDB attempts to allocate memory.  A file with crafted metadata leading to out-of-bounds reads during tree traversal. A file designed to trigger an integer overflow during index calculations.
*Impact:* Arbitrary code execution (most severe), denial of service (DoS), application crashes, potential information disclosure (less likely, but possible).
*Risk Severity:* Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability; buffer overflows leading to RCE are critical).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Comprehensive Input Validation:** Implement *extremely* rigorous validation of *all* data within the VDB file. This is the most important mitigation.  Go beyond basic checks:
        *   **Header Validation:**  Verify magic numbers, version, and all header fields.
        *   **Grid Metadata Validation:**  Strictly validate grid dimensions, transforms, data types, and bounding boxes against predefined, *safe* limits.  Do *not* trust values from the file directly.
        *   **Voxel Data Sanity Checks:**  If feasible, perform basic checks on voxel data (e.g., range checks for floats, known-good value checks where applicable).
        *   **Tree Structure Validation:**  Validate the consistency of the tree structure (parent-child relationships, node types, etc.).
    *   **Aggressive Fuzz Testing:**  Use specialized fuzzing tools designed for file format parsing.  Target OpenVDB's file loading and processing functions specifically.  Generate a *massive* number of malformed inputs.
    *   **Memory Safety Tooling:**  Employ memory safety tools like AddressSanitizer (ASan) and Valgrind during development and testing.  These tools can detect memory errors (buffer overflows, use-after-free, etc.) at runtime.
    *   **Strict Resource Limits:**  Enforce hard limits on file size, grid dimensions, and tree depth.  These limits should be significantly lower than what might seem "reasonable" to account for malicious inflation.
    *   **Sandboxing (Strongly Recommended):**  Isolate OpenVDB file processing within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a separate process with restricted privileges, a container, or a virtual machine). This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve code execution.

## Attack Surface: [API Misuse with Unvalidated User-Controlled Input (Direct OpenVDB Calls)](./attack_surfaces/api_misuse_with_unvalidated_user-controlled_input__direct_openvdb_calls_.md)

*Description:* Vulnerabilities arising from passing unvalidated or improperly sanitized user-supplied data *directly* to OpenVDB API functions that modify or create VDB data structures.
*How OpenVDB Contributes:*  This attack vector directly targets the OpenVDB API.  If the application allows user input to control parameters of API calls that affect memory allocation, data structure creation, or data manipulation, it creates a direct path for exploitation.
*Example:*  An application allows users to specify grid dimensions via a web form, and these dimensions are passed *directly* to `openvdb::Vec3i` and then to `openvdb::FloatGrid::create()`. An attacker could provide extremely large values, causing a massive memory allocation and a denial-of-service.  Another example: user input directly controls a voxel value written via `openvdb::FloatGrid::setAccessor()`, potentially injecting malicious data.
*Impact:* Denial of service (DoS) through resource exhaustion, memory corruption (potentially leading to crashes or, in some cases, code execution), data corruption within the VDB grid.
*Risk Severity:* High (DoS is highly likely; memory corruption leading to RCE is possible, but depends on the specific API call and how it's used).
*Mitigation Strategies:*
    *   **Absolute Input Validation:**  *Never* trust user input.  Implement *extremely* strict validation *before* any data reaches OpenVDB API calls.
        *   **Type Enforcement:**  Ensure data types are correct and cannot be manipulated by the user.
        *   **Range and Value Constraints:**  Enforce *very* strict limits on numerical values (grid dimensions, offsets, voxel values, etc.).  Use whitelisting where possible (allow only known-good values).
        *   **String Sanitization:**  If strings are used (e.g., for metadata), thoroughly sanitize them to prevent any form of injection.
    *   **Indirect API Access (Mandatory):**  *Do not* expose OpenVDB API calls directly to user input.  Create a *secure intermediary layer* that:
        *   Receives user input.
        *   Performs *complete* validation and sanitization.
        *   Transforms the validated input into *safe* OpenVDB API calls.
        *   Handles any errors from OpenVDB gracefully.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application (and especially the part interacting with OpenVDB) runs with the minimum necessary privileges.
