## Threat: [VDB File Parsing Buffer Overflow](./threats/vdb_file_parsing_buffer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious VDB file with oversized data fields or corrupted headers. When the application parses this file using OpenVDB, it attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow. The attacker could potentially overwrite adjacent memory regions to inject and execute arbitrary code, or cause a denial of service by crashing the application.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Data Corruption
    *   **Affected OpenVDB Component:** `VDB File I/O`, specifically the parsing logic within functions responsible for reading grid data from VDB files (e.g., functions in `openvdb/io/File.h`, `openvdb/io/Stream.h`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Validation: Implement robust validation of VDB file headers and data structures before parsing. Check file sizes, grid metadata, and data element counts against expected limits.
        *   Safe Parsing Functions: Utilize OpenVDB API functions that offer bounds checking or safer parsing mechanisms if available.
        *   Fuzz Testing: Conduct extensive fuzz testing of the VDB parsing logic with malformed and oversized VDB files to identify potential buffer overflows.
        *   Memory Sanitization: Employ memory sanitizers (e.g., AddressSanitizer) during development and testing to detect buffer overflows early.
        *   Sandboxing: Isolate the VDB parsing process within a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Threat: [VDB File Parsing Integer Overflow](./threats/vdb_file_parsing_integer_overflow.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious VDB file with extremely large values in fields that are used for size calculations (e.g., grid dimensions, data offsets). When OpenVDB parses this file, these large values could lead to integer overflows during memory allocation or data processing. This can result in allocating smaller-than-expected buffers, leading to buffer overflows later, or incorrect data processing and application crashes.
    *   **Impact:** Buffer Overflow, Denial of Service, Data Corruption, Potential Remote Code Execution
    *   **Affected OpenVDB Component:** `VDB File I/O`, specifically integer arithmetic operations within parsing functions when handling size and offset values from VDB files (e.g., functions in `openvdb/io/File.h`, `openvdb/io/Stream.h`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Input Validation: Validate size and offset values read from VDB files to ensure they are within reasonable and expected ranges. Reject files with excessively large values.
        *   Integer Overflow Checks: Implement explicit checks for integer overflows in critical arithmetic operations during VDB parsing, especially when dealing with size calculations.
        *   Use Larger Integer Types: Where feasible and performance-permitting, use larger integer types (e.g., 64-bit integers) for size calculations to reduce the likelihood of overflows.
        *   Fuzz Testing: Fuzz test the parsing logic with VDB files containing boundary and overflow values in size-related fields.
        *   Safe Integer Arithmetic Libraries: Consider using libraries that provide safe integer arithmetic operations with overflow detection.
