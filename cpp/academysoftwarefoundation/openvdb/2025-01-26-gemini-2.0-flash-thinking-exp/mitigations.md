## Mitigation Strategy: [VDB File Schema Validation](./mitigation_strategies/vdb_file_schema_validation.md)

**Description:**
1.  Define a strict schema for the expected structure of VDB files processed by the application. This schema should specify allowed node types, attributes, data types, and hierarchical organization.
2.  Implement a validation process that parses incoming VDB files and compares their structure against the defined schema. This validation should occur before further processing of the VDB data.
3.  Reject VDB files that do not conform to the schema and log validation failures for security monitoring and debugging.
**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   Malformed VDB File Parsing Errors: Severity: Medium
*   Exploitation of Parser Vulnerabilities through Unexpected File Structure: Severity: High
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex or Deeply Nested VDB Files: Severity: Medium
**Impact:**
*   Malformed VDB File Parsing Errors: High Risk Reduction
*   Exploitation of Parser Vulnerabilities through Unexpected File Structure: High Risk Reduction
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex or Deeply Nested VDB Files: Medium Risk Reduction
