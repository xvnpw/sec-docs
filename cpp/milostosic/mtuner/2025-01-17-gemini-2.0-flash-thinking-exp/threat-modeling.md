# Threat Model Analysis for milostosic/mtuner

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Memory Dumps](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_memory_dumps.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits `mtuner`'s functionality to generate memory dump files, and then gains unauthorized access to these files. This access could be due to insecure default settings within `mtuner` or vulnerabilities in how `mtuner` handles file storage. The attacker analyzes these dumps to extract sensitive information directly captured by `mtuner`.
* **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of credentials (API keys, passwords), personal data, business secrets, intellectual property directly accessible through `mtuner`'s memory snapshots.
* **Affected `mtuner` Component:** Core profiling functionality, specifically the module responsible for creating and saving memory snapshots to disk. This involves functions related to memory reading and file writing within `mtuner`.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Ensure `mtuner`'s configuration mandates encryption for memory dump files at rest.
    * Review and configure `mtuner`'s output directory settings to ensure they are secure by default.
    * If possible, limit the scope of memory captured by `mtuner` to minimize the potential for sensitive data exposure.

## Threat: [Information Leakage through Profiling Logs](./threats/information_leakage_through_profiling_logs.md)

**Description:** `mtuner`'s internal logging mechanisms inadvertently record sensitive data or reveal internal application logic during the profiling process. An attacker gains access to these logs due to insecure storage or access controls related to `mtuner`'s logging output.
* **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of internal application workings and potentially sensitive data directly logged by `mtuner`.
* **Affected `mtuner` Component:** Logging mechanisms within `mtuner` itself, specifically the modules responsible for generating and outputting log messages.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Review `mtuner`'s logging configuration and disable or minimize logging of potentially sensitive information.
    * Ensure `mtuner`'s log files are stored securely with appropriate access controls.
    * Consider patching or modifying `mtuner` (if feasible and necessary) to prevent logging of sensitive data.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion due to Malicious Profiling](./threats/resource_exhaustion_due_to_malicious_profiling.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages an interface (potentially unintended or insecure) to directly trigger `mtuner`'s profiling functionality in an excessive or continuous manner. This directly overloads the server resources used by `mtuner` for profiling.
* **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) or significant performance degradation due to `mtuner` consuming excessive CPU, memory, and I/O resources.
* **Affected `mtuner` Component:** The core profiling initiation and execution mechanisms within `mtuner`. This involves functions that start and manage memory monitoring and data collection within `mtuner`.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * If `mtuner` exposes any direct interface for triggering profiling, ensure it is secured and not publicly accessible.
    * Implement resource limits or safeguards within the application's integration with `mtuner` to prevent runaway profiling.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities within `mtuner` Library](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_within__mtuner__library.md)

**Description:** `mtuner` itself contains security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, format string bugs, or other code execution flaws). An attacker directly exploits these vulnerabilities within the `mtuner` library.
* **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, denial of service by crashing `mtuner` or the application, information disclosure by exploiting memory access vulnerabilities within `mtuner`.
* **Affected `mtuner` Component:** Any module or function within the `mtuner` library containing the exploitable vulnerability.
* **Risk Severity:** Can range from High to Critical depending on the nature and impact of the vulnerability.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Stay updated with the latest versions of `mtuner` to benefit from security patches.
    * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for known issues in `mtuner`.
    * If feasible, perform security audits or code reviews of the `mtuner` library itself.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised `mtuner` Dependency](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised__mtuner__dependency.md)

**Description:** A dependency of the `mtuner` library is compromised, and malicious code is injected into that dependency. This malicious code is then included in the application when `mtuner` is used, effectively making `mtuner` a vector for the attack.
* **Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the server it runs on, data theft, malware installation, all stemming from the compromised dependency pulled in by `mtuner`.
* **Affected `mtuner` Component:** Indirectly affects the entire `mtuner` library and the application using it, as the malicious code is introduced through `mtuner`'s dependencies.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use dependency management tools to track and verify the integrity of `mtuner`'s dependencies.
    * Regularly audit the list of dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
    * Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify potential supply chain risks associated with `mtuner`'s dependencies.
    * Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of downloaded dependencies.
