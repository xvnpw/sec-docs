## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Unprotected mtuner Endpoint [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_unprotected_mtuner_endpoint__critical_.md)

* **Exploit Unprotected mtuner Endpoint [CRITICAL]**
    * Description: mtuner's HTTP endpoint is accessible without authentication or authorization.
    * Attack Scenarios:
        * Access Sensitive Data Exposed by mtuner:
            * View Memory Snapshots Containing Sensitive Information
            * Analyze Performance Data Revealing Business Logic or Secrets
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: Minimal
    * Skill Level: Novice
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data Exposed by mtuner [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data_exposed_by_mtuner__critical_.md)

* **Access Sensitive Data Exposed by mtuner [CRITICAL]**
    * Description: Successful exploitation of the unprotected endpoint allows direct access to sensitive information exposed by mtuner.
    * Attack Scenarios:
        * View Memory Snapshots Containing Sensitive Information: Access raw memory dumps potentially containing credentials, API keys, or other secrets.
        * Analyze Performance Data Revealing Business Logic or Secrets: Infer sensitive algorithms or business rules from performance metrics.
    * Likelihood: Medium (dependent on unprotected endpoint)
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: Minimal
    * Skill Level: Novice
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy (access logs)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Potential Buffer Overflows or Injection Vulnerabilities in Data Parsing [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_potential_buffer_overflows_or_injection_vulnerabilities_in_data_parsing__critical_.md)

* **Exploit Potential Buffer Overflows or Injection Vulnerabilities in Data Parsing [CRITICAL]**
    * Description: Vulnerabilities exist in how mtuner processes incoming profiling requests, allowing for injection or buffer overflows.
    * Attack Scenarios:
        * Remote Code Execution: Inject malicious code that is executed by the server running mtuner.
    * Likelihood: Low (depends on mtuner's code quality)
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: High
    * Skill Level: Advanced
    * Detection Difficulty: Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Configuration of mtuner [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_configuration_of_mtuner__critical_.md)

* **Exploit Insecure Configuration of mtuner [CRITICAL]**
    * Description: mtuner is configured insecurely, allowing unauthorized access or control.
    * Attack Scenarios:
        * Access mtuner Endpoint Due to Weak or Default Credentials (if implemented in future): Gain access using easily guessable credentials.
        * Leverage Insecure Network Configuration Allowing External Access to mtuner: Access the endpoint from the public internet due to misconfigured firewalls or network settings.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Critical
    * Effort: Minimal
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Moderate
