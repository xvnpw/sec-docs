# Attack Surface Analysis for milostosic/mtuner

## Attack Surface: [Profiling Data Exposure via Filesystem](./attack_surfaces/profiling_data_exposure_via_filesystem.md)

**Description:** Sensitive memory profiling data is written to files on the filesystem, potentially accessible to unauthorized users or processes.

**How mtuner Contributes:** `mtuner`'s functionality includes writing profiling data to files (e.g., JSON). The library itself handles the creation and writing of these files.

**Example:** An application using `mtuner` saves profiling data to `/tmp/my_app_profile.json` with default permissions, allowing any local user to read it and potentially glean sensitive information about the application's memory layout and data.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential reverse engineering of application logic, exposure of sensitive data residing in memory.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure File Permissions:** Ensure that the directories and files where `mtuner` saves profiling data have restricted permissions, allowing access only to the application user or specific authorized users/groups.
* **Secure Storage Location:** Store profiling data in secure locations that are not publicly accessible or easily discoverable.
* **Data Encryption:** Encrypt the profiling data at rest if it contains sensitive information.
* **Temporary Files:** Use temporary directories with restricted access and ensure files are deleted after use.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Configuration](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_configuration.md)

**Description:**  If the application allows external input to configure `mtuner`'s output file path without proper sanitization, attackers could write profiling data to arbitrary locations.

**How mtuner Contributes:** `mtuner`'s configuration might allow specifying the output file path. If the application doesn't validate this path, it becomes a vulnerability.

**Example:** An application takes a user-provided filename as input for `mtuner`'s output and uses it directly without validation. An attacker provides `../../../../evil.json` as the filename, potentially overwriting critical system files.

**Impact:** Arbitrary file write, potential system compromise, data corruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided input used to configure `mtuner`, especially file paths.
* **Restrict Output Paths:**  Limit the possible output directories for `mtuner` to a predefined set of safe locations.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the impact of a successful path traversal attack.

## Attack Surface: [Information Leakage in Profiling Data Content](./attack_surfaces/information_leakage_in_profiling_data_content.md)

**Description:**  The profiling data itself might inadvertently contain sensitive information present in the application's memory.

**How mtuner Contributes:** `mtuner` captures snapshots of memory allocation, which could include sensitive data depending on what the application is processing.

**Example:**  An application processes user credentials in memory, and a memory snapshot taken by `mtuner` captures these credentials, which are then written to a profiling file.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (credentials, API keys, personal information, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Data Masking/Redaction:** Implement mechanisms to mask or redact sensitive data in memory before profiling.
* **Secure Memory Handling:** Employ secure coding practices to minimize the presence of sensitive data in memory for extended periods.
* **Targeted Profiling:**  Focus profiling on specific areas of the application's memory rather than taking broad snapshots.
* **Review Profiling Data:** Carefully review profiling data before sharing or storing it to identify and remove any sensitive information.
