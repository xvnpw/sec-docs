# Threat Model Analysis for milostosic/mtuner

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to `mtunergui` Web Interface](./threats/unauthorized_access_to__mtunergui__web_interface.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to `mtunergui` Web Interface

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `mtunergui` web interface, either by guessing weak credentials, exploiting a vulnerability in the web server, or bypassing authentication mechanisms altogether. The attacker then browses the memory profiling data, viewing stack traces, allocation sizes, and other sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information about the application's internal workings, data structures, and potentially sensitive data present in memory. This can be used for reverse engineering, vulnerability discovery, and data exfiltration.
    *   **Affected Component:** `mtunergui` (the web interface component, specifically the HTTP server and data rendering logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication (robust password policies, multi-factor authentication).
        *   Use a dedicated, secure web server configuration (avoid default configurations).
        *   Restrict network access to the interface (firewall, network segmentation, only allow access from localhost or a trusted network).
        *   Disable the web interface when not actively in use.
        *   Regularly audit the web server and `mtunergui` code for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [`mtuner` Data File Exfiltration](./threats/_mtuner__data_file_exfiltration.md)

*   **Threat:** `mtuner` Data File Exfiltration

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized file system access (e.g., through a separate vulnerability, compromised credentials, or misconfigured permissions) and copies the `.dat` or `.mtuner` files to an external location. The attacker then analyzes these files offline.
    *   **Impact:** Complete exposure of the memory allocation data, allowing for detailed analysis of the application's behavior and potential extraction of sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** The data files generated by the `mtuner` instrumentation library (e.g., `.dat`, `.mtuner` files). The specific functions affected are those related to writing and storing these files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store data files in a secure directory with restricted file system permissions (only the application user and `mtuner` analysis user should have access).
        *   Implement file system monitoring and alerting for unauthorized access attempts.
        *   Consider encrypting the data files at rest (though this adds complexity to the analysis workflow).
        *   Regularly review and audit file system permissions.

## Threat: [`mtuner` Data File Corruption/Tampering](./threats/_mtuner__data_file_corruptiontampering.md)

*   **Threat:** `mtuner` Data File Corruption/Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the `mtuner` data files and modifies them. This could involve deleting data, injecting false data, or corrupting the file format. The goal might be to disrupt analysis, hide malicious activity, or potentially trigger vulnerabilities in the analysis tools.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect memory analysis results, potentially masking real memory leaks or performance issues.  May lead to incorrect conclusions about the application's behavior.  In rare cases, crafted malicious data *might* be exploitable, but this is less likely.
    *   **Affected Component:** The data files generated by the `mtuner` instrumentation library (e.g., `.dat`, `.mtuner` files), and the file writing functions within the library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   Use digital signatures or checksums to verify file integrity before analysis.
        *   Restrict write access to the data files to the absolute minimum (ideally, only the instrumented application process).
        *   Regularly back up the data files to a secure location.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in `mtuner` Itself (e.g., `mtunergui`)](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in__mtuner__itself__e_g____mtunergui__.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in `mtuner` Itself (e.g., `mtunergui`)

    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in `mtuner` itself (e.g., a buffer overflow in the data parsing logic of `mtunergui` or a command injection vulnerability in the web interface). The attacker crafts a malicious `.dat` file or sends a specially crafted HTTP request to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server running `mtunergui` or, less likely, on the server running the instrumented application. This could lead to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of `mtuner`, but most likely the `mtunergui` web interface (due to its network exposure) or the data parsing functions within `mtuner` and `mtunergui`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `mtuner` updated to the latest version.
        *   Perform regular security audits and penetration testing of `mtuner`, especially `mtunergui`.
        *   Run `mtunergui` with the least necessary privileges (avoid running as root).
        *   Use a sandboxed environment or container to isolate `mtunergui`.
        *   Implement a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests to `mtunergui`.
