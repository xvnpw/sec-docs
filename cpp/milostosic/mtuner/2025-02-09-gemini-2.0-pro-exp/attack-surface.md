# Attack Surface Analysis for milostosic/mtuner

## Attack Surface: [Memory Operation Interception Errors](./attack_surfaces/memory_operation_interception_errors.md)

*   **Description:**  Bugs in `mtuner`'s core functionality of intercepting and handling memory allocation/deallocation calls (malloc, free, etc.). This is the most critical area.
*   **How `mtuner` Contributes:** `mtuner` *directly* implements this interception; this is its primary function.  Vulnerabilities here are entirely within `mtuner`'s code.
*   **Example:** A double-free vulnerability *within mtuner's* `free` wrapper could lead to memory corruption in the application being profiled.  An integer overflow in `mtuner`'s calculation of allocation sizes could cause an undersized allocation, leading to a heap overflow in the *target* application.  Incorrect pointer arithmetic within `mtuner`'s interception logic.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) of the target application (crash or hang).
    *   Memory corruption within the target application, potentially leading to exploitable vulnerabilities *within the application being profiled*.
    *   Bypass of application-level security mechanisms (e.g., ASLR, heap canaries) *due to mtuner's interference*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review:** Extremely rigorous code review of the interception logic is paramount. Focus on pointer arithmetic, size calculations, error handling, and thread safety (if applicable).
    *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz the target application *while using mtuner*. This is crucial to expose bugs in the interaction between `mtuner` and the application's memory management.  Fuzzing `mtuner` in isolation is less effective.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools specifically designed to detect memory safety issues (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free, double-frees) in C/C++ code.
    *   **Unit Tests:** Create a comprehensive suite of unit tests for `mtuner`'s interception functions.  Cover edge cases, error conditions, and different allocation patterns.
    *   **Address Sanitizer (ASan), Memory Sanitizer (MSan), UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSan):** Compile and run the target application *with* `mtuner` using these sanitizers. They can detect many memory errors at runtime.
    * **Disable in production:** Absolutely do not use mtuner in a production environment.

## Attack Surface: [Internal Data Structure Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/internal_data_structure_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitable flaws in how `mtuner` manages its internal data structures used for tracking memory allocations.  This includes potential buffer overflows, integer overflows, and logic errors in data structure manipulation.
*   **How `mtuner` Contributes:** `mtuner`'s internal data structures are entirely its own responsibility and are implemented within its codebase.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a specific sequence of allocations and deallocations that causes `mtuner`'s internal linked list or hash table to grow excessively, consuming all available memory (an algorithmic complexity attack leading to DoS).  A buffer overflow in a fixed-size buffer used *internally by mtuner* to store allocation metadata.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) of the target application due to resource exhaustion (memory or CPU) caused by `mtuner`.
    *   Potential code execution *within the context of mtuner* (if a buffer overflow is exploitable). This could then be leveraged to further compromise the target application.
    *   Incorrect profiling results, potentially masking real memory issues or creating false positives.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review the code that manages `mtuner`'s internal data structures. Pay close attention to buffer sizes, array indexing, pointer arithmetic, and the handling of dynamically allocated memory.
    *   **Dynamic Memory Allocation with Bounds Checking:** Use dynamic memory allocation for internal data structures, and *always* perform rigorous bounds checking to prevent overflows and underflows.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement hard limits on the maximum size of `mtuner`'s internal data structures to prevent excessive memory consumption.  This mitigates algorithmic complexity attacks.
    *   **Fuzzing:** Fuzz the target application (while using `mtuner`) to try to trigger vulnerabilities in `mtuner`'s internal data structure management.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to identify potential buffer overflows, integer overflows, and other memory safety issues within `mtuner`'s data structure handling code.
    * **Disable in production:** Do not use mtuner in a production environment.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration/Control Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/configurationcontrol_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitable flaws in how `mtuner` is configured or controlled (if such mechanisms exist), leading to unintended behavior or potential code execution.
*   **How `mtuner` Contributes:**  If `mtuner` provides any configuration options (environment variables, config files, API calls), it's responsible for their secure handling.
*   **Example:** An environment variable used to control `mtuner`'s behavior is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands or alter `mtuner`'s operation in a way that compromises the target application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potentially arbitrary code execution (if the configuration allows specifying code to be executed, even indirectly).
    *   Denial of Service.
    *   Modification of `mtuner`'s behavior in unexpected and potentially dangerous ways.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Rigorously validate and sanitize *any* input used to configure `mtuner`, regardless of the source (environment variables, configuration files, API calls).  Assume all input is potentially malicious.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Avoid providing configuration options that could allow arbitrary code execution or excessive control over `mtuner`'s behavior.
    *   **Secure Defaults:**  Use secure default settings for all configuration options.  Do not rely on users to configure `mtuner` securely.
    *   **Documentation:** Clearly document all configuration options and their security implications.
    * **Disable in production:** Do not use mtuner in a production environment.
