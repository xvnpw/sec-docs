# Threat Model Analysis for milostosic/mtuner

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Profiling Output](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_profiling_output.md)

*   **Description:** During memory profiling, `mtuner` might capture and include sensitive data residing in the application's memory within its profiling output (logs, reports, etc.). If this output is not properly secured or reviewed, sensitive user data, API keys, or other confidential information could be exposed to unauthorized parties. This is a direct consequence of `mtuner`'s memory inspection capabilities.
*   **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Data Breach. Leakage of sensitive data can lead to privacy violations, compliance breaches, reputational damage, and potential financial losses. The impact is **High** if the application processes highly sensitive data (PII, financial data, credentials).
*   **Affected mtuner Component:** Data Collection Module, Output/Reporting Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Sanitization:** Implement robust data sanitization or masking techniques within the application *before* memory profiling to prevent sensitive data from being captured by `mtuner`.
    *   **Output Review:**  Mandatory review of all `mtuner` profiling outputs for sensitive data *before* storage or sharing, especially in environments handling sensitive information.
    *   **Restrict Profiling Scope:** Limit profiling to specific code sections or memory regions that are less likely to contain sensitive data.
    *   **Non-Production Environments:** Primarily use `mtuner` in non-production environments with synthetic or anonymized data.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in `mtuner` Leading to Crash or Code Execution](./threats/vulnerability_in__mtuner__leading_to_crash_or_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:**  `mtuner` itself, being a software library, could contain bugs or security vulnerabilities (e.g., memory corruption, buffer overflows, injection flaws). If exploited by an attacker, these vulnerabilities could lead to the profiled application crashing (DoS) or, in more severe cases, allow for arbitrary code execution within the context of the application or the system running `mtuner`. This is a direct risk stemming from the quality and security of the `mtuner` codebase.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service, Code Execution. Application crash leading to unavailability (DoS). Remote Code Execution (RCE) if a critical vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code, potentially leading to full system compromise. The impact is **Critical** if RCE is possible.
*   **Affected mtuner Component:** Core Library, any module with vulnerabilities
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if code execution is possible), High (if only DoS is likely)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep `mtuner` Updated:**  Vigilantly monitor for and apply updates to the `mtuner` library to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits of `mtuner` Integration:** Conduct security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on the application's integration with `mtuner` to identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Static/Dynamic Analysis:** Utilize static and dynamic analysis security tools to scan `mtuner` and the application's code for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Isolate Profiling Environment:** If possible, run `mtuner` in an isolated environment with limited privileges to contain the impact of a potential exploit.

## Threat: [Insufficient Input Validation in `mtuner` Configuration Leading to Code Execution](./threats/insufficient_input_validation_in__mtuner__configuration_leading_to_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** If `mtuner`'s configuration parsing or handling logic lacks proper input validation, an attacker who can control configuration parameters (e.g., through command-line arguments, configuration files, or environment variables if `mtuner` reads them) could inject malicious inputs. This could lead to command injection or other code execution vulnerabilities within `mtuner` itself, which could then impact the profiled application. This is a direct vulnerability in how `mtuner` processes its configuration.
*   **Impact:** Code Execution. Successful injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running `mtuner` and the profiled application, potentially leading to full system compromise. The impact is **Critical** due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected mtuner Component:** Configuration Handling, Input Processing
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for *all* configuration parameters accepted by `mtuner`.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run `mtuner` with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Secure Configuration Practices:** Avoid accepting configuration parameters from untrusted sources. If external configuration is necessary, ensure it is securely managed and validated.
    *   **Code Review of Configuration Handling:** Thoroughly review the `mtuner` code responsible for configuration parsing and handling to identify and fix potential injection vulnerabilities.
