## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via mtuner [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_mtuner__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overall goal. Any successful attack along the paths below leads to compromising the application using mtuner as the attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit mtuner Web Interface Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_mtuner_web_interface_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Targeting vulnerabilities in the web interface of mtuner (if it exists) is a high-risk path because web interfaces are often externally accessible and can provide direct control or access to the application or server.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Weak or Default Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** If mtuner's web interface uses authentication and relies on weak or default credentials, attackers can easily gain unauthorized access.
        *   **Exploitation:** Brute-force attacks, using known default credentials.
    *   **Web UI Code Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** Common web application vulnerabilities within the mtuner's UI code can be exploited to gain control or access sensitive information.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into the web UI to be executed by other users' browsers.
                *   **Types:**
                    *   **Stored XSS [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in database) and executed when other users access the affected page.
                    *   **Reflected XSS [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Malicious script is injected via a crafted URL or input and executed immediately in the user's browser.
            *   **Server-Side Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
                *   **Description:** Injecting malicious code that is executed on the server-side, potentially leading to full server compromise.
                *   **Attack Vectors:**
                    *   **Command Injection [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Injecting system commands into input fields that are then executed by the server.
            *   **Insecure Deserialization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
                *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the web UI deserializes data, potentially leading to remote code execution.
                *   **Exploitation:** Crafting malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
    *   **API Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Description:** If mtuner has a backend API (often used by the web UI), vulnerabilities in the API can be exploited.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **API Injection Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]::** Similar to Server-Side Injection in the UI, but targeting API endpoints.
            *   **API Data Exposure [HIGH RISK PATH]:** API endpoints unintentionally leaking sensitive profiling data without proper authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit mtuner Core Logic/Instrumentation Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_mtuner_core_logicinstrumentation_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the core profiling and instrumentation logic of mtuner itself are high-risk because they directly interact with the application's memory and execution environment.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in mtuner's Profiling/Instrumentation Code [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
        *   **Description:** Bugs in the code responsible for memory profiling and instrumentation can be exploited.
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **Buffer Overflows/Memory Safety Issues [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
                *   **Description:** Exploiting memory corruption vulnerabilities (like buffer overflows) in mtuner's C/C++ code (if applicable) to gain control of execution flow.
            *   **Format String Bugs [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Description:** Exploiting format string vulnerabilities in mtuner's code to leak information or potentially gain code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit mtuner Vulnerabilities in Data Handling/Storage [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_mtuner_vulnerabilities_in_data_handlingstorage__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** How mtuner handles and stores profiling data can introduce vulnerabilities, especially related to information disclosure.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure Storage of Profiling Data [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
        *   **Description:** Storing sensitive profiling data insecurely, making it accessible to unauthorized users.
        *   **Types:**
            *   **Profiling data stored in world-readable files [HIGH RISK PATH]:** File system permissions misconfiguration allowing anyone to read profiling data.
            *   **Profiling data stored without encryption [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Sensitive memory data stored in plaintext, vulnerable to access if storage is compromised.
    *   **Information Leakage via Profiling Data [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
        *   **Description:** Profiling data itself inadvertently revealing sensitive application internals, data structures, or secrets that can be used for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit mtuner Dependencies Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_mtuner_dependencies_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies used by mtuner are a common and high-risk attack vector.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerable Libraries Used by mtuner [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]::**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in libraries that mtuner depends on.
        *   **Types:**
            *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in mtuner's dependencies.
            *   **Outdated Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:** Using older versions of dependencies that contain known vulnerabilities.
