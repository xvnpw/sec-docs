### Key Attack Surface List Involving mtuner (High & Critical)

This list details key attack surfaces that **directly involve** the `mtuner` library and have a **High** or **Critical** risk severity.

* **Unsecured Web Interface Access:**
    * **Description:** The `mtuner` library exposes a web interface for monitoring and controlling the tuning process. If this interface lacks proper authentication and authorization, it becomes a direct entry point for attackers.
    * **How mtuner Contributes:** `mtuner`'s core functionality relies on this web interface for user interaction and configuration. Without security measures, this inherent component becomes a vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An attacker accesses the `mtuner` web interface without logging in and modifies tuning parameters to cause a denial-of-service by excessively consuming resources.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive performance data, manipulation of application behavior, potential denial-of-service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication mechanisms (e.g., username/password, API keys) for accessing the `mtuner` web interface.
        * Enforce role-based access control to restrict actions based on user privileges.
        * Ensure the web interface is not exposed to the public internet without proper network security measures (e.g., firewalls, VPNs).

* **Manipulation of Tuning Parameters via Web Interface:**
    * **Description:**  The `mtuner` web interface allows users to modify various tuning parameters. If input validation is insufficient, attackers can inject malicious values.
    * **How mtuner Contributes:** `mtuner`'s purpose is to allow dynamic adjustment of application parameters. This inherent functionality becomes a risk if not properly secured.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects a negative value for a memory allocation parameter through the `mtuner` interface, potentially causing integer underflow and unexpected behavior or crashes in the target application.
    * **Impact:** Application instability, denial-of-service, potential for exploiting underlying system vulnerabilities through unexpected behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input validation on all tuning parameters accepted through the `mtuner` web interface.
        * Define acceptable ranges and data types for each parameter.
        * Sanitize and escape user inputs to prevent injection attacks.
        * Consider using a separate, more secure channel for critical parameter adjustments.

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in the Web Interface:**
    * **Description:** If the `mtuner` web interface doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied data before displaying it, attackers can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users.
    * **How mtuner Contributes:** The dynamic nature of the `mtuner` interface, displaying performance metrics and potentially user-provided labels, creates opportunities for XSS if not handled carefully within the `mtuner` codebase.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects a malicious JavaScript payload into a performance metric label within the `mtuner` interface. When another user views this metric, the script executes, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
    * **Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement of the web interface, redirection to malicious sites, information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement proper output encoding and escaping for all data displayed on the `mtuner` web interface.
        * Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        * Regularly scan the `mtuner` web interface for XSS vulnerabilities.
