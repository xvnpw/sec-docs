# Threat Model Analysis for milostosic/mtuner

## Threat: [Code Injection through Malicious Configuration](./threats/code_injection_through_malicious_configuration.md)

**Description:** If `mtuner` allows for configuration through external sources (e.g., configuration files, environment variables) without proper validation, an attacker could inject malicious code or commands into these configurations. This code could then be executed by the application or `mtuner` itself.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Handling, potentially Custom Metric Evaluation (if supported).

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly validate and sanitize all configuration parameters used by `mtuner`.
* Avoid allowing external, untrusted sources to directly configure `mtuner`.
* If custom metrics or code execution is supported, implement strong sandboxing or isolation mechanisms.

## Threat: [Path Traversal/File System Access via Configuration](./threats/path_traversalfile_system_access_via_configuration.md)

**Description:** If `mtuner`'s configuration allows specifying file paths (e.g., for log files, output files), an attacker could manipulate these paths to access or overwrite arbitrary files on the server's file system.

**Impact:** Reading sensitive files, overwriting critical system files, or potentially achieving code execution by overwriting executable files.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Handling, Logging Functionality, Output Handling.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict validation of file paths provided in `mtuner`'s configuration.
* Use absolute paths or restrict allowed paths to a specific directory.
* Run the application and `mtuner` with the least necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities within the `mtuner` Library](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_within_the__mtuner__library.md)

**Description:** The `mtuner` library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if they exist in the version being used by the application.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Any part of the `mtuner` library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update the `mtuner` library to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to `mtuner`.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within the Application Context](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_the_application_context.md)

**Description:** If `mtuner` operates with elevated privileges within the application's context, vulnerabilities within `mtuner` could be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities that the attacker would not normally have access to.

**Impact:** Ability to perform actions with higher privileges than intended, potentially leading to data manipulation, system compromise, or other unauthorized activities.

**Affected Component:** Any part of the `mtuner` library if it has access to privileged resources.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the level of privilege and the nature of the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Run the application and `mtuner` with the principle of least privilege. Only grant the necessary permissions.
* Isolate `mtuner`'s functionality if it requires elevated privileges.
