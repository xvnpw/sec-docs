# Attack Surface Analysis for milostosic/mtuner

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Manipulation Vulnerability](./attack_surfaces/configuration_manipulation_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:**  Malicious actors could potentially manipulate the configuration settings of `mtuner` if these settings are loaded from untrusted sources or are not properly protected.
    * **How mtuner Contributes:** `mtuner` relies on configuration to define its behavior, such as logging levels, output destinations, and potentially thresholds for performance monitoring. If this configuration is modifiable by an attacker, they can influence `mtuner`'s operation.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a configuration file used by the application to set `mtuner`'s logging level to maximum and direct the logs to a location they control, potentially leaking sensitive performance data or filling up disk space. Alternatively, they could disable crucial monitoring features to hide malicious activity.
    * **Impact:**  Loss of visibility into application performance, potential resource exhaustion due to excessive logging, information disclosure, and hindering the detection of malicious activities.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Store `mtuner` configuration in secure locations with restricted access permissions. Avoid loading configuration from user-controlled sources without thorough validation. Implement strong input validation and sanitization for any configuration parameters related to `mtuner`. Consider using environment variables or dedicated configuration management tools for secure storage.
        * **Users/Operators:** Ensure the application and its configuration files have appropriate file system permissions. Monitor configuration files for unauthorized changes.

## Attack Surface: [API Abuse (if exposed or indirectly accessible)](./attack_surfaces/api_abuse__if_exposed_or_indirectly_accessible_.md)

* **Description:** If the application exposes any internal APIs or functionalities that directly interact with `mtuner`'s capabilities (even indirectly through wrappers), attackers might exploit these to cause harm.
    * **How mtuner Contributes:** `mtuner` provides functionalities for memory allocation tracking and performance analysis. If the application exposes interfaces to trigger or control these functions without proper authorization and input validation, it can be abused.
    * **Example:** An attacker sends specially crafted requests to an application endpoint that internally uses `mtuner` to track memory allocation. By manipulating parameters, they could force `mtuner` to track an excessive number of allocations, leading to memory exhaustion and a denial-of-service.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for unexpected application behavior or crashes due to manipulated internal state of `mtuner`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for any APIs or internal functions that interact with `mtuner`. Thoroughly validate and sanitize all inputs passed to `mtuner`'s functions. Avoid exposing low-level `mtuner` functionalities directly through public APIs.
        * **Users/Operators:**  Restrict access to application APIs and internal functionalities based on the principle of least privilege. Monitor API usage for suspicious patterns.
