Here are the high and critical threats directly involving RapidJSON:

*   **Threat:** Large Input Size Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a maliciously crafted JSON payload with an extremely large size (e.g., very long strings or a huge number of elements in arrays/objects). RapidJSON attempts to parse this large input, leading to excessive memory consumption.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) due to memory exhaustion, application crash, or significant performance degradation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Parser, Memory Allocator
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the maximum size of the JSON payload accepted by the application.
        *   Consider using streaming parsing if RapidJSON supports it for very large inputs (note: RapidJSON is primarily an in-memory parser).
        *   Monitor memory usage of the application and implement alerts for unusual spikes.

*   **Threat:** Deeply Nested Object/Array Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a JSON payload with an excessive level of nesting in objects or arrays. When RapidJSON parses this, it can lead to stack overflow errors due to the recursive nature of parsing nested structures.
    *   **Impact:** Application crash due to stack overflow.
    *   **Affected Component:** Parser
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement limits on the maximum depth of nesting allowed in the JSON payload.
        *   Consider iterative parsing approaches if feasible (though RapidJSON is primarily recursive).
