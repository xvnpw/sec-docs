# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for zeromq/zeromq4-x

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict High Water Marks (HWM)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_high_water_marks__hwm_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure `ZMQ_SNDHWM` and `ZMQ_RCVHWM` on all sockets.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all ZeroMQ sockets:** Review the codebase and identify every instance where a ZeroMQ socket is created (e.g., `zmq::socket_t`).
    2.  **Determine appropriate HWM values:** For each socket, analyze the expected message rate and size.  Start with a low HWM (e.g., 100-1000 messages) and increase it only if performance testing under *realistic load* shows it's necessary.  Consider different HWMs for different socket types (e.g., lower for REQ/REP, higher for PUB/SUB).
    3.  **Set HWM during socket creation:** Immediately after creating the socket, use the appropriate `setsockopt` calls (or the equivalent in your binding) to set `ZMQ_SNDHWM` (for sending) and `ZMQ_RCVHWM` (for receiving).  Example (C++):
        ```c++
        zmq::socket_t socket(context, ZMQ_PUB);
        int hwm = 1000;
        socket.setsockopt(ZMQ_SNDHWM, &hwm, sizeof(hwm));
        socket.setsockopt(ZMQ_RCVHWM, &hwm, sizeof(hwm));
        ```
    4.  **Monitor HWM usage:** Implement monitoring (if possible with your binding) to track how close the queues are getting to the HWM.  Alert if they consistently approach the limit.
    5.  **Document HWM settings:** Clearly document the chosen HWM values and the rationale behind them.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to unbounded queue growth:** (Severity: High) - Prevents an attacker from flooding the socket with messages, exhausting memory or file descriptors.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** (Severity: Medium) - Limits the resources (memory, file descriptors) consumed by ZeroMQ.
    *   **Application Instability:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents crashes or unexpected behavior caused by excessive queue lengths.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of a successful DoS attack targeting ZeroMQ queues.  Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Substantially reduces resource consumption. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Application Instability:** Improves stability by preventing out-of-memory errors and other queue-related issues. Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Sockets A, B (in `module_x.cpp`): HWM set to 1000.
    *   Socket C (in `module_y.cpp`): HWM *not* set.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Socket C (`module_y.cpp`) needs HWM configuration.
    *   Monitoring of HWM usage is not implemented anywhere.  This needs to be added to the monitoring system.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/use_timeouts.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Employ `ZMQ_SNDTIMEO` and `ZMQ_RCVTIMEO` on all sockets.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all blocking operations:** Locate all calls to `socket.send()` and `socket.recv()` (or their equivalents in your binding).
    2.  **Determine appropriate timeout values:** Based on the expected network latency and processing time, choose reasonable timeout values.  Start with relatively short timeouts (e.g., 1-5 seconds) and adjust based on testing.  Consider different timeouts for different operations.
    3.  **Set timeouts during socket creation:** Use `setsockopt` to set `ZMQ_SNDTIMEO` and `ZMQ_RCVTIMEO`. Example (C++):
        ```c++
        zmq::socket_t socket(context, ZMQ_REQ);
        int timeout = 5000; // 5 seconds in milliseconds
        socket.setsockopt(ZMQ_SNDTIMEO, &timeout, sizeof(timeout));
        socket.setsockopt(ZMQ_RCVTIMEO, &timeout, sizeof(timeout));
        ```
    4.  **Handle timeout errors:** Wrap send/receive calls in try-catch blocks (or use error checking mechanisms provided by your binding) to handle timeout errors (`EAGAIN` or similar).  Implement appropriate error handling logic (e.g., retry, log, alert).
    5.  **Document timeout settings:** Clearly document the chosen timeout values and the rationale.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) due to slow consumers/producers:** (Severity: High) - Prevents a slow or unresponsive peer from blocking the application indefinitely.
    *   **Deadlocks:** (Severity: Medium) - Helps prevent deadlocks caused by blocking operations.
    *   **Application Unresponsiveness:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents the application from becoming unresponsive due to network issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of DoS attacks exploiting slow peers. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Deadlocks:** Reduces the likelihood of deadlocks. Risk reduction: Medium.
    *   **Application Unresponsiveness:** Improves responsiveness by preventing indefinite blocking. Risk reduction: High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No timeouts are currently implemented on any sockets.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeouts need to be implemented on *all* ZeroMQ sockets throughout the application.  This is a critical missing piece.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use CurveZMQ Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/use_curvezmq_encryption.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement CurveZMQ for all communication.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate keypairs:** Generate CurveZMQ keypairs (public and secret keys) for *each* communicating entity (client and server).  Use a secure method for key generation (e.g., `zmq_curve_keypair` or a secure random number generator).
    2.  **Securely store secret keys:** Store secret keys *securely*.  This is *critical*.  Consider using a hardware security module (HSM), encrypted storage, or a key management system.  *Never* store secret keys in the source code.
    3.  **Distribute public keys:** Distribute public keys to the appropriate peers.  The server's public key must be known to the clients, and vice versa.  This can be done through a configuration file, a secure key exchange mechanism, or a trusted third party.
    4.  **Configure sockets for CurveZMQ:**
        *   **Server:** Set `ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER` to 1, `ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY` to the server's public key, and `ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY` to the server's secret key.
        *   **Client:** Set `ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY` to the server's public key, `ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY` to the client's public key, and `ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY` to the client's secret key.
        *   Example (C++ - Server):
            ```c++
            zmq::socket_t socket(context, ZMQ_REP);
            socket.setsockopt(ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER, 1);
            socket.setsockopt(ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY, server_public_key, 32);
            socket.setsockopt(ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY, server_secret_key, 32);
            ```
    5.  **Verify key handling in your binding:** Ensure your ZeroMQ binding correctly handles CurveZMQ and doesn't introduce vulnerabilities.
    6.  **Test thoroughly:** Test the encrypted communication extensively, including error handling and key rotation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from intercepting or modifying messages.
    *   **Eavesdropping:** (Severity: High) - Prevents unauthorized access to message content.
    *   **Data Modification:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from tampering with messages.
    *   **Replay Attacks (with proper nonce/sequence number handling *in your application*):** (Severity: Medium) - CurveZMQ provides encryption, but you need to handle replay prevention at the application level.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **MitM, Eavesdropping, Data Modification:** Eliminates the risk of these attacks if implemented correctly. Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **Replay Attacks:** Reduces the risk, but application-level logic is still required. Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No encryption is currently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CurveZMQ needs to be implemented for *all* ZeroMQ communication. This is the *most critical* missing security feature.  Key management procedures also need to be defined and implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep libzmq Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_libzmq_updated.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of libzmq.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor for updates:** Subscribe to the ZeroMQ mailing list or regularly check the official website for new releases and security advisories.
    2.  **Test updates in a staging environment:** Before deploying updates to production, thoroughly test them in a staging environment that mirrors the production environment.
    3.  **Apply updates promptly:** Once an update is tested and verified, apply it to the production environment as soon as possible.
    4.  **Update bindings:** Ensure that the ZeroMQ binding/wrapper you are using is also updated to be compatible with the new libzmq version.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in libzmq:** (Severity: Variable, potentially High) - Addresses known security vulnerabilities in the underlying ZeroMQ library.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities:** Reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities. Risk reduction: Variable, potentially High, depending on the vulnerability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   The project is currently using libzmq version 4.3.4.
    *   There is no established process for regularly checking for and applying updates.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal process for monitoring, testing, and applying libzmq updates needs to be established.
    *   Check if 4.3.4 is the latest stable version, and update if necessary.
