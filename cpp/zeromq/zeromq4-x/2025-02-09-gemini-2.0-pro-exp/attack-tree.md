## Attack Tree Path: [2. Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/2__information_disclosure.md)

*   **2.1 Eavesdropping (Unencrypted Communication)** [High-Risk Path] [Critical Node]
    *   **Description:** The attacker intercepts ZeroMQ messages transmitted over a network without encryption. This is possible if the application uses plain TCP, IPC, or inproc without enabling ZeroMQ's `curve` security or another encryption mechanism.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   The application uses a ZeroMQ socket type (e.g., `REQ`, `REP`, `PUB`, `SUB`) over an unencrypted transport (e.g., `tcp://`).
        *   The attacker gains access to the network between the communicating parties (e.g., through network sniffing, compromised router, ARP spoofing).
        *   The attacker uses a network analysis tool (e.g., Wireshark, tcpdump) to capture the raw network traffic.
        *   The attacker can read the contents of the ZeroMQ messages, potentially exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if encryption is not used)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete exposure of sensitive data)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (without encryption, eavesdropping is often undetectable)
    *   **Mitigation:**  **Use ZeroMQ's `curve` security mechanism.** This provides authenticated encryption, preventing eavesdropping.  Do *not* rely on plain TCP, IPC, or inproc for sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/3__remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **3.2 Format String Vulnerability** [High-Risk Path]
    *   **Description:** The application uses data received via ZeroMQ in a format string function (e.g., `fmt.Sprintf` in Go, `printf` in C) without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject format string specifiers, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   The application receives data from a ZeroMQ socket.
        *   The application uses this data, without sanitization, as an argument to a format string function.
        *   The attacker crafts a malicious ZeroMQ message containing format string specifiers (e.g., `%x`, `%n`, `%s`).
        *   When the application processes the malicious message, the format string vulnerability is triggered, allowing the attacker to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if input is not properly sanitized) / Low (if the application avoids using unsanitized input in format strings)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (static analysis tools can often detect format string vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation:** **Never** use unsanitized user input (including data received via ZeroMQ) in format string functions. Use safer alternatives or explicitly sanitize the input.

*   **3.3 Deserialization Vulnerability** [High-Risk Path]
    *   **Description:** The application uses an unsafe deserialization method (e.g., `encoding/gob` in Go without type checking, Python's `pickle`) on data received via ZeroMQ. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized data, which, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   The application receives data from a ZeroMQ socket.
        *   The application deserializes this data using an unsafe method.
        *   The attacker crafts a malicious ZeroMQ message containing specially crafted serialized data.
        *   When the application deserializes the malicious message, the deserialization vulnerability is triggered, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (if unsafe deserialization is used) / Low (if secure deserialization is used)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires careful analysis of deserialization logic)
    *   **Mitigation:** **Avoid unsafe deserialization.** If you must deserialize data received via ZeroMQ, use a secure deserialization library or method that performs type checking and whitelisting. Consider using data formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers, which are less prone to deserialization vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Message Manipulation/Spoofing](./attack_tree_paths/4__message_manipulationspoofing.md)

*   **4.1 Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack** [High-Risk Path] [Critical Node]
    *   **Description:** The attacker intercepts and modifies ZeroMQ messages between two communicating parties without their knowledge. This is possible if the communication is not encrypted and authenticated.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   The application uses a ZeroMQ socket over an unencrypted transport.
        *   The attacker gains access to the network between the communicating parties (e.g., through ARP spoofing, DNS poisoning, compromised router).
        *   The attacker intercepts the ZeroMQ messages.
        *   The attacker can modify the messages, inject new messages, or drop messages.
        *   The receiving party is unaware that the messages have been tampered with.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if encryption is not used)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (complete control over communication)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (without encryption, MitM is often undetectable)
    *   **Mitigation:** **Use ZeroMQ's `curve` security mechanism.** This provides authenticated encryption, preventing MitM attacks.

*   **4.3 Message Injection** [High-Risk Path]
    *   **Description:** The attacker injects forged ZeroMQ messages into the communication stream, potentially bypassing authentication or authorization checks.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   The application uses a ZeroMQ socket without authentication.
        *   The attacker gains access to the network or can connect to the ZeroMQ socket.
        *   The attacker crafts and sends forged ZeroMQ messages.
        *   The application processes the forged messages as if they were legitimate, potentially leading to unintended actions or state changes.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if authentication is not used)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the injected message)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if authentication failures are logged)
    *   **Mitigation:** Use the authentication features of ZeroMQ's `curve` security.

*   **4.4 Message Tampering** [High-Risk Path]
    *   **Description:** The attacker modifies the content of legitimate ZeroMQ messages to alter the application's behavior or corrupt data.
    *   **Attack Vector:**
        *   Similar to MitM, but focuses on modifying existing messages rather than injecting new ones. Requires lack of encryption and authentication.
        *   The attacker intercepts a legitimate message.
        *   The attacker modifies the message content.
        *   The attacker forwards the modified message to the recipient.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if encryption/authentication is not used)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High (depends on the tampered message)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (if authentication failures are logged)
    *   **Mitigation:** Use the authentication and encryption features of ZeroMQ's `curve` security.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **1.1 Resource Exhaustion**
    *   **1.1.2 Memory Exhaustion** [High-Risk Path]
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends extremely large messages to the application, consuming excessive memory on the receiving end and potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.
        *   **Attack Vector:**
            * The application does not enforce message size limits using `ZMQ_MAXMSGSIZE`.
            * The attacker connects to a ZeroMQ socket.
            * The attacker sends one or more very large messages.
            * The receiving application attempts to allocate memory for these messages.
            * If the application runs out of memory, it may crash or become unresponsive.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if message size limits are not enforced)
        *   **Impact:** High (application crash, potential for wider system instability)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (memory usage monitoring)
        *   **Mitigation:** Limit maximum message sizes using `ZMQ_MAXMSGSIZE`.
