# Threat Model Analysis for zeromq/zeromq4-x

## Threat: [HWM Overflow DoS](./threats/hwm_overflow_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a continuous stream of messages to a ZeroMQ socket (e.g., PUSH or ROUTER) exceeding the High Water Mark (HWM).  The attacker does not consume messages, or consumes them too slowly.
*   **Impact:** Message loss, memory exhaustion on the sending side, potential application crash (out-of-memory), denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `zmq_setsockopt` (`ZMQ_SNDHWM`, `ZMQ_RCVHWM`), queuing socket types (PUSH, PULL, ROUTER, DEALER, SUB), core queuing mechanism in libzmq.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Set Appropriate HWM:** Use `zmq_setsockopt` to set `ZMQ_SNDHWM` and `ZMQ_RCVHWM` to realistic values.
    *   **Monitor HWM:** Implement monitoring.
    *   **Use ZMQ_CONFLATE (SUB):** For PUB/SUB, use `ZMQ_CONFLATE` on the subscriber.
    *   **Use ZMQ_IMMEDIATE (Sender):** If message loss is acceptable, use `ZMQ_IMMEDIATE` on the sender.
    *   **Backpressure:** Implement a feedback mechanism.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Sender):** Limit sending rate.

## Threat: [Slow Consumer DoS](./threats/slow_consumer_dos.md)

*   **Description:** A legitimate but slow consumer cannot keep up with the message rate, causing a buildup in the sender's queue.
*   **Impact:** Message loss, memory exhaustion (sender), potential crash, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Queuing socket types (PUSH, PULL, ROUTER, DEALER, SUB), `zmq_recv`, libzmq's internal queuing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Optimize Consumer:** Improve consumer performance.
    *   **Asynchronous Processing:** Use asynchronous processing or multiple threads (with careful socket management).
    *   **Backpressure:** Implement a backpressure mechanism.
    *   **Dedicated I/O Thread:** Use a dedicated thread for ZeroMQ I/O.
    *   **Monitor Consumer:** Track message processing rates.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute load among consumers.

## Threat: [Connection Storm DoS](./threats/connection_storm_dos.md)

*   **Description:** Many clients connect/disconnect rapidly, overwhelming the server.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service; server becomes unresponsive.
*   **Affected Component:** `zmq_bind`, `zmq_connect`, connection-oriented socket types (REQ, REP, DEALER, ROUTER), libzmq's connection handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Connection Limits:** Limit concurrent connections.
    *   **Rate Limiting/Throttling:** Implement connection rate limiting.
    *   **Load Balancing:** Distribute connections across servers.
    *   **ZMQ_TCP_KEEPALIVE:** Use keepalives to detect dead connections.

## Threat: [Large Message DoS](./threats/large_message_dos.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends excessively large messages.
*   **Impact:** Memory exhaustion, potential buffer overflows (in libzmq or application), denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** `zmq_msg_init_size`, `zmq_msg_recv`, `zmq_msg_data`, libzmq's message handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Maximum Message Size:** Enforce a maximum message size limit *before* receiving the full message (using `ZMQ_RCVMORE`).
    *   **Validate Message Size:** Validate size before processing.
    *   **Streaming (if applicable):** Process in chunks.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Sensitive Data Transmission](./threats/unencrypted_sensitive_data_transmission.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data is sent over unencrypted ZeroMQ connections (e.g., `tcp://`).
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure; data is compromised.
*   **Affected Component:** `zmq_bind`, `zmq_connect`, transport protocols (`tcp://`, `ipc://` without security), libzmq's transport layer.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **CurveZMQ:** Use the `curve://` transport.
    *   **GSSAPI (less common):** Use `gssapi://` for Kerberos.
    *   **Application-Layer Encryption (less desirable):** Encrypt *before* sending with ZeroMQ.

## Threat: [Message Injection/Spoofing](./threats/message_injectionspoofing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker connects without authorization and sends forged messages.
*   **Impact:** Application processes invalid data, leading to incorrect behavior, data corruption, or potential code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** `zmq_bind`, `zmq_connect`, all socket types, libzmq's connection handling (lack of built-in authentication without CurveZMQ/GSSAPI).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **CurveZMQ:** Use `curve://` for authentication and encryption.
    *   **GSSAPI:** Use `gssapi://` for Kerberos.
    *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** If using a custom mechanism, implement ACLs.
    *   **Message Validation:** Validate messages *in the application* (but this is *defense in depth*, not a primary mitigation for this specific threat).

## Threat: [Improper Threading](./threats/improper_threading.md)

*   **Description:** ZeroMQ sockets are accessed from multiple threads without synchronization.
*   **Impact:** Crashes, undefined behavior, data corruption.
*   **Affected Component:** All ZeroMQ functions, all socket types, libzmq's threading model.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **One Thread Per Socket:** Dedicate one thread to each socket.
    *   **Inproc Transport:** Use `inproc://` for intra-process communication.
    *   **zmq_proxy / zmq_device:** Use these functions for inter-thread communication.
    *   **Thread-Safe Queues:** Use queues to pass messages between threads and a dedicated ZeroMQ I/O thread.

## Threat: [libzmq Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/libzmq_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in libzmq itself.
*   **Impact:** Varies; could be denial of service to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially any part of libzmq.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Updated:** Use the latest stable release and apply updates.
    *   **Monitor Advisories:** Watch for security advisories.
    *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Isolate ZeroMQ components.
