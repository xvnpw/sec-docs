# Attack Surface Analysis for zeromq/zeromq4-x

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) via ZeroMQ Mechanisms](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos___distributed_denial_of_service__ddos__via_zeromq_mechanisms.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers exploit ZeroMQ's queuing and connection handling to overwhelm the application, making it unavailable.
    *   *ZeroMQ Contribution:* ZeroMQ's high-performance design, without proper configuration, makes it susceptible to resource exhaustion through its socket mechanisms.  Specifically, the queuing behavior of `ROUTER`, `DEALER`, `PULL`, and even `PUB` (with slow consumers) can be abused.
    *   *Example:* An attacker floods a `ROUTER` socket with messages, exceeding the HWM and causing memory exhaustion.  Or, numerous rapid connection attempts to a `REP` socket overwhelm the application's ability to accept new connections.
    *   *Impact:* Application unavailability, service disruption.
    *   *Risk Severity:* High to Critical (depending on application criticality).
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Strict HWM Configuration:**  Mandatory, well-defined HWM values for *all* sockets to limit queue sizes.  Values should be determined through testing and monitoring.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Application-Level, leveraging ZeroMQ):** Implement rate limiting *using ZeroMQ's connection events or message metadata* to restrict the number of messages/connections from a single source.
        *   **Message Size Limits (Enforced via ZeroMQ):**  Enforce maximum message sizes *at the ZeroMQ level* (if possible, through filtering or custom socket logic) to prevent memory exhaustion.
        *   **Connection Timeouts (ZeroMQ-Level):** Use ZeroMQ's built-in timeout options for connections and send/receive operations to prevent indefinite blocking.
        *   **Heartbeats (ZeroMQ-Level):** Implement ZeroMQ heartbeats to detect and close dead connections, freeing resources.
        *   **Monitoring (ZeroMQ Metrics):**  Actively monitor ZeroMQ-specific metrics (queue lengths, connection counts) to detect anomalies.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (Unencrypted `tcp://` Transport)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks__unencrypted__tcp__transport_.md)

*   *Description:* Attackers intercept and potentially modify communication when unencrypted `tcp://` transport is used.
    *   *ZeroMQ Contribution:* ZeroMQ's `tcp://` transport, *by itself*, provides no encryption.  This is a direct and inherent risk of using this transport without additional security measures.
    *   *Example:* An attacker uses a network sniffer to capture sensitive data transmitted over an unencrypted `tcp://` connection.
    *   *Impact:* Data breach, unauthorized access, potential for message modification.
    *   *Risk Severity:* Critical (if sensitive data is transmitted).
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Mandatory CurveZMQ:**  *Strictly enforce* the use of CurveZMQ for *all* `tcp://` connections.  Disallow unencrypted `tcp://` communication entirely.
        *   **Secure Key Management:**  Implement robust key generation, storage, and distribution procedures.  This is crucial for CurveZMQ's effectiveness.

## Attack Surface: [ZeroMQ Library Vulnerabilities (CVEs)](./attack_surfaces/zeromq_library_vulnerabilities__cves_.md)

*   *Description:* Exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVEs) directly within the `zeromq4-x` library code.
    *   *ZeroMQ Contribution:* This is a direct vulnerability of the library itself.
    *   *Example:* An attacker exploits a known buffer overflow vulnerability in a specific version of `zeromq4-x` to gain code execution.
    *   *Impact:* Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, data breaches.
    *   *Risk Severity:* Critical to High (depending on the specific CVE).
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Continuous Updates:**  Maintain a strict policy of updating `zeromq4-x` and its dependencies to the *latest* patched versions immediately upon release.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning (Dependency Analysis):**  Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify and track vulnerabilities in `zeromq4-x` and its dependencies.
        *   **Security Advisory Monitoring:**  Actively monitor security advisories and mailing lists related to ZeroMQ.
