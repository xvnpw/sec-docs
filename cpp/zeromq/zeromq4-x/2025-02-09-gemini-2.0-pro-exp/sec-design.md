# BUSINESS POSTURE

ZeroMQ (Ã˜MQ) is a high-performance asynchronous messaging library, aimed at use in distributed or concurrent applications. It provides a message queue, but unlike message-oriented middleware, a ZeroMQ system can run without a dedicated message broker. The library is designed to be as small, simple, and fast as possible.

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a high-performance, scalable, and reliable messaging library.
*   Minimize latency and maximize throughput for message delivery.
*   Offer a simple and easy-to-use API for developers.
*   Support a wide range of messaging patterns (e.g., PUB-SUB, REQ-REP, PUSH-PULL).
*   Maintain cross-platform compatibility.
*   Ensure the long-term maintainability and stability of the library.
*   Foster a vibrant community around the project.

Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to data breaches, denial-of-service attacks, or other malicious exploits in applications using ZeroMQ.
*   Performance bottlenecks or instability in the library could negatively impact the performance and reliability of applications relying on it.
*   Lack of adoption or a decline in community interest could lead to the project becoming obsolete.
*   Inadequate documentation or support could hinder developer adoption and usage.
*   Compatibility issues with different operating systems or programming languages could limit the library's reach.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project uses fuzzing (AddressSanitizer, LeakSanitizer, MemorySanitizer, UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer, libFuzzer) to identify potential security vulnerabilities. Described in `fuzzing/README.md`.
*   security control: The project uses static analysis tools (Clang Static Analyzer, Cppcheck, Coverity Scan) to identify potential security vulnerabilities. Described in `build-aux/scan-build`.
*   security control: The project has coding style guidelines and uses linters to enforce them, reducing the likelihood of common coding errors. Described in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
*   security control: The project uses encrypted communication (CurveZMQ) for secure message exchange. Described in `src/curve*.hpp` and `src/curve*.cpp`.
*   security control: The project provides authentication mechanisms (CurveZMQ, GSSAPI). Described in `src/mechanism.hpp` and related files.
*   security control: The project has a documented security policy and vulnerability reporting process. Described in `SECURITY.md`.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library itself does not handle all aspects of application-level security. Developers are responsible for implementing appropriate security measures in their applications that use ZeroMQ.
*   accepted risk: While CurveZMQ provides encryption and authentication, it relies on the correct configuration and key management by the user. Misconfiguration can lead to security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: The GSSAPI mechanism depends on the underlying GSSAPI implementation and its configuration, which may have its own security considerations and potential vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement regular dynamic security testing (DAST) to complement the existing fuzzing efforts.
*   security control: Integrate a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   security control: Conduct periodic security code reviews, focusing on critical components and security-sensitive areas.
*   security control: Provide more comprehensive security documentation and best practices guides for developers using ZeroMQ.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The library MUST support strong authentication mechanisms to verify the identity of connecting clients and servers.
    *   The library SHOULD support pluggable authentication mechanisms to allow for integration with different authentication systems.
    *   The default authentication mechanism (NULL) MUST be clearly documented as insecure and suitable only for trusted environments.
*   Authorization:
    *   The library SHOULD provide mechanisms for controlling access to resources (e.g., topics, queues) based on the authenticated identity.
    *   Access control policies SHOULD be configurable and granular.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library MUST validate all inputs received from the network or user applications to prevent injection attacks and other vulnerabilities.
    *   Validation SHOULD include checks for data type, length, format, and allowed values.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The library MUST use strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms and protocols for encryption and authentication (e.g., CurveZMQ).
    *   Key management MUST be secure and follow best practices.
    *   The library SHOULD provide options for configuring cryptographic parameters (e.g., cipher suites, key lengths).

## DEPLOYMENT

ZeroMQ is a library, and its deployment is tied to the deployment of the applications that use it. There isn't a single "ZeroMQ deployment" in the traditional sense. However, we can describe how applications using ZeroMQ might be deployed.

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  Statically linked library: The ZeroMQ library is compiled and linked directly into the application executable.
2.  Dynamically linked library: The ZeroMQ library is compiled as a shared library (e.g., .so, .dll) and loaded by the application at runtime.
3.  Containerized deployment: The application and the ZeroMQ library (either statically or dynamically linked) are packaged within a container (e.g., Docker).
4.  Cloud deployment: The application (and ZeroMQ) are deployed to a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) using virtual machines, containers, or serverless functions.

Chosen Deployment Solution (Example: Containerized Deployment):

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Deployment Environment (e.g., Kubernetes Cluster)"
        subgraph "Node 1"
            App1Container[("Application 1 Container")]
            ZMQ1[("ZeroMQ (within App1)")]
        end
        subgraph "Node 2"
            App2Container[("Application 2 Container")]
            ZMQ2[("ZeroMQ (within App2)")]
        end
        Network[("Network")]

        App1Container -- "Network" --> App2Container
        App1Container --> ZMQ1
        App2Container --> ZMQ2
    end

*   security control: Fuzzing: Fuzzing is used to test the library with a wide range of inputs, helping to discover vulnerabilities that might be missed by traditional testing.
*   security control: Unit Tests: Comprehensive unit tests are run to ensure the correctness and stability of the library.
*   security control: Compiler Warnings: The build process is configured to treat compiler warnings as errors, ensuring that potential issues are addressed.
*   security control: Continuous Integration: The project uses continuous integration (GitHub Actions, Travis CI, AppVeyor) to automatically build and test the code on every commit, ensuring that changes do not introduce regressions or security vulnerabilities.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Reliable message delivery between applications.
*   High-performance and low-latency communication.
*   Scalability to handle a large number of connections and messages.

Data Sensitivity:

*   The ZeroMQ library itself does not handle persistent data storage. However, the messages it transmits may contain sensitive data, depending on the application using it.
*   Data sensitivity levels will vary greatly depending on the specific use case. Examples include:
    *   Plaintext messages: Low sensitivity (unless the content itself is sensitive).
    *   Encrypted messages (CurveZMQ): Higher sensitivity, as the confidentiality of the data depends on the security of the encryption keys.
    *   Personally Identifiable Information (PII): High sensitivity, requiring strict protection under regulations like GDPR.
    *   Financial transactions: High sensitivity, requiring strong security and auditability.
    *   Control messages for critical infrastructure: Very high sensitivity, requiring the highest levels of security and reliability.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that apply to applications using ZeroMQ in particular use cases?
*   What are the expected message sizes and volumes for typical applications using ZeroMQ?
*   What are the specific threat models for the most common use cases of ZeroMQ?
*   What level of support is provided for integrating ZeroMQ with existing security infrastructure (e.g., SIEM systems, intrusion detection systems)?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: It is assumed that users of the ZeroMQ library are responsible for implementing appropriate security measures within their own applications.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: It is assumed that the default NULL authentication mechanism is only used in trusted environments.
*   DESIGN: It is assumed that applications using ZeroMQ will be designed and deployed in a secure manner, following best practices for network security and application security.
