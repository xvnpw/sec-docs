# Threat Model Analysis for zeromq/zeromq4-x

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Connection](./threats/unauthenticated_connection.md)

**Description:** An attacker connects to a ZeroMQ socket without providing any credentials. This allows them to send arbitrary messages, potentially disrupting communication, injecting malicious data, or causing denial of service.

**Impact:** The application might process unauthorized commands, leading to data corruption, system compromise, or denial of service for legitimate users.

**Affected Component:** Unencrypted Socket (when CurveZMQ is not used or improperly configured).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement CurveZMQ authentication with strong key generation and management. Ensure all connecting peers are properly authenticated before processing messages. Restrict socket access to trusted networks or processes.

## Threat: [Message Tampering](./threats/message_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts messages in transit and modifies their content before they reach the intended recipient. This can lead to the application processing incorrect data or executing malicious commands.

**Impact:** Data integrity is compromised, potentially leading to incorrect application behavior, financial loss, or security breaches.

**Affected Component:** Unencrypted Messages (when CurveZMQ encryption is not used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Enable CurveZMQ encryption for all sensitive communication.

## Threat: [Eavesdropping / Information Disclosure](./threats/eavesdropping__information_disclosure.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts and reads messages transmitted over the ZeroMQ network. This allows them to gain access to sensitive information being exchanged between application components.

**Impact:** Confidential data is exposed, potentially leading to privacy violations, intellectual property theft, or further attacks.

**Affected Component:** Unencrypted Messages (when CurveZMQ encryption is not used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Always use CurveZMQ encryption for all communication. Ensure secure storage and management of CurveZMQ secret keys.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_message_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a large volume of messages to a ZeroMQ socket, overwhelming the receiving application and making it unresponsive or crash.

**Impact:** The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users, disrupting services and potentially causing financial loss or reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Receiving Socket (especially PUSH or PUB sockets without proper flow control).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on message reception within the application or using network infrastructure. Set appropriate high-water marks (HWM) on sockets to limit queue sizes.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in `libzmq`](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in__libzmq_.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the underlying `libzmq` library to execute arbitrary code, gain unauthorized access, or cause denial of service.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.

**Affected Component:** The `libzmq` library itself.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:** Keep the `libzmq` library updated to the latest stable version with security patches.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of CurveZMQ Keys](./threats/insecure_storage_of_curvezmq_keys.md)

**Description:** If CurveZMQ is used, but the secret keys are stored insecurely (e.g., in plaintext in configuration files), an attacker who gains access to the system can steal these keys and impersonate legitimate peers or decrypt communication.

**Impact:** Compromise of the authentication and encryption mechanisms, leading to potential spoofing, tampering, and information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** CurveZMQ Security Context and Key Management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Store CurveZMQ secret keys securely using operating system key stores, hardware security modules, or encrypted configuration files. Implement proper access controls to key storage locations.

## Threat: [Exposure of Internal Communication](./threats/exposure_of_internal_communication.md)

**Description:** If ZeroMQ sockets intended for internal communication are bound to network interfaces accessible from outside the trusted network without proper access controls, external attackers can eavesdrop or inject messages.

**Impact:** Information disclosure or unauthorized control of internal application components.

**Affected Component:** Socket Binding Configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:** Bind internal ZeroMQ sockets to loopback interfaces (127.0.0.1) or specific internal network interfaces. Use firewalls to restrict access to ZeroMQ ports.
