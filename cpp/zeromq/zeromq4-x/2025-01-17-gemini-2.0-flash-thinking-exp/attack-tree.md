## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malicious Payload [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_payload__critical_.md)

**Target Specific Vulnerability in Application Logic (Processing Received Messages) [CRITICAL]:** An attacker crafts a message containing data specifically designed to exploit a flaw in how the application processes incoming messages. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
    **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Applicable) [CRITICAL]:** If the application deserializes message data, an attacker can send a specially crafted serialized object that, upon deserialization, executes malicious code or causes other harmful effects.
    **Trigger Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption in Application (Due to Message Size/Content) [CRITICAL]:**  An attacker sends messages with excessively large sizes or specific content that causes the application to write beyond allocated memory buffers, potentially leading to crashes, arbitrary code execution, or other unpredictable behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Messages](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_messages.md)

**Exploit Lack of Authentication/Authorization:**  Without proper authentication or authorization, an attacker can send arbitrary messages to the application, impersonating legitimate senders or introducing malicious commands or data.
    **Exploit Insecure Binding Configuration (e.g., binding to a public interface without authentication):** If the ZeroMQ socket is bound to a publicly accessible interface without authentication, anyone on the network can connect and send messages, potentially bypassing intended security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Spoof Messages](./attack_tree_paths/spoof_messages.md)

**Exploit Lack of Sender Verification:**  If the application doesn't verify the identity of the message sender, an attacker can forge messages appearing to come from trusted sources, potentially manipulating application logic or deceiving users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Connection Establishment [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_connection_establishment__critical_.md)

**Man-in-the-Middle Attack (If Using Unencrypted Transports) [CRITICAL]:** If communication is not encrypted (e.g., using plain TCP), an attacker can intercept the connection between the application components and eavesdrop on or manipulate the exchanged messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Large Volume of Messages](./attack_tree_paths/send_large_volume_of_messages.md)

**Overwhelm Message Queues:** An attacker floods the application with a large number of messages, exceeding the capacity of its message queues and potentially leading to delays, crashes, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Extremely Large Messages](./attack_tree_paths/send_extremely_large_messages.md)

**Slow Down Processing:** Sending very large messages can consume significant processing resources, slowing down the application and potentially making it unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit TCP Vulnerabilities (If Using TCP Transport) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tcp_vulnerabilities__if_using_tcp_transport___critical_.md)

**Other TCP Protocol Exploits [CRITICAL]:** Attackers can exploit inherent vulnerabilities in the TCP protocol itself (beyond SYN floods), potentially leading to denial of service or other network-level attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit IPC/Inproc Vulnerabilities (If Using These Transports) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ipcinproc_vulnerabilities__if_using_these_transports___critical_.md)

**Race Conditions in Shared Memory (IPC) [CRITICAL]:** When using Inter-Process Communication (IPC) with shared memory, attackers can exploit race conditions to manipulate data or gain unauthorized access if proper synchronization mechanisms are not in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use Insecure Default Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/use_insecure_default_configurations.md)

**Rely on Default Security Settings (e.g., no authentication):**  If developers rely on default ZeroMQ configurations without explicitly enabling security features like authentication, the application becomes vulnerable to unauthorized access and message manipulation.
