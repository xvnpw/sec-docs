# Threat Model Analysis for zeromq/zeromq4-x

## Threat: [Message Eavesdropping](./threats/message_eavesdropping.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between ZeroMQ endpoints to read sensitive data being transmitted. This is possible because ZeroMQ, by default, does not encrypt messages. The attacker can passively sniff network packets.

**Impact:** Loss of confidentiality. Sensitive information exchanged between application components is exposed to the attacker.

**Affected Component:** Unencrypted TCP transport (when used).

**Risk Severity:** Critical (if sensitive data is transmitted without encryption).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize ZeroMQ's built-in CurveZMQ security mechanism for encryption and authentication.
* Use secure transport protocols like TLS/SSL if tunneling ZeroMQ over other protocols.

## Threat: [Message Tampering](./threats/message_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts messages in transit and modifies their content before forwarding them to the intended recipient. This is possible because ZeroMQ, by default, does not enforce message integrity. This could involve altering data, commands, or control signals.

**Impact:** Loss of data integrity. The receiving application processes incorrect or malicious data, leading to unexpected behavior, data corruption, or security breaches.

**Affected Component:** Unprotected message transmission over any transport.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize ZeroMQ's built-in CurveZMQ security mechanism for message integrity checks.
* Implement message signing or MAC (Message Authentication Code) verification at the application level.
* Use secure transport protocols that provide integrity checks.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Message Injection](./threats/unauthorized_message_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to a ZeroMQ socket and sends malicious or unauthorized messages to application components. This is possible because ZeroMQ, by default, does not enforce authentication. This could involve sending commands, injecting false data, or disrupting the application's logic.

**Impact:** Loss of system integrity and availability. The application may perform unintended actions, process incorrect data, or become unstable.

**Affected Component:** Sockets without authentication mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize ZeroMQ's built-in CurveZMQ security mechanism for peer authentication.
* Implement application-level authentication and authorization to verify the sender of messages.
* Restrict access to socket endpoints using network firewalls or operating system-level access controls.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Socket Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_socket_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker establishes a large number of connections to a ZeroMQ socket, exhausting the available resources (e.g., file descriptors, memory) within the ZeroMQ library and the operating system, preventing legitimate connections.

**Impact:** The application becomes unavailable to legitimate users or components due to ZeroMQ's inability to handle new connections.

**Affected Component:** Socket connection handling within `libzmq`.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement connection limits on the receiving socket.
* Implement rate limiting on incoming connections.
* Configure appropriate operating system limits for open files and connections.

## Threat: [Request Forgery](./threats/request_forgery.md)

**Description:** In a REQ/REP pattern, an attacker sends requests impersonating a legitimate client. This is possible if the responder doesn't verify the requester's identity at the ZeroMQ level or application level. This can trigger unintended actions on the responder.

**Impact:** The responder performs actions on behalf of an unauthorized entity, potentially leading to data manipulation or security breaches.

**Affected Component:** REQ socket and responder's interaction with the ZeroMQ library.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement authentication and authorization for requesters, ideally using ZeroMQ's CurveZMQ.
* Ensure the responder validates the identity of the requester before processing the request.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `libzmq` or its Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__libzmq__or_its_dependencies.md)

**Description:** ZeroMQ relies on the underlying `libzmq` library and its dependencies. Exploitable vulnerabilities within `libzmq` itself (e.g., buffer overflows, use-after-free) could be directly triggered by malicious input or actions through the ZeroMQ API.

**Impact:**  The application becomes vulnerable to exploits potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, crashes, or information disclosure.

**Affected Component:** The underlying `libzmq` library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the vulnerability in `libzmq`, but can be Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay up-to-date with the latest stable releases of `libzmq` and its dependencies.
* Monitor security advisories for `libzmq` and apply patches promptly.
