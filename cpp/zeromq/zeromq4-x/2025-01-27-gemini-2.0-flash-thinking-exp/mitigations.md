# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for zeromq/zeromq4-x

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement End-to-End Encryption using CURVE](./mitigation_strategies/implement_end-to-end_encryption_using_curve.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Generate CurveZMQ key pairs for each communicating peer using `zmq_curve_keypair()`.
    *   Step 2: Securely exchange public keys between authorized peers out-of-band.
    *   Step 3: Configure ZeroMQ sockets with `ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER` on the server side and `ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY`, `ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY`, and `ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY` on the client side.
    *   Step 4: Manage keys securely, including storage and rotation.
    *   Step 5: Verify encrypted communication by testing message exchange.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping (High Severity): Interception of data in transit.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (High Severity): Interception and manipulation of communication.
    *   Data Tampering (High Severity): Alteration of messages in transit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping: High Risk Reduction - CURVE encryption makes decryption infeasible without private keys.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks: High Risk Reduction - CURVE authentication prevents unauthorized connection establishment.
    *   Data Tampering: High Risk Reduction - Encryption ensures message integrity.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, for backend microservices and message queue communication. Keys managed in secrets system.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Not fully implemented for external client communication, which currently uses application-layer TLS instead of ZeroMQ CURVE.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configure Resource Limits (High Water Marks)](./mitigation_strategies/configure_resource_limits__high_water_marks_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Analyze message flow and rates for each ZeroMQ socket type.
    *   Step 2: Set `ZMQ_RCVHWM` for receiver sockets (PULL, SUB) to limit queued messages in memory.
    *   Step 3: Set `ZMQ_SNDHWM` for sender sockets (PUSH, PUB) to control messages queued for sending.
    *   Step 4: Choose HWM values based on memory, message size, and acceptable message loss.
    *   Step 5: Monitor message loss and adjust HWM values as needed.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Memory Exhaustion (High Severity): Unbounded message queues leading to memory overload.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): Memory exhaustion contributing to DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Memory Exhaustion: High Risk Reduction - HWM prevents uncontrolled memory growth from message backlog.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium Risk Reduction - Prevents DoS caused by memory depletion.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `ZMQ_RCVHWM` configured for some backend receiver sockets, but inconsistently. `ZMQ_SNDHWM` less frequently used.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Consistent `ZMQ_RCVHWM` and `ZMQ_SNDHWM` configuration across all relevant sockets. Dynamic adjustment of HWM based on load is missing.
