# Attack Tree Analysis for zeromq/libzmq

Objective: To achieve *at least one* of the following, by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations in the libzmq implementation or its usage within the application:

1.  **Denial of Service (DoS):** Render the application, or a significant part of it, unavailable to legitimate users.
2.  **Information Disclosure:** Gain unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted or processed by the application via ZeroMQ.
3.  **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Execute arbitrary code on the server or client machines running the application.
4.  **Message Manipulation/Spoofing:** Alter, inject, or replay messages, leading to incorrect application behavior or unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/1__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **1.1.3 Slow Consumer [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** A consumer application or component that processes messages from a ZeroMQ socket is unable to keep up with the rate of incoming messages. This causes the sender's queue (or potentially intermediary queues) to fill up, eventually blocking the sender and preventing further message processing. This can be caused by legitimate high load, inefficient consumer code, or a deliberate DoS attack targeting the consumer.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (application unavailability)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires monitoring of queue lengths and consumer performance)
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize consumer performance, use asynchronous processing, implement backpressure mechanisms, monitor queue lengths, and set appropriate HWMs.

*   **1.3 Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:**  The attacker identifies and exploits a publicly known vulnerability (documented with a CVE identifier) in the specific version of libzmq used by the application.  This could be a buffer overflow, integer overflow, or other type of flaw that allows the attacker to cause a denial of service.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if regularly updated), Medium-High (if not updated)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (potential RCE, data breach, DoS)
    *   **Effort:** Medium-High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced-Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep libzmq updated to the latest version, use vulnerability scanners, and subscribe to security advisories.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Information Disclosure](./attack_tree_paths/2__information_disclosure.md)

*   **2.1 Unencrypted Communication (insecure transport) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** The application uses the `tcp://` transport without any encryption (like TLS or CurveZMQ).  This allows an attacker with network access to passively eavesdrop on the communication and read all transmitted data.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if CurveZMQ is not used and the network is untrusted)
    *   **Impact:** High (sensitive data exposed)
    *   **Effort:** Low (passive eavesdropping)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires network traffic analysis, attacker may be silent)
    *   **Mitigation:** *Always* use CurveZMQ (or another secure transport mechanism) for sensitive data.  Never use `tcp://` without encryption.

*   **2.2.1 No Authentication [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** CurveZMQ (or another authentication mechanism) is not enabled, meaning any client can connect to the ZeroMQ socket and potentially send or receive messages.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if security is overlooked)
    *   **Impact:** High (unauthorized access)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (requires auditing of configuration and access logs)
    *   **Mitigation:** Enable CurveZMQ and require authentication for all connections.

*   **2.2.3 Improper Key Management [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:**  CurveZMQ keys are stored insecurely, such as hardcoded in the application source code, stored in a publicly accessible location, or committed to version control.  This allows an attacker who gains access to the codebase or the storage location to obtain the keys and impersonate legitimate clients or servers.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (common security mistake)
    *   **Impact:** High (unauthorized access)
    *   **Effort:** Low (if keys are easily accessible)
    *   **Skill Level:** Novice
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires code review or configuration audits)
    *   **Mitigation:** Store keys securely using a key management system, environment variables, or other secure storage mechanisms.  Never hardcode keys or store them in version control.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/3__remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **3.1 Buffer Overflow in libzmq [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in libzmq's message parsing or handling code. This typically involves sending a specially crafted message that overwrites memory beyond the allocated buffer, potentially allowing the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if regularly updated), Medium-High (if not updated)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep libzmq updated.

*   **3.2 Integer Overflow in libzmq [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** Similar to a buffer overflow, but the attacker exploits an integer overflow vulnerability.  This involves providing input that causes an integer variable to wrap around, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially memory corruption, which can then be exploited for code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (if regularly updated), Medium-High (if not updated)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** High
    *   **Skill Level:** Expert
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Keep libzmq updated.

*   **3.3 Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if applicable) [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** If the application uses ZeroMQ to transmit serialized objects (e.g., using Python's `pickle` or similar), and the deserialization process is not properly secured, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized object that, when deserialized, executes arbitrary code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (if untrusted data is deserialized), Low (if not)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Medium-High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoid deserializing untrusted data. If necessary, use a safe deserialization library and validate data *before* deserialization.

*   **3.4 Exploiting Application Logic Errors (via Message Manipulation) [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Description:** The attacker sends crafted messages that, due to flaws in the application's logic for handling ZeroMQ messages, trigger unintended code execution. This is *not* a vulnerability in libzmq itself, but rather in how the application uses it.  For example, if the application uses a message to construct a system command without proper sanitization, the attacker could inject malicious commands.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (depends on application complexity and security practices)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (full system compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Medium-High
    *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly review and test the application's message handling logic. Implement strict input validation and avoid using message data directly in security-sensitive operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Message Manipulation/Spoofing](./attack_tree_paths/4__message_manipulationspoofing.md)

*   **4.1 Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack (without CurveZMQ) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** If encryption and authentication are not used (i.e., no CurveZMQ), an attacker positioned between the client and server can intercept, read, and modify messages in transit.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if CurveZMQ is not used and the network is untrusted)
    *   **Impact:** High (data modification, unauthorized actions)
    *   **Effort:** Low-Medium (requires network access)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Use CurveZMQ (or TLS) to encrypt and authenticate communication.

*   **4.3 Message Injection (without authentication) [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Description:** Without authentication, an attacker can connect to the ZeroMQ socket and inject arbitrary messages into the communication stream.  The impact depends on how the application handles these messages.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (if CurveZMQ is not used)
    *   **Impact:** High (depends on the content and handling of injected messages)
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
    *   **Mitigation:** Use CurveZMQ for authentication and integrity.
