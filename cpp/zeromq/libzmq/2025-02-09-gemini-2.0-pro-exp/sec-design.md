# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a high-performance, asynchronous messaging library.
*   Offer a flexible and versatile messaging system that supports various messaging patterns (e.g., PUB-SUB, REQ-REP, PUSH-PULL).
*   Ensure cross-platform compatibility and support multiple programming languages.
*   Maintain a stable and reliable core library.
*   Foster a vibrant open-source community and encourage contributions.
*   Minimize external dependencies to reduce complexity and potential vulnerabilities.
*   Provide comprehensive documentation and examples.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the library that could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*   Instability or performance issues that could disrupt applications relying on the library.
*   Lack of adoption due to complexity or poor documentation.
*   Inability to keep up with evolving messaging needs and technologies.
*   Loss of community support or key contributors.
*   Supply chain attacks targeting the library or its dependencies.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code reviews: The GitHub repository indicates a collaborative development process with pull requests, suggesting code reviews are performed.
*   security control: Community involvement: An active open-source community can help identify and address security issues.
*   security control: Fuzz testing: The project mentions fuzzing, which is a technique for finding vulnerabilities by providing invalid or unexpected inputs.
*   security control: Static analysis: The project uses static analysis tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: AddressSanitizer (ASan): ASan is used to detect memory errors.
*   security control: Continuous Integration (CI): CI pipelines are used to automate testing and building.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library's core functionality relies on low-level networking and memory management, which inherently carries some risk.
*   accepted risk: The library supports a wide range of platforms and configurations, increasing the attack surface.
*   accepted risk: The library is written in C++, which is known for potential memory safety issues if not handled carefully.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive security policy and vulnerability disclosure program.
*   security control: Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing.
*   security control: Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to track and manage dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Use a memory-safe language (e.g., Rust) for security-critical components, if feasible.
*   security control: Implement sandboxing or containerization to isolate the library from the host system.
*   security control: Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for users of the library.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The library itself does not handle application-level authentication. It's the responsibility of applications using libzmq to implement appropriate authentication mechanisms. However, libzmq does support CURVE security, based on CurveZMQ protocol.
*   Authorization:
    *   Similar to authentication, libzmq does not implement application-level authorization. Applications must manage their own authorization logic.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library should validate inputs to its API to prevent buffer overflows, format string vulnerabilities, and other common issues. Fuzz testing is crucial here.
    *   Applications using libzmq must also perform their own input validation on messages received from the network.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The library should use strong, well-vetted cryptographic algorithms for any security-sensitive operations (e.g., encryption, authentication with CURVE).
    *   The library supports encryption and authentication using the CURVE security mechanism (CurveZMQ protocol). This should be clearly documented and recommended for secure communication.
    *   Key management is a critical aspect of cryptography. The library should provide secure mechanisms for generating, storing, and exchanging keys, or clearly document how users should handle key management.

## DEPLOYMENT

libzmq is a library, so deployment typically involves linking it into an application.  There are several deployment scenarios:

1.  **Static Linking:** The libzmq code is compiled directly into the application executable.
2.  **Dynamic Linking:** The application links against a shared library (e.g., .so, .dll) at runtime.
3.  **Embedded Systems:** libzmq can be cross-compiled and deployed on embedded devices.
4.  **Containers:** Applications using libzmq can be deployed within containers (e.g., Docker).

We'll describe dynamic linking on a Linux system, as it's a common scenario.

## BUILD

The build process for libzmq typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Developer:** A developer writes code and commits it to the Git repository.
2.  **Continuous Integration (CI):** A CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Travis CI) triggers a build on each commit.
3.  **Configuration:** The build system configures the build environment (e.g., using CMake).
4.  **Compilation:** The source code is compiled into object files.
5.  **Linking:** The object files are linked together to create the libzmq library (either static or shared).
6.  **Testing:** Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests, fuzz tests) are run.
7.  **Static Analysis:** Static analysis tools (e.g., Coverity, clang-tidy) are run to identify potential code quality and security issues.
8.  **Artifact Creation:** The build artifacts (e.g., libzmq.so, libzmq.a) are created.
9.  **Artifact Storage:** The build artifacts may be stored in a repository (e.g., GitHub Releases, a package manager repository).

```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   security control: **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automates the build and testing process, ensuring consistency and repeatability.
*   security control: **Static Analysis:** Identifies potential vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
*   security control: **Fuzz Testing:** Helps discover vulnerabilities by providing invalid or unexpected inputs.
*   security control: **Dependency Management:** Tracking and managing dependencies to identify and mitigate known vulnerabilities.  (This should be improved with SCA).
*   security control: **Secure Build Environment:** The CI environment should be secured to prevent unauthorized access and tampering.
*   security control: **Code Signing:**  Signing the build artifacts can help ensure their integrity and authenticity (though not explicitly mentioned in the provided information, it's a recommended practice).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   Reliable and efficient message delivery between application components.
*   The integrity and confidentiality of messages (if encryption is used).
*   The availability of the messaging system.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   The content of messages: Sensitivity depends on the application using libzmq. Messages could contain sensitive data (e.g., personal information, financial data, trade secrets) or non-sensitive data.
*   Metadata about messages (e.g., source, destination, timing): Could be sensitive in some contexts, potentially revealing information about communication patterns.
*   Configuration data for libzmq: Could contain sensitive information like keys or credentials if not managed securely.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS
