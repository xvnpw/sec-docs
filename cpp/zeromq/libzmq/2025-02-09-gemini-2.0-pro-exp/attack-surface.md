# Attack Surface Analysis for zeromq/libzmq

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated/Unencrypted Communication](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticatedunencrypted_communication.md)

*   **Description:** Data transmitted via ZeroMQ sockets without authentication or encryption is vulnerable to interception and manipulation.
*   **How libzmq Contributes:** ZeroMQ provides transport mechanisms (TCP, IPC, etc.) but doesn't enforce security by default.  It offers CURVE and ZAP, but their implementation is the application's responsibility.  The *lack* of built-in, mandatory security is the direct contribution.
*   **Example:** An attacker sniffs network traffic on a TCP connection used by a ZeroMQ PUB/SUB pattern, capturing sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, data tampering, man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if sensitive data is involved), High (otherwise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement CURVE encryption and authentication for all sensitive communication. Use ZAP for custom authentication if needed.  *Do not* rely on transport-layer security alone (e.g., TLS) *instead* of CURVE, as this doesn't address ZeroMQ-specific identity issues.
    *   **Users:**  Cannot directly mitigate libzmq's lack of default security; rely on application developers to implement proper security.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection/Message Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_connectionmessage_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the application by sending a large number of connection requests or messages, exhausting resources.
*   **How libzmq Contributes:** ZeroMQ's high-performance design, and the behavior of certain socket types (especially `REQ/REP`), make it susceptible to DoS if the application doesn't implement its own safeguards. libzmq *provides* the mechanisms that *can be* abused, even if it doesn't *cause* the DoS directly. The lack of built-in rate limiting or throttling is a key factor.
*   **Example:** An attacker opens numerous `REQ` connections to a `REP` socket and sends slow requests, blocking legitimate clients.  Or, flooding a `PUB` socket overwhelms subscribers.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, application crash.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use `ZMQ_RCVTIMEO` and `ZMQ_SNDTIMEO` for timeouts. Use `ZMQ_HWM` cautiously (potential message loss). Choose appropriate socket types (e.g., `ROUTER/DEALER` over `REQ/REP` for better resilience). Implement application-level rate limiting and backpressure.
    *   **Users:** Cannot directly mitigate; rely on application developers.

## Attack Surface: [Identity Spoofing (Especially with ROUTER/DEALER)](./attack_surfaces/identity_spoofing__especially_with_routerdealer_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker impersonates a legitimate client or server.
*   **How libzmq Contributes:** The `ROUTER` socket uses identities for routing.  Without authentication (provided by CURVE or ZAP, which are part of libzmq but not enforced), these identities are easily forged.  This is a direct consequence of how `ROUTER` is designed to function.
*   **Example:** An attacker connects to a `ROUTER` and sends messages with a forged identity, pretending to be a trusted client.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** *Must* implement CURVE or ZAP for authentication.  Verify identities before processing or forwarding messages.
    *   **Users:** Cannot directly mitigate; rely on application developers.

## Attack Surface: [Buffer Overflow/Memory Corruption in Message Handling (Indirect, but libzmq's Role is Important)](./attack_surfaces/buffer_overflowmemory_corruption_in_message_handling__indirect__but_libzmq's_role_is_important_.md)

*    **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how the application handles ZeroMQ messages.
*    **How libzmq Contributes:** While the vulnerability is *in the application code*, libzmq's role is that it delivers messages as raw byte streams.  It does *not* perform any validation or sanitization.  This places the *entire* burden of safe message handling on the application. This is an indirect but crucial contribution.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a crafted message that exploits a buffer overflow in the application's parsing of ZeroMQ messages.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, application crash, data corruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Validate message size *before* processing. Use safe string/memory handling. Employ a robust message format (e.g., Protobuf) and parsing library. Use memory safety tools (ASan, Valgrind). This is *entirely* the developer's responsibility, given libzmq's design.
    *   **Users:** Cannot directly mitigate; rely on application developers.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of libzmq Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_libzmq_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within the `libzmq` library itself.
*   **How libzmq Contributes:** This is a direct vulnerability *within* the library.
*   **Example:** A discovered vulnerability in `libzmq` allows remote code execution via a crafted message.
*   **Impact:** Varies (DoS, information disclosure, code execution).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Keep `libzmq` updated. Monitor security advisories. Use SCA tools.
    *   **Users:** Ensure applications (and thus, embedded `libzmq` versions) are updated regularly.
