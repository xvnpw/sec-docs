# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for zeromq/libzmq

## Mitigation Strategy: [CURVE Authentication and Encryption](./mitigation_strategies/curve_authentication_and_encryption.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Key Pair Generation:** For each communicating peer (server and client), generate a CURVE key pair using `zmq_curve_keypair()`. This will produce a public key and a secret key.
    2.  **Secure Key Distribution:** Securely distribute the *server's public key* to all authorized clients.  This distribution must happen out-of-band and securely. Keep secret keys private and secure.
    3.  **Server-Side Configuration:** On the server-side `libzmq` socket:
        *   Set the `ZMQ_CURVE_SERVER` option to `1` to enable CURVE server mode.
        *   Set the `ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY` option to the server's public key.
        *   Set the `ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY` option to the server's secret key.
    4.  **Client-Side Configuration:** On the client-side `libzmq` socket:
        *   Set the `ZMQ_CURVE_SERVERKEY` option to the *server's public key*.
        *   Set the `ZMQ_CURVE_PUBLICKEY` option to the client's public key.
        *   Set the `ZMQ_CURVE_SECRETKEY` option to the client's secret key.
    5.  **Socket Binding/Connecting:** Proceed with binding (server) and connecting (client) the `libzmq` sockets. `libzmq` handles CURVE handshake and encryption.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping/Data Confidentiality Breach (High Severity)
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity)
    *   Unauthorized Access (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping/Data Confidentiality Breach: High reduction
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: High reduction
    *   Unauthorized Access: Medium reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, for inter-service communication between backend services within the internal network.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  N/A - Fully implemented in the backend services communication module.

## Mitigation Strategy: [PLAIN Authentication with TLS/SSL for TCP Transports](./mitigation_strategies/plain_authentication_with_tlsssl_for_tcp_transports.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Enable TLS/SSL:** Configure TLS/SSL for the TCP transport layer *used by `libzmq`*. This is configured when setting up the TCP connection that `libzmq` uses.
    2.  **Configure PLAIN Authentication:** On both server and client `libzmq` sockets:
        *   Set the `ZMQ_PLAIN_USERNAME` option.
        *   Set the `ZMQ_PLAIN_PASSWORD` option.
    3.  **Socket Binding/Connecting over TCP:** Use `tcp://` transport with TLS/SSL enabled.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Eavesdropping/Data Confidentiality Breach (High Severity)
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity)
    *   Weak Authentication (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Eavesdropping/Data Confidentiality Breach: High reduction
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: High reduction
    *   Weak Authentication: Medium reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, PLAIN authentication is considered for legacy systems. TLS/SSL for TCP is generally enabled for external facing services.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  PLAIN authentication is not currently implemented. TLS/SSL for TCP needs consistent application for TCP-based `libzmq` communications.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Appropriate Socket Options for Queues and Buffers](./mitigation_strategies/set_appropriate_socket_options_for_queues_and_buffers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand High-Water Marks (HWM):**  Learn about `ZMQ_SNDHWM` and `ZMQ_RCVHWM` socket options.
    2.  **Set Appropriate HWM Values:** Set `ZMQ_SNDHWM` and `ZMQ_RCVHWM` based on application needs and memory constraints.
    3.  **Choose HWM Policy:** Decide on `ZMQ_DROP` or `ZMQ_BLOCK` policy when HWM is reached.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks (Medium Severity)
    *   Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks: Medium reduction
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** Default `libzmq` HWM settings are used in most places. Custom HWM settings are not consistently reviewed for security.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need to review and configure `ZMQ_SNDHWM` and `ZMQ_RCVHWM` options for all `libzmq` sockets, especially for DoS-sensitive scenarios, and consider `ZMQ_DROP` policy for receive sockets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep `libzmq` Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep__libzmq__updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Check for Updates:**  Periodically check for new `libzmq` releases.
    2.  **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories for `libzmq`.
    3.  **Apply Updates Promptly:** Apply updates to `libzmq` in application and deployment environments quickly.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High Severity)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: High reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**  `libzmq` is updated periodically, but the process is not fully automated and might lag.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Need a more proactive and automated process for monitoring and applying `libzmq` updates.
