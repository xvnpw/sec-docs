# Threat Model Analysis for zeromq/libzmq

## Threat: [Unencrypted Communication (TCP)](./threats/unencrypted_communication__tcp_.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between communicating parties using the `tcp://` transport without encryption (CurveZMQ). This allows them to read the content of messages being exchanged, potentially including sensitive data like credentials, application data, or control commands.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive information, potential for further attacks based on intercepted data.

**Affected libzmq Component:** `zmq_socket` when using the `ZMQ_STREAM`, `ZMQ_PAIR`, `ZMQ_REQ`, `ZMQ_REP`, `ZMQ_PUB`, `ZMQ_SUB`, `ZMQ_PUSH`, or `ZMQ_PULL` socket types with the `tcp://` transport.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Mandatory Encryption:** Always enable CurveZMQ encryption for TCP transports using `zmq_curve_serverkey()` and `zmq_curve_publickey()` on the server and client respectively.
* **Secure Key Management:** Implement a secure method for generating, storing, and distributing CurveZMQ key pairs.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Connection Exhaustion (TCP)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_connection_exhaustion__tcp_.md)

**Description:** An attacker rapidly establishes a large number of TCP connections to a `libzmq` socket without properly closing them or sending valid data. This can exhaust server resources (file descriptors, memory), preventing legitimate clients from connecting or causing the application to crash.

**Impact:** Service disruption, unavailability of the application.

**Affected libzmq Component:** `zmq_socket` when using `ZMQ_STREAM`, `ZMQ_PAIR`, `ZMQ_REP`, or `ZMQ_PUB` socket types listening on a `tcp://` endpoint.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Connection Limits:** Implement limits on the number of concurrent connections the application accepts.
* **Timeouts:** Set appropriate timeouts for socket operations to prevent resources from being held indefinitely.
* **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor system resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors) to detect potential DoS attacks.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on incoming connections or messages.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Large Messages](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_large_messages.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends excessively large messages to a `libzmq` socket, potentially overwhelming the receiver's memory or processing capabilities, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of Service, application slowdown or crash.

**Affected libzmq Component:** `zmq_msg_recv()` and the memory management associated with receiving messages.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Message Size Limits:** Implement a maximum message size limit on the receiving end. This can be done by checking the size of the received message before further processing.
* **Flow Control:** Implement flow control mechanisms to prevent senders from overwhelming receivers.

## Threat: [Insecure Socket Options](./threats/insecure_socket_options.md)

**Description:** Developers or administrators configure `libzmq` socket options in a way that weakens security. For example, disabling security features or using insecure default settings.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific option, could lead to information disclosure, DoS, or other vulnerabilities.

**Affected libzmq Component:** `zmq_setsockopt()` and the specific socket options being set.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Security Best Practices:** Follow security best practices when configuring socket options. Consult the `libzmq` documentation for security recommendations.
* **Regular Review:** Regularly review socket option configurations to ensure they align with security requirements.

## Threat: [Socket Hijacking (IPC/Inproc)](./threats/socket_hijacking__ipcinproc_.md)

**Description:** When using the `ipc://` or `inproc://` transports, an attacker with sufficient privileges on the local system could potentially connect to the socket and inject or eavesdrop on messages intended for other processes.

**Impact:** Spoofing, information disclosure, unauthorized control over communicating processes.

**Affected libzmq Component:** `zmq_socket` when using `ZMQ_STREAM`, `ZMQ_PAIR`, `ZMQ_REQ`, `ZMQ_REP`, `ZMQ_PUB`, or `ZMQ_SUB` socket types with the `ipc://` or `inproc://` transport.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Restrict File System Permissions (IPC):** For `ipc://` transports, set restrictive file system permissions on the socket file to limit access to authorized processes.
* **Operating System Security:** Rely on the operating system's security mechanisms to isolate processes and prevent unauthorized access.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in libzmq Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_libzmq_itself.md)

**Description:** Like any software, `libzmq` may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.

**Impact:** Potentially any of the above, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Could lead to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Affected libzmq Component:** Any part of the `libzmq` library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep libzmq Updated:** Regularly update `libzmq` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists related to `libzmq` to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Incorrect Usage of libzmq API](./threats/incorrect_usage_of_libzmq_api.md)

**Description:** Developers might misuse the `libzmq` API in ways that introduce security vulnerabilities. This could include improper error handling, incorrect socket option settings, or flawed logic in message handling.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific misuse, could lead to information disclosure, DoS, or other vulnerabilities.

**Affected libzmq Component:** Various parts of the `libzmq` API depending on the specific error.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer Training:** Provide thorough training for developers on secure `libzmq` usage and best practices.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential security flaws in how `libzmq` is being used.

## Threat: [Socket Starvation](./threats/socket_starvation.md)

**Description:** An attacker intentionally creates a large number of sockets without properly closing them. This can exhaust system resources like file descriptors, preventing the application from creating new sockets or accepting new connections.

**Impact:** Denial of Service, inability to establish new communication channels.

**Affected libzmq Component:** `zmq_socket()` and the underlying operating system's resource management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Resource Limits:** Implement limits on the number of sockets the application can create.
* **Timeouts:** Set timeouts for socket creation and connection attempts.
* **Proper Socket Management:** Ensure the application properly closes sockets when they are no longer needed.

## Threat: [Message Queue Saturation](./threats/message_queue_saturation.md)

**Description:** An attacker floods a receiving `libzmq` socket with messages faster than the application can process them. This can lead to the message queue growing indefinitely, consuming excessive memory and potentially causing the application to crash or become unresponsive.

**Impact:** Denial of Service, memory exhaustion, application slowdown or crash.

**Affected libzmq Component:** The internal message queues associated with `zmq_socket`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Flow Control:** Implement flow control mechanisms to signal to senders when the receiver is overloaded.
* **Message Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on incoming messages.
* **Appropriate Queue Sizes:** Configure appropriate maximum queue sizes using socket options (e.g., `ZMQ_RCVHWM` for receive high-water mark).
