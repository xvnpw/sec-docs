*   **Typo Tolerance:**  Utilizes algorithms to handle misspellings and variations in search terms effectively.
*   **Comprehensive Search Features:** Supports faceted search, filtering, sorting, geosearch, synonyms, and custom ranking.
*   **Scalability and High Availability:** Achieved through a distributed cluster architecture with data replication and automatic failover.
*   **RESTful API:** Provides a clean and well-documented RESTful API for all operations.
*   **Configuration and Management:** Offers tools and APIs for easy configuration, schema management, and cluster monitoring.

## 3. System Architecture

Typesense employs a distributed, masterless architecture for high availability and horizontal scalability. Each node in the cluster is capable of handling both read and write operations.

**Diagram Description:**

*   **Client Application:** Any application (web, mobile, backend service) that interacts with Typesense via the REST API.
*   **Typesense Cluster:** A set of interconnected Typesense nodes working collaboratively.
*   **API Server (Node):**  The primary interface for client requests. Each node runs an API server, handling authentication, authorization, request routing, and coordination within the cluster. It's stateless and can be scaled horizontally.
*   **Query Engine:** Processes search queries, retrieves data from the Data Store, ranks results based on relevance, and applies filters, facets, and sorting. Optimized for low latency.
*   **Indexing Engine:** Responsible for indexing documents. It receives data from the API Server, processes it according to the schema, and stores it in the Data Store in an optimized format for searching.
*   **Data Store (RocksDB):**  Persistent storage for indexed data. Typesense leverages RocksDB for its performance, efficiency, and embedded nature. Data is partitioned and replicated across nodes.
*   **Cluster Manager (Gossip):**  Manages cluster membership, node discovery, failure detection, and configuration propagation using a gossip protocol. This ensures resilience and decentralization.
*   **Inter-Node Communication (gRPC):** Typesense uses gRPC for efficient and fast communication between nodes within the cluster for tasks like data replication, query distribution, and cluster management.

## 4. Component Descriptions

### 4.1. API Server (Node)

    *   **Request Parsing & Validation:** Parses incoming HTTP requests, validates input data against defined schemas, and handles errors.
    *   **Authentication & Authorization:** Enforces access control using API keys. Future enhancements might include OAuth 2.0 or other authentication methods. Authorization is role-based, controlling access to collections and operations.
    *   **Request Routing & Load Balancing:** Routes requests to the appropriate internal components (Query Engine, Indexing Engine, Cluster Manager) within the node. In a clustered setup, it participates in load balancing by handling requests and distributing queries across shards.
    *   **Response Formatting:** Formats responses in JSON and returns them to the client.
*   **Technology:** C++, using HTTP server libraries (e.g., Boost.Asio, or a dedicated HTTP framework), and potentially gRPC for internal communication.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **API Key Management:** Secure generation, storage, and revocation of API keys. Protection against brute-force attacks on API keys.
    *   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Rigorous validation of all API requests to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection is not directly applicable due to RocksDB, but NoSQL injection or command injection could be relevant). Sanitization of data before indexing to prevent stored XSS.

## 9. Assumptions and Constraints

*   **Assumption:** API Server is the sole entry point for external client interactions.
*   **Assumption:** RocksDB is the primary and only persistent data store used for indexes and data.
*   **Assumption:** Cluster management relies on a gossip-based protocol for node discovery and state synchronization.
*   **Constraint:** Performance (low latency, high throughput) is a paramount design consideration, influencing security implementation choices. Security measures must be implemented without significantly degrading performance.
*   **Constraint:** Developer-friendliness and ease of use are key design goals, which may influence default security configurations and the complexity of security setup. Security should be easy to configure and manage without being overly burdensome for developers.
*   **Constraint:** Open-source nature implies transparency and community scrutiny, but also potential for publicly known vulnerabilities if not addressed promptly.

## 10. Next Steps

This design document provides a comprehensive overview of Typesense architecture and security considerations. The immediate next step is to conduct a thorough **Threat Modeling** exercise based on this document. This will involve:

*   **Asset Identification:**  Clearly identify all valuable assets within the Typesense system (data, API keys, cluster configuration, etc.).
*   **Threat Identification:**  Brainstorm and document potential threats targeting each asset, considering various attack vectors (network attacks, application-level attacks, insider threats, etc.).
*   **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Analyze the system design and implementation to identify potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by identified threats.
*   **Risk Assessment:**  Assess the likelihood and impact of each threat exploiting identified vulnerabilities to determine the overall risk level.
*   **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Develop and document mitigation strategies and security controls to address identified risks and vulnerabilities. Prioritize mitigations based on risk level and feasibility.

This document will be a living document and will be updated as the threat modeling process progresses, new information becomes available, and the Typesense project evolves. Subsequent versions will incorporate findings from threat modeling and detail specific security controls and mitigations implemented.
