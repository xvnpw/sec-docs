# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Key Management with Principle of Least Privilege (Typesense)](./mitigation_strategies/api_key_management_with_principle_of_least_privilege__typesense_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify API Access Needs:** Determine which application components require access to the Typesense API and what level of access they need (e.g., search only, indexing, admin).
2.  **Generate Scoped Typesense API Keys:** Use the Typesense Admin API or `typesense-cli` to create API keys with specific scopes.  For example, create a "search-only" key for frontend applications and a "index-search" key for backend services.
3.  **Restrict Key Permissions:** When creating scoped keys, explicitly define the allowed actions (e.g., `actions: ["search"]`, `collections: ["products", "articles"]`). Avoid granting wildcard access (`*`) unless absolutely necessary. Never expose or use the `master` API key in application code.
4.  **Securely Store and Inject API Keys:** Store generated API keys in secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, environment variables in secure environments). Inject these keys into your application at runtime, avoiding hardcoding.
5.  **Implement API Key Rotation Policy:** Establish a policy for regular rotation of Typesense API keys (e.g., every 3-6 months). Automate this process where possible to minimize manual intervention and potential key exposure.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Typesense API (High Severity):** Limits unauthorized access by requiring API keys and restricting their scope.
    *   **API Key Compromise Impact Reduction (High Severity):** Reduces the damage from a compromised API key by limiting its permissions to only necessary actions and collections.
    *   **Internal Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Makes it harder for compromised application components to gain broader access to Typesense data or functionalities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Typesense API:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **API Key Compromise Impact Reduction:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Internal Privilege Escalation:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. API keys are used for Typesense access in backend services.
    *   Implemented in: Backend API services configuration files (using environment variables for key injection).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Principle of least privilege is not fully enforced. Currently, a single, relatively broad scoped API key is used for all backend services.
    *   API key rotation policy is not formally defined or automated within Typesense key management.
    *   Frontend search might be using a less restricted API key than necessary (needs review and potential scoping).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Typesense Access Control Lists (ACLs) for Granular Permissions (Typesense)](./mitigation_strategies/typesense_access_control_lists__acls__for_granular_permissions__typesense_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Access Control Requirements:** Determine the necessary access control granularity for your data within Typesense collections. Identify user roles or attributes that should dictate access permissions.
2.  **Design ACL Rules:**  Utilize Typesense's ACL feature to define rules based on user groups or document attributes.  Specify permissions for each rule, controlling actions like `search`, `index`, `update`, and `delete` on specific collections or documents.
3.  **Implement ACL Rule Application:** Integrate your application's authentication and authorization logic to dynamically apply Typesense ACL rules. This might involve passing user roles or attributes to Typesense during API requests so Typesense can enforce the defined ACLs.
4.  **Test and Audit ACL Configuration:** Thoroughly test your ACL configurations to ensure they correctly restrict access as intended. Regularly audit ACL rules to verify they remain aligned with your application's security requirements and user roles.
5.  **Utilize Document-Level Security (if needed):** For fine-grained control, explore using document-level security within Typesense ACLs. This allows you to define access rules based on specific attributes within each document, enabling dynamic and context-aware access control.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access within Typesense (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users or roles from accessing sensitive data stored in Typesense collections.
    *   **Data Breaches originating from Typesense (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by enforcing granular access control directly within the search engine.
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Typesense (Medium Severity):**  Makes privilege escalation attempts within the Typesense system more difficult by enforcing role-based or attribute-based access restrictions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access within Typesense:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches originating from Typesense:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Privilege Escalation within Typesense:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. ACLs are not currently configured or utilized within Typesense. Access control is managed primarily at the application level before interacting with Typesense.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   ACLs need to be designed and implemented for all relevant Typesense collections requiring access control.
    *   Integration with the application's authentication and authorization system is necessary to dynamically enforce ACLs based on user context.
    *   Testing and validation of ACL rules are crucial after implementation to ensure correct access restrictions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Typesense Query Complexity Limits (Typesense Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/typesense_query_complexity_limits__typesense_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Analyze Typical Query Patterns:** Understand the typical complexity of legitimate search queries in your application. Identify common query lengths, filter usage, facet requests, and other parameters.
2.  **Configure `resources.query_timeout_ms`:** Set a reasonable `query_timeout_ms` value in your `typesense.conf` file. This limits the maximum execution time for any single query, preventing excessively long-running queries from consuming resources indefinitely.
3.  **Consider Application-Level Query Shaping:** While not directly Typesense configuration, design your application's search interface and query construction logic to encourage efficient queries. Avoid generating overly complex queries programmatically.
4.  **Monitor Query Performance:** Monitor Typesense query performance metrics (e.g., query latency, resource utilization). Identify and investigate any unusually slow or resource-intensive queries.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries (Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks caused by malicious or accidental submission of extremely complex or resource-intensive search queries that can overload Typesense.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Reduces the risk of resource exhaustion (CPU, memory) on the Typesense server due to runaway queries.
    *   **Slow Query Performance (Low to Medium Severity):**  Helps to maintain consistent and acceptable query performance by preventing individual queries from monopolizing resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Queries:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Slow Query Performance:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Query complexity limits are not explicitly configured in Typesense.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `query_timeout_ms` setting needs to be configured in the `typesense.conf` file.
    *   Further investigation into other Typesense configuration options for query complexity limits (if available and relevant) should be considered.
    *   Monitoring of Typesense query performance metrics is not currently in place to identify potential issues related to query complexity.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTTPS Enforcement in Typesense Configuration (Typesense)](./mitigation_strategies/https_enforcement_in_typesense_configuration__typesense_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Obtain TLS Certificates for Typesense:** Acquire valid TLS/SSL certificates specifically for your Typesense server.
2.  **Configure `tls-certificate-path` and `tls-private-key-path`:** In your `typesense.conf` file, specify the paths to your TLS certificate and private key using the `tls-certificate-path` and `tls-private-key-path` configuration options.
3.  **Set `force-https: true`:**  Enable the `force-https: true` setting in `typesense.conf` to enforce HTTPS for all API communication. This will redirect HTTP requests to HTTPS.
4.  **Disable HTTP Port (Optional but Recommended):** If possible and if HTTPS is strictly enforced, consider disabling the HTTP port (default 8108) in your firewall rules to further reduce the attack surface.
5.  **Verify HTTPS Configuration:** After configuration, thoroughly test and verify that all communication with the Typesense API is exclusively over HTTPS.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Typesense API (High Severity):** Prevents eavesdropping and data interception during communication specifically with the Typesense API.
    *   **Data Eavesdropping of Typesense API Traffic (High Severity):** Protects sensitive data transmitted to and from Typesense (queries, indexed data, API keys) from being intercepted in transit.
    *   **Data Tampering of Typesense API Traffic (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of data tampering during communication with the Typesense API.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Typesense API:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Eavesdropping of Typesense API Traffic:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Tampering of Typesense API Traffic:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not fully implemented for internal Typesense communication. HTTPS is likely used for external application access, but internal Typesense communication might still be over HTTP.
    *   Implemented in: Load balancer for external access (HTTPS termination).
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `tls-certificate-path`, `tls-private-key-path`, and `force-https: true` need to be configured in the `typesense.conf` file on the Typesense server.
    *   Verification is needed to ensure all internal communication with Typesense is also using HTTPS after configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Typesense Updates and Patching (Typesense Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_typesense_updates_and_patching__typesense_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Monitor Typesense Security Advisories:** Actively monitor Typesense's official channels (release notes, security advisories, GitHub releases) for announcements of new versions and security patches.
2.  **Establish a Typesense Update Schedule:** Create a defined schedule for regularly updating your Typesense cluster. Aim for updates at least quarterly, or more frequently if critical security vulnerabilities are announced.
3.  **Prioritize Security Patches:**  Prioritize applying security patches and updates that address known vulnerabilities in Typesense. Treat security updates with higher urgency than feature updates.
4.  **Test Updates in a Staging Typesense Environment:** Before applying updates to your production Typesense cluster, thoroughly test them in a dedicated staging environment that mirrors your production setup.
5.  **Apply Updates to Production Typesense Cluster:**  Follow a documented and tested procedure to apply updates to your production Typesense cluster. Include steps for backup and rollback in case of issues during the update process.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Typesense Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Directly addresses and mitigates known security vulnerabilities within the Typesense software itself.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Reduced Risk - Medium Severity):** While updates cannot prevent zero-day exploits, staying up-to-date reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities before patches are available.
    *   **Typesense Software Bugs and Instability (Medium Severity):** Updates often include bug fixes and stability improvements specifically for Typesense, indirectly enhancing security and reliability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Typesense Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Reduced Risk):** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Typesense Software Bugs and Instability:** Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Typesense updates are performed, but not on a strictly regular schedule and without a formal documented process focused on security updates.
    *   Implemented in: Ad-hoc updates performed by DevOps team when prompted by major releases or known issues.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal, security-focused schedule or documented process for regular Typesense updates and patching.
    *   Staging environment is not consistently used for testing Typesense updates specifically for security implications before production deployment.
    *   Proactive monitoring of Typesense security advisories and release notes is not consistently performed to prioritize security updates.
