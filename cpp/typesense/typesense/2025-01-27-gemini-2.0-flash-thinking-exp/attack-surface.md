# Attack Surface Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** Accessing Typesense API endpoints without proper authentication. This allows unauthorized users to interact with Typesense, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or disrupting service.
*   **Typesense Contribution to Attack Surface:** Typesense API endpoints, especially those for indexing and configuration, are protected by API keys. If authentication is disabled, misconfigured, or default API keys are used, this attack surface is directly exposed by Typesense's security configuration.
*   **Example:** An attacker directly accesses the `/collections` endpoint of a Typesense instance that has authentication disabled or is using default API keys, and is able to list all collections and their schemas.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data exfiltration: Unauthorized access to indexed data.
    *   Data manipulation: Modifying or deleting indexed data.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Overloading Typesense with requests.
    *   Configuration changes: Modifying Typesense settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if indexing and configuration APIs are exposed without authentication), High (if search APIs with sensitive data are exposed).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce API Key Authentication:** Ensure API key authentication is enabled and properly configured for all sensitive API endpoints (especially indexing and configuration) within Typesense's configuration.
    *   **Disable Default API Keys:** Change or disable any default API keys provided by Typesense and generate strong, unique API keys as part of Typesense setup.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate Typesense instances within secure networks and restrict access based on the principle of least privilege at the network level, complementing Typesense's own authentication.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Management Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_key_management_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Weak, compromised, or improperly managed API keys. If API keys are easily guessable, leaked, or stored insecurely, attackers can gain unauthorized access as if they were legitimate users.
*   **Typesense Contribution to Attack Surface:** Typesense's security model relies heavily on API keys for authorization. Weaknesses in how API keys are generated, stored, transmitted, or rotated directly undermine Typesense's intended security mechanisms.
*   **Example:** Developers use a simple, predictable API key like "password123" for their Typesense instance, or embed the API key directly in client-side JavaScript code, making it easily accessible to attackers who target Typesense deployments.
*   **Impact:** Same as Unauthenticated API Access: Data exfiltration, manipulation, DoS, configuration changes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if indexing and configuration APIs are accessible with compromised keys), High (if search APIs with sensitive data are accessible).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong API Key Generation:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators to create strong, unpredictable API keys when configuring Typesense.
    *   **Secure API Key Storage:** Store API keys securely on the server-side, using environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure configuration files with restricted access, ensuring Typesense configuration itself is secure. **Never embed API keys in client-side code interacting with Typesense.**
    *   **Secure API Key Transmission:** Always transmit API keys over HTTPS when interacting with Typesense APIs to prevent eavesdropping on API key credentials.
    *   **API Key Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular API key rotation for Typesense to limit the lifespan of potentially compromised keys.
    *   **Least Privilege API Keys:** Utilize Typesense's API key scoping features to create API keys with specific, limited permissions (e.g., search-only keys) to minimize the impact if a key is compromised.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration API Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/configuration_api_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the Typesense API endpoints used for configuring Typesense settings. Unauthorized modification of configuration can lead to security bypasses, denial of service, or data corruption.
*   **Typesense Contribution to Attack Surface:** The configuration API is a core part of Typesense, controlling critical operational and security settings. Vulnerabilities in this specific API surface of Typesense can have severe security implications.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Typesense configuration API (e.g., due to unauthenticated access or compromised API keys) and disables authentication mechanisms within Typesense, weakens security settings, or modifies data storage paths to potentially access or corrupt underlying data managed by Typesense.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Security bypass: Disabling security features or weakening security configurations within Typesense.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Misconfiguring Typesense to become unstable or unavailable.
    *   Data corruption or loss: Modifying settings that affect data storage or indexing integrity within Typesense.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control for Configuration API:**  Enforce strong authentication and authorization specifically for the Typesense configuration API. Restrict access to only authorized administrators who manage Typesense.
    *   **Input Validation for Configuration Parameters:** Validate all configuration parameters submitted to the Typesense configuration API to prevent injection of malicious configurations or unexpected behavior within Typesense itself.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Configuration:** Periodically review and audit Typesense configurations to ensure they adhere to security best practices and haven't been inadvertently or maliciously modified through the configuration API.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Configuration Access:** Grant configuration API access only to users who absolutely need it for Typesense administration and with the minimum necessary permissions within the Typesense access control system.

## Attack Surface: [Data Storage Security](./attack_surfaces/data_storage_security.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure storage of indexed data at rest by Typesense. If the underlying storage mechanism used by Typesense is not properly secured, data managed by Typesense can be exposed to unauthorized access.
*   **Typesense Contribution to Attack Surface:** Typesense is responsible for managing and storing indexed data on disk. The security of this data storage, as implemented by Typesense, is crucial for data confidentiality.
*   **Example:** The file system permissions on the directory where Typesense stores its data are set too permissively (e.g., world-readable) during Typesense deployment or configuration, allowing unauthorized users with access to the server to read the indexed data directly from disk managed by Typesense.
*   **Impact:** Data breach: Unauthorized access and exfiltration of indexed data at rest managed by Typesense.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the data stored within Typesense).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure File System Permissions:** Configure file system permissions to restrict access to the Typesense data directory to only the Typesense process user and authorized administrators, following Typesense's recommended deployment practices.
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Implement encryption at rest for the storage volumes used by Typesense. While not directly a Typesense feature, ensuring the underlying storage used by Typesense is encrypted is a critical mitigation.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Storage Configuration:** Periodically audit the storage configuration used by Typesense to ensure it remains secure and compliant with security policies related to Typesense data.
    *   **Physical Security of Infrastructure:** Ensure the physical security of the servers and infrastructure hosting Typesense to prevent unauthorized physical access to storage media containing Typesense data.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** Overwhelming Typesense with requests to exhaust its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), making it unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Typesense Contribution to Attack Surface:** Typesense, as a service processing search and indexing requests, is inherently susceptible to DoS attacks if not properly configured and protected against abusive request volumes.
*   **Example:** An attacker floods Typesense with a large volume of search requests, complex queries, or indexing requests, causing the Typesense server to become overloaded and unresponsive to legitimate requests, impacting the search functionality provided by Typesense.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability: Making search functionality provided by Typesense unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the impact of service disruption on the application relying on Typesense).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on Typesense API endpoints (search, indexing, configuration) to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given time frame, directly controlling request volume to Typesense.
    *   **Resource Limits Configuration:** Configure resource limits within Typesense (if available through configuration options) and at the operating system level to prevent resource exhaustion of the Typesense process.
    *   **Load Balancing and Horizontal Scaling:** Distribute traffic across multiple Typesense instances using load balancers to improve resilience to DoS attacks and handle increased load, enhancing Typesense's capacity and availability.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF) and CDN:** Use a WAF and CDN to filter malicious traffic targeting Typesense, absorb volumetric attacks before they reach Typesense, and cache responses to reduce load on Typesense instances.
    *   **Input Validation and Query Complexity Limits:** Validate inputs and limit the complexity of search queries processed by Typesense to prevent resource-intensive queries from causing DoS within Typesense.
