# Threat Model Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Threat: [Unauthenticated or Unauthorized API Access](./threats/unauthenticated_or_unauthorized_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to Typesense API endpoints without proper authentication or authorization. This allows them to perform unauthorized operations like reading, modifying, or deleting data in Typesense collections. Attackers might exploit leaked API keys, bypass weak access controls, or access insecurely stored keys.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, data loss, unauthorized access to sensitive information indexed in Typesense, complete disruption of search functionality.
*   **Affected Typesense Component:** API Access Control, API Key Management
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong API key management practices: generate strong, unique API keys.
    *   Rotate API keys regularly.
    *   Utilize Typesense's API key access control features to restrict access based on operations and collections.
    *   Securely store API keys using environment variables, secrets management systems, or dedicated key vaults. Avoid hardcoding keys in application code.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege when assigning API keys, granting only necessary permissions.
    *   Monitor API access logs for suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Data at Rest Encryption (Lack of or Misconfiguration)](./threats/data_at_rest_encryption__lack_of_or_misconfiguration_.md)

*   **Description:** Typesense data stored on disk is not encrypted, or encryption is misconfigured or ineffective. An attacker gaining physical access to the server, storage volumes, or backups can access the unencrypted data. This could occur through physical theft, cloud storage compromise, or storage system vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to all indexed data if storage is compromised, severe confidentiality violation, complete exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Affected Typesense Component:** Data Storage, Persistence Layer
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable and properly configure data at rest encryption provided by Typesense (if available and supported in your deployment environment). Consult Typesense documentation for specific instructions.
    *   If Typesense doesn't natively support data at rest encryption, utilize underlying storage encryption mechanisms provided by the operating system, cloud provider (e.g., encrypted EBS volumes, Azure Disk Encryption), or storage system.
    *   Regularly verify the encryption configuration and ensure it remains active and effective after system updates or changes.
    *   Implement strong physical security measures for servers and storage infrastructure.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification or Deletion](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification_or_deletion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with unauthorized API access modifies or deletes data within Typesense collections. This can involve injecting malicious content, removing legitimate data, or altering collection schemas.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, data loss, application malfunction, inaccurate search results, potential reputational damage, misinformation dissemination, corruption of critical data.
*   **Affected Typesense Component:** Data Management, API Access Control, Indexing Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Reinforce API key management and access control measures (see "Unauthenticated or Unauthorized API Access" threat).
    *   Implement audit logging of all data modification and deletion operations within Typesense (if available in Typesense or through application-level logging).
    *   Regularly back up Typesense data to enable recovery from accidental or malicious data manipulation or deletion. Implement a robust backup and restore strategy.
    *   Consider implementing data validation and integrity checks on data being indexed to prevent malicious or corrupted data from being ingested.
    *   Implement version control or data lineage tracking for critical data within Typesense if possible.

## Threat: [Data in Transit Exposure](./threats/data_in_transit_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and Typesense server is not properly encrypted using HTTPS. A Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker can intercept network traffic and eavesdrop on sensitive data transmitted, including search queries, indexed data, and potentially API keys.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, interception of sensitive search queries and indexed data, potential compromise of API keys, loss of confidentiality during data transfer, exposure of user search patterns.
*   **Affected Typesense Component:** Network Communication, API Client-Server Interaction
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Enforce HTTPS for all communication between the application and the Typesense server.**
    *   Configure the Typesense server to accept only HTTPS connections and reject insecure HTTP connections.
    *   Use TLS/SSL certificates properly configured for both the application server and the Typesense server.
    *   If using a Typesense Cloud offering, verify that HTTPS is enforced by default and properly configured for all communication channels.
    *   Regularly check network configurations to ensure HTTPS is consistently applied.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Complex or Malicious Search Queries](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_complex_or_malicious_search_queries.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted, excessively complex, or malicious search queries to Typesense, consuming excessive server resources (CPU, memory, I/O). This can lead to slowdown or denial of service for legitimate search requests, server instability, or increased infrastructure costs.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, degraded search performance, impacting application availability and user experience, potential financial impact due to resource consumption, service disruption.
*   **Affected Typesense Component:** Query Processing, Search Engine Core
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement query complexity limits and timeouts within Typesense configuration (if available, check Typesense documentation for query limits or resource constraints).
    *   Implement rate limiting on the application side for search requests to Typesense.
    *   Monitor Typesense server resource utilization (CPU, memory, I/O) and set up alerts for unusual spikes or high resource consumption.
    *   Optimize search queries and indexing strategies to minimize resource consumption.
    *   Consider using Typesense's built-in features for query optimization and performance tuning.
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization on search query parameters to prevent injection of overly complex or malicious query syntax.

## Threat: [Search Result Manipulation (Indirect via Data Manipulation)](./threats/search_result_manipulation__indirect_via_data_manipulation_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker, by successfully modifying data within Typesense, indirectly manipulates search results. Users may receive inaccurate, misleading, or tampered results, leading to misinformation or application malfunction.
*   **Impact:** Misleading search results, reputational damage, application malfunction, potential for further attacks based on manipulated information, erosion of user trust, damage to information accuracy.
*   **Affected Typesense Component:** Search Results, Data Integrity, Indexing Engine
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Focus on preventing unauthorized data modification as the primary mitigation (see "Unauthorized Data Modification or Deletion" threat).
    *   Implement monitoring and alerting for unexpected changes in search result rankings or data content that could indicate data manipulation.
    *   Regularly audit data integrity and consistency within Typesense collections.
    *   Implement mechanisms to detect and flag potentially manipulated search results to users if possible, or provide alternative data sources for verification.
