## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Typesense Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_typesense_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate attacker goal. Success means the attacker has gained unauthorized access to the application, its data, or its functionality by exploiting vulnerabilities specifically within the Typesense component.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Typesense API Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_typesense_api_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The Typesense API is the primary interface for interacting with the search engine. Vulnerabilities in the API itself can provide direct access for attackers.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Authentication Bypass [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Brute-force API Keys [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to guess valid API keys through repeated automated requests.
            *   **How:** Using scripts or tools to systematically try combinations of characters to match the expected API key format.
            *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong rate limiting on API key authentication attempts, use strong and long API keys, and monitor for brute-force attempts.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Weak API Key Generation/Management [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  If the process for generating or managing API keys is flawed, attackers might be able to predict or derive valid keys.
            *   **How:**  Analyzing the key generation algorithm (if exposed or predictable), exploiting weaknesses in random number generation, or finding insecure storage or transmission of keys during management processes.
            *   **Mitigation:** Use cryptographically secure random number generators for key generation, implement secure key storage and rotation mechanisms, and regularly audit key management processes.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] API Key Leakage (e.g., exposed in code, logs, insecure storage) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** API keys are unintentionally exposed in publicly accessible locations.
            *   **How:** Finding keys hardcoded in application source code (especially in public repositories), accidentally logged in application logs, stored in insecure configuration files, or exposed through other information disclosure vulnerabilities.
            *   **Mitigation:** Never hardcode API keys, use environment variables or secure secrets management systems, implement code scanning and security reviews to prevent accidental key exposure, and secure logs and configuration files.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] CORS Misconfiguration allowing unauthorized origins to access sensitive APIs [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is misconfigured, allowing malicious websites to make API requests to the Typesense instance from a user's browser.
        *   **How:**  If the CORS policy is overly permissive (e.g., allows wildcard origins `*` or includes untrusted domains), attackers can craft malicious JavaScript on their website to make API calls to the Typesense instance on behalf of a user visiting their site. This can lead to data theft or unauthorized actions if the API is not properly protected by authentication and authorization beyond CORS.
        *   **Mitigation:**  Configure CORS policy restrictively, allowing only explicitly trusted origins. Regularly review and update the CORS policy. Ensure API endpoints are still protected by proper authentication and authorization mechanisms even with correct CORS configuration as CORS is a browser-level security and can be bypassed in other contexts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Data Handling/Storage Vulnerabilities in Typesense [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_data_handlingstorage_vulnerabilities_in_typesense__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting weaknesses in how Typesense handles or stores data to gain unauthorized access to or manipulate the indexed data.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Data Exfiltration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Extracting sensitive data from Typesense without proper authorization.
        *   **Breakdown:**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Abuse Search API for Data Scraping/Extraction [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:**  Using the search API to systematically retrieve large amounts of data, potentially bypassing intended access controls.
                *   **Breakdown:**
                    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Iterate through large result sets to extract all data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                        *   **How:**  Making API calls with pagination or scroll parameters to retrieve all or a significant portion of the indexed data by repeatedly querying and iterating through results.
                        *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on search API requests, limit the maximum result set size, and monitor for unusual data retrieval patterns. Consider if all data needs to be searchable or if access to certain fields should be restricted.
                    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Craft specific queries to target sensitive data fields [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                        *   **How:**  Designing search queries to specifically target and extract sensitive data fields, potentially using advanced query features or filters to narrow down results to the desired information.
                        *   **Mitigation:**  Implement robust authorization checks on search queries to ensure users only access data they are permitted to see. Sanitize and validate search queries to prevent potential injection attacks (though less likely in Typesense itself, it's a good practice). Consider data masking or anonymization for sensitive fields if full access is not required for search functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities in Typesense [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities_in_typesense__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting misconfigurations in Typesense settings to weaken security and gain unauthorized access or control.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Configuration Settings [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Using default or weak configurations that expose vulnerabilities.
        *   **Breakdown:**
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Weak or Default API Keys (if not properly rotated or secured) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **How:**  Using easily guessable or default API keys provided during initial setup or not changing default keys.
                *   **Mitigation:**  Force strong API key generation during setup, disable or remove default keys, implement key rotation policies, and regularly audit API key configurations.
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Insecure Network Configuration (e.g., exposed admin ports, lack of network segmentation) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **How:**  Exposing administrative ports (if any) to the public internet, failing to implement network segmentation to isolate Typesense, or using insecure network protocols.
                *   **Mitigation:**  Restrict access to administrative ports to trusted networks only (e.g., using firewalls), implement network segmentation to limit the blast radius of a compromise, and use secure network protocols (HTTPS).
            *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Overly Permissive CORS Policy allowing unauthorized origins [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                *   **How:**  As described in section 2.1.2, an overly permissive CORS policy can allow malicious websites to interact with the Typesense API from user browsers.
                *   **Mitigation:** Configure CORS policy restrictively, allowing only explicitly trusted origins. Regularly review and update the CORS policy.
