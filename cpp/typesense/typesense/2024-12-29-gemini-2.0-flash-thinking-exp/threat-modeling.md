### High and Critical Typesense Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Typesense component:

*   **Threat:** Data Injection via API
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious JSON payloads in API requests to insert data that violates schema constraints. This could be done by intercepting legitimate requests or directly crafting malicious ones.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data corruption within Typesense, leading to incorrect search results and application errors.
        *   Resource exhaustion if large volumes of malicious data are injected.
    *   **Affected Component:** Typesense API (specifically the document creation/update endpoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Schema Enforcement:** Leverage Typesense's schema enforcement features to reject data that doesn't match the defined schema.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and resource exhaustion.

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage through Unrestricted Search Queries
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft search queries that bypass intended access controls within Typesense, allowing them to retrieve sensitive data they should not have access to. This could involve manipulating search parameters or exploiting weaknesses in Typesense's access control mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within Typesense, potentially leading to privacy breaches and compliance violations.
    *   **Affected Component:** Typesense Search API.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Utilize Typesense's API keys and potentially collection-level access controls to restrict access to specific data based on user roles or permissions.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the application only the necessary API key permissions required for its functionality. Avoid using the "all access" API key in production.

*   **Threat:** Data Tampering via API Key Compromise
    *   **Description:** If Typesense API keys are compromised (e.g., through insecure storage or exposure), an attacker could use these keys to directly modify or delete data within Typesense.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Loss of data integrity, leading to inaccurate search results and application malfunctions.
        *   Denial of service by deleting critical data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Typesense API (all endpoints requiring authentication).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure API Key Storage:** Store API keys securely using environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure configuration management. Avoid hardcoding keys in the application code.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for API Keys:** Create API keys with the minimum necessary permissions for the application's functionality.
        *   **API Key Rotation:** Regularly rotate API keys to limit the window of opportunity if a key is compromised.
        *   **Monitoring and Auditing:** Monitor API usage for suspicious activity and implement auditing to track changes made to Typesense data.
        *   **Secure Communication (HTTPS):** Ensure all communication with the Typesense API is over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping on API keys.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via API Abuse
    *   **Description:** An attacker could send a large number of malicious or resource-intensive requests directly to the Typesense API, overwhelming the service and making it unavailable. This could involve flooding search endpoints with complex queries or overloading data ingestion endpoints.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, impacting user experience and potentially leading to financial losses.
    *   **Affected Component:** Typesense API (all endpoints).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to restrict the number of requests from a single source within a given timeframe.
        *   **Request Size Limits:** Enforce limits on the size of API requests to prevent excessively large payloads.
        *   **Query Complexity Limits:** If possible, implement mechanisms to limit the complexity of search queries.
        *   **Typesense Cloud Features:** If using Typesense Cloud, leverage its built-in DDoS protection features.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Typesense Admin Interface
    *   **Description:** If the Typesense admin interface (if enabled) is not properly secured or is exposed to the public internet, attackers could gain administrative control over the instance.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Typesense instance, allowing attackers to access, modify, or delete all data, and potentially disrupt the service entirely.
    *   **Affected Component:** Typesense Admin Interface.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Ensure the Typesense instance and its admin interface are located within a private network and not directly accessible from the public internet.
        *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Secure the admin interface with strong authentication mechanisms and restrict access to authorized personnel only.
        *   **Disable Admin Interface in Production:** If the admin interface is not required in production, disable it entirely.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules to restrict access to the admin interface to specific trusted IP addresses or networks.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Typesense Dependencies
    *   **Description:** Typesense relies on underlying libraries and components. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited to compromise the Typesense instance.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure within the Typesense service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Typesense Core and its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly Update Typesense:** Keep Typesense updated to the latest version, which includes security patches for known vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement dependency scanning tools to identify and track vulnerabilities in Typesense's dependencies.
        *   **Vulnerability Management:** Have a process in place to address identified vulnerabilities promptly.
