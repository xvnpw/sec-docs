# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Mitigation Strategy: [API Key Management (Principle of Least Privilege)](./mitigation_strategies/api_key_management__principle_of_least_privilege_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement granular API key permissions and management *within Typesense*.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Operations:** List all distinct operations your application performs on Typesense (searching, indexing, deleting, synonym management, etc.).
2.  **Create Keys (Typesense):** Use the Typesense API to create *separate* API keys for each operation or group of related operations.
3.  **Configure Permissions (Typesense):** When creating each key via the Typesense API, use these parameters:
    *   `actions`:  Specify the allowed actions (e.g., `documents:search`, `documents:create`, `collections:*`, `synonyms:*`, `overrides:*`, `keys:*`).  Be as restrictive as possible.
    *   `collections`:  Limit the key's access to specific collections by name (e.g., `products`, `articles`).  Use `*` for all collections only when absolutely necessary (and ideally never).
    *   `value_prefix` (for search-only keys):  Restrict searches to specific values within a designated field.  For example, `user_id:123*` would only allow searches where the `user_id` field starts with "123". This is crucial for multi-tenant applications or any scenario where data needs to be segmented by user or group.
4.  **Rotation (Typesense API):**  Use the Typesense API to implement a regular key rotation schedule.  Automate this process.  Typesense supports key rotation without downtime.
5. **Monitoring (Typesense Logs):** Utilize Typesense's logging capabilities to monitor API key usage. Look for unusual activity, such as unexpected access patterns or errors related to key permissions.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: High):** Prevents compromised search-only keys from modifying or deleting data.
*   **Unauthorized Data Modification (Severity: High):** Limits the ability to inject or alter data.
*   **Unauthorized Data Deletion (Severity: High):** Prevents deletion of collections or documents.
*   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: High):** Prevents low-privilege keys from gaining higher access.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Reduces the scope of exfiltratable data.

**Impact:**
*   **Unauthorized Access/Modification/Deletion/Privilege Escalation/Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced by limiting key capabilities.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Separate search-only key is used.
*   Basic key rotation is performed manually.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Per-collection key scoping (`collections` parameter).
*   `value_prefix` restrictions on search keys.
*   Automated key rotation via Typesense API.
*   Typesense log-based API key usage monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Typesense-Level Rate Limiting](./mitigation_strategies/typesense-level_rate_limiting.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Typesense's built-in rate limiting.

**Description:**
1.  **Configuration (Typesense Server):** Modify the Typesense server configuration (usually a configuration file or environment variables) to set these parameters:
    *   `per_ip_rate_limit_requests_per_second`:  Limits the number of API requests per second from a single IP address.
    *   `per_ip_rate_limit_documents_per_second`: Limits the total number of documents that can be returned per second from a single IP address.  This is *crucial* to prevent large result set attacks.
2.  **Tuning:** Start with conservative limits and adjust them based on your application's expected traffic and the server's capacity.  Monitor Typesense's performance and logs to fine-tune the limits.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from overwhelming the Typesense server with requests.
*   **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: High):** Protects against queries that consume excessive server resources, especially those returning large result sets.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service/Resource Exhaustion:** Risk significantly reduced by limiting request and document throughput.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `per_ip_rate_limit_requests_per_second` is configured.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `per_ip_rate_limit_documents_per_second` is *not* configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Sanitization (for Typesense)](./mitigation_strategies/query_sanitization__for_typesense_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize user input *specifically* to prevent injection of malicious Typesense query syntax.

**Description:**
1. **Identify Injection Points:** Understand how user input is used to construct Typesense queries. Any user-supplied string that becomes part of a filter, sort, or search query is a potential injection point.
2. **Typesense-Specific Sanitization:** Before incorporating user input into a Typesense query, sanitize it to remove or escape characters that have special meaning in the Typesense query language. This is *different* from general HTML or SQL sanitization. Focus on:
    *   Quotes (single and double)
    *   Parentheses
    *   Operators (e.g., `:=`, `>=`, `<=`, `&&`, `||`, `!`)
    *   Reserved keywords
3. **Parameterization (If Possible):** If your Typesense client library supports it, use parameterized queries. This is the most secure approach, as it separates the query structure from the user-provided data.
4. **Escaping:** If parameterization is not available, use the escaping mechanisms provided by your Typesense client library to properly escape special characters in user input.
5. **Whitelisting (Ideal):** If the range of acceptable user input is well-defined, use whitelisting to allow *only* known-good characters or patterns.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Query Manipulation (Severity: Medium/High):** Prevents attackers from altering the intended logic of Typesense queries to bypass security controls or access unauthorized data.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from crafting queries to retrieve data they shouldn't have access to.
* **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Prevents attackers from crafting complex or resource-intensive queries to cause a denial of service.

**Impact:**
*   **Query Manipulation/Data Exfiltration/DoS:** Risk significantly reduced by preventing malicious query modification.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic input validation is performed, but not specifically tailored to Typesense query syntax.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Typesense-specific sanitization or escaping is not implemented.
*   Parameterized queries are not used (check if client library supports them).
*   Whitelisting is not used.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Typesense Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_typesense_updated.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly update the Typesense server software to the latest stable version.

**Description:**
1.  **Subscribe:** Subscribe to Typesense release announcements.
2.  **Update (Typesense Server):** Follow Typesense's official update instructions. This usually involves downloading the new binary, stopping the old process, replacing the binary, and starting the new process.
3. **Rollback:** Have a rollback plan.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Known Vulnerabilities (Severity: Variable, potentially High):** Protects against known security vulnerabilities in Typesense.

**Impact:**
*   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Typesense is updated periodically.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A formal update schedule is not in place.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Exhaustive Search Parameter](./mitigation_strategies/exhaustive_search_parameter.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully manage the use of the `exhaustive_search` parameter in Typesense queries.

**Description:**
1. **Understand the Impact:** The `exhaustive_search` parameter, when set to `true`, forces Typesense to evaluate *all* possible matches, even if it finds enough results to satisfy the `per_page` limit early on. This can significantly increase CPU and memory usage, especially on large datasets.
2. **Use Sparingly:** Only set `exhaustive_search=true` when absolutely necessary for the accuracy of the search results. In most cases, the default behavior (`exhaustive_search=false`) is sufficient and much more efficient.
3. **Alternatives:** If you need to ensure that certain high-priority results are always included, consider using other techniques like:
    *   **Prioritizing fields:** Use the `query_by_weights` parameter to give higher weight to fields that are more likely to contain relevant matches.
    *   **Boosting specific documents:** Use overrides to manually boost the ranking of specific documents.
4. **Monitoring:** Monitor the performance of queries that use `exhaustive_search=true`. If they are causing performance problems, consider alternative approaches.

**Threats Mitigated:**
* **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the risk of attackers crafting queries with `exhaustive_search=true` to consume excessive server resources.
* **Resource Exhaustion (Severity: Medium):** Prevents unnecessary resource consumption by limiting the use of `exhaustive_search`.

**Impact:**
* **Denial of Service/Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced by limiting the performance impact of `exhaustive_search`.

**Currently Implemented:**
* The usage of `exhaustive_search` is not explicitly controlled or monitored.

**Missing Implementation:**
* A clear policy on when to use `exhaustive_search` is needed.
* Monitoring of queries using `exhaustive_search` is not implemented.
