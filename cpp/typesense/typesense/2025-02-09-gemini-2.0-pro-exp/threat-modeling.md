# Threat Model Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access via API Key Leakage](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_via_api_key_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtains a valid Typesense API key (e.g., through code repository leaks, compromised developer workstations, insecure storage of secrets). The attacker then uses this key to directly query the Typesense API, bypassing application-level access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to all data within the collections accessible by the leaked API key.  This could include sensitive PII, confidential business data, or other protected information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Typesense API (specifically, the authentication mechanism using API keys).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never commit API keys to code repositories.** Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
        *   **Implement API key rotation.** Regularly generate new API keys and revoke old ones.
        *   **Use scoped API keys.** Create keys with the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., read-only access to specific collections).  Don't use the master key in application code.
        *   **Monitor API key usage.** Track API requests and look for anomalous activity.
        *   **Implement IP whitelisting.** Restrict API access to known, trusted IP addresses.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion (Query Flooding)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion__query_flooding_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of search queries to the Typesense API, overwhelming the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth). This can be done with simple queries repeated many times, or with complex queries designed to be computationally expensive.
    *   **Impact:** Typesense becomes unresponsive, making search functionality unavailable to legitimate users.  This can disrupt the application's functionality and potentially lead to cascading failures.
    *   **Affected Component:** Typesense server (all components involved in query processing).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable Typesense's built-in rate limiting.** Configure appropriate limits on the number of requests per API key or IP address.
        *   **Implement application-level rate limiting.**  Control the rate at which the application sends requests to Typesense.
        *   **Use a load balancer.** Distribute traffic across multiple Typesense instances.
        *   **Monitor server resource usage.**  Set up alerts for high CPU, memory, or network utilization.
        *   **Optimize search queries.**  Avoid overly broad or complex queries.
        *   **Implement circuit breakers.**  Prevent the application from continuously sending requests to an overloaded Typesense server.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification/Deletion](./threats/unauthorized_data_modificationdeletion.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to the API key leakage threat, but specifically targeting write operations. An attacker with a write-enabled API key (or a compromised key) can add, modify, or delete data within the Typesense index.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, loss of data integrity, incorrect search results, potential denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Typesense API (specifically, the write operations: create, update, delete).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use scoped API keys with the principle of least privilege.**  Create separate keys for read and write operations.  Grant write access only to trusted components.
        *   **Implement strong API key management.** (Same as for API key leakage).
        *   **Implement audit logging.** Track all write operations to the Typesense index.
        * **Implement IP whitelisting.** Restrict API access to known, trusted IP addresses.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Typesense Vulnerabilities (Zero-Days)](./threats/exploitation_of_typesense_vulnerabilities__zero-days_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a previously unknown vulnerability (zero-day) in Typesense. The specific attack vector would depend on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:**  Highly variable, depending on the vulnerability. Could range from data exposure to remote code execution on the Typesense server.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially any component of Typesense, depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Typesense up-to-date.**  Apply security patches and updates promptly.
        *   **Monitor security advisories and mailing lists.**  Stay informed about newly discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   **Use a vulnerability scanner.**  Regularly scan the Typesense server for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Have an incident response plan.**  Be prepared to quickly patch or mitigate vulnerabilities when they are discovered.
        *   **Consider using a Web Application Firewall (WAF) to provide an additional layer of defense.**

## Threat: [Insecure Snapshot/Backup Exposure](./threats/insecure_snapshotbackup_exposure.md)

* **Description:** Typesense snapshots (backups) are stored in an insecure location (e.g., a publicly accessible cloud storage bucket) or with weak access controls. An attacker gains access to these snapshots.
    * **Impact:** Complete data breach, exposing all indexed data at the time of the snapshot.
    * **Affected Component:** Typesense snapshot/backup mechanism and the storage location of the snapshots.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Store snapshots in secure, encrypted storage.** Use strong access controls and encryption at rest.
        * **Regularly audit snapshot access and retention policies.**
        * **Use a dedicated, secure service for storing backups.** (e.g., AWS S3 with appropriate security configurations, Azure Blob Storage with access controls).
        * **Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing snapshots.**
