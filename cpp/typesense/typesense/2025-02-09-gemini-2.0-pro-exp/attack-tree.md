## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exfiltrate Sensitive Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exfiltrate_sensitive_data__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the most critical attack path, focusing on unauthorized access and retrieval of sensitive data stored within Typesense. The combination of relatively easy attack vectors and high impact makes this a high-risk area.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Unauthorized Access to Typesense API [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__unauthorized_access_to_typesense_api__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Gaining unauthorized access to the Typesense API is the foundation for most data exfiltration attacks.  This node is critical because it represents the primary security perimeter.
        *   **Mitigation Focus:** Strong API key management, authentication, and authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. API Key Leakage [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__api_key_leakage__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  The accidental or malicious exposure of Typesense API keys, allowing attackers to directly interact with the Typesense API. This is a critical vulnerability due to its prevalence and the ease with which leaked keys can be exploited.
            *   **Mitigation Focus:**  Preventing keys from being exposed in the first place, and quickly revoking them if they are.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Hardcoded API Key in Client-Side Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__hardcoded_api_key_in_client-side_code__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  Embedding API keys directly within client-side JavaScript or other publicly accessible code. This is extremely dangerous as anyone can view the source code and extract the key.
                *   **Likelihood:** High (Common mistake)
                *   **Impact:** High (Full data access)
                *   **Effort:** Very Low (Inspect source code)
                *   **Skill Level:** Very Low (Basic web knowledge)
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires code review or traffic analysis)
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   Never store API keys in client-side code.
                    *   Use a backend proxy to handle all Typesense interactions. The client communicates with the backend, and the backend (which securely stores the API key) communicates with Typesense.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.2. Accidental Commit to Public Repository [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_2__accidental_commit_to_public_repository__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  Inadvertently committing API keys to a public Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). This makes the key publicly available to anyone who can access the repository.
                *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Happens frequently)
                *   **Impact:** High (Full data access)
                *   **Effort:** Very Low (Use Git search tools)
                *   **Skill Level:** Very Low (Basic Git knowledge)
                *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires repository monitoring)
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   Use environment variables to store API keys outside of the codebase.
                    *   Use a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
                    *   Implement pre-commit hooks (e.g., using tools like `git-secrets` or `trufflehog`) to scan for potential secrets before they are committed.
                    *   Regularly scan repositories for accidentally committed secrets (e.g., using GitHub's secret scanning feature or dedicated tools).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Data Exposure Through Misconfigured Filtering/Faceting](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__data_exposure_through_misconfigured_filteringfaceting.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector involves exploiting misconfigurations in how Typesense's filtering and faceting features are used, leading to the unintentional exposure of sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Leaking Sensitive Data via Facets [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__leaking_sensitive_data_via_facets__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  If facets are configured on sensitive fields without proper access controls, an attacker can use facet queries to enumerate the possible values of those fields, potentially revealing sensitive information.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Configuration error)
            *   **Impact:** Medium (Partial data exposure)
            *   **Effort:** Low (Crafting specific facet queries)
            *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic Typesense query knowledge)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires auditing facet configurations and query logs)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Avoid using facets on sensitive fields.
                *   If faceting on sensitive fields is unavoidable, use scoped API keys with strict `filter_by` rules to restrict access based on user roles or attributes.  Ensure that the `filter_by` rules prevent unauthorized users from seeing facet values for sensitive data.
                *   Regularly audit facet configurations to ensure they are not exposing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2. Insufficiently Restrictive Filters [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2__insufficiently_restrictive_filters__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  If the application does not properly validate and sanitize user-supplied `filter_by` parameters on the backend, an attacker might be able to craft malicious queries that bypass intended data access restrictions.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Coding error)
            *   **Impact:** Medium (Partial data exposure)
            *   **Effort:** Low (Crafting specific filter queries)
            *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic Typesense query knowledge)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires auditing filter logic and query logs)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Always validate and sanitize user-provided `filter_by` parameters on the *backend* before sending them to Typesense.  Do *not* rely solely on client-side validation.
                *   Use a whitelist approach: define the allowed filter parameters and values, and reject any input that does not match the whitelist.
                *   Implement input validation to ensure that filter parameters are of the expected data type and format.
                *   Regularly review and test the filter logic to ensure it is working as intended and cannot be bypassed.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Disrupt Service Availability](./attack_tree_paths/2__disrupt_service_availability.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This attack path focuses on making the Typesense service unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__denial_of_service__dos__attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attacks designed to overwhelm the Typesense server or application, making it unavailable to legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Resource Exhaustion via High Query Load [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__resource_exhaustion_via_high_query_load__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker sends a large number of complex or computationally expensive search queries to the Typesense server, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and causing the service to become slow or unresponsive.
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on server capacity and rate limiting)
            *   **Impact:** Medium (Service degradation or outage)
            *   **Effort:** Low (Sending many requests)
            *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic scripting)
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (High traffic volume, server monitoring)
            *   **Mitigation:**
                *   Implement rate limiting on the Typesense API. Typesense has built-in rate limiting capabilities that can be configured to limit the number of requests per API key or IP address within a given time window.
                *   Use caching to reduce the load on the Typesense server. Cache frequently accessed search results to avoid repeatedly querying Typesense.
                *   Monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, network) and scale resources as needed to handle peak loads.
                *   Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to cache static assets and offload some traffic from the Typesense server.
                *   Optimize search queries to make them as efficient as possible. Avoid overly broad or complex queries.
                * Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.
