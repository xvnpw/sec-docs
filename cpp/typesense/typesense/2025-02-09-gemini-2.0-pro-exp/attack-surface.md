# Attack Surface Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Data Access (Read)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_data_access__read_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain read access to data stored within Typesense without proper authorization.
    *   **Typesense Contribution:** Typesense stores and indexes data, making it a direct target for data exfiltration.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a publicly accessible Typesense endpoint without API key restrictions and uses the `/collections/products/documents/search` endpoint to retrieve all product data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, loss of confidentiality, regulatory violations, reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory API Keys:** Enforce the use of API keys for *all* Typesense API requests.
        *   **Scoped API Keys:** Use API keys with the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., `documents:search` only).  Do *not* use the admin key in application code.
        *   **Network Restrictions:** Limit network access to the Typesense server to trusted hosts/networks.
        *   **IP Whitelisting:** If direct internet exposure is necessary, restrict access to known client IPs.
        *   **Field-Level Access Control:** Use scoped API keys to restrict access to specific fields.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Data Modification/Deletion (Write)](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_data_modificationdeletion__write_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain write access to Typesense, allowing them to modify, delete, or inject data.
    *   **Typesense Contribution:** Typesense provides APIs for creating, updating, and deleting documents and collections.
    *   **Example:** An attacker obtains a leaked API key with `documents:create` permissions and injects malicious data.  Alternatively, they use a key with `collections:*` to delete an entire collection.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, application malfunction, reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Least Privilege API Keys:** Use API keys with *only* the necessary write permissions.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Write Operations):** Implement rate limiting on all write operations.
        *   **Auditing:** Enable Typesense's audit logging (if available).

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Typesense Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_typesense_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit known or unknown (zero-day) vulnerabilities in the Typesense software itself.
    *   **Typesense Contribution:** As with any software, Typesense may contain vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a newly discovered vulnerability in Typesense's query parsing logic to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely, potentially ranging from data breaches to complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (potentially Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Typesense Updated:** Regularly update Typesense to the latest version. Subscribe to security advisories.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Typesense server for known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help mitigate some attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or insecure Typesense configuration settings create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Typesense Contribution:** Typesense offers various configuration options, and incorrect settings can expose the system.
    *   **Example:** Leaving the default admin API key unchanged, disabling TLS, or exposing the Typesense API directly to the internet without any restrictions.
    *   **Impact:** Varies widely, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Review Documentation:** Thoroughly review the Typesense documentation and security best practices.
        *   **Configuration Audits:** Regularly audit the Typesense configuration.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege to all configuration settings.
        *   **Secure Defaults:** Use secure default settings provided by Typesense.
