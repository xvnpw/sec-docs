## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1. Leaking Sensitive Data via Facets

### 4.1. Understanding Typesense Facets

Typesense facets are a powerful feature for providing aggregated information about search results.  They allow users to see the distribution of values for specific fields within a collection.  For example, in an e-commerce application, facets could be used to show the number of products in each category, price range, or brand.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **Facet Field:**  A field in a Typesense collection that is designated as a facet.  This is done during schema definition.
*   **Facet Query:**  A search query that includes a `facet_by` parameter, specifying which fields to generate facets for.
*   **Facet Count:**  The number of documents that match each unique value of a facet field.

**Example:**

Let's say we have a collection of "users" with fields like `username`, `email`, `role`, and `subscription_tier`.  If `role` is configured as a facet, a query like this:

```
GET /collections/users/documents/search
{
  "q": "*",
  "facet_by": "role"
}
```

Might return a response including:

```json
{
  "facet_counts": [
    {
      "field_name": "role",
      "counts": [
        { "count": 100, "value": "admin" },
        { "count": 500, "value": "editor" },
        { "count": 1000, "value": "user" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

This shows the distribution of users across different roles.  While useful, this becomes a vulnerability if `role` (or another faceted field) contains sensitive information.

### 4.2. Misconfiguration Scenarios

Several misconfigurations can lead to sensitive data leakage:

1.  **Faceting on Sensitive Fields Directly:**  The most obvious vulnerability is configuring a facet on a field that directly contains sensitive data, such as `social_security_number`, `credit_card_number`, `password_hash` (even hashed, this is bad practice), `internal_user_id`, or `api_key`.

2.  **Faceting on Fields with Indirectly Sensitive Information:**  Even if a field doesn't *directly* contain sensitive data, it might reveal sensitive information through inference.  Examples:
    *   `salary_band`:  While not the exact salary, it narrows down the range.
    *   `medical_condition`:  Reveals health information.
    *   `purchase_history`:  Could reveal sensitive preferences or financial status.
    *   `location_data`:  Precise location data can be highly sensitive.
    *   `group_membership`: If group names are sensitive (e.g., "High-Risk Customers").

3.  **Insufficient `filter_by` Restrictions with Scoped API Keys:**  Scoped API keys with `filter_by` are intended to restrict access to data.  However, if the `filter_by` rules are too broad or incorrectly configured, an attacker might still be able to access facet counts for sensitive data they shouldn't see.  For example:
    *   A `filter_by` rule that only filters by `department_id`, but the attacker can guess or enumerate valid `department_id` values.
    *   A `filter_by` rule that uses a field that can be manipulated by the attacker.

4.  **Lack of Input Validation:** If the application allows user-provided input to construct the `facet_by` parameter *without proper sanitization or validation*, an attacker could inject arbitrary field names, potentially discovering and faceting on fields that were not intended to be exposed. This is a form of query injection.

5.  **Default Facet Configuration:** If Typesense has any default facet configurations (which should be avoided by design), and these defaults include sensitive fields, this would be a vulnerability.

### 4.3. Attack Techniques

An attacker would exploit this vulnerability by:

1.  **Identifying Faceted Fields:**  The attacker might start by inspecting the application's search functionality, looking for clues about which fields are being used for faceting (e.g., in dropdown filters or auto-suggest features).  They could also try common field names.

2.  **Crafting Facet Queries:**  The attacker would then craft specific Typesense queries using the `facet_by` parameter to target potentially sensitive fields.  They would start with a broad query (`q: "*"`) to maximize the results.

3.  **Enumerating Values:**  By analyzing the `facet_counts` in the response, the attacker can enumerate the possible values for the targeted field.  Even if the exact values are not sensitive, the *distribution* of values might reveal information.

4.  **Bypassing `filter_by` (if applicable):**  If scoped API keys are used, the attacker would try to find ways to bypass the `filter_by` restrictions.  This might involve:
    *   **Parameter Tampering:**  Modifying the parameters used in the `filter_by` rule.
    *   **ID Enumeration:**  Trying different values for IDs used in the `filter_by` rule.
    *   **Exploiting Logic Flaws:**  Finding weaknesses in the application's logic that determines the `filter_by` rules.

5. **Using wildcard queries:** Attacker can use wildcard queries to get all possible values for facet.

**Example Attack Query:**

Assuming the attacker suspects that `internal_user_id` is a field (even if it's not intended to be a facet), they might try:

```
GET /collections/users/documents/search
{
  "q": "*",
  "facet_by": "internal_user_id"
}
```

If `internal_user_id` is accidentally configured as a facet, the response will reveal all unique `internal_user_id` values and their counts, potentially exposing a critical internal identifier.

### 4.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of this vulnerability depends on the type of sensitive data exposed:

*   **Personally Identifiable Information (PII):**  Exposure of PII (names, email addresses, etc.) can lead to identity theft, phishing attacks, and privacy violations.  This is a high-impact scenario.
*   **Financial Information:**  Exposure of credit card numbers, bank account details, or salary information can lead to financial fraud and significant financial losses.  This is a very high-impact scenario.
*   **Health Information:**  Exposure of medical conditions or other health data is a serious privacy violation and can have legal and reputational consequences.  This is a high-impact scenario.
*   **Internal Identifiers:**  Exposure of internal user IDs, API keys, or other internal identifiers can be used to launch further attacks against the system.  This is a medium-to-high impact scenario, depending on the identifier's sensitivity.
*   **Business-Sensitive Data:**  Exposure of confidential business data (e.g., sales figures, customer lists, pricing information) can give competitors an unfair advantage.  This is a medium-to-high impact scenario.

The impact is also affected by the *completeness* of the data exposed.  Even if only a subset of values is revealed, it can still be damaging.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies

A layered approach to mitigation is crucial:

1.  **Never Facet on Sensitive Fields:**  This is the most fundamental and important mitigation.  Do not configure facets on fields that contain sensitive data, directly or indirectly.

2.  **Careful Schema Design:**  Plan your Typesense schema carefully, considering the sensitivity of each field.  Avoid storing sensitive data in fields that might be used for faceting.

3.  **Strict Scoped API Keys:**  If faceting on potentially sensitive fields is unavoidable, use scoped API keys with very restrictive `filter_by` rules.  These rules should:
    *   Be based on user roles or attributes that are securely managed.
    *   Use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   Be as specific as possible, limiting access to only the necessary data.
    *   Be regularly reviewed and updated.
    *   Use server-side logic to generate the `filter_by` rules, preventing client-side manipulation.

4.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Never allow user-provided input to directly construct the `facet_by` parameter.  Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent query injection attacks.  Use a whitelist approach, allowing only specific, known-safe field names.

5.  **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on the Typesense API to prevent attackers from making a large number of facet queries in a short period.  This can slow down enumeration attempts.

6.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**  Monitor Typesense query logs for suspicious activity, such as:
    *   Queries with unusual `facet_by` parameters.
    *   A high volume of facet queries from a single IP address.
    *   Queries that attempt to bypass `filter_by` restrictions.
    *   Set up alerts to notify administrators of potential attacks.

7.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of your Typesense configuration and application code.  This should include:
    *   Reviewing the schema definition for sensitive fields.
    *   Examining the `filter_by` rules for scoped API keys.
    *   Testing the application for query injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Analyzing query logs for suspicious activity.

8.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that Typesense API keys have only the necessary permissions.  Don't use a single, all-powerful API key for all operations.

9. **Data Minimization:** Store only necessary data.

### 4.6. Detection Methods

Detecting this vulnerability or its exploitation involves:

*   **Static Analysis:**
    *   Reviewing the Typesense schema definition to identify fields configured as facets.
    *   Analyzing application code to identify how facet queries are constructed and if user input is involved.
    *   Checking the configuration of scoped API keys and their `filter_by` rules.

*   **Dynamic Analysis:**
    *   **Penetration Testing:**  Attempting to exploit the vulnerability using the attack techniques described above.
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Sending a large number of random or semi-random facet queries to the Typesense API to see if any sensitive data is revealed.

*   **Log Analysis:**
    *   Monitoring Typesense query logs for suspicious patterns, as described in the Mitigation Strategies section.
    *   Using a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to aggregate and analyze logs from multiple sources.
