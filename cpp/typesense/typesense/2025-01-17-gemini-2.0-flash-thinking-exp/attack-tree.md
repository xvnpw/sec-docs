## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Search Results (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_search_results__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Data into Typesense (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Exploit Insecure Data Sanitization on Ingestion (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * Inject Scripting Payloads (e.g., XSS in search results): Attackers inject JavaScript code that executes in users' browsers when search results are displayed, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
        * Inject Malicious Markup (e.g., HTML injection to redirect users): Attackers inject HTML code to modify the appearance or behavior of search results, potentially redirecting users to phishing pages or defacing the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Typesense Data (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_typesense_data__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Exploit API Key Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Exploit Stored API Keys (e.g., in application code or configuration) (CRITICAL NODE): Attackers find API keys hardcoded in the application's source code, configuration files, or other insecure locations, granting them full access to Typesense data and functionality.
* **Exploit Typesense Admin API Vulnerabilities (if exposed) (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Command Injection (CRITICAL NODE): Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the Typesense Admin API to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting Typesense, potentially leading to full server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disrupt Application Service via Typesense (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/disrupt_application_service_via_typesense__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Cause Denial of Service (DoS) on Typesense (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Send Large Number of Malicious Search Queries: Attackers flood the Typesense server with a high volume of resource-intensive or malformed search queries, overwhelming its processing capacity and making it unavailable.
    * Exploit Resource Exhaustion Vulnerabilities in Typesense: Attackers exploit specific bugs or design flaws in Typesense to consume excessive server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
    * Send Large Number of Data Ingestion Requests: Attackers overwhelm Typesense by sending a massive number of data ingestion requests, potentially exceeding its capacity and causing it to become unresponsive.
* **Corrupt Typesense Data (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Exploit API Vulnerabilities to Delete or Modify Data: Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in the Typesense API (after gaining unauthorized access) to delete or modify critical data, leading to application malfunction or data loss.
    * Inject Malicious Data that Causes Typesense to Fail: Attackers craft specific data payloads that trigger bugs or crashes within the Typesense engine, leading to service disruption or data corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Typesense Configuration Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_typesense_configuration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Access Sensitive Configuration Data (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Exploit Default Credentials (if not changed) (CRITICAL NODE): Attackers use default administrative credentials (if not changed after installation) to access sensitive Typesense configuration settings.
    * Access Configuration Files with Weak Permissions: Attackers gain access to Typesense configuration files due to overly permissive file system permissions, revealing sensitive information like API keys or database credentials.
* **Modify Configuration to Gain Control (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Disable Security Features: Attackers modify the Typesense configuration to disable authentication, authorization, or other security mechanisms, making it easier to exploit further vulnerabilities.
    * Add Malicious Users or API Keys: Attackers add new administrative users or API keys to the Typesense configuration, granting themselves persistent unauthorized access.
