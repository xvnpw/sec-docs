# Attack Surface Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured API Key Management](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_api_key_management.md)

*   **Description:**  API keys, especially the `admin` key, are not stored or handled securely, leading to potential exposure.
    *   **How Typesense Contributes:** Typesense relies on API keys for authentication and authorization. Compromise of these keys grants unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:**  Hardcoding the `admin` API key in the application's source code or client-side JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:**  Full control over the Typesense instance, including the ability to read, write, and delete data, create new collections, and potentially disrupt service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys securely (e.g., using environment variables or secrets management systems, not hardcoded in the application code).
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege by creating API keys with specific, limited permissions instead of relying solely on the `admin` key.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   Avoid exposing API keys in client-side code.

## Attack Surface: [Publicly Accessible Typesense Instance](./attack_surfaces/publicly_accessible_typesense_instance.md)

*   **Description:** The Typesense instance is directly accessible from the public internet without proper authentication or network restrictions.
    *   **How Typesense Contributes:** Typesense, by default, listens on a network port and can be exposed if not configured correctly.
    *   **Example:** A Typesense instance running on a cloud server with an open port and no firewall rules restricting access.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to data, potential data breaches, denial-of-service attacks by overwhelming the instance with requests, and the ability to manipulate or delete data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement network segmentation and firewalls to restrict access to the Typesense instance to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
        *   Ensure the Typesense instance is not directly exposed to the public internet. Consider placing it behind a private network or using a VPN.
        *   Utilize authentication mechanisms provided by Typesense (API keys) and enforce their use.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Communication with Typesense](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_communication_with_typesense.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and the Typesense instance is not encrypted using TLS/HTTPS.
    *   **How Typesense Contributes:** Typesense communicates over a network, and if this communication is not encrypted, it's vulnerable to interception.
    *   **Example:**  An application communicating with a Typesense instance over HTTP instead of HTTPS.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data transmitted between the application and Typesense, including API keys and indexed data. Attackers could eavesdrop on the communication and potentially steal credentials or sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use HTTPS/TLS for communication between the application and the Typesense instance.
        *   Configure Typesense to enforce HTTPS.
        *   Ensure proper certificate management for the Typesense instance.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of Administrative API Endpoints](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of_administrative_api_endpoints.md)

*   **Description:**  Administrative API endpoints in Typesense are not adequately protected, allowing unauthorized access to management functions.
    *   **How Typesense Contributes:** Typesense provides administrative API endpoints for managing the instance. If these are not secured, it creates a significant vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker gaining access to the `/collections` endpoint with an exposed `admin` API key, allowing them to create, modify, or delete collections.
    *   **Impact:**  Full control over the Typesense instance, including the ability to disrupt service, delete data, and potentially gain access to sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly control access to administrative API endpoints using strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Ensure that only authorized personnel or systems have access to the `admin` API key.
        *   Monitor access logs for suspicious activity on administrative endpoints.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Typesense Software](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_typesense_software.md)

*   **Description:**  The Typesense software itself contains security vulnerabilities that can be exploited by attackers.
    *   **How Typesense Contributes:** As with any software, Typesense may have undiscovered or unpatched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:**  Exploiting a known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) in an outdated version of Typesense to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but can range from denial of service to remote code execution on the Typesense server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Typesense instance up-to-date with the latest security patches and releases.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories from the Typesense project to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a vulnerability management process to regularly scan for and address known vulnerabilities.
