# Threat Model Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Threat: [Direct Access to Typesense Data](./threats/direct_access_to_typesense_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Direct Access to Typesense Data
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit network misconfigurations or vulnerabilities to directly connect to the Typesense instance, bypassing application-level security. They could then use the Typesense API or underlying data storage mechanisms to read, modify, or delete indexed data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation leading to incorrect application behavior, denial of service by corrupting or deleting the index.
    *   **Affected Component:** Network Layer, potentially the Typesense API if accessed directly, or the underlying data storage mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong firewall rules to restrict access to the Typesense instance to only authorized IP addresses or networks.
        *   Ensure Typesense is not exposed on public networks without explicit need and proper security measures.
        *   Regularly review and update firewall configurations.
        *   Consider using a private network or VPN for communication between the application and Typesense.

## Threat: [Data Leakage through Unfiltered Search Results](./threats/data_leakage_through_unfiltered_search_results.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage through Unfiltered Search Results
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft specific search queries that bypass intended application-level filtering or access controls, allowing them to retrieve sensitive data that should not be accessible to them. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in the application's query construction or understanding the indexed data structure within Typesense.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, privacy violations, potential legal repercussions.
    *   **Affected Component:** Search API, potentially the underlying indexing mechanism if data is not properly sanitized before indexing within Typesense.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully consider what data is indexed in Typesense and avoid indexing highly sensitive information if not absolutely necessary.
        *   Utilize Typesense's built-in filtering capabilities and API key permissions to restrict search results based on user authorization.
        *   Regularly audit search queries and results to identify potential leakage points.

## Threat: [Compromised Typesense API Keys](./threats/compromised_typesense_api_keys.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Typesense API Keys
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to valid Typesense API keys through various means (e.g., insecure storage, phishing, insider threat). They can then use these keys to perform unauthorized actions on the Typesense instance, such as reading, writing, or deleting data, depending on the permissions associated with the compromised key.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, potential compromise of the entire application if write access is obtained.
    *   **Affected Component:** Authentication and Authorization mechanisms (API Key management) within Typesense.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store Typesense API keys securely using environment variables, secure vault solutions, or secrets management systems. Avoid hardcoding keys in the application code.
        *   Implement strict access controls for accessing and managing API keys within Typesense.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   Utilize granular API key permissions within Typesense to limit the scope of each key to the minimum required functionality.
        *   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity within Typesense.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration](./threats/insecure_default_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Default Configuration
    *   **Description:** The Typesense instance is deployed with default or insecure configurations, such as default API keys, open ports, or disabled security features within Typesense itself. Attackers can exploit these weaknesses to gain unauthorized access or control over the Typesense instance.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration Management, Deployment of the Typesense instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review and harden the default Typesense configuration during deployment.
        *   Change default API keys immediately within Typesense.
        *   Disable unnecessary features or ports within the Typesense configuration.
        *   Follow security best practices for deploying and configuring Typesense.
        *   Regularly review the Typesense configuration for potential security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Configuration Details](./threats/exposure_of_configuration_details.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Configuration Details
    *   **Description:** Sensitive Typesense configuration details, such as API keys or connection strings, are inadvertently exposed through insecure storage, version control systems, or other means. Attackers who gain access to this information can compromise the Typesense instance.
    *   **Impact:** Compromised API keys, unauthorized access, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Configuration Management, Deployment of the Typesense instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive Typesense configuration details securely using environment variables, secure vault solutions, or secrets management systems.
        *   Avoid committing sensitive information to version control.
        *   Implement strict access controls for accessing Typesense configuration files and environment variables.
