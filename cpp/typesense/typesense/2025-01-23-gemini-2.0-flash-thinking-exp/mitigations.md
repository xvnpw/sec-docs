# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Typesense API Key Management](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_typesense_api_key_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Typesense:**  For each application component interacting with Typesense, determine the absolute minimum permissions required.  Avoid using the Master API Key in application code.
    2.  **Create Scoped Typesense API Keys:** Utilize the Typesense Admin API (using the Master API Key securely in a backend/administrative context) to generate scoped API keys.  Scope keys to specific collections and allowed actions (e.g., `search` only, `index:create`, `documents:import`).
    3.  **Secure Storage of Typesense API Keys:** Store generated Typesense API keys securely. Recommended methods include:
        *   **Environment Variables:** For application deployments, store keys as environment variables.
        *   **Secrets Management Systems:** Integrate with systems like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or Google Secret Manager to manage and retrieve Typesense API keys.
    4.  **Avoid Hardcoding Typesense API Keys:** Never embed Typesense API keys directly within application source code.
    5.  **Implement Typesense API Key Rotation:** Establish a policy for regular rotation of Typesense API keys. Automate this process if possible, generating new keys and updating application configurations.
    6.  **Network Restrictions for Typesense API Keys (Where Applicable):** If using Typesense Cloud, leverage IP allowlisting to restrict API key usage to specific trusted IP addresses or networks. For self-hosted Typesense, use network firewalls to control access to the Typesense server itself.

Refer to the Typesense documentation for the list of special characters and proper escaping methods.
    4.  **Limit Typesense Query Complexity (Application-Level):** Implement application-level controls to restrict the complexity of Typesense search queries users can submit. This could involve limiting the number of filters, facets, or query clauses.
