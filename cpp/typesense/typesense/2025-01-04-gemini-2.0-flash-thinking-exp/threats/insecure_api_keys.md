        print("Detailed Attack Vectors:")
        print("* **Exposed Configuration Files:** This is a common vulnerability where API keys are inadvertently stored in plaintext within configuration files committed to version control, left on the server, or exposed in cloud storage.")
        print("* **Compromised Administrative Account:** If an attacker gains access to the Typesense server's administrative interface, they can directly retrieve or generate API keys.")
        print("* **Application Vulnerabilities:** Our application itself might have vulnerabilities that could leak API keys, such as insecure logging, information disclosure flaws, or server-side request forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities.")
        print("* **Network Interception:** While HTTPS encrypts traffic, misconfigurations or vulnerabilities could potentially allow an attacker to intercept API keys during transmission if not handled carefully (though less likely with proper HTTPS).")
        print("* **Insider Threats:** Malicious or negligent insiders with access to the Typesense server or application configurations could intentionally or unintentionally expose API keys.")
        print("* **Social Engineering:** Attackers might trick developers or administrators into revealing API keys through phishing or other social engineering tactics.")

        print("\nDetailed Impact Analysis:")
        print("* **Data Breach (Confidentiality):** Attackers can read sensitive data indexed in Typesense, potentially including personal information, financial data, or proprietary business data. The scope of the breach depends on the data stored and the permissions of the compromised key.")
        print("* **Data Manipulation/Destruction (Integrity):** With write access, attackers can modify or delete existing data, insert malicious or incorrect data, leading to data corruption and loss of trust in the application's information.")
        print("* **Service Disruption (Availability):** Depending on the API key's permissions, attackers could potentially overload the Typesense instance with requests, delete collections, or modify configurations to disrupt the service for legitimate users.")
        print("* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack leveraging compromised API keys can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization behind it, leading to loss of users and business.")
        print("* **Financial Loss:** Costs associated with incident response, data breach notifications, legal fees, and potential regulatory fines can be significant.")

        print("\nTechnical Deep Dive (Typesense Specifics):")
        print("* **API Key Types:** Typesense offers different types of API keys (Admin, Search-Only, Scoped). Understanding the permissions associated with each type is crucial for mitigation.")
        print("* **API Key Location:**  API keys are typically configured within the `typesense.config.js` file or through environment variables on the Typesense server.")
        print("* **Authentication Mechanism:**  API keys are passed in the `X-TYPESENSE-API-KEY` header of HTTP requests to the Typesense server.")
        print("* **Key Rotation Mechanisms:** Typesense allows for generating new API keys and invalidating old ones. Leveraging this feature is essential for regular rotation.")

        print("* **Utilize secure secrets management solutions:** Implement tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, or similar to securely store and manage API keys.")
        print("* **Environment Variables (with caution):** If using environment variables, ensure the server environment is securely configured and access is strictly controlled.")
        print("* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application only accesses the Typesense instance with API keys that have the minimum necessary permissions for their specific tasks. Avoid using Admin API keys where scoped or search-only keys suffice.")

        print("\n**API Key Scoping and Rotation:**")
        print("* **Implement Granular Scoping:** Leverage Typesense's scoped API keys to restrict access to specific collections and actions. This limits the potential damage if a key is compromised.")
        print("* **Automate Key Rotation:**  Develop a process for regularly rotating API keys. This involves generating new keys, updating the application to use the new keys, and invalidating the old ones. Automate this process as much as possible.")
        print("* **Define a Rotation Schedule:** Determine an appropriate rotation frequency based on the sensitivity of the data and the risk assessment.")

        print("\n**Monitoring and Logging:**")
        print("* **Centralized Logging:** Implement centralized logging for all API requests to the Typesense server, including the API key used, the action performed, and the timestamp.")
        print("* **Anomaly Detection:**  Develop mechanisms to detect unusual API key usage patterns, such as requests from unexpected IP addresses, high volumes of requests, or attempts to perform unauthorized actions.")
        print("* **Alerting System:** Set up alerts to notify security teams of suspicious activity related to API key usage.")
        print("* **Utilize Typesense's Audit Logs:** If available, leverage Typesense's built-in audit logging features to track API key usage and administrative actions.")

        print("\n**Application Security:**")
        print("* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Follow secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities that could lead to API key exposure (e.g., avoid logging sensitive data, protect against injection attacks).")
        print("* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential weaknesses in API key management and overall application security.")
        print("* **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation to prevent attackers from manipulating requests in ways that could expose API keys.")

        print("\n**Infrastructure Security:**")
        print("* **Secure Typesense Server:** Ensure the Typesense server itself is securely configured and protected against unauthorized access.")
        print("* **Network Segmentation:**  Implement network segmentation to limit the impact if one part of the infrastructure is compromised.")
        print("* **Access Control:**  Restrict access to the Typesense server and its configuration files to authorized personnel only.")
