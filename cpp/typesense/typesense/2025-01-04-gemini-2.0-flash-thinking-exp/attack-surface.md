# Attack Surface Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Attack Surface: [API Key Exposure](./attack_surfaces/api_key_exposure.md)

**Description:**  Sensitive API keys (used for authentication and authorization) are exposed, allowing unauthorized access to Typesense functionalities.

**How Typesense Contributes:** Typesense relies on API keys for access control. If these keys are compromised, the security of the entire instance is at risk.

**Example:** An API key is hardcoded in a frontend application's JavaScript code or stored in a publicly accessible configuration file.

**Impact:**  Full read and write access to Typesense data, potential data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Ability to manipulate search results, synonyms, and curations.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid embedding API keys directly in client-side code.
* Utilize backend services to proxy Typesense requests, keeping API keys secure on the server.
* Implement proper API key management, including secure storage (e.g., using environment variables or secrets management systems).
* Regularly rotate API keys.
* Utilize scoped API keys with the least privilege necessary for specific tasks.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Rate Limiting](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_rate_limiting.md)

**Description:** Lack of proper rate limiting on Typesense API endpoints allows attackers to send a high volume of requests, potentially leading to denial of service.

**How Typesense Contributes:** Typesense processes incoming API requests. Without adequate rate limiting, it can become overwhelmed by malicious traffic.

**Example:** An attacker floods the search endpoint with numerous queries, consuming server resources and making Typesense unavailable for legitimate users.

**Impact:** Denial of service, impacting the availability of search functionality and potentially the entire application relying on it.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure rate limiting within Typesense (if available).
* Implement rate limiting at the application level or using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Cloudflare).
* Monitor API request rates and set up alerts for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Search Queries](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_in_search_queries.md)

**Description:**  Maliciously crafted search queries can exploit vulnerabilities in how Typesense parses and executes them, leading to unexpected behavior or information disclosure.

**How Typesense Contributes:** Typesense provides a rich query language with features like filtering and sorting. Improper sanitization or validation of input could lead to vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a complex filter expression in the `filter_by` parameter that causes excessive resource consumption or reveals internal data structures.

**Impact:** Potential denial of service, information disclosure, or unexpected behavior of the search engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Sanitize and validate all user-provided input used in search queries.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when constructing queries programmatically.
* Stay updated with Typesense releases and security patches.
* Carefully review and test any complex query logic.

## Attack Surface: [Bulk Import/Export Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/bulk_importexport_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the bulk import or export functionalities allow attackers to inject malicious data or exfiltrate large amounts of data.

**How Typesense Contributes:** Typesense provides features for bulk data operations. If not properly secured, these can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious JSON file during a bulk import, potentially causing errors or injecting unwanted data into the index. An attacker with compromised credentials exports the entire dataset.

**Impact:** Data corruption, data injection, data exfiltration, potential denial of service if malicious data overwhelms the system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Validate and sanitize all data before importing it into Typesense.
* Implement strict access control for bulk import and export operations.
* Monitor bulk data operations for suspicious activity.
