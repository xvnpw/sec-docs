## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Interaction with Typesense API (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/direct_interaction_with_typesense_api__critical_node_.md)

This node represents the scenario where an attacker directly interacts with the Typesense API, bypassing the application's intended access controls. If successful, it allows the attacker to perform various malicious actions directly on the Typesense instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Authentication/Authorization (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_authenticationauthorization__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on gaining unauthorized access to the Typesense API. Attackers might try to circumvent authentication mechanisms or exploit authorization flaws to act as a legitimate user or administrator.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default API Key (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_api_key__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Many systems, including Typesense, might have default API keys set during initial setup. If these are not changed, an attacker can easily find and use them to gain full access to the Typesense API.

**Impact:** Complete control over Typesense data, including reading, modifying, and deleting information. Potential for service disruption and data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Typesense API Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_typesense_api_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves exploiting known or unknown vulnerabilities within the Typesense API itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Known CVEs (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_known_cves__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers actively search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of Typesense being used. If vulnerabilities exist and are not patched, attackers can leverage readily available exploit code to compromise the Typesense instance.

**Impact:** The impact varies depending on the specific vulnerability. It could range from remote code execution on the server hosting Typesense to data breaches or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect Interaction via Application Logic (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_interaction_via_application_logic__critical_node_.md)

This node represents vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates with and uses Typesense. Even if Typesense itself is secure, flaws in the application's logic can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Information Disclosure via Search Results (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/information_disclosure_via_search_results__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on attackers exploiting the search functionality to gain access to sensitive information that should not be accessible to them.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Data through Loose Permissions (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_data_through_loose_permissions__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If Typesense indexes sensitive data without proper access controls, or if the application doesn't adequately filter search results based on user permissions, attackers can craft search queries to retrieve this confidential information.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potentially leading to privacy violations, compliance breaches, and reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Credential Leakage/Mismanagement in Application (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/credential_leakagemismanagement_in_application__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This node highlights the risks associated with insecure handling of Typesense API credentials within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Typesense API Keys (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/expose_typesense_api_keys__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application stores Typesense API keys insecurely (e.g., hardcoded in the code, committed to version control, stored in easily accessible configuration files), attackers can discover these keys and use them to directly access the Typesense API.

**Impact:** Gaining full, authenticated access to the Typesense API, allowing attackers to perform any action a legitimate user with those credentials could perform, including data manipulation, deletion, and information retrieval. This bypasses any application-level access controls.
