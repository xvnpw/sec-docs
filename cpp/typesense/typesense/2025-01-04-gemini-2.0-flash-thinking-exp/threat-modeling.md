# Threat Model Analysis for typesense/typesense

## Threat: [Insecure API Keys](./threats/insecure_api_keys.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to valid Typesense API keys. This could happen through various means, such as finding them in exposed configuration files on the Typesense server itself or through a compromised administrative account on the Typesense instance. With valid API keys, the attacker can authenticate directly with the Typesense server.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can perform any action authorized by the compromised API key directly on the Typesense instance. This could include reading sensitive data indexed in Typesense, modifying or deleting data, creating new collections with malicious data, or even potentially impacting the availability of the Typesense service depending on the key's permissions.
    *   **Affected Component:** `API Authentication Module`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely store and manage API keys within the Typesense server configuration.
        *   Restrict API key scopes to the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   Implement regular API key rotation.
        *   Monitor API key usage for suspicious activity directly on the Typesense server.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive API Key Scopes](./threats/overly_permissive_api_key_scopes.md)

*   **Description:** API keys are configured with broader permissions than required within Typesense itself. An attacker who compromises such a key gains access to more capabilities than necessary directly on the Typesense instance. For example, a key intended only for searching might also have permissions to delete collections within Typesense.
    *   **Impact:** If the API key is compromised, the attacker can perform actions beyond what is needed, potentially leading to greater damage to the Typesense data and service, such as data deletion or service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `API Key Management Module`, `Authorization Module`
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when configuring API key scopes within Typesense.
        *   Carefully review and restrict the permissions granted to each API key.
        *   Regularly audit API key configurations within Typesense.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Typesense Snapshots/Backups](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_typesense_snapshotsbackups.md)

*   **Description:** Typesense snapshots or backups contain the indexed data. If these backups are not stored securely by the Typesense administrator, an attacker could gain access to them and potentially extract sensitive information directly from the backup files.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to all data indexed in Typesense, potentially leading to significant data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Snapshot Module`, `Backup Management`
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt Typesense snapshots and backups at rest.
        *   Store backups in secure locations with restricted access.
        *   Implement access controls for accessing and managing backups.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Typesense Software](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_typesense_software.md)

*   **Description:**  Undiscovered or unpatched security vulnerabilities exist within the Typesense codebase itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities directly on the Typesense server to gain unauthorized access, cause a denial of service, or compromise the integrity of the Typesense instance.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of potential impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including data breaches, service disruption, and complete compromise of the Typesense instance.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various components depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Typesense updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories from the Typesense project.
        *   Follow security best practices for deploying and configuring Typesense.
