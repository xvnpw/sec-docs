## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Caffe Libraries leading to Buffer Overflow](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_caffe_libraries_leading_to_buffer_overflow.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts malicious input data that, when processed by Caffe, overflows a buffer in memory. This can overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or application crashes.

**Why High-Risk:** Buffer overflows are classic vulnerabilities with a high impact (code execution). While exploitation can be complex, successful exploitation grants significant control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Caffe Libraries leading to Use-After-Free](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_caffe_libraries_leading_to_use-after-free.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker triggers a specific sequence of memory allocation and deallocation operations within Caffe, leading to a situation where the application attempts to access memory that has already been freed. This can result in crashes or, more critically, allow for arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reallocated with attacker-controlled data.

**Why High-Risk:** Use-after-free vulnerabilities are often exploitable for code execution and can be difficult to detect and prevent.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Caffe Libraries leading to Vulnerabilities in Caffe's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_caffe_libraries_leading_to_vulnerabilities_in_caffe's_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vector:** Caffe relies on external libraries. Attackers identify known vulnerabilities in these dependencies (e.g., in BLAS, Protobuf, OpenCV) and craft inputs or trigger specific functionalities within Caffe that utilize the vulnerable dependency, leading to exploitation (which could range from information disclosure to remote code execution).

**Why High-Risk:** Dependency vulnerabilities are common, and exploits are often publicly available, making this a relatively accessible attack vector with potentially high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model File Vulnerabilities via Maliciously Crafted `.caffemodel` leading to Code Execution via Deserialization](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_file_vulnerabilities_via_maliciously_crafted___caffemodel__leading_to_code_execution_v_2bf59955.md)

**Attack Vector:** If Caffe or custom layers within the model utilize insecure deserialization practices, an attacker can craft a malicious `.caffemodel` file containing serialized malicious objects. When Caffe loads this model, the malicious objects are deserialized, leading to the execution of arbitrary code on the server.

**Why High-Risk:** Code execution is the highest impact, and while the likelihood depends on the presence of custom layers and insecure deserialization, the potential damage is severe.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model File Vulnerabilities via Maliciously Crafted `.caffemodel` leading to Model Poisoning](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_file_vulnerabilities_via_maliciously_crafted___caffemodel__leading_to_model_poisoning.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a `.caffemodel` file where the model's weights have been subtly altered. This "poisoned" model, when used by the application, produces incorrect or biased outputs that can compromise the application's logic or lead to malicious outcomes (e.g., misclassification, incorrect decisions).

**Why High-Risk:** While not directly leading to code execution, model poisoning can have a significant impact on the application's integrity and reliability, and it can be very difficult to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Data Processing Vulnerabilities leading to Trigger Vulnerabilities in Image/Data Decoding Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_data_processing_vulnerabilities_leading_to_trigger_vulnerabilities_in_imagedata_decodi_3828ab0f.md)

**Attack Vector:** Caffe uses libraries like OpenCV to decode image and other data formats. Attackers craft malicious input data (e.g., specially crafted images) that exploit vulnerabilities within these decoding libraries. This can lead to crashes, denial of service, or even remote code execution.

**Why High-Risk:** This is a common and well-understood attack vector, with many known vulnerabilities in image processing libraries. Exploits are often readily available.
