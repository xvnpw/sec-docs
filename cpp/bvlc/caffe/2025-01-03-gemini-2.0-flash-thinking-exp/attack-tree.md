## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Model File Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_model_file_vulnerabilities.md)

**Inject Malicious Code/Payload via Model File:**
    * **Crafted Prototxt File:**
        * **Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities:** An attacker crafts a malicious `prototxt` file designed to exploit weaknesses in Caffe's parser. This can involve techniques like buffer overflows (providing excessively long input strings) or format string bugs (using format specifiers to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations). Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
    * **Crafted Caffemodel File:**
        * **Exploit Deserialization Vulnerabilities:** Attackers create a malicious `caffemodel` file that exploits vulnerabilities in the way Caffe deserializes the model data. Insecure deserialization can allow attackers to inject malicious objects or code that are executed when the model is loaded, leading to remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Input Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_input_vulnerabilities.md)

**Malicious Input Causing Caffe Crash/Exploit:**
    * **Exploiting Image Processing Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Crafted Image Files:** If the application processes images using Caffe, attackers can craft malicious image files that trigger vulnerabilities in the image decoding libraries used by Caffe (e.g., libjpeg, libpng) or potentially within Caffe's own image processing routines. These vulnerabilities can often lead to buffer overflows or other memory corruption issues, potentially resulting in code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Caffe Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_caffe_library_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Caffe Core:**
    * **Outdated Caffe Version:** Applications using older, unpatched versions of Caffe are vulnerable to publicly known security flaws. Attackers can leverage existing exploits for these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
    * **Unpatched Vulnerabilities:** Even the latest version of Caffe might contain undiscovered vulnerabilities (zero-day vulnerabilities). Attackers who discover such vulnerabilities can exploit them before patches are available.
**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Caffe's Dependencies:**
    * **Vulnerable Libraries:** Caffe relies on various third-party libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them through the Caffe application. This often involves providing specific inputs that trigger the vulnerabilities in the underlying libraries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Insecure Model Loading/Handling:**
    * **Unvalidated Model Paths:** If the application allows users or external sources to specify the path to the model file without proper validation, an attacker could provide a path to a malicious model file stored elsewhere on the system or a remote location. Loading this malicious model can lead to code execution if the model file itself is crafted to exploit vulnerabilities.
**API Misuse/Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Vulnerabilities in Custom Caffe Layers:** If the application developers have created custom Caffe layers (extensions to Caffe's functionality), these layers might contain security vulnerabilities if not implemented with security in mind. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities through specific inputs or by triggering certain execution paths within the custom layers.
