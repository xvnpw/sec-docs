## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Scan Dependencies for Vulnerabilities (Caffe Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_scan_dependencies_for_vulnerabilities__caffe_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Scan Dependencies for Vulnerabilities (Caffe Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Caffe's Dependencies:**  Specifically list all third-party libraries that Caffe directly depends on (e.g., protobuf, BLAS, OpenCV, CUDA/cuDNN).
    2.  **Use Dependency Scanning Tools:** Employ vulnerability scanning tools to check these *Caffe* dependencies for known security flaws. Tools like `OWASP Dependency-Check` (for C++ libs), `Snyk`, or `Trivy` can be used.
    3.  **Automate Scans in Caffe Build/Integration:** Integrate these scans into your Caffe build process or CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for vulnerabilities whenever Caffe or its dependencies are updated.
    4.  **Prioritize Caffe Dependency Vulnerabilities:** When analyzing scan results, prioritize vulnerabilities found in *Caffe's* direct dependencies due to their potential impact on Caffe's functionality and security.
    5.  **Patch or Upgrade Caffe Dependencies:**  Promptly address identified vulnerabilities by upgrading to patched versions of the vulnerable *Caffe* dependencies or applying vendor-provided patches if available.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Caffe Dependencies (High Severity):** Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated libraries used by Caffe to compromise the application through Caffe.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Caffe Dependencies (Medium Severity):** Compromised dependencies of Caffe can introduce malicious code that affects Caffe's operation and the application using it.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Caffe Dependencies:** High reduction in risk. Regularly scanning and patching *Caffe's* dependencies directly reduces the attack surface related to Caffe.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Caffe Dependencies:** Medium reduction in risk. Helps detect known vulnerabilities in *Caffe's* supply chain, but may not catch zero-day or sophisticated attacks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** CI/CD pipeline includes weekly dependency scanning using `OWASP Dependency-Check` for C++ dependencies relevant to Caffe and `pip-audit` for Python components if using pycaffe. Reports are reviewed by the security team with a focus on Caffe related findings.
*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation currently for scanning.  However, automated patching or upgrade process for Caffe dependencies could be improved.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Pin Dependency Versions (Caffe Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/pin_dependency_versions__caffe_specific_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Pin Dependency Versions (Caffe Specific)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Manage Caffe's Dependency Versions:**  Specifically focus on managing the versions of libraries that Caffe relies on (protobuf, BLAS, OpenCV, CUDA/cuDNN).
    2.  **Pin Exact Versions for Caffe Build:** In your Caffe build system (e.g., CMake), explicitly specify exact versions for these key dependencies instead of using version ranges. For example, link against `protobuf-3.20.1` instead of `protobuf>=3.0`.
    3.  **Reproducible Caffe Builds:** Ensure that your Caffe build process consistently uses these pinned versions to create reproducible Caffe binaries across different environments. This is crucial for consistent security posture.
    4.  **Controlled Updates of Caffe Dependencies:** When updating *Caffe's* dependencies, do so in a controlled manner. Test the updated Caffe build thoroughly before deploying to production to ensure compatibility and stability with the new dependency versions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Behavior from Caffe due to Dependency Updates (Medium Severity):** Uncontrolled updates of Caffe's dependencies can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even security issues within Caffe itself.
    *   **Build Instability for Caffe (Low Severity):** Inconsistent dependency versions can make Caffe builds unstable and harder to debug, potentially masking security issues.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Behavior from Caffe due to Dependency Updates:** Medium reduction in risk. Pinning versions ensures Caffe runs with tested and known dependency versions, reducing risks from unexpected updates.
    *   **Build Instability for Caffe:** High reduction in risk. Pinning versions ensures consistent and reproducible Caffe builds.
*   **Currently Implemented:** `requirements.txt` for Python components (pycaffe tools, scripts) pins exact versions. CMake configuration for Caffe build pins specific versions of protobuf and OpenCV.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Currently, BLAS and CUDA/cuDNN library versions used by Caffe are managed at the system level and not explicitly pinned within the Caffe project's build configuration.  Containerization or a more robust dependency management system for Caffe's core C++ dependencies would improve this.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic Caffe model versioning is used, and Caffe model files are stored in version control.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive provenance metadata tracking specifically for Caffe models is not fully implemented. A more structured system for recording and managing provenance information for Caffe models should be developed and integrated into the Caffe model lifecycle.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation (for Caffe Inference)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation__for_caffe_inference_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation (for Caffe Inference)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Caffe Input Specifications:** Clearly define the expected format, data type, range, and size of input data that will be fed into your Caffe models for inference. This specification should be based on the Caffe model's requirements.
    2.  **Implement Input Validation Logic for Caffe:** Write code to rigorously validate *all* input data *before* it is passed to Caffe for inference. Validation should include:
        *   **Data Type Checks for Caffe Input:** Verify that input data is of the expected data type (e.g., image, numerical array) required by the Caffe model.
        *   **Format Checks for Caffe Input:** Validate the input format (e.g., image format, data serialization format) expected by Caffe.
        *   **Range Checks for Caffe Input Values:** Ensure input values are within acceptable ranges and boundaries that Caffe can handle safely and as expected.
        *   **Size Limits for Caffe Input:** Enforce limits on the size and dimensions of input data to prevent excessively large inputs from being processed by Caffe.
    3.  **Error Handling for Invalid Caffe Input:** Implement robust error handling for cases where input data fails validation. Reject invalid inputs and provide informative error messages indicating the validation failure. Log attempts to provide invalid input for security monitoring related to Caffe usage.
    4.  **Centralized Caffe Input Validation:** Ideally, centralize the input validation logic for Caffe in a reusable component to ensure consistent validation across all parts of your application that interact with Caffe for inference.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Input Data Exploits targeting Caffe (Medium to High Severity):** Maliciously crafted input data could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in Caffe's processing logic, leading to crashes within Caffe, unexpected behavior during Caffe inference, or even code execution within the Caffe context.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Caffe (Medium Severity):** Large or malformed inputs could consume excessive resources during Caffe processing, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS affecting Caffe-based functionality.
    *   **Model Poisoning via Input Manipulation (Low to Medium Severity):** While less direct for inference-only applications, in scenarios with feedback loops, manipulated inputs to Caffe could potentially influence model behavior over time if not properly validated.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Input Data Exploits targeting Caffe:** High reduction in risk. Strict input validation significantly reduces the likelihood of exploiting vulnerabilities in Caffe through malicious inputs.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Caffe:** Medium reduction in risk. Input size limits and validation help prevent resource exhaustion in Caffe from oversized or malformed inputs.
    *   **Model Poisoning via Input Manipulation:** Low reduction in risk. Input validation is not a primary defense against model poisoning, but it can prevent some forms of malicious input that might be used in poisoning attempts related to Caffe.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic input shape and data type checks are performed before feeding data to Caffe models. Image format validation is done using libraries like OpenCV.
*   **Missing Implementation:** More comprehensive range and boundary checks for input values specifically for Caffe inputs are needed.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Caffe:** High reduction in risk. Regularly updating Caffe to the latest stable version ensures that known security vulnerabilities in Caffe are patched promptly, reducing the risk of exploitation.
    *   **Software Bugs and Instability in Caffe:** Medium reduction in risk. Updates often include bug fixes that improve the stability and reliability of the Caffe framework itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Developers are generally aware of the need to keep dependencies updated, including Caffe.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A formal, documented process for proactively monitoring Caffe releases, security advisories, and planning/scheduling Caffe updates is missing. Implement a system for tracking Caffe releases and scheduling regular update evaluations and deployments for Caffe.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Compile Caffe with Security Flags](./mitigation_strategies/compile_caffe_with_security_flags.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Compile Caffe with Security Flags
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Caffe Compiler:** Determine the compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang) used to build the Caffe framework from source.
    2.  **Enable Security Compiler Flags for Caffe Build:** When compiling Caffe from source, add specific compiler flags to your Caffe build configuration (e.g., CMakeLists.txt, Makefiles) that enhance the security of the compiled Caffe binaries. Recommended flags include:
        *   **AddressSanitizer (`-fsanitize=address` for GCC/Clang):** Enable AddressSanitizer during Caffe development and testing builds. This runtime tool detects memory safety issues (buffer overflows, use-after-free) within Caffe code.
        *   **MemorySanitizer (`-fsanitize=memory` for Clang):** Enable MemorySanitizer during Caffe development and testing builds to detect uninitialized memory reads within Caffe.
        *   **Fortify Source (`-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2` for GCC):** Include Fortify Source in production Caffe builds to provide runtime buffer overflow detection within Caffe.
        *   **Position Independent Executable (`-fPIE` and `-pie` for GCC/Clang):** Enable PIE for Caffe executables and shared libraries to enable Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR), making code injection attacks against Caffe harder.
        *   **Relocation Read-Only (`-Wl,-z,relro` and `-Wl,-z,now` for GCC/Clang):** Use RELRO flags when linking Caffe binaries to mark relocation sections as read-only after startup, preventing certain types of code modification attacks against Caffe.
    3.  **Test Caffe with Security Flags:** Build and thoroughly test Caffe with these security flags enabled, especially AddressSanitizer and MemorySanitizer in development and testing environments, to proactively identify and fix memory safety issues within the Caffe codebase.
    4.  **Consider Performance Impact of Caffe Security Flags:** Be aware that some security flags (especially sanitizers like AddressSanitizer) can have a performance impact on Caffe. Use sanitizers primarily in development and testing. For production Caffe builds, use optimized flags like `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, `-fPIE`, and `-Wl,-z,relro`, `-Wl,-z,now` which offer security benefits with less performance overhead.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in Caffe (High Severity):** Buffer overflows, use-after-free, and other memory safety issues are common sources of vulnerabilities in C/C++ code like Caffe.
    *   **Code Injection Attacks targeting Caffe (Medium to High Severity):** PIE and RELRO flags make it significantly harder for attackers to inject and execute arbitrary code within the Caffe process by exploiting memory safety vulnerabilities in Caffe.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in Caffe:** High reduction in risk (in development/testing with sanitizers). Sanitizers are very effective at detecting memory safety issues within Caffe during development. Fortify Source provides runtime protection in production Caffe.
    *   **Code Injection Attacks targeting Caffe:** Medium to High reduction in risk. PIE and RELRO significantly increase the difficulty of code injection attacks against Caffe.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Caffe is compiled with standard optimization flags, but not specifically with security hardening flags.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Security flags like `-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=2`, `-fPIE`, and `-Wl,-z,relro`, `-Wl,-z,now` are not currently enabled in the production Caffe build process. AddressSanitizer and MemorySanitizer are not routinely used in development/testing builds of Caffe. These security flags should be integrated into the Caffe build system for both development/testing and production deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Least Privilege Principle (for Caffe Processes)](./mitigation_strategies/least_privilege_principle__for_caffe_processes_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Least Privilege Principle (for Caffe Processes)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Caffe Processes in Application:** Determine all processes within your application that directly execute Caffe components (e.g., Caffe inference servers, model loading services, data preprocessing steps using Caffe tools).
    2.  **Create Dedicated User Accounts for Caffe:** Create dedicated, separate user accounts with *minimal* privileges specifically for running these Caffe processes. Avoid using root or administrator accounts for Caffe execution.
    3.  **Restrict File System Access for Caffe Processes:** Configure file system permissions to strictly limit the access of Caffe processes to only the *necessary* files and directories. This includes:
        *   **Read-only access to Caffe binaries and libraries.**
        *   **Read-only access to Caffe model files (in most inference scenarios).**
        *   **Write access only to specific temporary directories if absolutely required by Caffe processes.**
        *   **Deny access to sensitive system files and directories.**
    4.  **Network Access Control for Caffe Processes:** If Caffe processes require network access (e.g., for serving inference requests), restrict this access to only the *necessary* ports and protocols. Use firewalls or network segmentation to minimize the network exposure of Caffe processes.
    5.  **Resource Limits for Caffe Processes:** Implement resource limits (CPU, memory, GPU, disk I/O) specifically for Caffe processes using operating system mechanisms (e.g., `ulimit`, cgroups, container resource limits). This helps prevent resource exhaustion and contain potential DoS attacks targeting Caffe.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Caffe Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):** If Caffe processes run with excessive privileges, vulnerabilities within Caffe or the application code interacting with Caffe could be exploited to gain higher privileges on the system through the Caffe process.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Compromised Caffe Process (Medium Severity):** If Caffe processes have broad access to the file system or network, attackers who manage to compromise a Caffe process could potentially use it as a stepping stone to move laterally to other parts of the system or network.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Compromised Caffe Process (Medium Severity):** Processes running Caffe with unlimited resources could be exploited to cause DoS by consuming excessive system resources, impacting other services and applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Caffe Vulnerabilities:** High reduction in risk. Running Caffe processes with least privilege significantly limits the potential for privilege escalation even if vulnerabilities are exploited within Caffe.
    *   **Lateral Movement from Compromised Caffe Process:** Medium reduction in risk. Restricting file system and network access for Caffe processes limits the possibilities for lateral movement if a Caffe process is compromised.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion due to Compromised Caffe Process:** Medium reduction in risk. Resource limits help prevent resource exhaustion and contain DoS attacks that might target Caffe processes.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Caffe processes are run under dedicated service accounts, but a detailed review and hardening of permissions specifically for Caffe processes based on the principle of least privilege is needed. Resource limits are generally applied at the system level but not specifically tuned for Caffe processes.
*   **Missing Implementation:** A thorough security review and hardening of permissions for Caffe service accounts is needed to strictly adhere to the principle of least privilege for all Caffe-related processes. Resource limits specifically tailored for Caffe processes should be configured and enforced.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Quotas (for Caffe Inference)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_quotas__for_caffe_inference_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Resource Limits and Quotas (for Caffe Inference)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Caffe Inference Resource Usage:**  Thoroughly analyze the resource consumption (CPU, memory, GPU memory, disk I/O) of Caffe inference processes under both normal and peak load conditions. Understand the typical resource footprint of Caffe inference in your application.
    2.  **Set Resource Limits for Caffe Processes:** Configure resource limits and quotas specifically for Caffe inference processes using operating system mechanisms (e.g., `ulimit`, cgroups, container resource limits). Set appropriate limits for:
        *   **CPU Time for Caffe Inference:** Limit the maximum CPU time a Caffe inference process can consume per request or over a given period.
        *   **Memory Usage for Caffe Inference:** Limit the maximum memory (RAM) a Caffe inference process can allocate.
        *   **GPU Usage for Caffe Inference (if applicable):** Limit GPU memory and compute resources that Caffe inference processes can utilize.
        *   **File Descriptors for Caffe Inference:** Limit the number of open file descriptors for Caffe inference processes.
        *   **Process Count for Caffe Inference:** Limit the number of processes that can be spawned for Caffe inference.
    3.  **Monitor Caffe Inference Resource Usage:** Implement monitoring of resource usage for Caffe inference processes in production. Track metrics like CPU usage, memory consumption, and GPU utilization to ensure that resource limits are effective and are not causing performance bottlenecks under normal load.
    4.  **Alerting for Caffe Resource Limit Violations:** Set up alerts to automatically notify administrators if Caffe inference processes exceed configured resource limits. This can indicate potential DoS attacks targeting Caffe or resource exhaustion issues within Caffe.
    5.  **Tune Caffe Resource Limits:** Regularly review and tune resource limits for Caffe inference processes based on monitoring data, performance testing, and changes in application load or Caffe models.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) targeting Caffe Inference (High Severity):** Attackers could attempt to exhaust system resources by sending excessive inference requests or malicious inputs that cause Caffe to consume excessive CPU, memory, or GPU resources, leading to DoS of Caffe-based functionality.
    *   **Resource Starvation due to Runaway Caffe Processes (Medium Severity):** Runaway Caffe inference processes or resource leaks within Caffe could starve other application components or services of resources, impacting overall application performance and stability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) targeting Caffe Inference:** High reduction in risk. Resource limits effectively prevent resource exhaustion DoS attacks against Caffe inference by capping the resources Caffe processes can consume.
    *   **Resource Starvation due to Runaway Caffe Processes:** Medium reduction in risk. Resource limits help prevent runaway Caffe processes from starving other components of resources, improving overall system stability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic OS-level resource limits are in place for all services, but they are not specifically tuned and optimized for Caffe inference processes based on their unique resource profiles.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Resource limits and quotas specifically tailored for Caffe inference processes, based on detailed analysis of their resource usage patterns, should be implemented. Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for resource limit violations by Caffe processes should be set up.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Size Limits (for Caffe Inference)](./mitigation_strategies/input_size_limits__for_caffe_inference_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Size Limits (for Caffe Inference)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine Caffe Input Size Limits:** Analyze the expected size and complexity of input data for your Caffe models under normal application usage. Determine reasonable upper bounds for input size that Caffe can efficiently process without excessive resource consumption. Define limits for:
        *   **Image Dimensions for Caffe Input:** Limit the maximum width and height of input images processed by Caffe.
        *   **Data Array Size for Caffe Input:** Limit the maximum size (number of elements) of input data arrays fed to Caffe.
        *   **File Size for Caffe Input Files:** Limit the maximum file size for uploaded input files (e.g., image files) that will be processed by Caffe.
    2.  **Enforce Input Size Limits Before Caffe Inference:** Implement input size limit checks in your application code *before* input data is passed to Caffe for inference. Reject inputs that exceed these limits.
    3.  **Reject Oversized Inputs for Caffe:** If input data exceeds the defined size limits for Caffe, reject the input and prevent it from being processed by Caffe. Return informative error messages to clients indicating why the input was rejected (e.g., "Input image too large").
    4.  **Log Rejected Oversized Caffe Inputs:** Log attempts to provide oversized input data to Caffe for security monitoring and potential detection of malicious activity targeting Caffe.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Caffe Inference via Large Inputs (Medium Severity):** Attackers could send excessively large or complex inputs designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, GPU) during Caffe inference, leading to DoS of Caffe-based functionality.
    *   **Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in Caffe (Low to Medium Severity):** In some scenarios, processing extremely large inputs by Caffe, if internal size limits are not robust, could potentially trigger buffer overflow vulnerabilities within Caffe or related libraries. Input size limits provide a defense-in-depth measure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Caffe Inference via Large Inputs:** Medium reduction in risk. Input size limits effectively prevent resource exhaustion DoS attacks against Caffe inference caused by oversized inputs.
    *   **Potential Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities in Caffe:** Low to Medium reduction in risk. Input size limits provide an extra layer of defense against potential buffer overflows in Caffe that might be triggered by very large inputs.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic image dimension limits are enforced in the image preprocessing pipeline before Caffe inference.
*   **Missing Implementation:** More comprehensive input size limits should be implemented for all types of inputs processed by Caffe, including limits on data array sizes and file sizes. Logging of rejected oversized inputs specifically for Caffe inference should be added for security monitoring.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Timeout Mechanisms (for Caffe Inference Operations)](./mitigation_strategies/timeout_mechanisms__for_caffe_inference_operations_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Timeout Mechanisms (for Caffe Inference Operations)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Long-Running Caffe Operations:** Identify specific Caffe inference operations or other Caffe-related tasks within your application that could potentially take a long time to complete, especially when processing malicious or malformed inputs, or due to unexpected issues within Caffe.
    2.  **Implement Timeouts for Caffe Inference Calls:** Set appropriate timeout values for these identified long-running Caffe inference operations. Use programming language or framework-specific timeout mechanisms to enforce these limits (e.g., timeouts in threading libraries, API request timeouts wrapping Caffe calls).
    3.  **Graceful Error Handling on Caffe Timeout:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage timeout situations during Caffe inference. When a timeout occurs during a Caffe operation:
        *   **Terminate the Caffe Operation:** Ensure the Caffe inference operation is properly terminated and does not continue to consume resources indefinitely.
        *   **Release Caffe Resources:** Release any resources (memory, GPU memory) held by the timed-out Caffe operation.
        *   **Return Error Response:** Return an appropriate error response to the client or calling component indicating that the Caffe inference request timed out.
        *   **Log Caffe Timeout Events:** Log timeout events, including details about the Caffe operation that timed out and the input data (if possible), for monitoring, debugging, and potential security incident investigation.
    4.  **Tune Caffe Inference Timeouts:** Carefully tune timeout values for Caffe inference operations. Set timeouts to be long enough to allow legitimate inference requests to complete under normal load and with typical inputs, but short enough to prevent indefinite resource holding in case of issues or malicious inputs targeting Caffe.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Caffe Inference via Long-Running Operations (Medium Severity):** Attackers could send malicious inputs that cause Caffe to get stuck in long-running or infinite loops during inference, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS of Caffe-based functionality.
    *   **Resource Holding by Caffe Processes (Medium Severity):** Long-running Caffe inference operations without timeouts can hold system resources (CPU, memory, GPU) indefinitely, even if the client disconnects or the request is no longer valid. This can lead to resource leaks and potential instability of the application and system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Caffe Inference via Long-Running Operations:** Medium reduction in risk. Timeouts prevent Caffe from getting stuck in indefinite loops and consuming resources indefinitely, mitigating DoS risks.
    *   **Resource Holding by Caffe Processes:** Medium reduction in risk. Timeouts ensure that resources are released even if Caffe inference operations take longer than expected or encounter issues, preventing resource leaks and improving system stability.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Default timeouts are configured at the API gateway level, which might apply to overall API requests, but explicit timeouts specifically for Caffe inference calls within the application code are not implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Explicit timeout mechanisms should be implemented directly for Caffe inference calls within the application code. Timeouts should be carefully tuned based on Caffe performance characteristics and expected inference times for different Caffe models and input types. Detailed logging of timeout events specifically related to Caffe inference should be added for monitoring and debugging purposes.
