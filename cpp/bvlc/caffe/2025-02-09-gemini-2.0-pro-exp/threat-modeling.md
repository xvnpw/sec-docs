# Threat Model Analysis for bvlc/caffe

## Threat: [Malicious Model Substitution (Prototxt and Caffemodel)](./threats/malicious_model_substitution__prototxt_and_caffemodel_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces the legitimate `prototxt` (network architecture definition) and `caffemodel` (trained weights) files with malicious versions.  While the *attack vector* might involve application-level vulnerabilities (e.g., file system access), the *vulnerability exploited* is the lack of integrity checking *within Caffe's model loading process*. Caffe itself does not inherently verify the integrity of the files it loads.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the model's behavior.  The attacker can cause incorrect predictions, denial of service (by making the model crash or consume excessive resources), or potentially execute arbitrary code if the malicious model exploits a vulnerability within Caffe itself.
*   **Affected Caffe Component:** `Net::Net()` (constructor that loads the model), `ReadProtoFromTextFile()`, `ReadProtoFromBinaryFile()`. These functions are the direct points of interaction where the malicious files are processed.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Cryptographic Hashing (External to Caffe):**  *Before* calling Caffe's loading functions, calculate and verify SHA-256 (or stronger) hashes of both `prototxt` and `caffemodel` files.  This is *crucial* because Caffe does not do this internally.
    *   **Digital Signatures (External to Caffe):** Digitally sign the model files and verify the signature *before* loading them into Caffe. Again, this verification must happen *outside* of Caffe.
    * **Read-Only Filesystem (If Possible):** If the deployment environment allows, mount the directory containing the model files as read-only *after* the application has started (and verified the model integrity). This prevents modification even if an attacker gains some level of access.

## Threat: [Adversarial Input (Evasion Attack)](./threats/adversarial_input__evasion_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed input (e.g., an image with subtle, imperceptible perturbations) that causes the Caffe model to misclassify it. This exploits the inherent sensitivity of deep neural networks to small input changes.  The vulnerability lies within the *trained model's* (and thus Caffe's inference engine's) response to these inputs.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect predictions, leading to application malfunction, incorrect decisions, or potentially denial of service.
*   **Affected Caffe Component:** `Net::Forward()` (the function that performs inference), and the specific layers within the network (e.g., convolutional layers, fully connected layers) that are susceptible to the adversarial perturbations. The vulnerability is inherent in how these layers process information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Adversarial Training (Training-Time Mitigation):** Train the model on a dataset that includes adversarial examples. This makes the resulting model (and thus Caffe's inference with that model) more robust.
    *   **Input Preprocessing (Limited Effectiveness):** Apply preprocessing like smoothing or adding noise, but this is often not a complete solution.
    *   **Ensemble Methods:** Use multiple models (loaded and used via Caffe) and combine their predictions.
    *   **Adversarial Detection (Requires External Tools/Logic):** Implement methods to *detect* potential adversarial examples. This often involves analyzing Caffe's internal layer activations, which requires custom code interacting with Caffe's API.

## Threat: [Caffe Library Tampering](./threats/caffe_library_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker modifies the compiled Caffe library files (e.g., `libcaffe.so`, `libcaffe.a`). This is a direct attack on the Caffe framework itself.
*   **Impact:** Complete control over the Caffe inference process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Caffe Component:** The entire Caffe library (all compiled code).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use a FIM tool to monitor the Caffe library files for changes.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Caffe and its dependencies updated. Monitor security advisories.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application using Caffe with minimal privileges.
    *   **Containerization:** Isolate the Caffe environment using containers (e.g., Docker).

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (DoS via Input)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__dos_via_input_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted input that causes Caffe to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, GPU), leading to denial of service. This exploits potential inefficiencies or vulnerabilities in Caffe's handling of certain input types or sizes.
*   **Impact:** Application unavailability.
*   **Affected Caffe Component:** `Net::Forward()`, and potentially specific layers (e.g., convolutional layers) that are computationally expensive or have vulnerabilities related to input size handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation (External to Caffe):** *Before* passing input to Caffe, enforce strict limits on input size and data type.
    *   **Resource Limits (Operating System Level):** Use operating system mechanisms (e.g., `ulimit` on Linux) to limit the resources Caffe can consume.
    *   **Timeouts (Application Level, Wrapping Caffe Calls):** Implement timeouts for `Net::Forward()` calls. This requires wrapping Caffe calls in application logic.
    *   **GPU Memory Management (Within Caffe and Application Code):** Carefully manage GPU memory if using a GPU. Use Caffe's memory pooling features if appropriate.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Caffe Vulnerabilities (Code Execution)](./threats/exploitation_of_caffe_vulnerabilities__code_execution_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *within the Caffe library itself* (e.g., a buffer overflow) to execute arbitrary code. This is a direct attack on Caffe.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying server.
*   **Affected Caffe Component:** Potentially any part of the Caffe library, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Caffe and all dependencies updated. Monitor security advisories. This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the Caffe library for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application using Caffe with minimal privileges.
    *   **Memory Protection (OS Level):** Ensure ASLR and DEP are enabled.
    *   **Sandboxing/Containerization:** Isolate Caffe in a sandboxed environment or container.
    *   **Input Fuzzing (Development/Testing Phase):** Use fuzzing to test Caffe's handling of various inputs and identify potential vulnerabilities *before* deployment.
