# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bvlc/caffe

## Mitigation Strategy: [Adversarial Training (Caffe-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/adversarial_training__caffe-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Generate Adversarial Examples:** Use tools (which may or may not integrate directly with Caffe's Python interface) to create adversarial examples. The key here is that the *target* of the attack is the Caffe model.
2.  **Augment Training Data:** Add these generated examples to your Caffe training data (typically LMDB or LevelDB datasets). This requires modifying your data preparation scripts to include the adversarial examples.
3.  **Modify Solver Protobuf:** Adjust your Caffe solver prototxt file (e.g., `solver.prototxt`). You might need to adjust learning rates, weight decay, or other hyperparameters to effectively train with adversarial examples.
4.  **Retrain with Caffe:** Use the Caffe command-line tools (or Python interface) to retrain your model using the augmented dataset and modified solver.  This is a direct interaction with the Caffe framework.
5.  **Iterative Process:** Repeat the process, generating new adversarial examples *based on the retrained Caffe model*.
6.  **Monitor Caffe Logs:** Carefully monitor Caffe's training logs (output to the console or log files) to track the model's performance on both clean and adversarial data during training.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Model Poisoning/Adversarial Attacks (High Severity):** Directly improves the Caffe model's robustness against adversarial inputs.
    *   **Data Integrity Violations (High Severity):** Maintains the integrity of Caffe model predictions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Model Poisoning/Adversarial Attacks:** Significant reduction in attack success rate, directly impacting the Caffe model's behavior.
    *   **Data Integrity Violations:** High impact; improves the reliability of the Caffe model.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (e.g., Modifications to `train.py` using `caffe.Net`, changes to `solver.prototxt`, custom data layer for adversarial examples) *Replace with your project's details.*

*   **Missing Implementation:** (e.g., "Adversarial training not implemented for specific Caffe layers.", "No automated generation of adversarial examples within the Caffe training loop.") *Replace with your project's details.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Caffe-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__caffe-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define Input Blob Specifications:**  Clearly define the expected dimensions, data type (e.g., `float32`), and range (e.g., 0-255 for image pixels) of the input blob(s) to your Caffe model. This is directly tied to the `input_shape` defined in your `deploy.prototxt`.
2.  **Pre-Inference Checks:** *Before* calling `net.forward()` (in Python) or the equivalent C++ code, implement checks to ensure the input data matches the defined specifications. This is crucial *before* the data enters the Caffe network.
3.  **Data Layer Validation (Less Common, but Possible):**  In *very* specific cases, you could implement custom data layers (in C++ or Python) that perform some basic validation *within* the Caffe framework itself.  This is less common and more complex than pre-inference checks.
4. **Reject/Error Handling:** If validation fails, *do not* pass the data to Caffe.  Return an error or throw an exception.
5. **Sanitize Valid Inputs (Optional and Caffe-Related):** If using image data, consider using Caffe's built-in image preprocessing capabilities (e.g., mean subtraction, scaling) *within* the `deploy.prototxt` or as part of a data layer. This can sometimes disrupt adversarial perturbations, although it's not a primary defense. This is a Caffe-specific configuration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Model Poisoning/Adversarial Attacks (Medium Severity):** Can prevent some basic attacks that rely on out-of-range values.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessively large inputs (if size checks are done before Caffe processing).
    *   **Code Injection (Low Severity, Indirect):** Reduces the risk of exploiting vulnerabilities in Caffe's input handling.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Model Poisoning/Adversarial Attacks:** Moderate impact; effective against simple attacks.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** High impact if size checks are done *before* Caffe processing.
    *   **Code Injection:** Low, indirect impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (e.g., Checks before `net.forward()` in `inference.py`, custom data layer with validation) *Replace with your project's details.*

*   **Missing Implementation:** (e.g., "No validation of input data type.", "Missing checks for image dimensions before `net.forward()`.") *Replace with your project's details.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Model Integrity Verification (Caffe-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/model_integrity_verification__caffe-specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Checksum Generation:** After training and saving your Caffe model (`.caffemodel` file), generate a cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256).
2.  **Secure Checksum Storage:** Store this hash separately and securely.
3.  **Verification Before `caffe.Net()`:** *Before* creating a `caffe.Net` object (in Python) or the equivalent C++ code to load the model, recalculate the checksum of the `.caffemodel` file.
4.  **Comparison:** Compare the recalculated checksum with the securely stored checksum.
5.  **Rejection on Mismatch:** If the checksums *do not* match, *do not* proceed with loading the model using `caffe.Net()`. Raise an error or exception. This prevents the Caffe framework from loading a potentially compromised model.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Insecure Model Loading (High Severity):** Prevents loading a tampered-with Caffe model, which is a direct threat to the Caffe framework's operation.
    *   **Data Integrity Violations (High Severity):** Ensures the integrity of the Caffe model itself.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insecure Model Loading:** High impact; directly prevents the Caffe framework from using a compromised model.
    *   **Data Integrity Violations:** High impact; ensures the Caffe model is the intended one.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (e.g., Checksum verification before `caffe.Net()` in `model_loading.py`) *Replace with your project's details.*

*   **Missing Implementation:** (e.g., "Checksum verification is not performed before loading the Caffe model.") *Replace with your project's details.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Defensive Distillation (Caffe-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/defensive_distillation__caffe-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Train Teacher Model:** Train your initial Caffe model (the "teacher") as usual.
    2.  **Generate Soft Labels:** Use the trained teacher model to generate "soft" labels (probabilities from the softmax layer) for your training data. This involves running inference with the teacher model using `net.forward()`.
    3.  **Train Student Model:** Train a second Caffe model (the "student") using the *soft* labels from the teacher model as the target, instead of the original "hard" labels. This requires modifying your training data to use the soft labels.
    4. **Adjust Temperature:** Use a "temperature" parameter in the softmax function of *both* the teacher and student models during training. This controls the "softness" of the probabilities. A higher temperature produces softer probabilities. This is a direct modification to the Caffe model definition (prototxt).
    5. **Deploy Student Model:** Deploy the trained student model for inference.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Model Poisoning/Adversarial Attacks (Medium Severity):** Makes the model less sensitive to small input perturbations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Model Poisoning/Adversarial Attacks:** Moderate impact; reduces the effectiveness of some adversarial attacks.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (e.g., Separate training scripts for teacher and student models, modified prototxt files with temperature parameter) *Replace with your project's details.*

*   **Missing Implementation:** (e.g., "Defensive distillation not implemented.", "Temperature parameter not used.") *Replace with your project's details.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Feature Squeezing (Caffe-Specific, Limited)](./mitigation_strategies/feature_squeezing__caffe-specific__limited_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Bit Depth Reduction:** If using image data, reduce the color bit depth of the input images *before* feeding them to the Caffe model. This can be done as a preprocessing step before calling `net.forward()`.
    2. **Spatial Smoothing:** Apply spatial smoothing (e.g., using a Gaussian filter) to the input images *before* feeding them to the Caffe model. This can also be done as a preprocessing step.
    3. **Caffe's Image Preprocessing (Limited):** Utilize Caffe's built-in image preprocessing capabilities (mean subtraction, scaling) within the `deploy.prototxt` or a data layer. While not primarily designed for feature squeezing, these transformations can have a similar effect.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Model Poisoning/Adversarial Attacks (Low-Medium Severity):** Reduces the search space for adversarial attacks.

* **Impact:**
    * **Model Poisoning/Adversarial Attacks:** Low to moderate impact; can be effective against some attacks, but may be bypassed by others.

* **Currently Implemented:** (e.g., Preprocessing steps before `net.forward()`, modifications to `deploy.prototxt`) *Replace with your project's details.*

* **Missing Implementation:** (e.g., "Feature squeezing techniques not applied.", "Only basic Caffe preprocessing is used.") *Replace with your project's details.*
