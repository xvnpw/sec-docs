Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "JavaScript Code Injection in Design Documents" attack surface for an Apache CouchDB application, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: JavaScript Code Injection in CouchDB Design Documents

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with JavaScript code injection in CouchDB design documents, identify specific vulnerabilities, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level overview.  We aim to provide the development team with the knowledge needed to build a secure CouchDB implementation.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack surface of JavaScript code injection within CouchDB design documents.  This includes:

*   **Design Document Components:**  Views (map and reduce functions), show functions, list functions, and validation functions.
*   **Injection Vectors:**  How malicious JavaScript can be introduced into these components.
*   **Execution Context:**  The limitations and capabilities of the CouchDB JavaScript sandbox.
*   **Impact Analysis:**  Specific scenarios of data breaches, modifications, and denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Mitigation Techniques:**  Detailed, practical steps to prevent and mitigate this vulnerability.

This analysis *does not* cover other CouchDB attack surfaces (e.g., network-level attacks, authentication bypasses) except where they directly relate to this specific injection vulnerability.

### 1.3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Identify potential attackers, their motivations, and attack vectors.
2.  **Code Review (Hypothetical):**  Analyze example design document code (both vulnerable and secure) to illustrate the problem and solutions.
3.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Explore known vulnerabilities and exploit techniques related to JavaScript injection in CouchDB.
4.  **Best Practices Research:**  Review CouchDB documentation, security advisories, and industry best practices for secure coding in JavaScript.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Propose specific, actionable mitigation strategies, prioritizing those with the highest impact and feasibility.
6. **Testing Recommendations:** Suggest testing strategies to verify the effectiveness of mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis

### 2.1. Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Profiles:**
    *   **Unauthenticated Users:**  If the CouchDB instance allows unauthenticated writes (a highly discouraged configuration), anyone can attempt to inject malicious code.
    *   **Authenticated Users (Low Privilege):**  Users with write access to the database, but potentially limited permissions, might attempt to escalate privileges or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Compromised Accounts:**  Attackers who have gained access to legitimate user credentials.
    *   **Insider Threats:**  Malicious or negligent developers or administrators with direct access to the CouchDB instance.

*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Data Theft:**  Stealing sensitive data stored in the database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:**  Altering or deleting data to cause disruption or fraud.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Crashing the CouchDB instance or making it unresponsive.
    *   **Reputation Damage:**  Defacing or compromising the application using the CouchDB data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining higher-level access within the CouchDB instance or the underlying system (though the sandbox limits this).

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct Document Insertion:**  Submitting a new document with malicious JavaScript embedded in a field intended to be processed by a design document function.
    *   **Document Update:**  Modifying an existing document to include malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Design Document Modification:**  Directly altering the design document itself (requires higher privileges, but is a critical attack vector).

### 2.2. Vulnerability Analysis & Execution Context

CouchDB's JavaScript environment is sandboxed, which limits the impact of injected code.  However, it's crucial to understand the sandbox's limitations:

*   **`eval()` and `Function()`:**  While CouchDB *discourages* their use, they are *not* inherently blocked.  If user-supplied data is passed to these functions, it *will* execute.  This is the primary vulnerability.
*   **Access to `this`:**  Within design document functions, `this` refers to the current document.  Malicious code can access and modify the current document's properties.
*   **Access to `emit()`:**  In map functions, `emit()` is used to generate view results.  Injected code can manipulate the emitted keys and values, potentially corrupting the view or exfiltrating data.
*   **Access to `getRow()`:** In list and show functions, getRow() is used to access view rows. Malicious code can use this to access other documents.
*   **No Network Access:**  The sandbox *does* prevent direct network access (e.g., making HTTP requests).  This limits the attacker's ability to directly exfiltrate data *out* of the CouchDB environment.  However, they can still manipulate data *within* CouchDB to achieve their goals.
*   **No File System Access:**  The sandbox prevents access to the underlying file system.
*   **Limited Global Scope:**  The global scope is restricted, preventing access to many standard JavaScript objects and functions.  However, core JavaScript functionality remains available.
*   **Validation Functions:** These are *designed* to reject documents.  However, a cleverly crafted validation function could *modify* a document before rejecting it, or could be bypassed entirely if the attacker can modify the design document itself.

**Example (Vulnerable Map Function):**

```javascript
function(doc) {
  if (doc.type === 'comment') {
    eval("var x = " + doc.user_input + ";"); // VULNERABLE!
    emit(doc.post_id, x);
  }
}
```

If `doc.user_input` contains `"1; log('hello');"`, the `log` function will be executed.  Worse, if it contains code to modify other documents, that code will execute.

**Example (Vulnerable Validation Function):**

```javascript
function(newDoc, oldDoc, userCtx) {
    if (newDoc.type === 'comment') {
        if (eval(newDoc.securityCheck)) { //VULNERABLE
            return;
        } else {
            throw({forbidden : 'Invalid comment'});
        }
    }
}
```
If `newDoc.securityCheck` contains malicious code, it will be executed.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

The following mitigation strategies are crucial, going beyond the high-level overview:

1.  **Input Validation (Whitelist Approach):**

    *   **Principle:**  *Never* trust user input.  Define *exactly* what is allowed and reject everything else.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Regular Expressions (with caution):**  Use regular expressions to enforce strict patterns for input fields.  However, be *extremely* careful with regular expressions, as they can be complex and prone to errors (e.g., ReDoS).  Test them thoroughly.  Prefer simpler, more restrictive patterns.
        *   **Type Checking:**  Verify that input data is of the expected type (e.g., string, number, boolean).  Use JavaScript's `typeof` operator and other type-checking mechanisms.
        *   **Length Restrictions:**  Enforce maximum lengths for input fields to prevent excessively long strings that might be used in denial-of-service attacks or to bypass other validation checks.
        *   **Allowed Character Sets:**  Define a whitelist of allowed characters for each input field.  For example, a username might only allow alphanumeric characters and underscores.
        *   **Custom Validation Functions:**  For complex validation logic, write custom JavaScript functions that perform thorough checks.  These functions should be *separate* from the design document functions and should *not* use `eval()` or `Function()`.
        * **Validation Libraries:** Consider using well-vetted validation libraries like `validator.js` (if compatible with the CouchDB environment) to reduce the risk of introducing vulnerabilities in custom validation code.

    *   **Example (Improved Map Function):**

        ```javascript
        function(doc) {
          if (doc.type === 'comment') {
            // Validate user_input:  Must be a string, max length 100, only alphanumeric and spaces.
            if (typeof doc.user_input === 'string' &&
                doc.user_input.length <= 100 &&
                /^[a-zA-Z0-9\s]+$/.test(doc.user_input)) {
              emit(doc.post_id, doc.user_input); // Now safe, as input is validated.
            }
          }
        }
        ```

2.  **Avoid Dynamic Code Generation:**

    *   **Principle:**  Eliminate the use of `eval()`, `Function()`, and any other mechanism that executes code from strings.
    *   **Implementation:**  Refactor design document functions to use static code instead of dynamically generated code.  This often requires rethinking the logic, but it's the most effective way to prevent code injection.

3.  **Least Privilege (Design Document Permissions):**

    *   **Principle:**  Design documents should only have the minimum necessary permissions to perform their intended function.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **_users Database:**  Carefully manage user roles and permissions in the `_users` database.  Limit write access to design documents to trusted users or administrators.
        *   **Validation Functions:**  Use validation functions to restrict which users can create or modify documents of specific types.
        * **Replication Filters:** If using replication, use filters to prevent malicious design documents from being replicated to other databases.

4.  **Code Review and Static Analysis:**

    *   **Principle:**  Regularly review design document code for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Manual Code Review:**  Have multiple developers review each design document, focusing on input validation, dynamic code generation, and adherence to security best practices.
        *   **Automated Static Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (if available for the CouchDB JavaScript environment) to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities, such as the use of `eval()` or insecure regular expressions.

5.  **Output Encoding (for Show and List Functions):**

    *   **Principle:**  Encode output from show and list functions to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the output is displayed in a web browser.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **HTML Encoding:**  Use appropriate HTML encoding functions to escape special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, `'`).  CouchDB's `toJSON()` function can help with this, but be sure to handle any additional escaping needed for the specific context where the output is used.
        * **Context-Specific Encoding:** The type of encoding required depends on where the output will be used (e.g., HTML attribute, JavaScript string, URL).

6. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**

    * **Principle:** If CouchDB data is accessed via a web application, use CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
    * **Implementation:**
        * Set appropriate HTTP headers to define a strict CSP that prevents the execution of inline scripts and scripts from untrusted sources. This mitigates the risk of XSS attacks that might leverage CouchDB data.

7. **Regular Security Audits and Updates:**

    * **Principle:** Stay up-to-date with CouchDB security advisories and apply patches promptly.
    * **Implementation:**
        * Subscribe to CouchDB security mailing lists.
        * Regularly audit the CouchDB configuration and design documents for vulnerabilities.
        * Implement a process for applying security updates in a timely manner.

### 2.4 Testing Recommendations

*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for all design document functions, including validation functions. These tests should cover both valid and invalid input scenarios, focusing on edge cases and boundary conditions.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between design documents and other parts of the application.
*   **Fuzz Testing:** Use fuzz testing techniques to generate random or semi-random input data and test the robustness of input validation.
*   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing by security professionals to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by other testing methods. Specifically, attempt to inject malicious JavaScript into design documents.
*   **Static Analysis Tooling:** Integrate static analysis tools into the development workflow to automatically detect potential vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

JavaScript code injection in CouchDB design documents is a serious vulnerability that requires careful attention. By implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined above, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this attack.  The key is to adopt a defense-in-depth approach, combining strict input validation, avoiding dynamic code generation, adhering to the principle of least privilege, and conducting thorough code reviews and testing.  Regular security audits and updates are also essential to maintain a secure CouchDB implementation.
