## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Attacker's Goal](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_attacker's_goal.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker, which is to gain unauthorized access to, modify, or delete data within the CouchDB database, or to disrupt the availability of the CouchDB service. This impacts the application relying on it.
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise of data and/or service availability)

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 1.1 Bypass Authentication (Design/Validation Rules)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_1_1_bypass_authentication__designvalidation_rules_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker circumvents the authentication mechanisms of CouchDB, potentially gaining unauthorized access to data. This often involves exploiting weaknesses in design documents or validation rules.
*   **Impact:** Very High (Enables many subsequent attacks)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 1.1.1 Weak Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_1_1_weak_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains access by using weak, default, or easily guessable administrator credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Assuming basic security practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full control of CouchDB)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Failed login attempts can be logged)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 1.1.2 Brute Force Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_1_2_brute_force_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to guess the administrator password through repeated login attempts.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on password complexity and rate limiting)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full control of CouchDB)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High (Requires time and resources)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (With proper logging and rate limiting)

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 2.1 Bypass Authentication (Design/Validation Rules)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_2_1_bypass_authentication__designvalidation_rules_.md)

*   **Description:** Identical to 1.1, but in the context of data modification/deletion. The attacker bypasses authentication to gain write access.
*   **Impact:** Very High (Enables data modification/deletion)

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 2.1.1.1 Weak Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_1_1_1_weak_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Same as 1.1.1.
*   **Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill Level, Detection Difficulty:** Same as 1.1.1.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 2.1.2.1 Brute Force Admin Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_1_2_1_brute_force_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Same as 1.1.2.
*   **Likelihood, Impact, Effort, Skill Level, Detection Difficulty:** Same as 1.1.2.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: 3.2.2.1 Unpatched CouchDB Instance](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_2_2_1_unpatched_couchdb_instance.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in an outdated version of CouchDB to cause a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Increases over time as new vulnerabilities are discovered)
*   **Impact:** High (Potential for complete service disruption, and potentially other attacks)
*   **Effort:** Low (Attacker can leverage existing exploits)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Version information is often readily available)
