# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Brute Force Admin Credentials (CouchDB)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Thoroughly understand the "Brute Force Admin Credentials" attack path against an Apache CouchDB instance.
*   Identify specific vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the CouchDB configuration and application code that could facilitate this attack.
*   Propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies to reduce the likelihood and impact of this attack.
*   Provide clear guidance to the development team on implementing these mitigations.
*   Enhance the overall security posture of the application by addressing this specific, high-impact threat.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the attack path described as "1.1.2 Brute Force Admin Credentials" in the provided attack tree.  This means we will concentrate on:

*   **Authentication Mechanisms:**  How CouchDB handles administrator authentication, including default settings, configuration options, and potential weaknesses.
*   **Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:**  Existing mechanisms (or lack thereof) to prevent rapid, repeated login attempts and to temporarily or permanently disable accounts after failed attempts.
*   **Password Policies:**  The enforcement (or lack thereof) of strong password policies for administrator accounts.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:**  The ability to detect and respond to brute-force attempts in real-time or through post-incident analysis.
*   **Network Configuration:** How network-level controls (firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems) can contribute to mitigating this attack.
*   **CouchDB Version:** The specific version of CouchDB in use, as vulnerabilities and mitigation strategies can vary between versions.  We will assume the latest stable release unless otherwise specified.

We will *not* cover other attack vectors, such as:

*   Exploiting software vulnerabilities in CouchDB itself (e.g., buffer overflows).
*   Social engineering attacks to obtain the administrator password.
*   Attacks targeting other user accounts (non-admin).
*   Denial-of-service attacks.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  Refine the threat model for this specific attack path, considering the attacker's capabilities, motivations, and resources.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Identify specific vulnerabilities in CouchDB's default configuration, common misconfigurations, and potential application-level weaknesses that could be exploited.
3.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluate existing mitigation strategies and propose new or improved ones, focusing on practical implementation.
4.  **Documentation and Recommendations:**  Clearly document the findings and provide specific, actionable recommendations for the development team.
5.  **Testing and Verification:** Outline testing procedures to verify the effectiveness of implemented mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.2 Brute Force Admin Credentials

### 2.1 Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Profile:**  The attacker is likely to be an external entity with intermediate technical skills.  They may be motivated by financial gain (data theft, ransomware), espionage, or simply malicious intent.  They have access to standard brute-forcing tools (e.g., Hydra, Medusa, custom scripts) and potentially a botnet for distributed attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker targets the CouchDB administrative interface, typically exposed on port 5984 (HTTP) or 6984 (HTTPS). They will use automated tools to submit a large number of username/password combinations.
*   **Attack Goal:**  The attacker's goal is to gain unauthorized access to the CouchDB instance with administrator privileges. This grants them full control over the database, including the ability to read, modify, or delete all data, create or delete users, and potentially compromise the underlying server.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis

*   **Weak Default Password:**  Older versions of CouchDB (pre-3.0) had a well-known default administrator password (`admin:admin`).  Even if changed, a weak, easily guessable password remains a significant vulnerability.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting (Default):**  By default, CouchDB *does not* implement robust rate limiting on authentication attempts.  This is a critical vulnerability, allowing attackers to make thousands of guesses per second.
*   **Insufficient Account Lockout:**  CouchDB does not have a built-in account lockout mechanism after a certain number of failed login attempts.  This allows attackers to continue brute-forcing indefinitely.
*   **Inadequate Password Policy Enforcement:**  CouchDB allows administrators to set weak passwords without enforcing complexity requirements (minimum length, special characters, etc.).
*   **Insufficient Logging:**  While CouchDB logs authentication attempts, the default logging level may not be detailed enough to easily detect brute-force attacks.  Logs may not include source IP addresses or timestamps with sufficient granularity.
*   **Lack of Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  CouchDB does not natively support 2FA, a crucial security control that significantly mitigates brute-force attacks.
*   **Exposure of Admin Interface:**  Exposing the CouchDB administrative interface directly to the public internet increases the attack surface.

### 2.3 Mitigation Analysis

Here are the recommended mitigations, prioritized by importance and feasibility:

1.  **Strong, Unique Admin Password (Immediate & Critical):**
    *   **Action:**  Immediately change the default administrator password to a strong, unique password that is at least 16 characters long and includes a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols.  Use a password manager to generate and store this password securely.
    *   **Verification:**  Attempt to log in with the new password.  Attempt to brute-force the old password (if known) to confirm it no longer works.

2.  **Implement Rate Limiting (High Priority):**
    *   **Action:**  Implement rate limiting at the network level (using a firewall or reverse proxy) or using a CouchDB plugin.  A good starting point is to limit login attempts to 5 per minute per IP address.
        *   **Reverse Proxy (Recommended):**  Use a reverse proxy like Nginx or HAProxy in front of CouchDB.  These proxies offer robust rate-limiting features.  Example Nginx configuration:
            ```nginx
            limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=login_limit:10m rate=5r/m;

            server {
                # ... other configurations ...

                location /_session {  # Or the specific authentication endpoint
                    limit_req zone=login_limit burst=10 nodelay;
                    proxy_pass http://localhost:5984;
                    # ... other proxy settings ...
                }
            }
            ```
        *   **CouchDB Plugin (Alternative):**  Explore and carefully evaluate third-party CouchDB plugins that provide rate-limiting functionality.  Ensure the plugin is actively maintained and well-regarded.
    *   **Verification:**  Use a brute-force testing tool to attempt rapid login attempts.  Verify that the rate limiting mechanism blocks or delays excessive attempts.

3.  **Implement Account Lockout (High Priority):**
    *   **Action:**  Since CouchDB lacks native account lockout, this must be implemented externally.
        *   **Reverse Proxy (Recommended):**  Some reverse proxies (like HAProxy) can track failed login attempts and temporarily block IP addresses.
        *   **Custom Scripting (Advanced):**  A more complex solution involves monitoring CouchDB logs and using a script to dynamically update firewall rules to block IP addresses after a threshold of failed attempts.  This requires careful design and testing to avoid accidental lockouts of legitimate users.  Fail2ban is a good example of a tool that can be adapted for this purpose.
    *   **Verification:**  Simulate failed login attempts and verify that the lockout mechanism triggers after the configured threshold.

4.  **Enforce Strong Password Policies (High Priority):**
    *   **Action:**  While CouchDB doesn't have built-in password policy enforcement, you can enforce this through administrative procedures and potentially through custom validation logic in your application if it interacts with user creation.  Document a clear password policy and communicate it to all administrators.
    *   **Verification:**  Regularly audit administrator accounts to ensure compliance with the password policy.

5.  **Enhance Logging and Monitoring (High Priority):**
    *   **Action:**
        *   Configure CouchDB to log authentication attempts with detailed information, including source IP address, timestamp, username, and success/failure status.  Set the `log_level` to `debug` or `info` in the `local.ini` file.
        *   Implement a centralized logging system (e.g., ELK stack, Splunk) to collect and analyze CouchDB logs.
        *   Set up alerts for suspicious activity, such as a high number of failed login attempts from a single IP address within a short period.
    *   **Verification:**  Regularly review logs and monitor alerts to ensure that the system is effectively detecting and reporting potential brute-force attempts.

6.  **Restrict Network Access (High Priority):**
    *   **Action:**  Do *not* expose the CouchDB administrative interface directly to the public internet.  Use a firewall to restrict access to specific IP addresses or networks (e.g., your application server, internal management network).  Consider using a VPN for remote administrative access.
    *   **Verification:**  Use network scanning tools (e.g., Nmap) to verify that the CouchDB port (5984/6984) is not accessible from unauthorized IP addresses.

7.  **Consider Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Action:**  While CouchDB doesn't natively support 2FA, you can implement it using a reverse proxy that supports 2FA (e.g., Authelia, Keycloak) or by integrating a third-party authentication service. This adds a significant layer of security.
    *   **Verification:** Test the 2FA implementation thoroughly to ensure it functions correctly and prevents unauthorized access even with a compromised password.

8. **Regular security audits and updates (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Action:** Regularly update CouchDB to the latest stable version to patch any known security vulnerabilities. Perform periodic security audits to identify and address any potential weaknesses in the system configuration.
    *   **Verification:** Review the changelog of each CouchDB update for security-related fixes.

### 2.4 Testing and Verification

After implementing the mitigations, thorough testing is crucial:

*   **Functional Testing:**  Verify that legitimate users can still log in and access the database.
*   **Security Testing:**  Use automated brute-force tools to attempt to bypass the implemented security controls.  Vary the attack parameters (e.g., number of attempts, delay between attempts, source IP address) to test the effectiveness of rate limiting and account lockout.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  Consider engaging a security professional to conduct a penetration test to identify any remaining vulnerabilities.
