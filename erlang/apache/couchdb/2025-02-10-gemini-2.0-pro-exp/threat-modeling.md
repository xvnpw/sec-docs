# Threat Model Analysis for apache/couchdb

## Threat: [Unauthorized Admin Access (Admin Party Bypass)](./threats/unauthorized_admin_access__admin_party_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains full administrative access to the CouchDB instance because the "Admin Party" mode is enabled (default configuration) or weak/default admin credentials are used. The attacker can create, read, update, and delete any database and document, and modify design documents.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the CouchDB instance and all data. Attacker can exfiltrate data, corrupt data, or use the instance for malicious purposes.
*   **Affected Component:** CouchDB Authentication and Authorization system, specifically the `_config/admins` section and the overall security model.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately disable "Admin Party" mode** after installation by setting a strong admin password.
    *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all CouchDB users, especially the admin user.
    *   Regularly rotate admin credentials.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin access if possible (requires external tools/plugins).

## Threat: [Design Document Modification](./threats/design_document_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with some level of write access (even non-admin) modifies a design document (containing views, `_validate_doc_update` functions, show/list functions). They could inject malicious JavaScript code into a view to cause a denial of service, alter validation logic to bypass security checks, or modify show/list functions to leak sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, denial of service, information disclosure, privilege escalation (if validation logic is weakened). The specific impact depends on the nature of the modification.
*   **Affected Component:** Design Documents (`_design/*` documents), specifically the JavaScript code within views, `_validate_doc_update`, `_show`, and `_list` functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict access to design documents:** Only grant write access to a highly trusted "design" role or user.
    *   **Code Review:** Implement a mandatory code review process for *all* changes to design documents before deployment.
    *   **Version Control:** Manage design documents using a version control system (e.g., Git) to track changes and facilitate rollbacks.
    *   **Separate Development/Production:** Use separate CouchDB instances for development/testing and production. Changes to design documents should be thoroughly tested before deployment to production.

## Threat: [Data Tampering via Bypassed Validation](./threats/data_tampering_via_bypassed_validation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a request that bypasses the intended data validation logic within a `_validate_doc_update` function. This could be due to flaws in the validation logic, unexpected input, or type juggling vulnerabilities in JavaScript. The attacker can then insert invalid or malicious data.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, violation of data integrity constraints, potential for further attacks (e.g., if the tampered data is used in other parts of the application).
*   **Affected Component:** `_validate_doc_update` functions within design documents.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Thorough Validation Logic:** Write comprehensive `_validate_doc_update` functions that validate *all* fields, not just those expected to change. Check data types, lengths, formats, and allowed values.
    *   **Schema Validation:** Consider using a schema validation library (e.g., a JSON Schema validator) within your validation functions to enforce stricter data structure and type checks.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize input data to remove or escape potentially harmful characters.  (While sanitization is often done at the application layer, it's relevant *within* the `_validate_doc_update` function as a defense-in-depth measure).
    *   **Testing:** Extensively test validation functions with both valid and invalid input, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** Combine validation functions with other security measures (e.g., proper user roles, application-level validation).

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests to CouchDB, creates excessively large documents, or uses inefficient views/queries to consume server resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O), making the database unresponsive.  This is specifically focused on attacks that exploit CouchDB's internal processing.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Affected Component:** CouchDB server, potentially all components (depending on the nature of the attack). Specifically, view indexing, query processing, and document storage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Document Size Limits:** Enforce limits on the maximum size of documents and attachments *within CouchDB's configuration*.
    *   **View Optimization:** Optimize view functions to minimize resource usage. Avoid complex calculations or large data manipulations within views. Use appropriate indexing.  This is a *direct* CouchDB mitigation.
    *   **Query Optimization:** Ensure queries are efficient and use appropriate indexes. This is a *direct* CouchDB mitigation.
    *   **Compaction:** Regularly run CouchDB's compaction process to optimize database size and performance. This is a *direct* CouchDB mitigation.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor CouchDB's resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O) and set alerts for unusual activity.

## Threat: [CouchDB Version Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/couchdb_version_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a specific version of CouchDB or its dependencies (Erlang, JavaScript engine). This could lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable component within CouchDB or its dependencies (e.g., a specific Erlang module, the JavaScript engine, or a CouchDB API endpoint).
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (often High or Critical) depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep CouchDB Updated:** Regularly update CouchDB and its dependencies (Erlang, JavaScript engine) to the latest stable versions with security patches.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and mailing lists for CouchDB and related components to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners to identify known vulnerabilities in your CouchDB deployment.
