# Threat Model Analysis for apache/couchdb

## Threat: [Weak or Default Administrator Credentials](./threats/weak_or_default_administrator_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to log in to the CouchDB administrative interface (usually Futon or Fauxton) using default credentials (like `admin:password`) or easily guessable passwords. They might use brute-force or dictionary attacks.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the CouchDB instance. The attacker can read, modify, or delete any data, create new users, change configurations, and potentially disrupt the entire application.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, `/_session` endpoint, Admin Party functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Mandate changing the default administrator password during initial setup.
    *   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length).
    *   Consider implementing account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.

## Threat: [Insecure Cookie Configuration](./threats/insecure_cookie_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities related to CouchDB's session cookies if they lack the `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags. With `HttpOnly` missing, XSS attacks could allow JavaScript to access the cookie. Without `Secure`, the cookie could be intercepted over non-HTTPS connections.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, allowing the attacker to impersonate legitimate users, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or administrative functions within CouchDB.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, `/_session` endpoint, Cookie handling.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure CouchDB to set the `HttpOnly` and `Secure` flags on session cookies.
    *   Ensure the application and CouchDB are accessed over HTTPS.

## Threat: [Authentication Bypass Vulnerability](./threats/authentication_bypass_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in CouchDB's authentication logic to bypass the normal authentication process and gain unauthorized access without valid credentials. This might involve manipulating API requests or exploiting flaws in the authentication code within CouchDB.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data and functionalities within CouchDB, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Authentication Module, `/_session` endpoint, potentially specific authentication handlers.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep CouchDB updated to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on the application side when interacting with CouchDB's authentication API.
    *   Regularly review CouchDB's security advisories.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass through Misconfigured Security Objects](./threats/authorization_bypass_through_misconfigured_security_objects.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit misconfigured security objects within CouchDB (e.g., database-level permissions, document validation functions) to access or modify data they are not authorized to. This could involve understanding the CouchDB security model and crafting requests that bypass intended restrictions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data within CouchDB, data modification, or deletion, potentially leading to data breaches or data integrity issues.
*   **Affected Component:** Authorization Module, Security Objects (e.g., `_security` object), Database permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully design and implement CouchDB's security objects and database permissions.
    *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access within CouchDB.
    *   Regularly audit CouchDB security configurations.

## Threat: [Replication Data Tampering](./threats/replication_data_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** If replication is enabled with untrusted or compromised CouchDB nodes, an attacker controlling a malicious node could inject or modify data during the replication process, affecting the integrity of the data on other replicating CouchDB instances.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption across multiple CouchDB instances, potentially leading to application errors, incorrect information, or loss of trust in the data managed by CouchDB.
*   **Affected Component:** Replication Module, `/_replicate` endpoint.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure replication channels using TLS/SSL between CouchDB instances.
    *   Authenticate replication partners using strong credentials within CouchDB's replication configuration.
    *   Carefully manage access to replication credentials.
    *   Monitor replication processes for anomalies.

## Threat: [View Function Injection](./threats/view_function_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If user-supplied data is directly incorporated into CouchDB view functions (MapReduce) without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code. This code could be executed on the CouchDB server during view indexing or querying.
*   **Impact:** Potential for data exfiltration from CouchDB, denial of service by consuming excessive resources on the CouchDB server, or even remote code execution on the CouchDB server.
*   **Affected Component:** MapReduce View Engine, JavaScript execution environment within CouchDB.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid incorporating user-supplied data directly into CouchDB view functions.
    *   If necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization on any data used in view functions within CouchDB.
    *   Consider alternative data processing methods if user input is involved.

## Threat: [Publicly Accessible CouchDB Instance](./threats/publicly_accessible_couchdb_instance.md)

*   **Description:** If the CouchDB instance is not properly firewalled or configured to listen only on specific interfaces, it could be publicly accessible over the internet. This allows anyone to potentially interact with the CouchDB database.
*   **Impact:** Complete data breach of the CouchDB instance, unauthorized data modification or deletion, denial of service of the CouchDB service, and potential compromise of the underlying server.
*   **Affected Component:** Network Listener, Configuration settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the CouchDB instance is behind a firewall and only accessible from authorized networks or applications.
    *   Configure CouchDB to listen only on specific, non-public interfaces (e.g., `127.0.0.1` or internal network addresses).

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** If CouchDB's configuration files (e.g., `local.ini`) are not properly protected with appropriate file system permissions, attackers could gain access to sensitive information like administrator credentials or API keys used by CouchDB.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the CouchDB instance.
*   **Affected Component:** File System Access, Configuration Files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Restrict access to CouchDB's configuration files using appropriate file system permissions (e.g., only the CouchDB user should have read access).

## Threat: [Running CouchDB with Elevated Privileges](./threats/running_couchdb_with_elevated_privileges.md)

*   **Description:** Running the CouchDB process with unnecessary elevated privileges (e.g., as root) increases the potential impact of a successful attack. If the CouchDB process is compromised, the attacker gains the privileges of the user running the process.
*   **Impact:** If the CouchDB process is compromised, the attacker could gain root access to the server, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Operating System Process Management (related to how CouchDB is deployed).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Run the CouchDB process with the least privileges necessary for its operation. Create a dedicated user for the CouchDB process.
