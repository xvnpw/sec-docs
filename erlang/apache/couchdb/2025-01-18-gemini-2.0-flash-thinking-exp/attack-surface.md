# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/couchdb

## Attack Surface: [Unauthenticated API Access](./attack_surfaces/unauthenticated_api_access.md)

**Description:**  CouchDB's HTTP API endpoints are accessible without requiring authentication.

**How CouchDB Contributes:** CouchDB allows configuration where authentication is disabled or not enforced for certain endpoints.

**Example:** An attacker can directly access `/_all_dbs` to list all databases or `/<database>/_all_docs` to view documents if authentication is not enabled.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential for complete database takeover.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enable and enforce authentication:** Configure CouchDB to require authentication for all API requests.
* **Use strong authentication mechanisms:**  Leverage CouchDB's built-in authentication or integrate with external authentication providers.
* **Review and restrict access:** Regularly audit and restrict access permissions to the minimum necessary.

## Attack Surface: [NoSQL Injection in Mango Queries](./attack_surfaces/nosql_injection_in_mango_queries.md)

**Description:**  Improperly sanitized user input used in Mango queries can allow attackers to execute arbitrary database operations.

**How CouchDB Contributes:** CouchDB's Mango query language allows for complex queries, and if user input is directly incorporated without sanitization, it can be exploited.

**Example:** An application takes a user-provided field name and uses it directly in a Mango query like `{"selector": {"$gt": {""+user_input+"": null}}}`. A malicious user could input `"$where": "1 == 1"` to bypass intended query logic.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential for information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Parameterize queries:**  Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to separate user input from the query structure.
* **Input validation and sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before incorporating it into Mango queries.
* **Principle of least privilege:**  Ensure the CouchDB user used by the application has only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Attachment Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/attachment_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Flaws in how CouchDB handles file attachments can lead to vulnerabilities like path traversal or arbitrary file read/write.

**How CouchDB Contributes:** CouchDB allows storing binary attachments with documents, and vulnerabilities can arise in how these attachments are stored, retrieved, and processed.

**Example:** A vulnerability in attachment handling could allow an attacker to upload an attachment with a specially crafted filename that, when processed by the server, writes the file to an unintended location on the server's filesystem.

**Impact:** Arbitrary file read/write, potential for information disclosure or system compromise.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep CouchDB updated:** Ensure you are using the latest version with security patches.
* **Secure file storage:**  Ensure the underlying filesystem where attachments are stored has appropriate permissions.
* **Input validation for attachment names:**  Validate and sanitize attachment filenames to prevent path traversal.
* **Consider alternative storage:** For highly sensitive attachments, consider storing them outside of CouchDB with appropriate access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Weak Default Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_default_credentials.md)

**Description:**  Using default administrator credentials makes the instance easily compromised.

**How CouchDB Contributes:** CouchDB, like many systems, has default credentials upon initial installation.

**Example:** An attacker uses the default username and password to log into Futon or the API and gains full administrative control.

**Impact:** Complete database takeover, unauthorized data access, modification, and deletion.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Change default credentials immediately:**  Set strong, unique passwords for all administrative users upon initial setup.
* **Regularly review and update credentials:**  Periodically change administrative passwords.
