## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via CouchDB (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_couchdb__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal. Success means the attacker has achieved their objective, potentially gaining unauthorized access, manipulating data, or disrupting the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CouchDB Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_couchdb_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path involves leveraging known weaknesses in the CouchDB software itself.
    *   **Exploit Known CouchDB CVEs (CRITICAL NODE):** Targeting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with known exploits.
        *   **Execute Exploit (CRITICAL NODE):** The actual act of running the exploit code against the vulnerable CouchDB instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [NoSQL Injection (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/nosql_injection__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path exploits the application's failure to properly sanitize user inputs when constructing CouchDB queries.
    *   **Craft Malicious CouchDB Query (CRITICAL NODE):** Injecting malicious code into a CouchDB query to bypass security checks, access unauthorized data, or modify data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path aims to execute arbitrary code on the CouchDB server.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerability in a CouchDB Dependency:** Targeting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by CouchDB.
        *   **Exploit Vulnerability in the Dependency to Achieve RCE (CRITICAL NODE):** Successfully leveraging a dependency vulnerability to gain code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse CouchDB Features (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_couchdb_features__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path involves misusing legitimate CouchDB features for malicious purposes.
    *   **Replication Abuse (CRITICAL NODE):** Exploiting weaknesses in replication configuration or authentication.
        *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Replication Configuration:** Accessing replication settings without proper authorization.
            *   **Exploit Weak Authentication/Authorization on Replication Endpoints (CRITICAL NODE):** Bypassing or exploiting weak security measures on replication-related APIs.
    *   **Information Disclosure via API Abuse (HIGH-RISK PATH START):** Exploiting weak access controls to access sensitive data.
        *   **Exploit Weak Access Controls (CRITICAL NODE):** Bypassing or exploiting insufficient authentication or authorization mechanisms on CouchDB APIs.
        *   **Retrieve Sensitive Data (CRITICAL NODE):** Successfully accessing and obtaining confidential information stored in CouchDB.

## Attack Tree Path: [Design Document Manipulation (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/design_document_manipulation__critical_node__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path involves gaining unauthorized access to and modifying CouchDB design documents.
    *   **Gain Unauthorized Access to Design Documents:** Accessing design documents without proper authorization.
        *   **Exploit Weak Authentication/Authorization on Design Document Management Endpoints (CRITICAL NODE):** Bypassing or exploiting weak security on APIs managing design documents.
    *   **Modify Design Documents for Malicious Purposes (CRITICAL NODE):** Injecting malicious code (e.g., JavaScript in validation functions) or altering logic within design documents.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate CouchDB Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_couchdb_configuration__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path involves altering CouchDB's configuration to weaken its security or enable malicious features.
    *   **Gain Access to Configuration Files (CRITICAL NODE):** Directly accessing and modifying CouchDB's configuration files (e.g., `local.ini`).
    *   **Abuse Configuration API (CRITICAL NODE):** Using the CouchDB configuration API (if enabled) for malicious purposes.
        *   **Exploit Weak Authentication/Authorization on Configuration API Endpoints (CRITICAL NODE):** Bypassing or exploiting weak security on the configuration API.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept or Manipulate Communication with CouchDB (HIGH-RISK PATH START)](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_or_manipulate_communication_with_couchdb__high-risk_path_start_.md)

*   This path involves intercepting and potentially altering communication between the application and CouchDB.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack (CRITICAL NODE):** Intercepting network traffic between the application and CouchDB.
        *   **Decrypt or Manipulate Traffic (If HTTPS is Not Enforced or Misconfigured) (CRITICAL NODE):** Decrypting or altering communication due to the absence or misconfiguration of HTTPS encryption.
