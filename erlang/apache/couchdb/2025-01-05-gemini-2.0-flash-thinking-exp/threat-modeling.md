# Threat Model Analysis for apache/couchdb

## Threat: [Weak CouchDB Administrator Credentials](./threats/weak_couchdb_administrator_credentials.md)

*   **Threat:** Weak CouchDB Administrator Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the CouchDB administrator account by guessing or cracking weak credentials (default or easily guessable passwords). This allows them to bypass all access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the CouchDB instance. The attacker can read, modify, or delete any data, create or delete databases, and potentially gain access to the underlying server.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `_users` database
        *   Authentication module
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong, unique passwords for all CouchDB administrative accounts.
        *   Regularly rotate administrative passwords.
        *   Consider using key-based authentication where supported.
        *   Restrict network access to the CouchDB administrative port (usually 5984).

## Threat: [NoSQL Injection in View Functions](./threats/nosql_injection_in_view_functions.md)

*   **Threat:** NoSQL Injection in View Functions
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a CouchDB view function through unsanitized user input. When the view is processed, this code is executed by CouchDB.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration (accessing data the attacker shouldn't), data modification (altering data), denial of service (crashing or slowing down the database), or potentially remote code execution on the CouchDB server (depending on the environment and CouchDB configuration).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Map/Reduce view engine
        *   `_design` documents
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid constructing view functions dynamically based on user input.
        *   If dynamic view construction is necessary, strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided data.
        *   Use parameterized queries or pre-defined view functions whenever possible.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access via Replication Misconfiguration](./threats/unauthorized_access_via_replication_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access via Replication Misconfiguration
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigured replication settings to gain unauthorized access to data. This could involve setting up a malicious CouchDB instance to replicate data from the target instance or gaining access to credentials used for replication.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (sensitive data is exposed to the attacker), potential data modification (if the attacker can write to the replicated database), and potential denial of service (if the attacker floods the target with data).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Replication module (`_replicate`)
        *   `_replicator` database
        *   Authentication module (if replication requires authentication)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure replication settings, ensuring only trusted sources and targets are allowed.
        *   Use strong, unique credentials for replication if authentication is required.
        *   Restrict network access to CouchDB instances involved in replication.
        *   Regularly review and audit replication configurations.

## Threat: [Direct Access to CouchDB Data Files](./threats/direct_access_to_couchdb_data_files.md)

*   **Threat:** Direct Access to CouchDB Data Files
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains direct file system access to the CouchDB data files (e.g., through a compromised server or container vulnerability). This bypasses CouchDB's access control mechanisms.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (reading sensitive data directly from files), data corruption (modifying files directly), or denial of service (deleting or corrupting essential data files).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Storage engine (file system)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict file system access to the CouchDB data directory to only the necessary processes and users.
        *   Implement strong access controls on the server hosting CouchDB.
        *   Encrypt the CouchDB data at rest.
        *   Regularly monitor file system integrity.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Erlang Runtime](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_erlang_runtime.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Erlang Runtime
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the underlying Erlang runtime that CouchDB relies on.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, remote code execution on the CouchDB server, or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Erlang runtime environment
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep CouchDB and the Erlang runtime updated with the latest security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Erlang and CouchDB.
