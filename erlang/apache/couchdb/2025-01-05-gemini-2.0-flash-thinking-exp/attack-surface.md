# Attack Surface Analysis for apache/couchdb

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Administrative Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_administrative_credentials.md)

*   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB, by default, has administrative credentials that, if unchanged, grant immediate access to the entire database system. This is a direct feature of CouchDB's initial setup.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default username "admin" and password "password" (or a common default) to log into CouchDB's Futon interface or the administrative API.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the CouchDB instance, including access to all data, the ability to modify or delete data, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server if further vulnerabilities are exploited.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change the default administrator password to a strong, unique password upon installation.
        *   Disable or remove default administrative accounts if possible.
        *   Implement strong password policies and enforce regular password changes.

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured "Admin Party" Mode](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_admin_party_mode.md)

*   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB's design includes an "admin party" mode, controlled by the `require_valid_user` configuration, which, if disabled, bypasses authentication â€“ a direct CouchDB feature.
    *   **Example:** A misconfigured CouchDB instance has `require_valid_user = false` in its configuration, allowing anyone to access and modify data without authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Complete data breach, data manipulation, and potential denial of service. Any user can perform any action on the database.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `require_valid_user = true` in the CouchDB configuration file.
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
        *   Regularly review and audit CouchDB configuration settings.

## Attack Surface: [Direct Access to the `_users` Database](./attack_surfaces/direct_access_to_the___users__database.md)

*   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB's architecture stores user credentials and roles in the specific `_users` database. The ability to directly interact with this database is a core CouchDB functionality.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability allowing them to directly modify documents in the `_users` database, granting themselves administrator privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to create, modify, or delete user accounts, leading to unauthorized access and control over the CouchDB instance.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the `_users` database to only authorized CouchDB processes.
        *   Avoid exposing the `_users` database directly through application interfaces.
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks targeting this database.

## Attack Surface: [Weaknesses in Cookie-Based Authentication](./attack_surfaces/weaknesses_in_cookie-based_authentication.md)

*   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB's chosen method for session management relies on cookies. The specific implementation details of this cookie management are part of CouchDB's design.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts a CouchDB authentication cookie and uses it to impersonate a legitimate user (session hijacking).
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user data and the ability to perform actions on behalf of the compromised user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enable HTTPS to protect cookies in transit (using the `Secure` flag).
        *   Set the `HttpOnly` flag on cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access.
        *   Use strong, unpredictable session IDs.
        *   Implement proper session invalidation and timeout mechanisms.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitable MapReduce Functions](./attack_surfaces/exploitable_mapreduce_functions.md)

*   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB's feature allowing custom MapReduce functions to be defined and executed directly within the database introduces the risk of code injection.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor injects code into a view's `map` or `reduce` function that, when executed by CouchDB, allows them to run arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, allowing the attacker to gain full control over the CouchDB server and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and sanitize any user-provided input used in MapReduce functions.
        *   Implement strict code review processes for custom MapReduce functions.
        *   Run CouchDB with appropriate user privileges to limit the impact of potential code execution vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Replication Configurations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_replication_configurations.md)

*   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB's built-in replication mechanism, while powerful, requires careful configuration and secure credential management to prevent unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** An attacker intercepts replication traffic due to missing encryption or gains access to weakly protected replication credentials, allowing them to access or modify data on the target database.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation across multiple CouchDB instances, and potential denial of service by overloading replication processes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use HTTPS for replication to encrypt data in transit.
        *   Use strong, unique credentials for replication.
        *   Restrict replication access to only trusted sources and destinations.
        *   Regularly review and audit replication configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected Configuration API](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_configuration_api.md)

*   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB exposes a configuration API that allows modification of server settings. The security of this API is a direct responsibility of CouchDB's implementation and configuration.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the configuration API and disables authentication, effectively opening up the CouchDB instance to the public.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the CouchDB instance, allowing attackers to modify security settings, access data, and potentially disrupt service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the configuration API to only authorized users and processes.
        *   Ensure strong authentication is required to access the configuration API.
        *   Monitor access logs for suspicious activity related to the configuration API.
