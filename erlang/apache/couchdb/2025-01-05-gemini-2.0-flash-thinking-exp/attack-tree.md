## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit CouchDB Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_couchdb_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting weaknesses in how CouchDB verifies user identity and grants access to resources. Successful exploitation bypasses security measures and allows unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Default Credentials Exploitation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__default_credentials_exploitation__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Using the default username and password provided by CouchDB after installation (if not changed). This grants immediate administrative access.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Insufficient Access Control Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__insufficient_access_control_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting misconfigured permissions that allow users or roles to access or modify data and functionalities beyond their intended scope.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Unauthorized Data Deletion [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__unauthorized_data_deletion__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector:  Gaining the ability to delete critical application data within CouchDB, leading to data loss and potential application malfunction.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit CouchDB Code Execution Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_couchdb_code_execution_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Leveraging vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the CouchDB server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Malicious View Functions [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__malicious_view_functions__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Injecting malicious JavaScript code into CouchDB view functions. When these views are queried, the injected code executes on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Crashing the CouchDB Server [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__crashing_the_couchdb_server__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting vulnerabilities or sending specially crafted requests that cause the CouchDB server process to terminate unexpectedly, leading to a denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit CouchDB Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_couchdb_configuration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Leveraging insecure settings or misconfigurations in CouchDB's setup to gain unauthorized access or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[CRITICAL NODE] Insecure Default Configuration [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__insecure_default_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

Attack Vector: Exploiting the default, often less secure, settings of CouchDB immediately after installation, such as open ports or disabled security features.
