### High and Critical CouchDB Threats

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve Apache CouchDB components:

*   **Threat:** Authentication Bypass through Default Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker could gain full administrative control over the CouchDB instance by using default, unchanged administrator credentials. This allows them to access all data, modify configurations, and potentially compromise the underlying system.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, including access to all data, modification capabilities, and potential for further system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** CouchDB Authentication Module, Administrator Account Management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change default administrator credentials upon installation and configuration.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all CouchDB users.
        *   Disable or remove default administrative accounts if possible.

*   **Threat:** Authorization Bypass through Misconfigured Security Objects
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit incorrectly configured security objects (e.g., the `_security` document) to gain unauthorized access to databases or administrative functions. This might involve manipulating the `admins` or `members` lists.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or administrative functions, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** CouchDB Authentication and Authorization Module, `_security` document.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully configure and review security objects, ensuring they accurately reflect the intended access control policies.
        *   Use CouchDB's built-in security features and understand their implications.
        *   Restrict direct access to the `_security` document to authorized administrators.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Insecure Permissions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit overly permissive access controls on CouchDB databases or documents to read sensitive data. This might involve directly accessing the CouchDB API or using a compromised application account with excessive privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential information, leading to privacy breaches, data leaks, or regulatory non-compliance.
    *   **Affected Component:** CouchDB Authentication and Authorization Module, `_security` document, Database and Document Access Control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement fine-grained access control using CouchDB roles and per-database/per-document permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit CouchDB security configurations.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions.

*   **Threat:** Data Integrity Violation through Insecure Permissions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could leverage overly permissive write access to modify or delete critical data in CouchDB. This could be done through direct API access or via a compromised application account.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, loss of data integrity, and potential disruption of application functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** CouchDB Authentication and Authorization Module, `_security` document, Database and Document Write Access Control.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict write access controls, limiting modification and deletion privileges to authorized users and roles.
        *   Regularly back up CouchDB data to facilitate recovery from unauthorized modifications.
        *   Consider using CouchDB's change notification features to detect unauthorized changes.

*   **Threat:** NoSQL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into CouchDB queries (e.g., Mango queries) if user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or validated. This could allow them to bypass security checks, access unauthorized data, or even modify data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion. Potential for executing arbitrary code on the CouchDB server (though less common than in SQL injection).
    *   **Affected Component:** CouchDB Query Parser (e.g., Mango Query Parser), Data Retrieval Modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements whenever possible to prevent direct injection of user input into queries.
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user input before incorporating it into CouchDB queries.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege to database access, limiting the scope of potential damage from successful injection attacks.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to Futon Interface
    *   **Description:** If the Futon web interface is accessible without proper authentication, attackers could gain administrative access to the CouchDB instance. This allows them to perform any administrative action, including viewing and modifying data, and changing configurations.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the database, including access to all data, modification capabilities, and potential for further system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** CouchDB Futon Web Interface, Authentication for Futon.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the Futon interface to authorized administrators only, preferably through network restrictions (e.g., firewall rules).
        *   Disable the Futon interface in production environments if it is not required.
        *   Ensure that the Futon interface requires proper authentication.

*   **Threat:** Replication Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** If replication is configured insecurely, malicious actors could potentially inject or modify data during the replication process. This could involve compromising the source or target database or intercepting replication traffic.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption or unauthorized data access on the target database.
    *   **Affected Component:** CouchDB Replication Protocol, Replication Handlers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely configure replication using authentication and authorization.
        *   Ensure that only trusted sources are allowed to replicate data.
        *   Use HTTPS for replication traffic to encrypt data in transit.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Security Updates and Patching
    *   **Description:** Failure to apply security updates and patches leaves the CouchDB instance vulnerable to known exploits. Attackers can leverage these known vulnerabilities to compromise the database.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities and compromise the database, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or other security incidents.
    *   **Affected Component:** All CouchDB Components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Establish a regular patching schedule and promptly apply security updates released by the Apache CouchDB project.
        *   Subscribe to security mailing lists or notifications to stay informed about new vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for testing updates in a non-production environment before deploying them to production.
