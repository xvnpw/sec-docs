```

*   **Client Application:** Any software application, service, or user interface that interacts with CouchDB by sending HTTP requests to its API endpoints. This could range from web browsers and mobile apps to backend services.
*   **HTTP Request:** The standardized communication protocol used by clients to interact with the CouchDB server. These requests encapsulate actions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting data.
*   **CouchDB Server (Erlang VM):** The core runtime environment for the CouchDB application. The Erlang Virtual Machine provides the necessary concurrency, fault tolerance, and distribution capabilities.
*   **HTTP Listener (Cowboy):** An efficient and robust Erlang-based HTTP server responsible for accepting and managing incoming HTTP connections and requests. It acts as the entry point for all client interactions.
*   **Request Router:**  A component within the CouchDB server that analyzes the incoming HTTP request's URL path and method to determine the appropriate handler or module to process the request.
*   **Authentication/Authorization:**  A critical security module responsible for verifying the identity of clients (authentication) and ensuring they have the necessary permissions to access the requested resources and perform the intended actions (authorization).
*   **Database Core:**  The central component responsible for managing databases, documents, and views. It orchestrates operations like document creation, retrieval, updates, and deletions, and interacts with the storage engine and indexer.
*   **Storage Engine (Mnesia/Pluggable):** The underlying mechanism responsible for the persistent storage of data on disk. Mnesia is the default, in-memory, real-time distributed database management system provided by Erlang. CouchDB also supports pluggable storage engines, allowing for alternative storage backends.
*   **Data Files:** The physical files on the server's file system where the database documents, indexes, and metadata are stored. The format and structure of these files depend on the chosen storage engine.
*   **Indexer (MapReduce):**  The component that builds and maintains indexes based on user-defined JavaScript MapReduce functions. These indexes enable efficient querying and retrieval of data based on specific criteria.
*   **Replication Process:**  A background process responsible for synchronizing data between different CouchDB instances. This enables features like data backup, distribution, and offline access.
*   **Admin Tools/CLI:**  Command-line interface tools and other utilities used by administrators to manage and configure the CouchDB server, including tasks like database creation, user management, and monitoring.

### 3.2. Component-Level Architecture

This section provides a more granular view of the key components within the CouchDB server and their specific functionalities.

*   **HTTP API Layer:**
    *   Serves as the primary interface for all client interactions.
    *   Utilizes the Cowboy web server for handling HTTP requests and responses.
    *   Exposes a comprehensive set of RESTful endpoints for managing databases (e.g., creating, deleting), manipulating documents (e.g., creating, reading, updating, deleting), querying data (e.g., using views, `_find`), and performing administrative tasks.
    *   Performs initial request validation, such as checking for valid JSON or content types.

*   **Authentication and Authorization Module:**
    *   Manages user accounts, roles, and permissions.
    *   Supports various authentication mechanisms, including Basic Authentication, Cookie Authentication, and potentially OAuth or other custom authentication schemes.
    *   Enforces access control policies at the database and document level, ensuring that only authorized users can perform specific actions.
    *   Handles session management, maintaining user login states.

*   **Request Handling and Routing:**
    *   Receives and parses incoming HTTP requests, extracting relevant information such as the HTTP method, URL path, and headers.
    *   Utilizes a routing mechanism to map incoming requests to the appropriate handler functions or modules based on the URL structure (e.g., requests to `/mydb` are routed to database management functions, while requests to `/mydb/mydoc` are routed to document management functions).
    *   Handles different HTTP methods (GET for retrieval, POST for creation, PUT for updates, DELETE for deletion) and dispatches them accordingly.

*   **Database Management:**
    *   Provides functionalities for creating new databases, deleting existing databases, and listing available databases.
    *   Manages database-level metadata, such as creation timestamps and modification history.

*   **Document Management:**
    *   Handles the core operations related to JSON documents: creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
    *   Implements Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC) to manage concurrent access to documents and prevent data corruption. Each document update creates a new revision, allowing for consistent reads and conflict resolution.
    *   Supports bulk document operations, allowing for efficient processing of multiple documents in a single request.

*   **Indexing and Querying (MapReduce):**
    *   Allows developers to define custom views of the data using JavaScript Map and Reduce functions. The Map function extracts relevant information from documents, and the Reduce function aggregates or summarizes this information.
    *   Builds and maintains indexes based on these defined views, enabling efficient querying of data based on specific criteria.
    *   Provides query endpoints to retrieve data based on the indexed views.
    *   Supports ad-hoc queries using the `_find` endpoint (introduced in CouchDB 2.0), which allows for more flexible querying using a JSON-based query language.

*   **Replication:**
    *   Facilitates the synchronization of databases between different CouchDB instances.
    *   Supports both one-way and two-way replication, allowing for various data distribution and backup scenarios.
    *   Implements conflict resolution mechanisms to handle situations where the same document is modified concurrently on different instances.
    *   Utilizes a pull and push mechanism to transfer changes between the source and target databases.

*   **Storage Engine:**
    *   The default storage engine is Mnesia, an Erlang built-in database known for its real-time characteristics and fault tolerance.
    *   CouchDB's pluggable storage engine architecture allows for the integration of alternative storage backends, such as LevelDB or custom implementations, offering flexibility in terms of performance and storage characteristics.
    *   Manages the persistence of documents, indexes, and metadata to disk, ensuring data durability.

*   **Administration Interface:**
    *   Provides endpoints and tools for performing administrative tasks, such as configuring server settings, managing user accounts, inspecting logs, and monitoring server statistics.
    *   Often accessed through command-line tools like `couchdb-admin` or web-based interfaces like Fauxton.

## 4. Data Flow

This section illustrates the typical flow of data within the CouchDB system for common operations, highlighting potential points of interaction and data transformation.

### 4.1. Document Creation

```mermaid
graph LR
    A("Client Application") --> B("POST /db_name");
    B --> C("HTTP Listener");
    C --> D("Request Router");
    D --> E("Authentication/Authorization");
    E --> F("Database Core");
    F --> G("Document Management");
    G --> H("Storage Engine");
    H --> I("Data Files");
    I --> G;
    G --> J("Indexer (if applicable)");
    J --> I;
    F --> K("Response (201 Created)");
    K --> A;
```

*   The **Client Application** initiates the document creation process by sending an HTTP `POST` request to the specific database URL (`/db_name`). The request body typically contains the JSON representation of the document to be created.
*   The **HTTP Listener** receives the incoming `POST` request.
*   The **Request Router** analyzes the request URL and method and directs it to the appropriate handler for document creation.
*   The **Authentication/Authorization** module verifies the client's identity and ensures they have the necessary permissions to create documents in the specified database.
*   The **Database Core** receives the validated request and delegates the document creation to the **Document Management** component.
*   The **Document Management** component processes the JSON document, assigns it a unique ID (if not provided), and interacts with the **Storage Engine** to persist the document.
*   The **Storage Engine** writes the document data to the **Data Files** on disk.
*   Optionally, if there are defined indexes for the database, the **Indexer** is notified of the new document and updates the relevant indexes.
*   Finally, the **Database Core** sends a success response (e.g., HTTP status code 201 Created) back to the **Client Application**, often including the document ID and revision number.

### 4.2. Document Retrieval

```mermaid
graph LR
    A("Client Application") --> B("GET /db_name/doc_id");
    B --> C("HTTP Listener");
    C --> D("Request Router");
    D --> E("Authentication/Authorization");
    E --> F("Database Core");
    F --> G("Document Management");
    G --> H("Storage Engine");
    H --> I("Data Files");
    I --> G;
    F --> J("Response (200 OK with document)");
    J --> A;
```

*   The **Client Application** requests a specific document by sending an HTTP `GET` request to the document's URL (`/db_name/doc_id`).
*   The **HTTP Listener** receives the `GET` request.
*   The **Request Router** directs the request to the appropriate handler for document retrieval.
*   The **Authentication/Authorization** module verifies the client's identity and permissions to access the requested document.
*   The **Database Core** receives the validated request and delegates the retrieval to the **Document Management** component.
*   The **Document Management** component interacts with the **Storage Engine** to fetch the document from the **Data Files**.
*   The **Storage Engine** retrieves the document data from disk.
*   The **Database Core** then sends a success response (e.g., HTTP status code 200 OK) back to the **Client Application**, with the document's JSON representation in the response body.

### 4.3. Data Replication

```mermaid
graph LR
    A("Source CouchDB") --> B("Replication Process");
    B --> C("Target CouchDB");
    C --> D("Replication Process");
    B -- "Request for Changes" --> A;
    A -- "Changes Feed" --> B;
    B -- "Document Transfer" --> C;
    C -- "Document Write" --> E("Target Database");
```

*   The **Replication Process** on the **Source CouchDB** initiates the replication process, either periodically or on demand.
*   The **Replication Process** on the source sends a "Request for Changes" to the **Source CouchDB**, specifying the target database and any relevant filters or parameters.
*   The **Source CouchDB** generates a "Changes Feed," which is a stream of updates (new documents, modified documents, deleted documents) that have occurred since the last replication.
*   The **Replication Process** on the source receives the "Changes Feed" and begins transferring the relevant documents to the **Target CouchDB**.
*   The **Replication Process** on the source sends the "Document Transfer" requests to the **Target CouchDB**.
*   The **Target CouchDB** receives the documents and performs a "Document Write" operation to its **Target Database**, potentially involving conflict resolution if the same document has been modified on both the source and target.

## 5. Key Technologies

*   **Erlang:** The foundational programming language for the CouchDB server, providing robust concurrency, fault tolerance, and distribution capabilities.
*   **HTTP:** The standard communication protocol used for the API, enabling interoperability with a wide range of clients and tools.
*   **JSON:** The lightweight data-interchange format used for storing documents and exchanging data through the API.
*   **JavaScript:** Used for defining Map and Reduce functions for creating custom indexes and performing data aggregation.
*   **Mnesia:** The default real-time distributed database management system provided by Erlang, used for storing CouchDB's data and metadata.
*   **Cowboy:** A high-performance, small-footprint HTTP server written in Erlang, used as the HTTP listener for CouchDB.
*   **OAuth (Optional):** A standard authorization framework that can be integrated for more secure and flexible authentication.
*   **SSL/TLS:** Essential for securing communication over HTTPS, encrypting data in transit between clients and the CouchDB server.
