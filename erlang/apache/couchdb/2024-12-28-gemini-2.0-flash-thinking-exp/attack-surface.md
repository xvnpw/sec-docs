### Key CouchDB Attack Surface List (High & Critical - CouchDB Specific)

*   **Attack Surface:** Unauthenticated HTTP API Access
    *   **Description:** CouchDB's HTTP API endpoints are accessible without requiring authentication, allowing direct interaction with the database.
    *   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB's configuration can permit unauthenticated access to databases and their data through its built-in HTTP API.
    *   **Example:** An attacker can directly access `http://<couchdb-host>:5984/<database>/_all_docs` to list all documents in a database without providing credentials, a feature inherent to CouchDB's API.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete data breach (read, modify, delete), potential for denial of service by overwhelming the CouchDB server, and the ability to create or modify administrative users within CouchDB.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable and Enforce Authentication:** Configure CouchDB to require authentication for all or sensitive API endpoints, utilizing CouchDB's built-in user authentication system or integrating with external providers.
        *   **Restrict Network Access:** Use firewalls or network segmentation to limit access to the CouchDB port (default 5984) to only trusted networks or specific IP addresses, controlling access to the CouchDB service itself.

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious View Function (MapReduce) or Mango Query Injection
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into CouchDB view functions or exploit vulnerabilities in CouchDB's Mango query processing to execute arbitrary code on the CouchDB server.
    *   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB's design allows users to define custom JavaScript functions for data processing in views and supports a JSON-based query language (Mango), creating potential injection points if not handled securely within CouchDB's execution environment.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a CouchDB view function that, when executed by CouchDB, reads sensitive files from the server's file system or executes system commands.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the CouchDB server, leading to complete system compromise, data exfiltration from the CouchDB instance, or denial of service of the CouchDB service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable or Restrict View Function Execution:** If CouchDB view functions are not strictly necessary, disable them within CouchDB's configuration. If required, carefully review and sanitize all view function code before deploying it to CouchDB.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Sanitize any user-provided input that is used in Mango queries processed by CouchDB to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the CouchDB process with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful code execution within the CouchDB environment.
        *   **Regularly Update CouchDB:** Ensure CouchDB is updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities in its view function execution engine or Mango query parser.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exploiting Default Administrator Credentials
    *   **Description:** The default administrator username and password for CouchDB are used, allowing unauthorized access with full administrative privileges to the CouchDB instance.
    *   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB, upon initial installation, has default credentials that are well-known if not changed, a common practice in many software systems including CouchDB.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uses the default `admin` username and password to log into CouchDB's administrative interface or API and gain complete control over the CouchDB database.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the CouchDB instance, including data access, modification, deletion, and the ability to create or modify users within CouchDB.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Change Default Credentials Immediately:** The first and most crucial step is to change the default administrator username and password to strong, unique credentials during the initial setup of CouchDB.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Attachment Handling
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in how CouchDB handles file attachments can be exploited to upload malicious files directly into CouchDB's storage or perform path traversal attacks within the CouchDB environment.
    *   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB's feature of allowing storage of binary attachments with documents introduces this attack surface if filename or content validation within CouchDB is insufficient.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Malicious File Upload:** An attacker uploads an executable file disguised as an image to a CouchDB document, which could be executed if accessed directly through a vulnerable application interacting with CouchDB.
        *   **Path Traversal:** An attacker uploads an attachment with a filename like `../../../../etc/passwd` to CouchDB, potentially overwriting sensitive files within the CouchDB server's file system if CouchDB doesn't properly sanitize the path.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution (if executable files are uploaded to CouchDB and subsequently executed), data corruption within the CouchDB database, or access to sensitive files on the CouchDB server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Filename Validation:** Implement strict validation of attachment filenames within the application interacting with CouchDB to prevent path traversal attempts when storing attachments in CouchDB.
        *   **Content Type Validation:** Validate the content type of uploaded attachments before storing them in CouchDB to ensure they match the expected type and prevent the upload of unexpected executable files.
        *   **Secure Storage Location:** Ensure attachments managed by CouchDB are stored in a secure location with appropriate access controls at the operating system level.
        *   **Consider Object Storage:** For sensitive applications, consider using dedicated object storage services instead of relying solely on CouchDB's built-in attachment handling features.

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Replication Configuration
    *   **Description:** Misconfigured or unsecured CouchDB replication can allow unauthorized access to data being replicated or the introduction of malicious data into a CouchDB instance.
    *   **How CouchDB Contributes to the Attack Surface:** CouchDB's replication feature, designed for synchronizing data between CouchDB instances, becomes an attack surface if the replication process itself is not properly secured within CouchDB.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** An attacker intercepts CouchDB replication traffic and modifies data being transferred between CouchDB instances.
        *   **Malicious Node Introduction:** An attacker sets up a rogue CouchDB instance and leverages CouchDB's replication protocol to inject malicious data into the legitimate system.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption within the CouchDB database, data breaches through unauthorized access to replicated data, and potential for denial of service of the CouchDB replication process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authentication and Authorization for Replication:** Ensure that CouchDB replication requires proper authentication and authorization between participating CouchDB nodes.
        *   **Use HTTPS for Replication:** Encrypt CouchDB replication traffic using HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks on data being synchronized between CouchDB instances.
        *   **Secure Network Connections:** Ensure the network connections between replicating CouchDB nodes are secure.
        *   **Carefully Manage Replication Partners:** Only configure CouchDB replication with trusted CouchDB instances.
