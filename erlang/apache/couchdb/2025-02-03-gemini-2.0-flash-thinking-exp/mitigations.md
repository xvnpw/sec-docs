# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/couchdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable "Admin Party"](./mitigation_strategies/disable_admin_party.md)

### 1. Disable "Admin Party"

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable "Admin Party"

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Edit CouchDB Configuration:** Access the `local.ini` or `default.ini` configuration file.
    2.  **Modify `[admins]` Section:**  Remove or comment out any default usernames and passwords in the `[admins]` section.  Optionally, set up initial admin user credentials if needed using secure methods.
    3.  **Restart CouchDB:** Apply changes by restarting the CouchDB service.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Administrative Access (High Severity):** Prevents default, unauthenticated administrative access to CouchDB.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Administrative Access:** High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, implemented in `couchdb.ini` within deployment scripts. Default admin credentials are removed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   N/A - Implemented across all environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

### 2. Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Roles:** Determine necessary user roles and their required permissions within CouchDB (e.g., read-only, write access to specific databases).
    2.  **Configure CouchDB Security:** Utilize CouchDB's security features (security objects, `validate_doc_update` in design documents) to define and enforce these roles. Manage roles via CouchDB API or tools.
    3.  **Assign Roles to Users:**  Assign appropriate roles to CouchDB users, either directly or through external authentication integration.
    4.  **Enforce Permissions:** Configure CouchDB security settings to actively enforce defined roles for data access and operations.
    5.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review and update roles and permissions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Medium to High Severity):** Restricts data access to authorized users based on their roles.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Limits users to their intended access levels.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Insider Threats (Medium Severity):** Reduces potential damage from compromised internal accounts by limiting access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium Risk Reduction
    *   **Data Breaches due to Insider Threats:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Database-level RBAC using CouchDB security objects is in place in production.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Document-level RBAC using `validate_doc_update` functions is not fully implemented for fine-grained control within databases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce HTTPS/TLS](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_httpstls.md)

### 3. Enforce HTTPS/TLS

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce HTTPS/TLS

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Obtain TLS Certificates:** Acquire TLS/SSL certificates for the CouchDB server.
    2.  **Configure CouchDB TLS:**  Edit `local.ini` or `default.ini` to enable TLS in the `[ssl]` section, providing paths to certificate and key files.
    3.  **Enable `httpsd` Listener:** Ensure the `httpsd` listener is enabled in the `[httpd]` section.
    4.  **Redirect HTTP to HTTPS (Recommended):** Configure redirection from HTTP to HTTPS, ideally via a reverse proxy.
    5.  **Verify Configuration:** Confirm CouchDB serves requests over HTTPS and validate certificate details.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data in Transit Interception (High Severity):** Encrypts communication to prevent eavesdropping.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks (High Severity):** Protects against interception and modification of data in transit.
    *   **Credential Theft (Medium Severity):** Reduces risk of credentials being stolen during transmission.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data in Transit Interception:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** High Risk Reduction
    *   **Credential Theft:** Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, HTTPS/TLS is enforced in production and staging using CA-signed certificates and HTTP redirection.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   TLS enforcement is inconsistent in development environments.  Self-signed certificates should be used at minimum in development.
