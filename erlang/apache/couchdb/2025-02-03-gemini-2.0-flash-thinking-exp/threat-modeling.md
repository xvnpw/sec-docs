# Threat Model Analysis for apache/couchdb

## Threat: [Default Admin Credentials](./threats/default_admin_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might attempt to log in to the CouchDB Fauxton interface or API using default credentials (e.g., `admin/password`, `admin` with no password). If successful, they gain full administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. Attackers can read, modify, or delete all data, create backdoors, and perform denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Affected CouchDB Component:** Authentication Module, Fauxton UI, API
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately change default administrator passwords upon initial CouchDB setup.
    *   Enforce strong password policies for all CouchDB users.
    *   Disable or restrict access to Fauxton UI in production environments if not needed.
    *   Regularly audit user accounts and permissions.

## Threat: [Weak or Misconfigured Authentication Mechanisms](./threats/weak_or_misconfigured_authentication_mechanisms.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers might exploit weak passwords, insecure authentication schemes (like Basic Auth over HTTP), or misconfigured user roles within CouchDB. They could brute-force weak passwords, intercept credentials over unencrypted channels, or leverage overly permissive roles to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, privilege escalation, potentially leading to data breaches and system compromise.
*   **Affected CouchDB Component:** Authentication Module, User Roles and Permissions System
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation) within CouchDB user management.
    *   Always use HTTPS (TLS) for all communication with CouchDB, especially for authentication.
    *   Carefully define and apply least privilege principles when assigning user roles and permissions within CouchDB.
    *   Consider using more robust CouchDB authentication methods if available and suitable for your application.
    *   Regularly review and audit CouchDB user roles and permissions.

## Threat: [API Key Compromise](./threats/api_key_compromise.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker might obtain CouchDB API keys through various means: eavesdropping on network traffic, accessing insecure storage locations, or social engineering. With compromised API keys, they can impersonate legitimate users or applications to access CouchDB directly.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to CouchDB resources, data breaches, data manipulation, abuse of application functionality, potentially leading to financial loss or reputational damage.
*   **Affected CouchDB Component:** API Authentication, API Key Management
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Store CouchDB API keys securely using environment variables, secrets management systems, or secure vaults.
    *   Avoid hardcoding CouchDB API keys in application code.
    *   Transmit CouchDB API keys only over HTTPS.
    *   Implement CouchDB API key rotation and revocation mechanisms.
    *   Monitor CouchDB API key usage for suspicious activity.
    *   Consider using short-lived CouchDB API keys or tokens.

## Threat: [Unsecured Public Exposure of CouchDB](./threats/unsecured_public_exposure_of_couchdb.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can scan the internet for publicly accessible CouchDB instances. If found, they can attempt to exploit vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, or default credentials to gain unauthorized access to the CouchDB server and its data.
*   **Impact:** Increased attack surface, making exploitation easier. Could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, denial of service, and system compromise of the CouchDB instance.
*   **Affected CouchDB Component:** Network Listener, Overall CouchDB Instance
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure CouchDB is not directly accessible from the public internet.
    *   Deploy CouchDB behind a firewall and restrict access to only necessary internal networks or application servers.
    *   Use network segmentation to isolate CouchDB in a secure network zone.
    *   Regularly scan for publicly exposed CouchDB instances.

## Threat: [Replication Security Issues](./threats/replication_security_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers might compromise a CouchDB replication partner or intercept replication traffic if not properly secured. They could then gain unauthorized access to replicated data or inject malicious data into the database through compromised replication processes within CouchDB.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches through unauthorized CouchDB replication, data corruption through malicious replication, denial of service if replication processes are abused, impacting CouchDB availability.
*   **Affected CouchDB Component:** Replication Module, Data Synchronization
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully control CouchDB replication configurations and only replicate to trusted destinations.
    *   Authenticate CouchDB replication partners using strong credentials.
    *   Use TLS encryption for all CouchDB replication traffic.
    *   Monitor CouchDB replication processes for anomalies and unauthorized replication attempts.
    *   Regularly review and audit CouchDB replication configurations.

## Threat: [Outdated CouchDB Version with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/outdated_couchdb_version_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated version of CouchDB with known security vulnerabilities exposes the application to exploitation. Attackers can leverage public exploits targeting CouchDB to compromise the CouchDB instance.
*   **Impact:** Potential for various attacks depending on the specific CouchDB vulnerabilities, including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and system compromise of the CouchDB server.
*   **Affected CouchDB Component:** All CouchDB Components (depending on vulnerability)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep CouchDB updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
    *   Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for CouchDB.
    *   Implement a vulnerability management process for CouchDB and related infrastructure.
    *   Automate patching and updates for CouchDB where possible.
