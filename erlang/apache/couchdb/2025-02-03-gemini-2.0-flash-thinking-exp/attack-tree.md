## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Data and/or Availability via CouchDB Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_data_andor_availability_via_couchdb_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*Description:* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to application data, disrupting application services, or both.
*Attack Vectors (Leading to this Goal):*
    * Exploiting Network Exposure of CouchDB
    * Exploiting Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses
    * Exploiting CouchDB Software Vulnerabilities

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Exposure of CouchDB [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_exposure_of_couchdb__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:* Attackers target vulnerabilities arising from how CouchDB is exposed on the network.  If network access is poorly controlled, it opens doors for various attacks.
*Attack Vectors (Within this Path):*
    * Unsecured Network Access

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsecured Network Access [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/unsecured_network_access__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:*  This is a fundamental security flaw where CouchDB is accessible from untrusted networks, especially the public internet, without proper network controls.
*Attack Vectors (Within this Path):*
    * CouchDB directly exposed to public internet without firewall/network segmentation

## Attack Tree Path: [CouchDB directly exposed to public internet without firewall/network segmentation [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/couchdb_directly_exposed_to_public_internet_without_firewallnetwork_segmentation__critical_node___hi_f67a6b98.md)

*Description:*  The most critical instance of unsecured network access. CouchDB is directly reachable from the internet, allowing anyone to attempt to connect and exploit vulnerabilities.
*Attack Characteristics:*
    * Likelihood: Medium (Common misconfiguration)
    * Impact: High (Full compromise possible)
    * Effort: Low (Easy to discover via network scanning)
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy (Network monitoring, port scanning detection)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication and Authorization Weaknesses [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_and_authorization_weaknesses__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:* Attackers aim to bypass or abuse CouchDB's authentication and authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
*Attack Vectors (Within this Path):*
    * Default Credentials
    * Weak Credentials

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:*  Using the default administrator credentials provided by CouchDB (if not changed). This is a very common and easily exploitable vulnerability.
*Attack Vectors (Within this Path):*
    * Using default admin credentials (e.g., admin/password if not changed)

## Attack Tree Path: [Using default admin credentials (e.g., admin/password if not changed) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/using_default_admin_credentials__e_g___adminpassword_if_not_changed___critical_node___high-risk_path_d951ba09.md)

*Description:*  Directly attempting to log in with well-known default credentials.
*Attack Characteristics:*
    * Likelihood: Medium (Common oversight)
    * Impact: High (Full admin access)
    * Effort: Low (Trivial to try)
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy (Authentication logs, failed login attempts for default users)

## Attack Tree Path: [Weak Credentials [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/weak_credentials__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:*  Exploiting weak passwords set by administrators or users. Weak passwords are susceptible to brute-force and dictionary attacks.
*Attack Vectors (Within this Path):*
    * Brute-force attacks on weak passwords

## Attack Tree Path: [Brute-force attacks on weak passwords [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/brute-force_attacks_on_weak_passwords__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:*  Systematically trying different password combinations to guess a weak password.
*Attack Characteristics:*
    * Likelihood: Medium (If weak passwords are allowed)
    * Impact: High (Account compromise, potential admin access)
    * Effort: Medium (Requires password cracking tools)
    * Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium (High volume of failed login attempts, account lockout events)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit CouchDB Software Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_couchdb_software_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:*  Targeting known or unknown vulnerabilities within the CouchDB software itself.
*Attack Vectors (Within this Path):*
    * Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs)
    * Outdated CouchDB Version

## Attack Tree Path: [Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs) [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/known_vulnerabilities__cves___critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:*  Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific CouchDB versions.
*Attack Vectors (Within this Path):*
    * Exploiting known vulnerabilities in specific CouchDB versions

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting known vulnerabilities in specific CouchDB versions [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_specific_couchdb_versions__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:*  Using exploits to leverage known CVEs to compromise the CouchDB instance.
*Attack Vectors (Within this Path):*
    * Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:*  Exploiting RCE vulnerabilities allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the CouchDB server, leading to full system compromise.
*Attack Characteristics:*
    * Likelihood: Medium (If systems are not patched promptly)
    * Impact: High (Full system compromise)
    * Effort: Low (If exploit is publicly available)
    * Skill Level: Beginner (to use exploit), Expert (to discover)
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium/Hard (Exploit attempts can be detected by IDS/IPS, but successful exploit might be harder to detect immediately)

## Attack Tree Path: [Outdated CouchDB Version [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/outdated_couchdb_version__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

*Description:* Running an outdated version of CouchDB that contains known, unpatched vulnerabilities.
*Attack Vectors (Within this Path):*
    * Running an outdated, unsupported version of CouchDB with known vulnerabilities

## Attack Tree Path: [Running an outdated, unsupported version of CouchDB with known vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/running_an_outdated__unsupported_version_of_couchdb_with_known_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high_99d14073.md)

*Description:*  Specifically running a version of CouchDB that is no longer supported and contains publicly known vulnerabilities that are not patched.
*Attack Characteristics:*
    * Likelihood: Medium (Organizations often lag in updates)
    * Impact: High (Exposure to all known vulnerabilities)
    * Effort: Low (Easy to identify outdated versions)
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Easy (Vulnerability scanning, version checks)
