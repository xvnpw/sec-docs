# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project aims to provide a robust, scalable, and fault-tolerant NoSQL database solution. The primary business priority is to offer a reliable data storage and retrieval system that can be used in a wide range of applications, from web applications to mobile apps and IoT devices. Key business goals include:

- Providing a flexible and schema-less data model.
- Ensuring high availability and data durability.
- Offering easy scalability to handle growing data volumes and user traffic.
- Supporting offline and mobile applications through replication capabilities.
- Enabling efficient data querying and indexing.

The most important business risks that need to be addressed are:

- Data loss due to system failures or disasters.
- Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
- Data corruption or integrity issues.
- Performance bottlenecks and service disruptions.
- Compliance violations with data privacy regulations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Access control lists (ACLs) for database and document level authorization. (Implemented within CouchDB core)
- security control: Authentication mechanisms including username/password and cookie-based authentication. (Implemented within CouchDB core)
- security control: HTTPS support for encrypted communication. (Requires external configuration of web server or load balancer)
- security control: Role-based access control (RBAC). (Implemented within CouchDB core)
- security control: Input validation on API endpoints to prevent injection attacks. (Implemented within CouchDB core)
- accepted risk: Reliance on external infrastructure for network security and physical security of servers.
- accepted risk: Complexity of configuration can lead to misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Implement audit logging to track access and modifications to data and system configurations.
- security control: Integrate with external authentication providers (e.g., LDAP, OAuth 2.0) for centralized user management.
- security control: Regularly perform security vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.
- security control: Implement database encryption at rest to protect data stored on disk.
- security control: Enhance input validation and sanitization to cover a wider range of potential injection vectors.

Security requirements:

- Authentication:
    - Requirement: The system must authenticate users before granting access to data or administrative functions.
    - Requirement: Support for strong password policies and multi-factor authentication should be considered.
    - Requirement: Securely store and manage user credentials.

- Authorization:
    - Requirement: The system must enforce granular access control to ensure users can only access data and perform actions they are authorized for.
    - Requirement: Role-based access control should be implemented to simplify user management and authorization.
    - Requirement: Principle of least privilege should be applied to all users and processes.

- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user inputs, especially those from external sources (API requests, user interfaces), must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both the client-side and server-side.
    - Requirement: Sanitize user inputs before storing them in the database to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data in transit must be encrypted using HTTPS.
    - Requirement: Consider encryption at rest for sensitive data stored in the database.
    - Requirement: Use strong cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    - Requirement: Securely manage cryptographic keys.
