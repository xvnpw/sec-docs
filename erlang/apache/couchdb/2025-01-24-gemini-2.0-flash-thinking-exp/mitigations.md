# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for apache/couchdb

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Administrator Password](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_administrator_password.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enforce Strong Administrator Password
*   **Description:**
    1.  Access the CouchDB configuration file (`local.ini`) located on the server where CouchDB is installed.
    2.  Navigate to the `[admins]` section within the `local.ini` file.
    3.  Set a strong, unique password for the administrator user directly within the `[admins]` section.  Example: `admin = your_strong_password`.
    4.  Restart the CouchDB service to apply the password change. Use the appropriate command for your operating system (e.g., `sudo systemctl restart couchdb`).
    5.  Store the administrator password securely, ideally using a password manager.
    6.  Avoid using default or easily guessable passwords.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Administrative Access (High Severity):** Default or weak administrator passwords allow attackers to gain full administrative control over the CouchDB instance, leading to complete compromise of data and service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Administrative Access:** High Risk Reduction.  Significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized administrative access by making it extremely difficult for attackers to guess or brute-force the administrator credentials.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in the production CouchDB instance configuration file (`local.ini` on the production server).
*   **Missing Implementation:** Not explicitly enforced in development or staging environments setup scripts.  Should be included in automated provisioning and documented in setup guides for all environments to ensure consistency.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable Authentication for All CouchDB Access](./mitigation_strategies/enable_authentication_for_all_couchdb_access.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Enable Authentication for All CouchDB Access
*   **Description:**
    1.  Open the CouchDB configuration file (`local.ini`).
    2.  Locate the `[httpd]` section.
    3.  Ensure the setting `require_valid_user = true` is present and uncommented within the `[httpd]` section. This setting forces authentication for all HTTP requests to CouchDB.
    4.  Restart the CouchDB service for the configuration change to take effect.
    5.  Verify that accessing CouchDB without authentication now results in an authentication error (e.g., HTTP 401 Unauthorized).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (High Severity):** Anonymous access allows anyone to read sensitive data stored in CouchDB without any authorization, leading to potential data breaches and privacy violations.
    *   **Data Manipulation (High Severity):** Unauthenticated users could potentially modify or delete data if write access is not properly controlled, leading to data integrity issues and service disruption.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):**  Open access points can be exploited for DoS attacks by overwhelming the server with unauthenticated requests.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access:** High Risk Reduction. Eliminates the risk of unauthorized data access by enforcing authentication for all CouchDB interactions.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** High Risk Reduction. Prevents unauthorized modification or deletion of data by requiring authenticated and authorized users.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Medium Risk Reduction. Reduces the attack surface for certain DoS attacks that rely on anonymous access.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in production and staging environments via `require_valid_user = true` in `local.ini`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Not consistently enforced in local development environments for developer convenience.  Consider providing scripts or documentation to easily enable/disable authentication in local dev environments to encourage secure development practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Design Documents](./mitigation_strategies/implement_role-based_access_control__rbac__using_design_documents.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using Design Documents
*   **Description:**
    1.  Define application-specific roles that align with data access needs (e.g., `administrator`, `editor`, `reader`).
    2.  Create or modify design documents within CouchDB databases to implement RBAC.
    3.  Within each relevant design document, define a `_security` object.
    4.  In the `_security` object, specify `admins` and `members` roles.  Use role names (prefixed with `role:`) to grant access to users with those roles. Example:
        ```json
        "_security": {
          "admins": { "roles": ["role:administrator"] },
          "members": { "roles": ["role:editor", "role:reader"] }
        }
        ```
    5.  Utilize `validate_doc_update` functions within design documents to enforce more granular access control logic based on roles and document content during write operations.
    6.  Assign roles to CouchDB users in the `_users` database.
    7.  Test and verify that RBAC rules are correctly enforced by attempting to access data with different user roles.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Without RBAC, users might inadvertently or intentionally gain access to data or perform actions beyond their authorized permissions within CouchDB.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Over-Permissions (Medium Severity):** Overly broad permissions increase the risk of data breaches if user accounts are compromised, as compromised accounts could access more data than necessary.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Lack of controlled write access can lead to unauthorized or accidental data modification, compromising data integrity.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** High Risk Reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of privilege escalation by strictly controlling access based on defined roles within CouchDB.
    *   **Data Breaches due to Over-Permissions:** Medium Risk Reduction. Limits the scope of potential data breaches by restricting access to only necessary data based on user roles.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium Risk Reduction. Enhances data integrity by controlling write access and ensuring only authorized users can modify specific documents.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic roles are defined, and some critical design documents utilize `_security` objects for basic access control. `validate_doc_update` functions are used in key databases.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Fine-grained RBAC is not consistently applied across all databases and design documents.  A comprehensive RBAC strategy needs to be defined and implemented across the entire CouchDB deployment, especially for new databases and features.  More detailed documentation and training for developers on implementing and maintaining RBAC in CouchDB are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Network Exposure to CouchDB Ports with Firewall](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_network_exposure_to_couchdb_ports_with_firewall.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Network Exposure to CouchDB Ports with Firewall
*   **Description:**
    1.  Configure a firewall (e.g., `iptables`, `firewalld`, cloud provider security groups) on the server hosting CouchDB.
    2.  By default, block all incoming traffic to CouchDB's default ports (TCP 5984 for HTTP, and TCP 6984 if using clustering or inter-node communication).
    3.  Create specific firewall rules to *allow* incoming traffic to CouchDB ports *only* from trusted and necessary sources:
        *   Allow access from application servers that require connectivity to CouchDB on port 5984.
        *   Allow access from designated administrator machines for CouchDB management, ideally through a secure channel like a VPN or SSH tunnel, on port 5984 (and 6984 if needed for cluster management).
        *   If external access is absolutely required (e.g., for a specific API endpoint through a reverse proxy), restrict access to only the necessary IP addresses or IP ranges and consider using a reverse proxy or API gateway in front of CouchDB.
    4.  Regularly review and update firewall rules to ensure they remain aligned with network architecture and access requirements, specifically for CouchDB ports.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **External Attacks Targeting CouchDB (High Severity):** Exposing CouchDB ports directly to the internet or untrusted networks increases the attack surface, making it vulnerable to various network-based attacks specifically targeting CouchDB services.
    *   **Unauthorized Access from Untrusted Networks (Medium Severity):** Without firewall restrictions on CouchDB ports, any system on the network (or internet if publicly exposed) can attempt to connect to CouchDB services, potentially bypassing authentication if vulnerabilities exist or misconfigurations are present.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **External Attacks Targeting CouchDB:** High Risk Reduction. Significantly reduces the risk of external attacks by limiting network accessibility to CouchDB services and ports to only authorized sources.
    *   **Unauthorized Access from Untrusted Networks:** Medium Risk Reduction. Prevents unauthorized network-level access to CouchDB services from networks outside the defined trusted zones.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Firewall rules are configured on production and staging servers to restrict access to CouchDB ports (5984 and 6984) to only application servers and authorized administrator IPs.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Firewall rules are not consistently applied in local development environments.  While local development might be more open for convenience, developers should be provided with clear instructions and scripts to easily configure firewalls for local CouchDB instances to better mirror production security practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep CouchDB Up-to-Date with Security Patches](./mitigation_strategies/keep_couchdb_up-to-date_with_security_patches.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Keep CouchDB Up-to-Date with Security Patches
*   **Description:**
    1.  Establish a routine process for monitoring CouchDB security announcements and release notes from the Apache CouchDB project. Subscribe to official mailing lists or monitor their security advisories page.
    2.  When a new CouchDB version or security patch is released, prioritize reviewing the release notes for security-related fixes and vulnerabilities addressed.
    3.  Before applying patches to production, thoroughly test the update in a dedicated staging or testing environment that mirrors the production setup. This includes functional testing and regression testing to ensure application compatibility and stability after the CouchDB update.
    4.  Schedule regular maintenance windows to apply tested security patches to production CouchDB instances. Follow documented upgrade procedures provided by the CouchDB project.
    5.  Document the patching process, including version numbers, dates of application, and any issues encountered. Maintain a record of applied patches for auditing and compliance purposes.
    6.  Consider implementing automated patch management tools or scripts to streamline the patch application process and reduce manual effort, especially for larger CouchDB deployments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known CouchDB Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Running outdated CouchDB versions exposes the system to publicly known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the database, gain unauthorized access, or cause service disruption.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known CouchDB Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction. Eliminates the risk of exploitation of known CouchDB vulnerabilities that are addressed by security patches and updates released by the CouchDB project.
*   **Currently Implemented:**  A monthly process is in place to check for CouchDB updates. A staging environment is used for testing updates before production deployment.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Patching is still largely a manual process.  Automation of patch application and testing workflows would improve efficiency, reduce the risk of human error, and ensure more timely application of critical security patches.  More detailed documentation of the patching process and responsibilities is needed.
