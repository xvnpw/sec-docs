Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving the RabbitMQ server, with high and critical severity:

**Key Attack Surface: Unencrypted AMQP Communication**

*   **Description:** Data transmitted between clients and the RabbitMQ server over the AMQP protocol is not encrypted.
*   **How RabbitMQ-server Contributes:** RabbitMQ, by default, listens for AMQP connections on port 5672 without enforcing encryption.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network intercepts communication between an application and RabbitMQ, reading sensitive message payloads and potentially capturing authentication credentials.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential compromise of application logic and data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS/SSL for AMQP: Configure RabbitMQ to require TLS/SSL for AMQP connections on port 5671.
    *   Force TLS: Disable the unencrypted AMQP listener (port 5672) entirely.

**Key Attack Surface: Default Credentials**

*   **Description:** The default `guest` user with the password `guest` exists and has default permissions, allowing anyone to connect without proper authentication.
*   **How RabbitMQ-server Contributes:** RabbitMQ creates this default user upon installation.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses the `guest/guest` credentials to connect to the RabbitMQ server and gain full access to messaging resources, potentially reading, writing, or deleting messages.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the messaging system, data manipulation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Immediately Change Default Credentials: Change the password for the `guest` user to a strong, unique password.
    *   Disable Default User: Disable or delete the `guest` user, especially in production environments.

**Key Attack Surface: Insecure HTTP Management Interface Configuration**

*   **Description:** The RabbitMQ management interface (accessible via HTTP/HTTPS) is not properly secured, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation.
*   **How RabbitMQ-server Contributes:** RabbitMQ provides this interface for administration and monitoring.
*   **Example:**
    *   The management interface is accessible over unencrypted HTTP, allowing interception of login credentials.
    *   Weak or default credentials for management users allow unauthorized login.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the RabbitMQ server, including the ability to create/delete users, queues, exchanges, and bindings, leading to service disruption or data compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce HTTPS: Configure the management interface to only accept connections over HTTPS.
    *   Strong Authentication: Use strong, unique passwords for all management users.
    *   Network Segmentation: Restrict access to the management interface to authorized networks or IP addresses.

**Key Attack Surface: Unsecured Inter-Node Communication (Clustering)**

*   **Description:** Communication between nodes in a RabbitMQ cluster is not encrypted or authenticated, allowing malicious nodes to join or eavesdrop.
*   **How RabbitMQ-server Contributes:** RabbitMQ uses the Erlang distribution protocol for inter-node communication.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the same network as the RabbitMQ cluster intercepts communication between nodes, potentially gaining access to sensitive information or injecting malicious commands. An attacker could also potentially join the cluster as a rogue node if the Erlang cookie is compromised.
*   **Impact:** Cluster instability, data corruption, potential takeover of the entire messaging infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable TLS for Inter-Node Communication: Configure RabbitMQ to use TLS for communication between cluster nodes.
    *   Secure Erlang Cookie: Protect the `.erlang.cookie` file with appropriate file system permissions and restrict access.
    *   Network Segmentation: Isolate the RabbitMQ cluster network to prevent unauthorized access.
