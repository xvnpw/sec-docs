## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to RabbitMQ (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_rabbitmq__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the foundational step for many other attacks. Successful unauthorized access grants the attacker the ability to manipulate the broker, messages, and potentially the application.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  A successful breach here has a critical impact, allowing for a wide range of malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Default Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_default_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to find and use the default usernames and passwords that come with RabbitMQ installations.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Default credentials are often publicly known and easy to find, making this a highly likely initial attack vector with critical impact if successful.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use Default Credentials to Login (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/use_default_credentials_to_login__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker uses the identified default credentials to log into the RabbitMQ management interface or connect directly to the broker.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  If default credentials haven't been changed, this is a trivial attack with immediate critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability (e.g., CVE) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_authentication_bypass_vulnerability__e_g___cve___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities in RabbitMQ's authentication mechanism to bypass the login process.
*   **Why Critical:** Successful exploitation grants immediate unauthorized access, a critical impact. While the likelihood of a *specific* CVE being present and exploitable might vary, the potential impact is always critical.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Vulnerability to Bypass Authentication (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerability_to_bypass_authentication__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the execution phase of exploiting an authentication bypass vulnerability.
*   **Why Critical:**  Directly leads to unauthorized access, a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Network Exposure (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_network_exposure__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  RabbitMQ management or broker ports are exposed to the public internet without proper access controls.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Public exposure significantly increases the likelihood of various attacks, including brute-forcing and exploiting default credentials, leading to a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [RabbitMQ Management Interface Exposed to Public Network (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/rabbitmq_management_interface_exposed_to_public_network__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The RabbitMQ management interface (typically on port 15672) is accessible from the public internet.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This provides a direct and easily accessible attack surface, increasing the likelihood of unauthorized access and control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Management Interface Without Authentication or Weak Credentials (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/access_management_interface_without_authentication_or_weak_credentials__critical_node__high-risk_pat_0c4e418f.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers access the publicly exposed management interface using default or easily guessable credentials.
*   **Why High-Risk:**  Combines a likely misconfiguration (public exposure) with a common security weakness (weak credentials), leading to a high likelihood of critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse RabbitMQ Management Features (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_rabbitmq_management_features__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Once authenticated (legitimately or illegitimately) to the management interface, attackers use its features for malicious purposes.
*   **Why High-Risk:** The management interface provides powerful capabilities, making its abuse highly impactful.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Management Interface (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_management_interface__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Achieving successful login to the RabbitMQ management interface.
*   **Why High-Risk:** This is a prerequisite for abusing management features, making it a critical step in a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Perform Malicious Actions via Management Interface (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/perform_malicious_actions_via_management_interface__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Using the management interface to perform actions that compromise the application or RabbitMQ.
*   **Why High-Risk:** The management interface offers significant control, leading to potentially critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create/Modify Users and Permissions (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/createmodify_users_and_permissions__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers create new administrative users or modify existing permissions to gain further control.
*   **Why Critical:** This allows for persistent access and the ability to perform any action on the broker.

## Attack Tree Path: [Reconfigure Broker Settings to Disrupt Service or Gain Further Access (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/reconfigure_broker_settings_to_disrupt_service_or_gain_further_access__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers change broker settings to cause denial of service or to create backdoors for future access.
*   **Why Critical:**  Directly impacts the availability of RabbitMQ and potentially the application, or facilitates further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit RabbitMQ Server Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rabbitmq_server_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the RabbitMQ server software itself.
*   **Why Critical:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution or denial of service at the RabbitMQ level, a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Code Vulnerabilities (e.g., CVEs in RabbitMQ Server itself) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_code_vulnerabilities__e_g___cves_in_rabbitmq_server_itself___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting specific, publicly known vulnerabilities in the RabbitMQ codebase.
*   **Why Critical:** These vulnerabilities, if present and unpatched, can be exploited for significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Vulnerable Code Path (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_vulnerable_code_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The process of finding and successfully exploiting a vulnerable code section in RabbitMQ.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the step that directly leads to the exploitation of a code vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Successfully executing arbitrary code on the RabbitMQ server.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the highest level of compromise, granting the attacker full control over the server and potentially the application's environment.
