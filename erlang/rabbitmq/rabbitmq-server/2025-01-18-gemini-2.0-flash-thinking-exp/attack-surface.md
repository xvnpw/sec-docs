# Attack Surface Analysis for rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Management Interface Credentials](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_management_interface_credentials.md)

**Description:** The RabbitMQ management interface is accessible via a web browser and allows administrative control. Using default credentials or weak passwords makes it easily accessible to attackers.

**How RabbitMQ-server Contributes:** RabbitMQ ships with a default user (`guest`) and password (`guest`). If not changed, this provides an immediate entry point.

**Example:** An attacker attempts to log in to the management interface using the default `guest/guest` credentials and gains full administrative access.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the RabbitMQ instance, including the ability to view, modify, and delete queues, exchanges, bindings, and user permissions. This can lead to data loss, service disruption, and unauthorized access to messages.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Immediately change the default password for the `guest` user or disable it entirely.
*   Enforce strong password policies for all RabbitMQ users.
*   Implement proper user and permission management, granting only necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Unencrypted Communication Channels (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP, Management Interface)](./attack_surfaces/unencrypted_communication_channels__amqp__mqtt__stomp__management_interface_.md)

**Description:**  Data transmitted between clients and the RabbitMQ server, or between nodes in a cluster, is sent in plaintext if encryption is not enabled.

**How RabbitMQ-server Contributes:** RabbitMQ supports various protocols (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP) and the management interface, all of which can operate over unencrypted TCP connections by default.

**Example:** An attacker eavesdrops on network traffic and captures sensitive data, such as message payloads, user credentials, or configuration details being transmitted over an unencrypted AMQP connection.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, including message content, user credentials, and potentially application secrets. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized access, and further attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable TLS/SSL encryption for all client connections (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP).
*   Configure the management interface to use HTTPS.
*   For clustered environments, enable TLS for inter-node communication.

## Attack Surface: [Erlang Cookie Mismanagement (Inter-Node Communication)](./attack_surfaces/erlang_cookie_mismanagement__inter-node_communication_.md)

**Description:** The Erlang cookie is used for authentication between nodes in a RabbitMQ cluster. If this cookie is compromised or easily guessable, an attacker can join the cluster as a legitimate node.

**How RabbitMQ-server Contributes:** RabbitMQ relies on the Erlang distribution mechanism for inter-node communication, which uses the Erlang cookie for authentication.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the `.erlang.cookie` file on one of the RabbitMQ servers or uses a default/weak cookie value to join the cluster, gaining full control over the cluster's operations.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the RabbitMQ cluster, allowing the attacker to manipulate data, disrupt service, and potentially gain access to underlying systems.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the Erlang cookie is randomly generated and kept secret.
*   Restrict access to the `.erlang.cookie` file on all cluster nodes.
*   Consider using more robust authentication mechanisms for inter-node communication if available in future RabbitMQ versions.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Management Interface](./attack_surfaces/exposed_management_interface.md)

**Description:** Making the RabbitMQ management interface publicly accessible without proper access controls significantly increases the attack surface.

**How RabbitMQ-server Contributes:** RabbitMQ's management interface, while useful, can be a major vulnerability if exposed to the internet without strong authentication and authorization.

**Example:** An attacker discovers the publicly accessible management interface and attempts to brute-force login credentials or exploit known vulnerabilities in the interface.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to administrative functions, potentially leading to complete compromise of the RabbitMQ instance.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict access to the management interface to trusted networks or specific IP addresses using firewalls or network segmentation.
*   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the management interface.
*   Consider using a VPN or bastion host to access the management interface.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Bypass in Messaging Protocols](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_messaging_protocols.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in the authentication or authorization mechanisms of the messaging protocols (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP) could allow unauthorized clients to connect and interact with the broker.

**How RabbitMQ-server Contributes:** RabbitMQ implements these protocols, and misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in their implementation can lead to bypasses.

**Example:** An attacker exploits a flaw in the AMQP authentication process to connect to the broker without providing valid credentials, allowing them to publish or consume messages.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to messaging infrastructure, potentially leading to data breaches, message manipulation, or service disruption.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for all messaging protocols.
*   Implement fine-grained authorization rules to control access to queues and exchanges.
*   Regularly review and update RabbitMQ configurations related to authentication and authorization.
