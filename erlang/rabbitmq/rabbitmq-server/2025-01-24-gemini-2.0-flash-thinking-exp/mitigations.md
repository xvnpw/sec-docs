# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Change Default Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/change_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Access the RabbitMQ server configuration file (typically `rabbitmq.conf` or `advanced.config`).
    2.  Locate and modify the configuration for the default `guest` user.
    3.  Change the default password to a strong, unique password.
    4.  Ideally, disable the `guest` user entirely by removing or commenting out its configuration within the RabbitMQ server configuration.
    5.  Restart the RabbitMQ server for the changes to take effect.
    6.  Ensure no applications or scripts are using the default credentials.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to RabbitMQ Server - Severity: High
    *   Exploitation via Default Credentials - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strong Password Policies](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strong_password_policies.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Define password complexity requirements (length, character types) suitable for RabbitMQ user accounts.
    2.  Configure RabbitMQ's authentication mechanisms (if possible directly, or through external authentication plugins) to enforce these policies during user creation and password changes.  For built-in authentication, policy enforcement might require external scripting or processes.

    *   Dictionary Attacks against RabbitMQ Users: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Compromise of Weak RabbitMQ User Credentials: Medium Risk Reduction
*   **Currently Implemented:** No - No formal password policies are enforced within RabbitMQ server configuration or user management processes.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Implementation of password policy enforcement within RabbitMQ user management, and documentation of these policies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize External Authentication (LDAP/AD)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_external_authentication__ldapad_.md)

    3.  Map RabbitMQ user authentication to the external directory service, leveraging existing user accounts and password policies managed centrally.
    4.  Test and verify successful authentication against the external directory service through RabbitMQ.
    5.  Reduce reliance on RabbitMQ's internal user database for authentication.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Weak Local RabbitMQ Authentication - Severity: Medium
    *   Decentralized RabbitMQ User Management - Severity: Low

    1.  Define roles within RabbitMQ that align with application needs and user responsibilities (e.g., publisher, consumer, administrator).
    2.  Create RabbitMQ users and assign them to the defined roles.
    3.  Utilize RabbitMQ's permission system to grant permissions to roles, controlling access to virtual hosts, exchanges, queues, and routing keys.
    4.  Apply these role-based permissions using `rabbitmqctl` commands or the RabbitMQ management UI.
    5.  Regularly review and adjust RabbitMQ roles and permissions as application requirements evolve.
