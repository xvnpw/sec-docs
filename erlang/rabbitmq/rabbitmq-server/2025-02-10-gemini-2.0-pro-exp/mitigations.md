# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Default Guest User](./mitigation_strategies/disable_default_guest_user.md)

**1. Disable Default Guest User**

*   **Description:**
    1.  Locate the RabbitMQ configuration file (`rabbitmq.conf` or `advanced.config`).
    2.  Open the configuration file.
    3.  Set `loopback_users = none` (advanced format) or `{rabbit, [{loopback_users, []}]}.` (Erlang term format).
    4.  Save the file.
    5.  Restart the RabbitMQ server.
    6.  Verify by attempting to connect with the `guest` user.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Critical):** Prevents use of the default `guest` user/password.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High):** If `guest` has excessive permissions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented in production via Ansible playbook `rabbitmq_config.yml`.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Missing in the staging environment.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strong, Unique Credentials (within RabbitMQ)](./mitigation_strategies/strong__unique_credentials__within_rabbitmq_.md)

**2. Strong, Unique Credentials (within RabbitMQ)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all RabbitMQ user accounts.
    2.  Generate strong, unique passwords for each user (password manager recommended).
    3.  Update passwords using `rabbitmqctl change_password <username> <new_password>`. 
    4.  Document passwords securely.
    *Note: This focuses on managing passwords *within* RabbitMQ.  External password policies are not directly RabbitMQ-server related.*

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High):** Reduces risk of password guessing/brute-forcing.
    *   **Credential Stuffing (High):** Prevents reuse of stolen credentials.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Strong passwords used in production, managed via password manager.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Some dev/test environments use weak passwords.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit User Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_user_permissions__principle_of_least_privilege_.md)

**3. Limit User Permissions (Principle of Least Privilege)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify user roles (producers, consumers, admins).
    2.  Define *minimum* necessary permissions for each role:
        *   Virtual Host Access.
        *   Configure Permissions (exchanges/queues).
        *   Write Permissions (exchanges).
        *   Read Permissions (queues).
    3.  Use RabbitMQ's permission model (regular expressions) to define permissions. Be specific; avoid broad wildcards. Example: `rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p /my_vhost my_user "" "my_queue" ".*"`.
    4.  Create separate user accounts for each role.
    5.  Regularly review and audit permissions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High):** Limits access for compromised accounts.
    *   **Data Breach (Medium):** Reduces potential damage from compromised accounts.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Medium):** Reduces risk of accidental resource deletion/modification.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially. Basic role separation exists, but permissions are not granular enough.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Permissions are too broad in many cases. Comprehensive review needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [TLS/SSL Encryption (Server Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/tlsssl_encryption__server_configuration_.md)

**4. TLS/SSL Encryption (Server Configuration)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  Obtain TLS/SSL certificates.
    2.  Configure RabbitMQ in `rabbitmq.conf`:
        ```
        listeners.ssl.default = 5671
        ssl_options.cacertfile = /path/to/ca_certificate.pem
        ssl_options.certfile   = /path/to/server_certificate.pem
        ssl_options.keyfile    = /path/to/server_key.pem
        ssl_options.verify     = verify_peer
        ssl_options.fail_if_no_peer_cert = true
        ```
    3.  Restart RabbitMQ.
    *Note: This focuses on the *server-side* TLS configuration. Client configuration is not included here.*
    4. For cluster, configure inter-node communication to use TLS.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Eavesdropping (High):** Prevents intercepting messages.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High):** Prevents impersonation/modification.
    *   **Data Breach (Medium):** Protects data in transit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Eavesdropping:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
    *   **Data Breach:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (for data in transit).

*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented for client-to-server in production. Self-signed certs in dev/test.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Inter-node communication not yet secured with TLS.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Connection Limits](./mitigation_strategies/connection_limits.md)

**5. Connection Limits**

    2.  In `rabbitmq.conf`, set `max_connections = <value>`.  Example: `max_connections = 1024`.
    3.  Save and restart RabbitMQ.
    4.  Monitor connection counts.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Prevents connection exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented with `max_connections = 1024` in all environments.

*   **Missing Implementation:** No per-user connection limits.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Message Rate Limiting (Queue Length Limit - Server-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/message_rate_limiting__queue_length_limit_-_server-side_.md)

**6. Message Rate Limiting (Queue Length Limit - Server-Side)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify queues susceptible to flooding.
    2.  Determine a reasonable maximum queue length.
    3.  Set the `x-max-length` argument when creating/modifying the queue.  Example (using `rabbitmqctl`): `rabbitmqctl set_policy -p /my_vhost my_queue_limit "^my_queue$" '{"max-length": 1000}' --apply-to queues`.
    4.  Monitor queue lengths.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):** Prevents queue flooding.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium):** Limits memory/disk usage by queues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented on a few critical queues in production.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Not consistently applied to all queues.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Alarms (Memory and Disk)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_alarms__memory_and_disk_.md)

**7. Resource Alarms (Memory and Disk)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  Determine appropriate memory and disk space thresholds.
    2.  Configure `vm_memory_high_watermark.relative` in `rabbitmq.conf`. Example: `vm_memory_high_watermark.relative = 0.4`.
    3.  Configure `disk_free_limit.absolute` in `rabbitmq.conf`. Example: `disk_free_limit.absolute = 50MB`.
    *Note: This focuses on *configuring* the alarms within RabbitMQ.  External monitoring/alerting systems are not included.*
    4. Regularly review and adjust thresholds.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Provides early warning of resource exhaustion.
    *   **System Instability (High):** Prevents crashes due to resource exhaustion.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduced from High to Medium.
    *   **System Instability:** Risk reduced from High to Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic alarms configured.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Thresholds may need fine-tuning.

* **Description:**
    1. Obtain TLS/SSL certificates.
    2. Configure `ssl_options` for the `rabbit` application in the configuration file (`rabbitmq.conf` or `advanced.config`). This involves specifying paths to certificate and key files, similar to client-server TLS configuration, but within the `rabbit` application section.
    3. Restart RabbitMQ nodes.
