# Threat Model Analysis for rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server

## Threat: [Unauthorized Broker Access (Spoofing)](./threats/unauthorized_broker_access__spoofing_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Broker Access (Spoofing)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the RabbitMQ broker by guessing or stealing credentials, or by exploiting a misconfiguration that allows unauthenticated access. The attacker could then publish malicious messages, consume legitimate messages, or disrupt the service.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breaches (reading sensitive messages, assuming the application didn't encrypt them).
        *   Data corruption (injecting malicious messages).
        *   Denial of service (flooding queues, exhausting resources).
        *   System compromise (if combined with other vulnerabilities).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `rabbit_auth_backend_internal`: The internal authentication backend.
        *   `rabbit_access_control`: The module responsible for enforcing access control rules.
        *   Network listeners (e.g., `rabbit_amqp_connection` for AMQP connections).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Authentication:** Enforce strong, unique passwords or, preferably, use client-side certificate authentication (mutual TLS).
        *   **Disable Default User:** Delete or change the password of the default `guest` user *immediately* after installation.
        *   **Virtual Hosts (vhosts):** Use vhosts to isolate different applications and limit the scope of access.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Restrict network access to the RabbitMQ ports (5672, 15672) to only authorized clients.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Connection Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_connection_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Connection Exhaustion (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker opens a large number of connections to the RabbitMQ broker, exhausting available resources (file descriptors, memory) and preventing legitimate clients from connecting.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Service unavailability.
        *   Potential for cascading failures if other systems depend on RabbitMQ.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `rabbit_networking`: The core networking module.
        *   `rabbit_listener`: The component that manages listeners for different protocols.
        *   Operating system resources (file descriptors, sockets).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Connection Limits:** Configure maximum connection limits per user, vhost, and globally.
        *   **Firewall Rules:** Limit the number of connections from a single IP address.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor connection counts and resource usage to detect and respond to attacks.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Message Flooding (DoS)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_message_flooding__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Message Flooding (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a large volume of messages to a queue or exchange, overwhelming the broker's resources (memory, disk space) and causing it to become unresponsive.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Service unavailability.
        *   Data loss (if messages are not durable and the broker crashes).
        *   Disk space exhaustion.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `rabbit_queue`: The queue component.
        *   `rabbit_exchange`: The exchange component.
        *   Memory management (`rabbit_memory_monitor`).
        *   Disk space management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Queue Length Limits:** Set maximum queue lengths and define policies for handling overflow (reject, drop, dead-letter).
        *   **Message TTL (Time-To-Live):** Set TTLs for messages to automatically expire old messages.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor queue lengths, memory usage, and disk space.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Management Interface (Information Disclosure)](./threats/information_disclosure_via_management_interface__information_disclosure_.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Management Interface (Information Disclosure)

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the RabbitMQ management interface, exposing sensitive information about the broker's configuration, queues, exchanges, connections, and users.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure of sensitive configuration details (e.g., credentials, vhost settings).
        *   Leakage of message metadata (e.g., routing keys, queue names).
        *   Potential for reconnaissance and further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `rabbitmq_management`: The management plugin.
        *   `rabbitmq_management_agent`: The agent that handles management requests.
        *   HTTP server (used by the management interface).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Management Interface:** Use strong authentication (username/password, or preferably, client certificates) for the management interface.
        *   **Restrict Access:** Limit access to the management interface to specific IP addresses or networks.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any management features that are not required.
        *   **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS for the management interface to encrypt communication.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in RabbitMQ (Elevation of Privilege)](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_rabbitmq__elevation_of_privilege_.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in RabbitMQ (Elevation of Privilege)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or unknown vulnerability in the RabbitMQ server code or its dependencies to gain elevated privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete system compromise.
        *   Data theft.
        *   Data destruction.
        *   Installation of malware.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Potentially any component of RabbitMQ, depending on the vulnerability.  This could include core modules, plugins, or external libraries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep RabbitMQ Updated:** Regularly update RabbitMQ to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Run as Non-Root:** Run RabbitMQ as a dedicated, non-privileged user.
        *   **Harden Host System:** Secure the underlying operating system.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan the RabbitMQ server and its dependencies for vulnerabilities.
