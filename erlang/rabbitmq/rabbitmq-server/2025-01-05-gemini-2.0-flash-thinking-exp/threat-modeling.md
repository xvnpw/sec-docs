# Threat Model Analysis for rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server

## Threat: [Weak Default Credentials](./threats/weak_default_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the RabbitMQ management interface or broker functionality by exploiting the default `guest` user with the `guest` password. They might log in through the management UI or use AMQP clients with these credentials.

**Impact:** Full control over the RabbitMQ instance, including the ability to view, create, modify, and delete exchanges, queues, bindings, and users. This can lead to data breaches, service disruption, and the ability to inject malicious messages.

**Affected Component:** Authentication module, Management UI, AMQP connection handling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Immediately change the default password for the `guest` user or disable it entirely.
* Implement strong password policies for all RabbitMQ users.

## Threat: [Insufficient Access Controls](./threats/insufficient_access_controls.md)

**Description:** An attacker, either an insider or someone who has gained access through compromised credentials, exploits overly permissive user permissions configured within RabbitMQ. They might publish to sensitive exchanges, consume from critical queues they shouldn't have access to, or perform administrative actions beyond their intended scope.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data within messages, disruption of message flow, potential data manipulation, and escalation of privileges within the messaging system.

**Affected Component:** Authorization module, User and Permission management.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement the principle of least privilege when assigning permissions to users and vhosts within RabbitMQ.
* Regularly review and audit user permissions configured in RabbitMQ.
* Utilize RabbitMQ's fine-grained permission system to restrict access to specific resources.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Message Traffic (Snooping)](./threats/unencrypted_message_traffic__snooping_.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between publishers, consumers, and the RabbitMQ broker. If TLS encryption is not configured on the RabbitMQ server and client connections, they can read the content of messages in transit.

**Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive data contained within messages processed by RabbitMQ.

**Affected Component:** AMQP protocol handling, Network communication configuration within RabbitMQ.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enforce TLS encryption for all client connections to the RabbitMQ broker by configuring the server to require it.
* Ensure that TLS certificates are properly configured and managed on the RabbitMQ server.

## Threat: [Message Tampering (Without Integrity Checks)](./threats/message_tampering__without_integrity_checks_.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic and modifies message content before it reaches the broker or consumers. If message integrity mechanisms are not enforced by the RabbitMQ server or clients, these modifications go undetected.

**Impact:** Data integrity compromise, leading to incorrect processing, application errors, or malicious actions based on altered data flowing through RabbitMQ.

**Affected Component:** AMQP protocol handling within RabbitMQ.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize TLS encryption, configured on the RabbitMQ server, which provides some level of integrity protection.
* Implement application-level message signing or hashing, ensuring both publishers and consumers verify integrity, but the server configuration to enforce TLS is crucial.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Management UI](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_management_ui.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the RabbitMQ management interface without proper authentication. This could be due to weak credentials configured on the server, exposed ports on the server, or vulnerabilities in the UI component of the RabbitMQ server.

**Impact:** Full control over the RabbitMQ instance, allowing the attacker to manage all aspects of the broker, potentially leading to service disruption, data breaches, and malicious configuration changes.

**Affected Component:** Management UI plugin, Authentication module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the management interface with strong authentication and authorization configured within RabbitMQ.
* Restrict access to the management interface to authorized networks or IP addresses using firewall rules protecting the RabbitMQ server.
* Keep the RabbitMQ server and its plugins up to date to patch any known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Management API Exploitation](./threats/management_api_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the RabbitMQ management API to perform unauthorized actions. This could involve sending malicious requests to create, delete, or modify resources managed by the RabbitMQ server.

**Impact:** Similar to unauthorized access to the management UI, this can lead to full control over the broker, service disruption, and data manipulation.

**Affected Component:** Management API, HTTP endpoint handling within the RabbitMQ server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the management API with strong authentication and authorization configured within RabbitMQ (same as management UI).
* Regularly update RabbitMQ to patch API vulnerabilities.
* Implement input validation and sanitization on the management API endpoints within the RabbitMQ server.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Connection Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_connection_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker establishes a large number of connections to the RabbitMQ broker, exhausting its resources (e.g., file descriptors, memory) on the server. This prevents legitimate clients from connecting or functioning properly.

**Impact:** Service unavailability, impacting applications that rely on RabbitMQ for messaging.

**Affected Component:** Connection management, AMQP listener within the RabbitMQ server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure connection limits on the RabbitMQ broker.
* Implement rate limiting or connection throttling at the network level (e.g., using firewalls) protecting the RabbitMQ server.
* Monitor connection metrics on the RabbitMQ server and set up alerts for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Queue Overflow](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_queue_overflow.md)

**Description:** An attacker publishes a massive number of messages to one or more queues, overwhelming the broker's resources (memory, disk) on the server or the capacity of consumers to process them.

**Impact:** Service degradation, message loss (if queue limits are reached), and potential crashes of the RabbitMQ broker.

**Affected Component:** Queue management, Message storage within the RabbitMQ server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Set queue limits (e.g., message count, queue length, message size) on the RabbitMQ server.
* Implement dead-letter exchanges to handle messages that cannot be processed, preventing queue buildup on the main queues.
* Monitor queue depths and consumer performance on the RabbitMQ server.
* Implement rate limiting on publishers if necessary.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits security vulnerabilities in third-party or custom RabbitMQ plugins installed on the server.

**Impact:**  The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability and the plugin's functionality. It could range from information disclosure to remote code execution on the RabbitMQ server.

**Affected Component:** Plugin architecture, specific vulnerable plugin.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only install trusted and necessary plugins on the RabbitMQ server.
* Keep all plugins up to date with the latest security patches.
* Regularly review the security of installed plugins.
* Follow secure development practices when creating custom plugins.

## Threat: [Inter-Node Communication Exploitation (Clustering)](./threats/inter-node_communication_exploitation__clustering_.md)

**Description:** In a clustered RabbitMQ setup, an attacker intercepts or manipulates communication between the nodes if it's not properly secured on the RabbitMQ servers.

**Impact:** Compromise of the entire RabbitMQ cluster, potentially leading to data corruption, service disruption, and unauthorized access to cluster resources.

**Affected Component:** Cluster communication module (Erlang distribution) within the RabbitMQ server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Enable TLS encryption for inter-node communication within the RabbitMQ cluster configuration.
* Secure the network infrastructure to prevent unauthorized access to cluster communication ports on the RabbitMQ servers.

## Threat: [Lack of Resource Limits](./threats/lack_of_resource_limits.md)

**Description:**  Absence of proper resource limits on connections, channels, or memory usage configured on the RabbitMQ server allows an attacker (or even unintentional usage) to overwhelm the RabbitMQ server.

**Impact:** Performance degradation, service instability, and potential crashes of the RabbitMQ broker.

**Affected Component:** Resource management, Connection and Channel handling within the RabbitMQ server.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (While potentially critical in impact, the direct exploitation often involves overwhelming the server, making it high priority for mitigation)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure appropriate resource limits for connections, channels, memory, and disk usage on the RabbitMQ server.
* Monitor resource consumption on the RabbitMQ server and set up alerts for exceeding thresholds.
