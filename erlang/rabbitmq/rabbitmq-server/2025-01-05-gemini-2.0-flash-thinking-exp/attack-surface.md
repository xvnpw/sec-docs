# Attack Surface Analysis for rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server

## Attack Surface: [Unprotected AMQP Port](./attack_surfaces/unprotected_amqp_port.md)

**Description:** Unprotected AMQP Port
    * **How RabbitMQ-Server Contributes to the Attack Surface:** RabbitMQ listens for client connections on a configurable AMQP port (default 5672). If this port is exposed to untrusted networks without proper authentication and authorization, it becomes a direct entry point managed by the RabbitMQ service.
    * **Example:** An attacker on the internet can connect to the exposed AMQP port managed by RabbitMQ and attempt to authenticate using default credentials or exploit any potential protocol vulnerabilities within RabbitMQ's AMQP handling.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the messaging system, allowing attackers to publish, consume, and manipulate messages, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or control of connected applications.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong authentication mechanisms within RabbitMQ (e.g., using strong passwords, x509 certificates).
        * Utilize network firewalls to restrict access to the AMQP port to only trusted IP addresses or networks. This is a network-level control, but essential for protecting the RabbitMQ service.
        * Enable TLS encryption for AMQP connections within RabbitMQ to protect data in transit.
        * Regularly review and update user permissions and access controls configured within RabbitMQ.

## Attack Surface: [Weak or Default Credentials on Management Interface](./attack_surfaces/weak_or_default_credentials_on_management_interface.md)

**Description:** Weak or Default Credentials on Management Interface
    * **How RabbitMQ-Server Contributes to the Attack Surface:** RabbitMQ provides a web-based management interface accessible via HTTP (default port 15672). Default credentials or weak passwords for administrative users configured within RabbitMQ create a significant vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An attacker can access the RabbitMQ management interface using default credentials ("guest"/"guest") or easily guessable passwords and gain full control over the RabbitMQ server.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the RabbitMQ instance, allowing attackers to manage users, permissions, exchanges, queues, and potentially access or manipulate messages handled by RabbitMQ. This can lead to severe data breaches and service disruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Immediately change all default usernames and passwords for the RabbitMQ management interface.
        * Enforce strong password policies for all users configured within RabbitMQ.
        * Consider disabling the default "guest" user within RabbitMQ.
        * Implement multi-factor authentication for the RabbitMQ management interface.
        * Restrict access to the management interface to trusted networks or IP addresses (network-level control).

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured HTTP Management Interface](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_http_management_interface.md)

**Description:** Unsecured HTTP Management Interface
    * **How RabbitMQ-Server Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The HTTP management interface provided by RabbitMQ, if not secured with HTTPS (TLS), transmits sensitive information (like credentials and configuration data) in plaintext.
    * **Example:** An attacker eavesdropping on the network traffic can intercept login credentials or API keys used to access the RabbitMQ management interface.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information related to the RabbitMQ server, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always enable HTTPS (TLS) for the RabbitMQ management interface through its configuration.
        * Ensure proper certificate management and avoid self-signed certificates in production environments for the RabbitMQ management interface.
        * Enforce HTTPS-only access through RabbitMQ configuration.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Erlang Distribution Port (Clustering)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_erlang_distribution_port__clustering_.md)

**Description:** Exposure of Erlang Distribution Port (Clustering)
    * **How RabbitMQ-Server Contributes to the Attack Surface:** When RabbitMQ is clustered, nodes communicate using the Erlang distribution protocol on a specific port (default 4369). Exposure of this port to untrusted networks can allow attackers to potentially interact with the RabbitMQ clustering mechanism.
    * **Example:** An attacker on the network can attempt to connect to the Erlang distribution port and, if successful, potentially add a malicious node to the RabbitMQ cluster.
    * **Impact:**  Compromise of the entire RabbitMQ cluster, allowing attackers to manipulate data, disrupt service, or gain access to sensitive information managed by the cluster.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict access to the Erlang distribution port to only the IP addresses of other trusted cluster nodes using firewalls (network-level control).
        * Utilize Erlang cookie-based authentication for inter-node communication within the RabbitMQ cluster and ensure the cookie is strong and kept secret.
        * Consider using network segmentation to isolate the RabbitMQ cluster network.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Enabled Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_enabled_plugins.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Enabled Plugins
    * **How RabbitMQ-Server Contributes to the Attack Surface:** RabbitMQ's plugin architecture allows extending its functionality. However, vulnerabilities in enabled plugins (either official or third-party) directly integrated with RabbitMQ can introduce new attack vectors within the RabbitMQ process.
    * **Example:** A vulnerable third-party authentication plugin could allow attackers to bypass authentication or gain elevated privileges within the RabbitMQ server.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability and the plugin's functionality, but can range from information disclosure to remote code execution within the RabbitMQ server process.
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Only enable necessary plugins within RabbitMQ.
        * Regularly update all enabled plugins to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities within RabbitMQ.
        * Carefully evaluate the security of third-party plugins before enabling them within RabbitMQ.
        * Subscribe to security advisories for RabbitMQ and its plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Protocol Implementation Vulnerabilities (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP)](./attack_surfaces/protocol_implementation_vulnerabilities__amqp__mqtt__stomp_.md)

**Description:** Protocol Implementation Vulnerabilities (AMQP, MQTT, STOMP)
    * **How RabbitMQ-Server Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  RabbitMQ implements various messaging protocols. Vulnerabilities in RabbitMQ's implementation of these protocols can be exploited by malicious clients interacting with the RabbitMQ server.
    * **Example:** A crafted AMQP message could trigger a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue within the RabbitMQ server process.
    * **Impact:**  Can range from denial of service to remote code execution on the RabbitMQ server.
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep RabbitMQ server updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches in its protocol implementations.
        * Implement network-level security measures to filter potentially malicious traffic before it reaches the RabbitMQ server.
        * Consider using TLS for all client connections to add a layer of security around the protocol interaction with RabbitMQ.
