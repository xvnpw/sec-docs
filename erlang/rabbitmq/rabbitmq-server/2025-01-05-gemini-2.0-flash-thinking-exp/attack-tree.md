## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit default credentials (guest/guest) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_credentials__guestguest___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to log in to the RabbitMQ management interface or connect via the AMQP protocol using the default username "guest" and password "guest".
*   **Impact:** Successful login grants full administrative control over the RabbitMQ instance, allowing manipulation of queues, exchanges, bindings, and message flow.
*   **Mitigation:** Immediately change or disable the default "guest" user. Enforce strong password policies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate queues, exchanges, bindings, publish/consume messages [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_queues__exchanges__bindings__publishconsume_messages__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** After gaining unauthorized access (e.g., via default credentials), attackers can perform various malicious actions:
    *   Delete critical queues, disrupting application functionality.
    *   Create rogue queues to intercept or inject messages.
    *   Modify exchange bindings to redirect message flow.
    *   Publish malicious messages to trigger vulnerabilities in consuming applications.
    *   Consume sensitive messages.
*   **Impact:** Service disruption, data loss, data corruption, injection of malicious data, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong authentication and authorization. Regularly audit and monitor queue, exchange, and binding configurations. Implement message signing or encryption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal credentials of administrators, perform actions on their behalf [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/steal_credentials_of_administrators__perform_actions_on_their_behalf__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  Successful Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks on the RabbitMQ management interface allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that can steal administrator session cookies or credentials.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can gain administrative control over RabbitMQ, performing any action a legitimate administrator can.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding in the management interface. Enforce Content Security Policy (CSP). Regularly update RabbitMQ to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain unauthorized network access to RabbitMQ [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_network_access_to_rabbitmq__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** RabbitMQ ports (e.g., 5672 for AMQP, 15672 for the management interface) are left open to the public internet without proper firewall restrictions.
*   **Impact:** Allows attackers to directly interact with the RabbitMQ service, potentially attempting authentication bypass, exploiting vulnerabilities, or launching denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Mitigation:** Implement strict firewall rules to restrict access to RabbitMQ ports to only trusted networks or hosts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Allow unauthorized users to manage resources or access sensitive data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/allow_unauthorized_users_to_manage_resources_or_access_sensitive_data__critical_node__high_risk_path_7974c6fa.md)

*   **Description:**  RabbitMQ user permissions are configured in an overly permissive manner, granting unnecessary privileges to users or roles.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized users can manage queues, exchanges, bindings, publish/consume messages, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or manipulation of message flow.
*   **Mitigation:** Regularly audit and review user permissions. Follow the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept communication between application and RabbitMQ [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_communication_between_application_and_rabbitmq__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Communication between the application and RabbitMQ is not encrypted using TLS, allowing attackers with network access to eavesdrop on the traffic.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted in messages, including potentially credentials or business-critical information.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce TLS for all communication between the application and RabbitMQ.

## Attack Tree Path: [Intercept and modify messages (if TLS is weak or absent) [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/intercept_and_modify_messages__if_tls_is_weak_or_absent___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:**  Without strong TLS encryption, attackers can not only eavesdrop but also intercept and modify messages in transit.
*   **Impact:** Alteration of application logic, data corruption, injection of malicious data, potentially leading to significant business impact.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong TLS encryption. Implement message signing or encryption at the application level for end-to-end integrity.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain unauthorized access to the management interface [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_the_management_interface__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to gain access to the RabbitMQ management interface through brute-force attacks on the login form.
*   **Impact:** Successful access grants administrative control over the RabbitMQ instance.
*   **Mitigation:** Enforce strong password policies. Implement account lockout policies after multiple failed login attempts. Consider multi-factor authentication. Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity. Rate-limit login attempts.
