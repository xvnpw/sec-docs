        *   Track remediation progress and verify effectiveness after implementation.
        *   Maintain a central repository for security audit findings and remediation plans.

#### 4.2. Effectiveness in Mitigating Threats:

*   **Misconfigurations (Medium to High Severity):**
    *   **Impact:** **High Reduction.** Regular configuration reviews, automated scanning, and adherence to secure baselines are highly effective in mitigating misconfigurations. By proactively identifying and correcting deviations from secure configurations, this strategy significantly reduces the attack surface and prevents exploitation of misconfiguration-related vulnerabilities.
    *   **Explanation:**  Misconfigurations often arise from human error, lack of awareness, or configuration drift over time. This strategy directly addresses these issues by establishing clear standards, providing tools for detection, and promoting a culture of secure configuration management.

*   **Undetected Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):**
    *   **Impact:** **High Reduction.** Regular vulnerability scanning and penetration testing are crucial for identifying and addressing undetected vulnerabilities in RabbitMQ and its underlying components. By proactively searching for and remediating vulnerabilities, this strategy significantly reduces the risk of exploitation.
