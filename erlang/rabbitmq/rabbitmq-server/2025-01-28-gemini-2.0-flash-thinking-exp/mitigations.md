# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication - Change Default Credentials](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication_-_change_default_credentials.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  Access the RabbitMQ Management UI (usually at `http://your-rabbitmq-server:15672`) or use the command-line tool `rabbitmqctl`.
        2.  Navigate to the "Users" section in the Management UI or use `rabbitmqctl list_users` to identify the default `guest` user.
        3.  Change the password for the `guest` user to a strong, unique password using the Management UI or `rabbitmqctl change_password guest <new_strong_password>`.
        4.  Alternatively, and preferably in production environments, consider disabling the `guest` user entirely using `rabbitmqctl delete_user guest`.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Attackers exploiting default credentials to gain immediate access to the RabbitMQ server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and malicious message manipulation.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access:** High reduction. Eliminates the most common and easily exploitable vulnerability.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, default `guest` password was changed during the initial RabbitMQ server setup as part of the infrastructure provisioning script. Documented in the infrastructure setup guide.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Disabling the `guest` user entirely in production environments is still pending. This is planned for the next infrastructure update.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strong Authentication - Utilize Strong Passwords](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strong_authentication_-_utilize_strong_passwords.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  Define a strong password policy for all RabbitMQ users. This policy should include requirements for password length, complexity (mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols), and prohibit the use of easily guessable passwords.
        2.  Educate administrators about the importance of strong passwords and encourage the use of password managers.
        3.  During user creation (via Management UI or `rabbitmqctl add_user`), enforce adherence to the strong password policy. While RabbitMQ doesn't inherently enforce complexity, manual checks and user training are crucial.
        4.  Consider periodic password rotation policies for service accounts accessing RabbitMQ.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):** Attackers attempting to guess passwords through automated brute-force attacks. Strong passwords significantly increase the time and resources required for successful brute-force attempts.
        *   **Dictionary Attacks (Medium Severity):** Attackers using lists of common passwords to gain unauthorized access. Strong passwords, especially those with complexity, are less likely to be found in dictionary lists.
        *   **Credential Stuffing (Medium Severity):** Attackers using compromised credentials from other services to attempt login to RabbitMQ. Strong, unique passwords reduce the effectiveness of credential stuffing.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Medium reduction. Makes brute-force attacks significantly more difficult and time-consuming.
        *   **Dictionary Attacks:** Medium reduction. Reduces the likelihood of passwords being easily guessed from common password lists.
        *   **Credential Stuffing:** Medium reduction. If users reuse passwords across services, this mitigation is less effective, highlighting the need for unique passwords.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Strong password guidelines are documented in the security policy document. User training on password security has been conducted.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Automated password complexity enforcement within RabbitMQ user creation process is missing. Password rotation policy for service accounts is not yet implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Fine-Grained Authorization - Define User Permissions](./mitigation_strategies/implement_fine-grained_authorization_-_define_user_permissions.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  For each user or service account that needs to interact with RabbitMQ, define the minimum necessary permissions.
        2.  Utilize RabbitMQ's permission system (using Management UI or `rabbitmqctl set_permissions`) to grant specific access rights to virtual hosts, exchanges, queues, and bindings.
        3.  Apply the principle of least privilege: grant only the permissions required for the user or service to perform its intended function. Avoid granting wildcard permissions (`".*"`) unless absolutely necessary and well-justified.
        4.  Regularly review and audit user permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with current access needs.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium to High Severity):**  Compromised accounts with overly broad permissions could be used to perform actions beyond their intended scope, leading to data breaches, service disruption, or unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Lateral Movement (Medium Severity):** In case of a breach, limiting user permissions restricts the attacker's ability to move laterally within the RabbitMQ system and access sensitive resources.
        *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Low to Medium Severity):** Restricting permissions reduces the risk of accidental misconfigurations or unintended actions by users with excessive privileges.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** High reduction. Significantly limits the potential damage from compromised accounts by restricting their capabilities.
        *   **Lateral Movement:** Medium reduction. Hinders attacker's ability to explore and exploit other parts of the RabbitMQ system after initial compromise.
        *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Low to Medium reduction. Reduces the scope of potential damage from accidental errors.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, fine-grained permissions are configured for all service accounts accessing RabbitMQ. Permissions are defined in infrastructure-as-code and applied during deployment.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  Regular automated audits of user permissions are not yet in place. Manual reviews are conducted periodically but could be improved with automation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enable TLS/SSL for Communication - Encrypt Client-Server Communication](./mitigation_strategies/enable_tlsssl_for_communication_-_encrypt_client-server_communication.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  Generate or obtain TLS/SSL certificates for the RabbitMQ server and clients. Use certificates signed by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) for production environments.
        2.  Configure RabbitMQ to enable TLS/SSL listeners on the appropriate ports (e.g., 5671 for AMQP over TLS, 15671 for Management UI over TLS). Specify the paths to the server certificate, private key, and CA certificate (if applicable) in the RabbitMQ configuration file (`rabbitmq.conf` or `advanced.config`).
        3.  Configure client applications to connect to RabbitMQ using TLS/SSL. This typically involves specifying the `amqps://` protocol in connection URLs and providing client-side certificates if mutual TLS authentication is required.
        4.  Disable or restrict access to non-TLS listeners (e.g., plain AMQP on port 5672) to enforce encrypted communication.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Eavesdropping (High Severity):** Attackers intercepting network traffic to read sensitive message content, credentials, or other confidential information transmitted between clients and the RabbitMQ server.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Attackers intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between clients and the RabbitMQ server, leading to data breaches, message tampering, or unauthorized actions.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Eavesdropping:** High reduction. Encrypts communication, making it extremely difficult for attackers to passively intercept and understand message content.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** High reduction. TLS/SSL provides authentication and encryption, making it significantly harder for attackers to impersonate the server or client and intercept/manipulate communication.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, TLS/SSL is enabled for all client-server communication in production and staging environments. Certificates are managed by our internal certificate management system.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  TLS/SSL is not consistently enforced in development environments.  Enforcement in development needs to be improved to mirror production security posture.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits and Quotas - Memory Alarms](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_and_quotas_-_memory_alarms.md)
