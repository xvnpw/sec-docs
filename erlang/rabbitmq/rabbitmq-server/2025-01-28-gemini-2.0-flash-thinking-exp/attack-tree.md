## Attack Tree Path: [1. Gain Unauthorized Access to RabbitMQ Broker (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/1__gain_unauthorized_access_to_rabbitmq_broker__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms to gain control over the RabbitMQ broker. This is a critical path as broker access allows for message manipulation, data access, and DoS attacks.
*   **Potential Impact:** Full control over RabbitMQ broker, leading to data breaches, message manipulation, application disruption, and potential system compromise.
*   **Mitigation Focus:** Strong authentication, robust authorization, secure network configuration, and regular security updates.

    *   **1.1. Default Credentials Exploitation (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Using well-known default usernames and passwords for the RabbitMQ management UI and AMQP users.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Immediate and complete access to the RabbitMQ broker.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Immediately change default credentials upon deployment.
            *   Regularly audit and enforce strong password policies.

    *   **1.2. Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing Attacks (High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Attempting to guess passwords through repeated login attempts or using lists of compromised credentials from other breaches.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Successful password cracking leading to unauthorized broker access.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement strong password policies (complexity, length, rotation).
            *   Enable account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed login attempts.
            *   Consider rate limiting login attempts to slow down brute-force attacks.

    *   **1.3. Weak Password Policies (Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Lack of strong password complexity requirements or regular password rotation, making passwords easier to guess or crack.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Increased susceptibility to brute-force and dictionary attacks, leading to unauthorized broker access.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Enforce strong password complexity requirements (minimum length, character types).
            *   Implement regular password rotation policies.
            *   Use password strength meters during password creation.

        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Restrict access to the management UI to trusted networks only (e.g., internal network, VPN).
            *   Implement strong authentication for the management UI.
            *   Consider disabling the management UI if it's not essential for operations.

    *   **2.2. Exposed AMQP Ports without Proper Firewalling (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Exposing the AMQP ports (5672, 5671) to the public internet or untrusted networks without firewall rules to restrict access.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Direct access to the AMQP broker service, allowing attackers to connect, publish, and consume messages without proper authorization.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement firewall rules to restrict access to AMQP ports only from trusted clients and networks.
            *   Use network segmentation to isolate the RabbitMQ broker within a secure network zone.
