### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving RabbitMQ Server

Here's an updated list of high and critical security threats that directly involve the RabbitMQ server:

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access via Default Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker uses the default `guest` credentials (or other default credentials if not changed) to log into the RabbitMQ management interface or connect to the broker via AMQP. This allows them to view queues, exchanges, bindings, publish messages, consume messages, and potentially reconfigure the broker.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the RabbitMQ instance, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and the ability to manipulate message flow.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rabbit_auth_backend_internal` (authentication module), `web_stomp`, `web_mqtt`, `amqp_connection`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately change default credentials for all users upon deployment.
        *   Disable the `guest` user in production environments.
        *   Enforce strong password policies for all RabbitMQ users.

*   **Threat:** Brute-Force Attack on User Credentials
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess user credentials by repeatedly trying different usernames and passwords against the RabbitMQ management interface or AMQP ports.
    *   **Impact:** Successful compromise of user accounts, potentially leading to unauthorized access and actions as described in the previous threat.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rabbit_auth_backend_internal`, `web_stomp`, `web_mqtt`, `amqp_connection`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce account lockout policies after a certain number of failed login attempts.
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts.
        *   Consider using multi-factor authentication for management interface access.
        *   Monitor login attempts for suspicious activity.

*   **Threat:** Message Eavesdropping via Unencrypted Connections
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the application and RabbitMQ when TLS encryption is not enabled. This allows them to read the contents of messages, potentially exposing sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive information contained within messages.
    *   **Affected Component:** `amqp_connection`, `web_stomp`, `web_mqtt` (if not configured for secure connections).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for all client connections by configuring the `listeners.ssl.*` settings in `rabbitmq.conf`.
        *   Ensure that clients are configured to connect using TLS.
        *   Disable non-TLS listeners if not required.

*   **Threat:** Message Tampering via Unprotected Channels
    *   **Description:**  Similar to eavesdropping, if connections are not encrypted, an attacker could intercept messages and modify their content before they reach the intended recipient.
    *   **Impact:** Integrity breach, leading to incorrect data processing, potentially causing application errors or malicious actions based on the altered messages.
    *   **Affected Component:** `amqp_connection`, `web_stomp`, `web_mqtt` (if not configured for secure connections).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce TLS encryption for all client connections.
        *   Consider application-level message signing or encryption for end-to-end integrity verification.

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Exchange or Queue Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker with sufficient permissions (or through exploiting a vulnerability) could delete, create, or reconfigure exchanges and queues, disrupting message flow and potentially causing data loss or service unavailability.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, data loss, inability for applications to communicate via the message broker.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rabbit_exchange`, `rabbit_queue`, `rabbit_binding`, `rabbit_access_control`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when assigning user permissions.
        *   Regularly review and audit user permissions.
        *   Disable or restrict access to management features for unauthorized users.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Message Flooding
    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a large volume of messages to queues, overwhelming the RabbitMQ server and potentially causing it to become unresponsive or crash.
    *   **Impact:** Service disruption, inability for applications to send or receive messages.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rabbit_amqp_publisher`, `rabbit_channel`, `rabbit_queue`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on message publishing at the application level or using RabbitMQ plugins.
        *   Configure queue limits (e.g., message count, queue length).
        *   Implement monitoring and alerting for queue depth and server resource utilization.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in RabbitMQ Management Interface
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the RabbitMQ management interface (accessible via HTTP) to gain unauthorized access or execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the RabbitMQ server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and control over the underlying system.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rabbit_web_dispatch`, `web_stomp`, `web_mqtt`, underlying web server components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the RabbitMQ server software up-to-date with the latest security patches.
        *   Restrict access to the management interface to trusted networks only.
        *   Use a firewall or VPN to protect access to the management interface.
        *   Consider disabling the management interface if it is not required.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Erlang/OTP
    *   **Description:** RabbitMQ is built on Erlang/OTP. Vulnerabilities in the underlying Erlang/OTP platform could be exploited to compromise the RabbitMQ server.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the RabbitMQ server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, and control over the underlying system.
    *   **Affected Component:** Underlying Erlang Virtual Machine (BEAM), various Erlang libraries used by RabbitMQ.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Erlang/OTP updated to the latest stable version with security patches.
        *   Monitor Erlang security advisories.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Plugin Usage
    *   **Description:** Using untrusted or vulnerable RabbitMQ plugins can introduce security risks. Malicious plugins could perform unauthorized actions or compromise the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the plugin's functionality, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or server compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rabbit_plugin_manager`, various plugin modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Carefully review the code and functionality of any third-party plugins before installation.
        *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Implement strong access controls for plugin management.
