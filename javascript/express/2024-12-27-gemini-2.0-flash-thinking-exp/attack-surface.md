| Description | How Express Contributes to Attack Surface | Example | Impact | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Route Parameter Pollution/Manipulation** | Express allows defining routes with parameters (e.g., `/users/:id`). Attackers can manipulate these parameters in unexpected ways. | An attacker modifies the URL `/articles/123` to `/articles/../sensitive-data` attempting path traversal, or sends multiple parameters with the same name to confuse the application logic. | Potential for unauthorized access to resources, bypassing security checks, information disclosure, or application errors. | High | **Developers:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all route parameters. Use parameterized queries for database interactions. Avoid relying solely on route parameters for authorization. Use specific route definitions instead of overly broad patterns. |
| **Middleware Vulnerabilities** | Express's middleware architecture relies on third-party packages. Vulnerabilities in these packages can directly impact the application. | A vulnerable version of a body-parser middleware allows an attacker to send a specially crafted payload that causes a denial-of-service or even remote code execution. | Denial of service, remote code execution, data breaches, or other security compromises depending on the vulnerability. | Critical | **Developers:** Regularly audit and update all middleware dependencies. Use security scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities. Be cautious when choosing and integrating third-party middleware. Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA). |
| **Denial-of-Service through Large Payloads (Body Parser)** | Express uses body-parser middleware to handle request bodies. Default configurations might be vulnerable to DoS by processing excessively large payloads. | An attacker sends a very large JSON or XML payload to an endpoint, consuming excessive server resources (CPU, memory) and potentially crashing the application. | Application downtime, resource exhaustion, impacting availability for legitimate users. | High | **Developers:** Configure body-parser middleware with appropriate size limits (`limit` option). Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive requests from a single source. Consider using streaming for large file uploads. |
| **Static File Path Traversal** | Express's `express.static()` middleware serves static files. Incorrect configuration can allow attackers to access files outside the intended directory. | An attacker requests `/static/../../../../etc/passwd` attempting to access sensitive system files. | Information disclosure, potential access to sensitive configuration files or application code. | High | **Developers:** Use `express.static()` with caution and ensure the root directory is correctly configured and restricted. Avoid serving sensitive files through static routes. Consider using a dedicated CDN for static assets. |
| **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)** | If using a templating engine (like Pug, EJS, Handlebars) with Express, vulnerabilities in the engine or improper use can lead to SSTI. | User input is directly embedded into a template without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code that gets executed on the server. For example, `res.render('user', { name: req.query.name })` where `req.query.name` is not sanitized. | Remote code execution, information disclosure, or other server-side vulnerabilities. | Critical | **Developers:** Always escape user-provided data before rendering it in templates. Use templating engines with auto-escaping enabled by default. Keep templating engine dependencies updated. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP). |
| **Middleware Ordering Issues** | The order in which middleware is defined in Express is crucial. Incorrect ordering can lead to security bypasses. | An authentication middleware is placed *after* a middleware that handles sensitive data, allowing unauthenticated access to the data. | Security bypasses, unauthorized access to protected resources. | High | **Developers:** Carefully plan and document the middleware pipeline. Ensure authentication and authorization middleware are placed early in the chain. Regularly review and test the middleware order. |
| **Exposure of Sensitive Configuration via Environment Variables or Files** | Improper handling of environment variables or configuration files can expose sensitive information used by the Express application. | Database credentials or API keys are stored directly in a configuration file that is accessible through a misconfigured static route or a vulnerability. | Information disclosure, potential compromise of connected services or data. | Critical | **Developers:** Use environment variables for sensitive configuration. Avoid hardcoding secrets in code or configuration files. Implement secure storage and retrieval mechanisms for sensitive data (e.g., using a secrets manager). Ensure configuration files are not accessible through static routes. |
