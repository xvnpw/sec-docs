### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Environment Variable Injection via `$processEnv` System Variable

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a `.http` or `.rest` file intended to be used with the REST Client extension.
    2. Within this file, the attacker includes a request that utilizes the system variable `{{$processEnv envVarName}}`.
    3. The `envVarName` is chosen by the attacker to correspond to an environment variable that is expected to be processed by the target server-side application when the request is sent.
    4. When the user of the REST Client extension sends this request, the extension substitutes `{{$processEnv envVarName}}` with the value of the specified system environment variable from the user's machine.
    5. This value, now part of the HTTP request (in headers, URL, or body), is sent to the target server.
    6. If the target server-side application is vulnerable to environment variable injection and processes the injected value without proper sanitization, the attacker can influence the application's behavior.
    7. This can lead to various impacts depending on how the server application uses environment variables.

- **Impact:**
    The impact of this vulnerability is highly dependent on how the target server-side application processes environment variables. Potential impacts include:
    - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker might be able to extract sensitive information if environment variables are used to store secrets or configuration details that are unintentionally exposed through the application's responses or logs.
    - **Application Logic Manipulation:** If environment variables control critical application logic, an attacker could manipulate the application's behavior, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data modification, or bypass of security controls.
    - **Indirect Command Injection (in specific server-side scenarios):** In highly specific and unlikely scenarios, if the server-side application *itself* then uses these environment variables in a way that leads to command execution (which is bad server-side practice, but theoretically possible in some badly designed applications), then this could indirectly contribute to command injection, though the REST Client extension is not directly causing command injection.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None implemented within the REST Client extension itself to prevent this behavior. The extension functions as designed by allowing users to inject environment variables into requests using `$processEnv`.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No mitigations are inherently *missing* from the REST Client extension's perspective. The extension is providing a feature as documented.
    - The "missing mitigation" is on the side of the *user* of the extension and the *developer of the target API*. Users should be aware of the implications of injecting environment variables, and API developers should not rely on or unsafely process environment variables derived directly from client requests.
    - From a purely theoretical "mitigation in the project" perspective, the extension *could* warn users about the potential security implications of using `$processEnv`, but this is more of a documentation/best-practice concern rather than a technical mitigation within the extension's code.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker needs to identify a target server-side application that is vulnerable to environment variable injection.
    2. The attacker needs to know the name of an environment variable that is processed by the vulnerable server-side application.
    3. The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a `.http` or `.rest` file that will be used with the REST Client extension.
    4. A user of the REST Client extension must execute the crafted request against the vulnerable server.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Based on the documentation in `/code/README.md` under the "System Variables" and "Variables" sections, the extension clearly states that `{{$processEnv [%]envVarName}}` resolves to the value of a local machine environment variable.
    - The documentation describes how to use this feature and provides examples.
    - There is no indication in the provided documentation or code (only README and CHANGELOG are provided, not the actual source code) that the extension performs any sanitization or validation of the environment variable values before embedding them into the HTTP request.
    - The extension's purpose is to facilitate HTTP request construction and sending, and the variable substitution feature is designed to be flexible, including accessing system environment variables.
    - **Visualization:** (Conceptual, based on documentation)
        ```
        .http/.rest File (Attacker Controlled):
        -----------------------
        GET https://example.com/api/data
        X-Custom-Header: {{$processEnv MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR}}
        -----------------------
            |
            | (REST Client Extension - Variable Substitution)
            V
        HTTP Request Sent:
        -----------------------
        GET https://example.com/api/data
        X-Custom-Header: <value of MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR from user's machine>
        -----------------------
            |
            | (Network)
            V
        Target Server Application:
        -----------------------
        ... processes X-Custom-Header ... (potentially vulnerable)
        -----------------------
        ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Set up a vulnerable test server (example in Python using Flask):**
        ```python
        from flask import Flask, request
        import os

        app = Flask(__name__)

        @app.route('/env')
        def env_endpoint():
            injected_value = request.headers.get('X-Injected-Env')
            if injected_value:
                # Simulate vulnerable processing of environment variable (BAD PRACTICE!)
                command_to_run = f"echo 'Injected Value: {injected_value}'"
                os.system(command_to_run) # VERY VULNERABLE - DO NOT DO THIS IN REAL APPS
                return f"Processed injected value: {injected_value}", 200
            else:
                return "No X-Injected-Env header provided", 400

        if __name__ == '__main__':
            app.run(debug=True, port=5000)
        ```
        **(Note:** This Python example is intentionally vulnerable for demonstration purposes and uses `os.system` unsafely. **Do not use this in production code.**)

    2. **Set an environment variable on your local machine (e.g., `MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR`) with a harmless value for initial testing (e.g., `test_value`).**

    3. **Create a `.http` file with the following content:**
        ```http
        GET http://localhost:5000/env
        X-Injected-Env: {{$processEnv MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR}}
        ```

    4. **Send the request using the REST Client extension.**

    5. **Observe the server's output.** You should see "Processed injected value: test_value" and the echo command output on the server console, confirming the environment variable value was injected.

    6. **Now, change the environment variable `MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR` to a potentially more harmful value (e.g., `$(whoami)` or `$(hostname)` - depending on the OS and server-side context).**

    7. **Resend the request.**

    8. **Observe the server's output *and the machine where the server is running*.** If the server is truly vulnerable (as in the example code - again, do NOT create servers like this), you might see the output of the `whoami` or `hostname` command executed on the *server's machine* in the server's console or logs (in a real-world scenario, the impact could be much worse).

    9. **Expected Result:** The test case should demonstrate that the value of the local environment variable `MALICIOUS_ENV_VAR` is successfully injected into the HTTP request via the REST Client extension and processed by the (intentionally vulnerable) test server. This proves the `$processEnv` variable substitution works as documented and can be used to inject environment variables into requests. The server-side behavior then determines the actual vulnerability impact, which in a badly designed server could be significant.

This vulnerability highlights that while the REST Client extension itself is not directly vulnerable, it provides a feature (`$processEnv`) that, when combined with a vulnerable server-side application, can be exploited for environment variable injection. The responsibility for mitigation primarily lies with developers of server-side applications to avoid insecure processing of environment variables, especially those derived from client requests.
