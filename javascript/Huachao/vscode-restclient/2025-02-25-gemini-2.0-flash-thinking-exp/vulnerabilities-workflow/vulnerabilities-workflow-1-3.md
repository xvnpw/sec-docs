### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Uncontrolled Variable Substitution leading to Potential Information Disclosure via Error Messages
- Description:
    1. A user opens a specially crafted `.http` file that utilizes prompt variables with complex nested variable references or references to undefined variables within the prompt description or default value.
    2. When the REST Client extension attempts to resolve these prompt variables, if an error occurs during the substitution process (e.g., due to circular dependencies, undefined variables in nested contexts, or issues in parsing complex variable expressions), the error message displayed to the user might inadvertently reveal internal details about the variable resolution process or the file system structure where the `.http` file is located.
    3. This information leakage could occur if error messages are not properly sanitized and include debug information or file paths that are not intended to be exposed.
- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker who can convince a user to open a malicious `.http` file could potentially gain insights into the user's local file system structure, internal variable names used within the REST Client extension, or potentially sensitive configuration details revealed in verbose error messages. This information could be used to further target the user or their system.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Based on the provided files, there are no specific mitigations implemented in the documentation to prevent information disclosure via error messages during variable substitution. Error handling mechanisms are likely in place, but it's unclear if they are designed to prevent information leakage in error messages.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for prompt variable descriptions and default values to prevent injection of malicious variable expressions.
    - Secure error handling for variable resolution: Error messages should be generic and user-friendly, avoiding the exposure of internal paths, variable names, or debug information. Detailed error logging should be restricted to development/debug builds and not exposed to end-users.
    - Implement rate limiting or input complexity limits for variable substitution to prevent excessive resource consumption during resolution, which could indirectly be exploited to trigger verbose error messages.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the REST Client extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
    - The attacker needs to be able to provide or convince the user to open a specially crafted `.http` file.
    - The `.http` file must contain prompt variables with complex or intentionally erroneous variable references designed to trigger errors during variable substitution.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Variable Resolution Logic**: The vulnerability lies within the variable resolution engine of the REST Client extension. Specifically, the code that handles prompt variables and their interaction with other variable types (environment, file, request, system variables) is the area of concern.
    2. **Error Handling**: Examine the error handling routines within the variable resolution process. If errors during variable substitution (e.g., `resolveVariable`, `substituteVariables` functions) are caught and displayed to the user, analyze the content of these error messages.
    3. **Path Exposure**: Check if error messages include file paths related to the `.http` file being processed or internal extension paths.
    4. **Variable Name Disclosure**: Determine if error messages reveal the names of variables that failed to resolve or internal variable structures.
    5. **Nested Variable Handling**: Analyze how nested variable references within prompt variable descriptions or default values are processed. Look for potential issues in recursive variable resolution or handling of undefined variables in nested contexts.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new file named `poc.http`.
    2. Add the following content to `poc.http`:

    ```http
    // @prompt maliciousVar {{undefinedVar}}
    GET https://example.com/api/test
    ```

    3. Open `poc.http` in Visual Studio Code with the REST Client extension installed.
    4. Send the request by clicking "Send Request" or using the shortcut.
    5. Observe the error message displayed by the REST Client extension.
    6. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable Scenario):** The error message might contain information about the variable resolution process, potentially mentioning "undefinedVar" or internal paths related to variable resolution, revealing more information than necessary for a user-friendly error.
    7. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated Scenario):** The error message should be generic, indicating that there was an issue resolving a variable, but without revealing specific variable names, internal paths, or excessive debug information. The error should be user-friendly and not expose sensitive details.

    8. Create a new file named `poc2.http`.
    9. Add the following content to `poc2.http`:

    ```http
    @filePath = ./non_existent_file.txt
    // @prompt fileContent {{< $filePath}}
    GET https://example.com/api/test
    ```

    10. Ensure that `non_existent_file.txt` does not exist in the same directory as `poc2.http`.
    11. Open `poc2.http` in Visual Studio Code and send the request.
    12. Observe the error message.
    13. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable Scenario):** The error message might reveal the absolute path where the extension tried to find `non_existent_file.txt`, disclosing directory structure information.
    14. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated Scenario):** The error message should be generic, indicating that the file could not be found, but without revealing the full path or internal implementation details.
