# Threat Model Analysis for dcloudio/uni-app

## Threat: [Platform API Inconsistency Exploitation](./threats/platform_api_inconsistency_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies discrepancies in how uni-app's unified API interacts with underlying platform-specific APIs (e.g., iOS, Android, WeChat Mini Program). They craft exploits that leverage these inconsistencies to bypass security measures or achieve unintended functionality on a specific platform. For example, a permission check might be implemented differently on Android vs. iOS within uni-app's abstraction, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access on one platform.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to device features due to uni-app's flawed abstraction, data breaches specific to certain platforms because uni-app doesn't properly normalize security behavior, bypassing security controls on specific platforms due to uni-app's incomplete or incorrect API mapping, inconsistent application behavior leading to unexpected vulnerabilities introduced by uni-app's cross-platform nature.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugin Usage](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugin_usage.md)

**Description:** A developer integrates a third-party uni-app plugin that contains malicious code or exploitable vulnerabilities. The attacker leverages these vulnerabilities through the uni-app plugin system to compromise the application or the user's device. This could involve stealing user data, injecting malicious code that interacts with uni-app's core functionalities, or gaining control over device functionalities exposed through uni-app's plugin interface.

**Impact:** Data breaches facilitated by vulnerable plugins integrated through uni-app, unauthorized access to device resources (camera, microphone, contacts, etc.) via plugin vulnerabilities within the uni-app ecosystem, application crashes caused by faulty plugins interacting with uni-app's runtime, code injection through plugin vulnerabilities that exploit uni-app's plugin loading mechanism, potential for supply chain attacks affecting multiple applications using the same vulnerable plugin within the uni-app ecosystem.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication Between JavaScript and Native Modules](./threats/insecure_communication_between_javascript_and_native_modules.md)

**Description:** uni-app allows communication between JavaScript code and native modules (either custom or within plugins). If this communication channel, facilitated by uni-app's bridging mechanisms, is not properly secured, an attacker might be able to inject malicious payloads or intercept sensitive data being passed between these layers. This could happen if data is not sanitized or validated by uni-app's bridge before being passed to the native side.

**Impact:** Code injection into native context through uni-app's insecure bridge, privilege escalation by exploiting vulnerabilities in uni-app's native module interaction, unauthorized access to native device features via manipulated communication through uni-app's APIs, data interception during the transfer between JavaScript and native code managed by uni-app.

## Threat: [Mini-Program Sandboxing Bypass](./threats/mini-program_sandboxing_bypass.md)

**Description:** Attackers discover vulnerabilities in uni-app's implementation for specific mini-program platforms (e.g., WeChat, Alipay) that allow them to bypass the intended sandboxing restrictions imposed by the mini-program environment. This bypass is facilitated by flaws within uni-app's adaptation layer for these platforms, granting them access to APIs or functionalities that should be restricted, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions within the mini-program context.

**Impact:** Access to sensitive user data within the mini-program environment due to uni-app's inadequate sandboxing enforcement, ability to perform actions on behalf of the user by exploiting uni-app's compromised mini-program integration, potential for cross-mini-program attacks (depending on platform vulnerabilities amplified by uni-app's implementation).
