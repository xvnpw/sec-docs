# Attack Surface Analysis for dcloudio/uni-app

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Native API Access](./attack_surfaces/insecure_native_api_access.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities arising from the interaction between JavaScript code and native device functionalities through uni-app's bridging mechanism.

**How uni-app Contributes:** uni-app provides APIs to access native device features (camera, geolocation, storage, etc.). Improperly secured access or vulnerabilities in *these uni-app provided APIs* can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in the `uni.getLocation` API to continuously track a user's location without explicit consent or bypass permission checks due to a flaw in uni-app's permission handling for that API.

**Impact:** Privacy breaches, unauthorized access to device resources, potential for device compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement the principle of least privilege when requesting native permissions. Only request necessary permissions.
* Sanitize and validate data passed to and received from native APIs.
* Regularly review and audit the usage of native APIs in the codebase.
* Stay updated with uni-app's security advisories regarding native API vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable or Malicious uni-app Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_or_malicious_uni-app_plugins.md)

**Description:** Security risks introduced by using third-party plugins within the uni-app ecosystem.

**How uni-app Contributes:** uni-app's plugin architecture allows developers to extend functionality. However, vulnerabilities *within these uni-app compatible plugins* or intentionally malicious plugins can be exploited.

**Example:** A vulnerable plugin, designed to work with uni-app's plugin system, could allow an attacker to inject arbitrary code into the application or steal sensitive data. A malicious plugin, specifically targeting uni-app, could be designed to exfiltrate user data.

**Impact:** Data breaches, code execution, application compromise, supply chain attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully vet and audit all third-party plugins before using them.
* Only use plugins from trusted sources with active maintenance and good community reputation.
* Keep plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Consider using dependency scanning tools that can identify known vulnerabilities in plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Framework-Specific Client-Side Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/framework-specific_client-side_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities inherent in the uni-app framework's client-side implementation.

**How uni-app Contributes:** Bugs or design flaws within *uni-app's core JavaScript runtime*, component lifecycle, or data handling mechanisms can be exploited.

**Example:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability within a *uni-app component* could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application's webview.

**Impact:** Data theft, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Stay updated with the latest uni-app releases and security patches.
* Follow secure coding practices when developing uni-app components.
* Be cautious when using dynamic content or user-provided input within the application.
* Implement appropriate input validation and output encoding.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Storage Usage (uni.*Storage APIs)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_storage_usage__uni_storage_apis_.md)

**Description:** Improperly storing sensitive data using uni-app's local storage APIs, making it accessible to attackers.

**How uni-app Contributes:** uni-app provides `uni.setStorage`, `uni.getStorage`, etc., for client-side data persistence. If *these specific uni-app APIs* are used without proper security considerations, it can expose data.

**Example:** Storing user credentials or API keys directly in local storage using `uni.setStorage` without encryption.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to user accounts or sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing highly sensitive data in local storage if possible.
* Encrypt sensitive data before storing it using uni-app's storage APIs.
* Consider using more secure storage mechanisms if the data sensitivity warrants it.
* Be mindful of the storage scope and potential for other applications to access the data (platform-dependent).
