# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, uni-app, aims to provide a unified development framework for building applications across multiple platforms including iOS, Android, Web, and various mini-program environments using Vue.js.

*   Business Priorities and Goals:
    *   Cross-platform compatibility: Enable developers to write code once and deploy to multiple platforms, reducing development time and cost.
    *   Developer productivity: Offer a familiar and efficient development experience based on Vue.js.
    *   Performance: Ensure applications built with uni-app perform well on target platforms.
    *   Community growth: Foster a strong developer community around uni-app to drive adoption and contribution.
    *   Ease of use: Provide a simple and intuitive framework for developers of varying skill levels.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Security vulnerabilities in the uni-app framework could impact all applications built using it, leading to widespread security incidents.
    *   Lack of timely security updates and patches could leave applications vulnerable to known exploits.
    *   Dependence on third-party libraries and components introduces supply chain risks.
    *   Poorly designed or implemented security features in uni-app could lead to insecure applications.
    *   Reputational damage if applications built with uni-app are frequently compromised.

# SECURITY POSTURE

    *   security control: Documentation available online, potentially including some security considerations. Implemented in: `https://uniapp.dcloud.net.cn/` (Documentation website)

*   Accepted Risks:
    *   accepted risk: Open-source nature implies vulnerabilities might be publicly disclosed before a patch is available.
    *   accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security improvements and vulnerability identification.
    *   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.

*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early in the development process.
    *   security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy and process to handle security reports effectively.
    *   security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.
    *   security control: Implement a Security Champions program to promote security awareness and best practices within the development team.
    *   security control: Enhance input validation and output encoding mechanisms within the framework to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
    *   security control: Provide secure coding guidelines and security training for developers using uni-app.

*   Security Requirements:
    *   Authentication:
        *   Requirement: If uni-app framework includes any backend or administrative functionalities, it must implement secure authentication mechanisms to verify user identity.
        *   Requirement: Applications built with uni-app should provide guidance and best practices for implementing secure authentication based on the specific needs of the application.
    *   Authorization:
        *   Requirement: If uni-app framework includes any backend or administrative functionalities, it must implement robust authorization mechanisms to control access to resources and functionalities based on user roles and permissions.
        *   Requirement: Applications built with uni-app should provide guidance and best practices for implementing secure authorization to manage user access within the application.
    *   Input Validation:
        *   Requirement: The uni-app framework must provide mechanisms and guidance to developers for validating user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
        *   Requirement: Input validation should be applied on both client-side and server-side (if applicable) to ensure comprehensive protection.
    *   Cryptography:
        *   Requirement: If uni-app framework handles sensitive data, it must provide secure cryptographic functionalities for data encryption in transit and at rest.
        *   Requirement: Applications built with uni-app should provide guidance and best practices for using cryptography to protect sensitive user data.
