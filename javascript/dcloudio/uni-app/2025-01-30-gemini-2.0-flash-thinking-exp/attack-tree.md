## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Uni-App Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_uni-app_application__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the ultimate goal. All subsequent paths are attack vectors leading to this compromise. Successful compromise means achieving unauthorized access, data manipulation, or malicious code execution within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Uni-App Framework Specific Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_uni-app_framework_specific_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targeting weaknesses inherent in the uni-app framework itself, rather than application-specific code.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the JavaScript bridge, framework APIs, or platform-specific issues introduced during compilation.
    *   This path is high-risk because framework vulnerabilities can affect many applications built with uni-app.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] JavaScript Bridge Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__javascript_bridge_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**

    *   **Identify Insecure Bridge API Usage:** Discovering bridge APIs that expose sensitive native functionalities or lack proper security controls.
    *   **Inject Malicious JavaScript Code:** Injecting malicious JavaScript (e.g., via XSS or logic flaws) to interact with the bridge and execute malicious actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious JavaScript Code [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_javascript_code__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
