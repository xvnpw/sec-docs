# Threat Model Analysis for dcloudio/uni-app

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Injection during Build](./threats/malicious_dependency_injection_during_build.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency used in the `package.json` or its transitive dependencies. During the build process (`npm install` or `yarn install`), the malicious dependency is downloaded and integrated into the application. This allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the final application bundle.

**Impact:**  Compromised application code, leading to backdoors, data breaches, or malicious functionality being deployed to end-users.

**Affected Uni-app Component:** Build process, dependency management (`package.json`, `node_modules`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
    *   Regularly audit and update dependencies to their latest secure versions.
    *   Employ lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions across builds.
    *   Verify dependency integrity using checksums or signatures when available.
    *   Integrate Software Composition Analysis (SCA) into the CI/CD pipeline.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Uni-app Framework APIs (e.g., `uni.request`, `uni.navigateTo`)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_uni-app_framework_apis__e_g____uni_request____uni_navigateto__.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within a built-in uni-app API. For instance, a flaw in `uni.request` could be leveraged for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) or if input validation is insufficient in `uni.navigateTo`, it could lead to open redirects or client-side injection vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  Server-Side Request Forgery, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if API responses are mishandled, sensitive data leakage, or denial of service.

**Affected Uni-app Component:** Uni-app Framework APIs (e.g., `uni.request`, `uni.navigateTo`, `uni.getStorage`, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Maintain the uni-app framework at the latest stable version to benefit from security patches and updates.
    *   Actively monitor uni-app security advisories and release notes for reported vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding when using uni-app APIs, even if the API is assumed to be secure by design.
    *   Promptly report any suspected vulnerabilities in uni-app APIs to the framework maintainers.

## Threat: [JS Bridge Exploitation for Native Code Execution](./threats/js_bridge_exploitation_for_native_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker targets vulnerabilities in the uni-app JS Bridge, the communication channel between JavaScript code and the native platform runtime. By manipulating messages exchanged through the bridge or exploiting weaknesses in its implementation, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary native code on the user's device.

**Impact:**  Native code execution, privilege escalation on the device, complete device compromise, data breaches, and full control over the application and potentially the operating system.

**Affected Uni-app Component:** JS Bridge, platform integration layer, native runtime environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the uni-app framework and the associated runtime environment are consistently updated to the latest versions.
    *   Minimize the exposure of sensitive native functionalities accessible through the JS Bridge.
    *   Implement stringent input validation and sanitization for all data transmitted across the JS Bridge.
    *   Adhere to platform-specific security best practices when integrating with native code and functionalities.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerabilities Leading to Remote Code Execution or XSS](./threats/plugin_vulnerabilities_leading_to_remote_code_execution_or_xss.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within a uni-app plugin. If a plugin contains vulnerabilities such as remote code execution (RCE) flaws or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, an attacker could leverage these to execute arbitrary code within the application's context or inject malicious scripts that compromise user data or sessions.

**Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the application, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), data theft, session hijacking, and potentially broader system compromise depending on plugin permissions.

**Affected Uni-app Component:** Uni-app Plugin system, specific vulnerable plugins.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Exercise extreme caution when selecting and integrating uni-app plugins. Prioritize plugins from trusted, reputable, and actively maintained sources.
    *   Regularly update all plugins to their latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Conduct security audits of plugin code, especially for plugins handling sensitive data or core application functionalities, if feasible.
    *   Minimize the number of plugins used in the application and only include those that are absolutely necessary.
