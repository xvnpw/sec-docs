# Attack Surface Analysis for dcloudio/uni-app

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `uni.request`](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via__uni_request_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting the `uni.request` API to make requests to unintended resources. This occurs when user-controlled input is used to construct URLs for network requests without proper validation within the uni-app application.

*   **uni-app Contribution:** `uni.request` is the core API provided by uni-app for handling network communication across all platforms. Its flexibility, if misused, directly enables SSRF if URL construction is vulnerable.

*   **Example:** A uni-app application feature allows users to preview external website content by fetching it using `uni.request`. If the URL parameter is directly passed to `uni.request` without validation, an attacker could manipulate the URL to target internal services like `http://localhost:8080/admin` or attempt to access local files using `file:///etc/passwd`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to internal network resources and sensitive data.
    *   Circumvention of firewalls and network security measures.
    *   Potential for further exploitation of internal systems.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict URL Validation:** Implement robust server-side and client-side validation of all user-provided URLs before using them in `uni.request`. Use allowlists of acceptable domains and protocols.
        *   **Secure URL Construction:** Avoid string concatenation for building URLs. Utilize URL parsing and construction libraries to ensure proper encoding and prevent manipulation.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate backend services and restrict network access to only necessary external resources, limiting the impact of potential SSRF exploits.
        *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct security-focused code reviews to identify and remediate potential SSRF vulnerabilities in `uni.request` usage.
    *   **Users:** Users cannot directly mitigate SSRF vulnerabilities. This is a developer-side issue.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Storage of Sensitive Data via `uni.setStorage` and `uni.getStorage`](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_storage_of_sensitive_data_via__uni_setstorage__and__uni_getstorage_.md)

*   **Description:**  Storing sensitive data, such as authentication tokens or personal information, in local storage using uni-app's `uni.setStorage` API without encryption. This makes the data accessible to malicious scripts or applications, especially in H5 environments and on compromised devices.

*   **uni-app Contribution:** uni-app provides `uni.setStorage` and `uni.getStorage` as the primary APIs for local data persistence across platforms.  Developers might rely on these APIs for convenience without fully considering the inherent security risks of storing sensitive data in client-side storage, particularly in the context of web-based (H5) deployments.

*   **Example:** A uni-app application stores user session tokens directly in local storage using `uni.setStorage('sessionToken', userToken)`. If the application is deployed as an H5 web app, a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack or a malicious browser extension could potentially steal this session token, leading to account takeover.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive user credentials and personal data.
    *   Account compromise and unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   Privacy breaches and potential identity theft.

*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Avoid Local Storage for Sensitive Data:**  Refrain from storing highly sensitive information in local storage. Explore secure alternatives like platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (Keychain, Keystore) or backend session management.
        *   **Encryption for Local Storage (If Necessary):** If sensitive data *must* be stored locally, encrypt it using robust encryption algorithms before storing it with `uni.setStorage`. Decrypt only when needed using `uni.getStorage`.
        *   **Minimize Token Lifespan:** Implement short-lived access tokens and refresh token mechanisms to limit the window of opportunity if a token is compromised.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Review code to identify instances of sensitive data storage in local storage and implement secure alternatives.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Strong Device Security:** Use strong device passcodes or biometric authentication to protect against unauthorized physical access to the device and its local storage.
        *   **Be Cautious with Browser Extensions (H5):**  Avoid installing untrusted browser extensions when using uni-app applications in H5 browsers, as they could potentially access local storage.
        *   **Keep Software Updated:** Maintain up-to-date operating systems and browsers to benefit from the latest security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/template_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting template rendering engines within uni-app (Vue.js templates) by injecting malicious code through user-controlled data. This occurs when user input is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization, particularly when using features like `v-html`.

*   **uni-app Contribution:** uni-app leverages Vue.js templates for UI rendering.  The framework's flexibility in template syntax, including features like `v-html`, can be misused by developers, leading to template injection vulnerabilities if user input is not handled securely within these templates.

*   **Example:** A uni-app application displays user-generated content in a news feed. If the application uses `v-html` to render user posts and doesn't sanitize the HTML content, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within a post, such as `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`, which will execute when other users view the post.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution in users' browsers or mini-program environments.
    *   Session hijacking and cookie theft.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites and phishing attacks.
    *   Application defacement and manipulation of displayed content.

*   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Avoid `v-html` for User Input:**  Never use `v-html` to render user-provided content directly. Utilize text interpolation (`{{ }}`) which automatically escapes HTML entities and prevents code execution.
        *   **HTML Sanitization:** If rendering HTML from user input is absolutely necessary (e.g., for rich text editing), employ a robust and well-maintained HTML sanitization library to remove potentially malicious code before rendering.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to limit the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by controlling the sources from which scripts and other resources can be loaded.
        *   **Regular Template Audits:**  Conduct thorough security audits of templates to identify and remediate potential template injection vulnerabilities, especially in areas where user input is rendered.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Browser-Based XSS Protection:** Utilize browser extensions designed to detect and block certain types of XSS attacks.
        *   **Keep Browsers Updated:** Ensure browsers are updated to benefit from the latest security features and patches against XSS vulnerabilities.
