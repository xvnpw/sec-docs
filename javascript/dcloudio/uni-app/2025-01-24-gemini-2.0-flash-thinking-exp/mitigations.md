# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dcloudio/uni-app

## Mitigation Strategy: [Platform-Specific Security Testing for uni-app Targets](./mitigation_strategies/platform-specific_security_testing_for_uni-app_targets.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify uni-app Target Platforms:**  Define all platforms your uni-app application will be built for (Web, iOS, Android, WeChat Mini-Program, Alipay Mini-Program, etc.) as configured in `manifest.json`.
    2.  **Set up uni-app Platform-Specific Testing Environments:** Create testing environments for each target platform, reflecting how uni-app builds and deploys to each. This includes using uni-app's build process for each platform and testing in emulators/simulators and physical devices relevant to uni-app's output.
    3.  **Develop uni-app Specific Security Test Cases:** Design security test cases that target potential vulnerabilities arising from uni-app's cross-platform compilation and platform-specific adaptations. Focus on testing the behavior of uni-app's APIs and components across different platforms.
    4.  **Execute Security Tests on Each uni-app Platform Build:** Run security tests on the application built by uni-app for each target platform.
    5.  **Analyze and Remediate uni-app Platform-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Address security issues identified in the context of uni-app's platform builds. This may involve modifying uni-app components, adjusting platform-specific configurations within `manifest.json` or using conditional compilation in uni-app code.
    6.  **Automate uni-app Platform-Specific Security Testing:** Integrate platform-specific security tests into the CI/CD pipeline, triggered after uni-app builds for each target platform.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   uni-app Cross-Platform Compilation Issues (Medium to High Severity): Security vulnerabilities introduced during uni-app's compilation process for different platforms, leading to unexpected behavior or platform-specific exploits.
    *   Platform-Specific API Vulnerabilities Exposed by uni-app (High Severity): Exploitation of platform-specific API vulnerabilities that are made accessible or are mishandled by uni-app's framework.
    *   WebView Vulnerabilities in uni-app Apps (Medium to High Severity): Vulnerabilities within the WebView component used by uni-app for Android and iOS apps, potentially allowing XSS or code execution within the uni-app context.
    *   Mini-Program Platform Security Flaws in uni-app Mini-Programs (Medium Severity): Security weaknesses in the underlying Mini-Program platform that are relevant to uni-app deployments.

*   **Impact:**
    *   uni-app Cross-Platform Compilation Issues: Medium to High Risk Reduction - Reduces risks arising from the cross-platform nature of uni-app.
