# Attack Surface Analysis for caolan/async

## Attack Surface: [Unhandled Errors in Asynchronous Operations](./attack_surfaces/unhandled_errors_in_asynchronous_operations.md)

* **Description:** Asynchronous tasks managed by `async` functions can fail, and if these errors are not caught and handled properly, it can lead to application instability or unexpected behavior.
* **How async contributes to the attack surface:** `async` provides control flow mechanisms (e.g., `series`, `parallel`, `waterfall`) for managing asynchronous operations. If error handling isn't implemented within the tasks or the final callback, `async` will propagate the error, potentially crashing the application or leaving it in an inconsistent state.
* **Example:**  Using `async.waterfall` where one task fails to connect to a database, and the subsequent tasks don't have error handling to gracefully manage this failure.
* **Impact:** Application crashes, unexpected state changes, potential data corruption, information disclosure through error messages.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement robust error handling within each asynchronous task, using `try...catch` blocks or error-first callbacks.
    * Ensure the final callback of `async` control flow functions has proper error handling logic.
    * Log errors appropriately for debugging but avoid exposing sensitive error details to users.

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions in Concurrent Operations](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_in_concurrent_operations.md)

* **Description:** When multiple asynchronous tasks managed by `async` concurrently access and modify shared mutable state without proper synchronization, it can lead to unpredictable and potentially exploitable race conditions.
* **How async contributes to the attack surface:** `async.parallel` and `async.parallelLimit` are designed for concurrent execution. If these are used without careful consideration of shared state and synchronization, race conditions can occur.
* **Example:** Two parallel tasks using `async.parallel` increment a shared counter without any locking mechanism. The final counter value might be incorrect due to the interleaving of operations.
* **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, potential for privilege escalation or unauthorized access depending on the affected data.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid sharing mutable state between concurrent asynchronous tasks if possible.
    * If shared state is necessary, implement proper synchronization mechanisms like locks, mutexes, or atomic operations.
    * Carefully review the logic of concurrent tasks to identify potential race conditions.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Uncontrolled Concurrency](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_uncontrolled_concurrency.md)

* **Description:**  Initiating an excessive number of concurrent asynchronous operations can overwhelm server resources (CPU, memory, network connections) or external services, leading to denial of service.
* **How async contributes to the attack surface:** Functions like `async.parallel`, `async.each`, or loops like `async.whilst` and `async.until` can be misused to create a large number of concurrent operations if the input data or loop conditions are not properly controlled.
* **Example:** Using `async.parallel` to process a large array of user-provided data without limiting the concurrency, potentially overwhelming the server with requests.
* **Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, instability of dependent services.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Use concurrency limiting functions like `async.parallelLimit`, `async.eachLimit`, etc., to control the number of concurrent operations.
    * Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent attackers from providing excessively large datasets that trigger uncontrolled concurrency.
    * Monitor resource usage and implement rate limiting if necessary.
