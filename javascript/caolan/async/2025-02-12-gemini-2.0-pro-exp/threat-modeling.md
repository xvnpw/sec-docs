# Threat Model Analysis for caolan/async

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Uncontrolled Parallelism](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_uncontrolled_parallelism.md)

*   **Threat:**  Parallel Execution Overload
*   **Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests or provides a large input that triggers the application to use `async.parallel` or `async.each` (or their `*Limit` counterparts with an excessively high limit) without proper bounds. The attacker aims to spawn a massive number of concurrent operations, exhausting server resources.  For example, if the application processes image uploads in parallel, the attacker could upload thousands of images simultaneously.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive, crashes, or is unable to serve legitimate users.  Database connections, file handles, memory, and CPU can all be exhausted.
*   **Affected Async Component:** `async.parallel`, `async.parallelLimit`, `async.each`, `async.eachLimit`, `async.map`, `async.mapLimit`, and any other functions that execute tasks concurrently.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical if easily exploitable and no other DoS protections are in place).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Validate the size and number of inputs *before* passing them to `async` functions.  Reject excessively large or numerous inputs.
    *   **Use `*Limit` Variants:**  Always prefer `async.parallelLimit`, `async.eachLimit`, `async.mapLimit`, etc., over their unbounded counterparts.
    *   **Dynamic Concurrency Limits:**  Instead of hardcoding limits, consider adjusting them dynamically based on current server load and resource availability.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the application or API gateway level to restrict the number of requests a user can make within a given time period.
    *   **Queueing System:**  Use a robust queueing system (e.g., Bull, Bee-Queue, or a message broker like RabbitMQ) to manage asynchronous tasks.  This provides better control over concurrency and resource utilization than `async` alone.
    *   **Circuit Breakers:** Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures if a dependent service (e.g., a database) becomes overloaded.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Unbounded Queue](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_unbounded_queue.md)

*   **Threat:**  Queue Overflow Attack
*   **Description:** An attacker sends a flood of requests that add tasks to an `async.queue`.  The attacker sends requests faster than the queue workers can process them, causing the queue to grow without bound.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).  The application runs out of memory and crashes.
*   **Affected Async Component:** `async.queue`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Queue Length Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor the queue length and set alerts for unusual growth.
    *   **Backpressure:** Implement backpressure mechanisms.  When the queue reaches a certain size, the application should slow down or stop accepting new tasks until the queue size decreases. This requires coordination between the task producer and the `async.queue`.
    *   **Persistent Queue:**  Use a persistent queue (e.g., Redis-backed) to prevent data loss in case of a crash and to allow for more sophisticated queue management.
    *   **Maximum Queue Size (Custom Implementation):**  `async.queue` doesn't have a built-in maximum size.  You'll need to wrap it with custom logic to reject new tasks when a limit is reached.  This might involve checking `queue.length()` before pushing.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Limit the rate at which tasks can be added to the queue.

## Threat: [Event Loop Blockage via Long-Running Synchronous Tasks](./threats/event_loop_blockage_via_long-running_synchronous_tasks.md)

*   **Threat:**  Synchronous Blocking Operation
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts input that triggers a long-running *synchronous* operation within an `async` callback (e.g., a computationally expensive calculation, a blocking I/O operation without proper asynchronous handling).  The attacker aims to block the Node.js event loop.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). The application becomes unresponsive to all requests while the blocking operation is running.
*   **Affected Async Component:**  Any `async` function that uses callbacks containing synchronous blocking code (e.g., `async.queue` worker, `async.each` iterator, etc.).  The issue isn't `async` itself, but how it's used.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Asynchronous I/O:**  Use asynchronous versions of I/O operations (e.g., `fs.readFile` instead of `fs.readFileSync`, asynchronous database drivers).
    *   **Worker Threads:**  Offload CPU-bound tasks to worker threads (using the `worker_threads` module in Node.js) to prevent blocking the main event loop.
    *   **Process Pool:**  For very heavy computations, consider using a process pool to distribute the work across multiple processes.
    *   **Code Profiling:**  Use profiling tools to identify and eliminate synchronous blocking operations within `async` callbacks.
    *   **Input Validation (Indirect Mitigation):** Validate input to prevent triggering computationally expensive operations maliciously.

## Threat: [Data Corruption via Race Conditions](./threats/data_corruption_via_race_conditions.md)

*   **Threat:**  Concurrent Resource Modification
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits timing vulnerabilities by sending multiple requests that trigger concurrent asynchronous operations (e.g., using `async.parallel`) that access and modify the same shared resource (e.g., a global variable, a database record) without proper synchronization.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unpredictable behavior, potentially leading to security vulnerabilities (e.g., privilege escalation if user roles are corrupted).
*   **Affected Async Component:**  `async.parallel`, `async.each`, and any other functions that execute tasks concurrently, *if* those tasks access shared mutable state.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the nature of the shared resource).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Minimize Shared State:**  Design the application to minimize shared mutable state.  Favor immutable data structures.
    *   **Synchronization Primitives:**  Use appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes, semaphores, atomic operations) to protect access to shared resources. Libraries like `async-mutex` can help.
    *   **Database Transactions:**  If using a database, use transactions to ensure atomicity and consistency of operations that modify shared data.
    *   **Careful Code Review:**  Thoroughly review code that uses `async.parallel` or `async.each` to identify and eliminate potential race conditions.
