Okay, let's create a design document for the `async` library, focusing on aspects relevant to threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a simple, yet powerful utility library for managing asynchronous operations in JavaScript.
*   Improve developer productivity by offering higher-level abstractions for common asynchronous patterns (e.g., collections, control flow).
*   Maintain broad compatibility across various JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js).
*   Ensure the library is lightweight and has minimal dependencies to avoid bloating projects that use it.
*   Maintain high code quality and test coverage to ensure reliability.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Introduction of vulnerabilities through dependencies: Since `async` is a widely used library, any security flaws could have a cascading impact on numerous applications.  The primary risk is a supply chain attack, where a compromised dependency introduces malicious code.
*   Incorrect handling of asynchronous operations: Bugs in `async` could lead to unexpected application behavior, potentially including race conditions, deadlocks, or data corruption, which could be exploited.
*   Denial of Service (DoS):  While less likely in a utility library, inefficient algorithms or improper resource management could make applications using `async` vulnerable to DoS attacks.
*   Compatibility issues: Changes to the library could break existing implementations, causing operational disruptions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Dependency Management: The project uses `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock` in some branches) to pin dependency versions, reducing the risk of unexpected changes from upstream updates. (Described in `package-lock.json`)
*   security control: Code Reviews: The project's contribution guidelines and open-source nature imply that code reviews are performed before merging changes. (Implicit in the GitHub workflow)
*   security control: Testing: The project has an extensive test suite, which helps to identify functional bugs and regressions that could lead to security vulnerabilities. (Described in the `test` directory)
*   security control: Static Analysis: The project uses linters (like ESLint, indicated by configuration files) to enforce code style and identify potential issues. (Described in configuration files like `.eslintrc.js`)
*   security control: Issue Tracking: Security vulnerabilities can be reported and tracked via GitHub Issues. (Implicit in the GitHub workflow)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited Input Validation: As a utility library, `async` itself performs minimal input validation. It relies on the calling code to provide valid inputs. This is acceptable because `async` is a low-level building block, and excessive validation within the library would be inefficient and redundant. The responsibility for input validation lies with the application using `async`.
*   accepted risk: No Built-in Cryptography: `async` does not directly handle cryptographic operations. This is acceptable as it's outside the scope of the library's purpose.
*   accepted risk: Reliance on JavaScript's built-in security model: `async` operates within the standard JavaScript security sandbox, inheriting its limitations and protections.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Regular Dependency Audits: Implement automated dependency scanning (e.g., using tools like `npm audit`, Dependabot, or Snyk) to proactively identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Fuzz Testing: Introduce fuzz testing to the test suite to explore edge cases and uncover unexpected behavior that might be exploitable.
*   security control: Security Policy: Create a `SECURITY.md` file to clearly outline the process for reporting security vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not applicable, as `async` is a utility library and does not handle authentication.
*   Authorization: Not applicable, as `async` does not manage authorization.
*   Input Validation: The library should include basic type checking to prevent obvious misuse (e.g., ensuring callbacks are functions). However, comprehensive input validation is the responsibility of the application using `async`.
*   Cryptography: Not applicable, as `async` does not handle cryptographic operations.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Writes code" --> SourceCode["Source Code (GitHub)"]
    SourceCode -- "Git Push" --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions (CI)"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs Tests" --> TestResults["Test Results"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs Linters" --> LintResults["Lint Results"]
    GitHubActions -- "Builds Package" --> Package["Package (npm)"]
    TestResults -- "Success" --> GitHubActions
    LintResults -- "Success" --> GitHubActions

```
Build Process Description:

1.  **Developer Writes Code:** A developer writes code and commits it to the `async` repository on GitHub.
2.  **Git Push:** The developer pushes their changes to the remote repository.
3.  **GitHub Actions (CI):**  GitHub Actions, the CI/CD system used by the project, is triggered by the push.
4.  **Runs Tests:** The CI workflow runs the test suite to ensure that the code changes haven't introduced any regressions.
5.  **Runs Linters:** The CI workflow runs linters (e.g., ESLint) to check for code style and potential errors.
6.  **Builds Package:** If the tests and linters pass, the CI workflow builds the package, preparing it for publication to npm.  This typically involves transpilation (if necessary) and creating a distributable package.
7.  **Package Published:** The built package is then published to the npm registry (this step is likely manual, triggered by a maintainer).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: CI/CD (GitHub Actions): Automates the build, test, and linting process, ensuring consistency and reducing the risk of human error.
*   security control: Automated Testing: The test suite helps to identify functional bugs and regressions.
*   security control: Static Analysis (Linters): Linters enforce code style and identify potential issues.
*   security control: Code Review (GitHub): All changes are reviewed before being merged into the main branch.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing reliable asynchronous operation management for JavaScript applications.
*   Maintaining developer trust and the library's reputation.

Data to Protect:

*   Source Code: The `async` library's source code itself is the primary data to protect.  While it's publicly available, ensuring its integrity is crucial to prevent the introduction of malicious code.  Sensitivity: Medium (publicly available, but integrity is critical).
*   No user data or sensitive configuration is directly handled by the library.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific performance requirements or limitations for the `async` library?
*   Are there any plans to add new features or significantly change the API in the future?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports? (This should ideally be documented in a `SECURITY.md` file).
*   What is the exact version of lodash that is used?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a stable and reliable utility library.  The project prioritizes correctness and maintainability over adding new features rapidly.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project relies on community contributions and code reviews for security.  There is an implicit assumption that contributors are acting in good faith.
*   DESIGN: The library is designed to be modular and extensible. The core functionality is well-defined and unlikely to change drastically. The deployment process via npm is standard and well-understood. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions.
