# Attack Surface Analysis for caolan/async

## Attack Surface: [Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/uncontrolled_resource_consumption__dos_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker triggers excessive concurrent operations, exhausting server resources.
*   **How `async` Contributes:**  `async` functions like `parallel`, `each`, `map`, and `queue` (without `Limit` variants) allow for unbounded concurrency. This is the *core* contribution of `async` to this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a request that causes the application to process a very large list of items using `async.each`, leading to the creation of thousands of simultaneous database connections, exhausting the connection pool and crashing the database server. The use of `async.each` *without a limit* is the direct cause.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), application unavailability, potential data loss (if transactions are interrupted).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if easily exploitable and no limits are in place) or **High** (if some limits exist but are insufficient).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use `*Limit` Variants:**  *Always* use `parallelLimit`, `eachLimit`, `mapLimit`, `queue` (with a concurrency limit), etc., with a carefully chosen limit based on system capacity. This is the *primary* mitigation directly related to `async`.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for individual asynchronous tasks using `async.timeout` to prevent long-running or stalled tasks from consuming resources indefinitely. This is also a direct `async`-related mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Race Conditions and Data Corruption](./attack_surfaces/race_conditions_and_data_corruption.md)

*   **Description:**  Multiple asynchronous tasks concurrently access and modify shared resources without proper synchronization, leading to inconsistent data.
*   **How `async` Contributes:**  `async`'s concurrency features (especially `parallel` and `each`) *facilitate* the conditions where race conditions can occur.  While race conditions are not unique to `async`, its concurrency management makes them more likely if not handled correctly.
*   **Example:** Two concurrent tasks, managed by `async.parallel`, attempt to update the same counter in a database.  Without proper locking, one update might overwrite the other, resulting in an incorrect count. The use of `async.parallel` creates the concurrent execution context.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unpredictable behavior, potential security vulnerabilities (e.g., bypassing access controls).
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can lead to significant data integrity issues).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sequential Execution (if necessary):** Use `async.series` or `async.waterfall` to enforce strict ordering of operations that *must* be executed sequentially. This is a direct `async`-based mitigation for specific scenarios.
    * **Locks/Mutexes:** Use a locking mechanism (e.g., `async-mutex` library) to ensure exclusive access to shared resources. While the mutex itself isn't part of `async`, its use is directly related to managing the concurrency *introduced* by `async`.

## Attack Surface: [Unhandled Errors and Application Crashes](./attack_surfaces/unhandled_errors_and_application_crashes.md)

*   **Description:** Errors within asynchronous callbacks are not properly handled, leading to unhandled exceptions and application crashes.
*   **How `async` Contributes:** Complex nested `async` calls can make it difficult to ensure consistent error handling throughout the asynchronous workflow. The structure and nesting facilitated by `async` contribute to the *difficulty* of error handling.
*   **Example:** A database query within an `async.each` callback fails, but the error is not checked in the callback function. The unhandled error propagates and crashes the application. The error occurs *within* the `async.each` callback.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (can lead to application unavailability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Consistent Error Handling:** Check for the `err` parameter in *every* callback function *within* `async` constructs and handle it appropriately. This is directly related to how `async` structures callbacks.
