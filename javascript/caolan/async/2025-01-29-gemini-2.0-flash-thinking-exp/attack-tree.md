## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Vector: Trigger input/condition leading to exception in async callback](./attack_tree_paths/attack_vector_trigger_inputcondition_leading_to_exception_in_async_callback.md)

Description: Attacker crafts specific input or manipulates application state to cause an unhandled exception within a callback function or promise chain managed by `async`.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium (Application crash, denial of service, unexpected state)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement robust error handling in all async callbacks and promise chains using error callbacks or `.catch()` blocks.
        * Log errors comprehensively for debugging and monitoring.
        * Ensure error handling prevents application crashes and exposes minimal information to users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Vector: Introduce errors in async operations that are not caught](./attack_tree_paths/attack_vector_introduce_errors_in_async_operations_that_are_not_caught.md)

Description: Attacker exploits scenarios where error handling is completely missing in asynchronous operations. This could involve triggering network failures, database errors, or other exceptions that are not caught and managed.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium (Application instability, silent failures, data inconsistencies)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Enforce mandatory error handling for all asynchronous operations.
        * Use linters and static analysis tools to detect missing error handling.
        * Implement global error handlers to catch unhandled rejections and exceptions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Vector: Trigger concurrent async operations that access and modify shared variables without proper synchronization](./attack_tree_paths/attack_vector_trigger_concurrent_async_operations_that_access_and_modify_shared_variables_without_pr_a08af257.md)

Description: Attacker initiates multiple parallel asynchronous tasks that concurrently access and modify shared resources (variables, objects, database records) without proper synchronization mechanisms, leading to race conditions.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium (Data corruption, inconsistent application state, unpredictable behavior)
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Medium
    * Detection Difficulty: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Identify all shared state accessed by concurrent async operations.
        * Implement appropriate synchronization mechanisms (if necessary and feasible in JavaScript context, consider patterns to manage shared state).
        * Refactor code to minimize or eliminate shared mutable state where possible.
        * Thoroughly test concurrent async operations for race conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Vector: Trigger unhandled promise rejections or exceptions in async operations leading to application crashes](./attack_tree_paths/attack_vector_trigger_unhandled_promise_rejections_or_exceptions_in_async_operations_leading_to_appl_d017cb80.md)

Description: Attacker specifically aims to trigger unhandled promise rejections or exceptions within asynchronous operations, exploiting the lack of proper rejection/exception handling to cause application crashes and denial of service.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: Medium (Denial of Service (DoS), application instability)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement global unhandled rejection handlers.
        * Ensure all promise chains have `.catch()` blocks.
        * Log unhandled rejections and exceptions for monitoring and debugging.
        * Implement application-level recovery mechanisms to handle unexpected errors gracefully.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attack Vector: Inject malicious input that is processed by async operations without proper sanitization (e.g., SQL injection in async database queries)](./attack_tree_paths/attack_vector_inject_malicious_input_that_is_processed_by_async_operations_without_proper_sanitizati_3903b50a.md)

Description: Attacker injects malicious input (e.g., SQL code, script code) that is processed by asynchronous operations (like database queries or data processing pipelines) without proper sanitization or validation, leading to injection vulnerabilities.
    * Likelihood: High
    * Impact: High (Data breach, unauthorized access, code execution depending on injection type)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user inputs.
        * Use parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent SQL injection.
        * Apply context-aware output encoding to prevent XSS.
        * Follow secure coding practices to prevent other types of injection vulnerabilities.
