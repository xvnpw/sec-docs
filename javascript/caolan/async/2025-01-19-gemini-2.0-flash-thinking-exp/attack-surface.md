# Attack Surface Analysis for caolan/async

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Execution Flow due to Complex Asynchronous Logic](./attack_surfaces/unintended_execution_flow_due_to_complex_asynchronous_logic.md)

*   **Description:**  The intended sequence of operations in an application is disrupted, leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How `async` Contributes:** Improper use of `async`'s control flow functions (`series`, `parallel`, `waterfall`, etc.) can create complex execution paths that are difficult to reason about. Errors in callback logic or conditional execution within these flows can lead to unintended code execution.
    *   **Example:** Using `async.series` with a series of database updates where a failure in an earlier step is not properly handled, leading to later steps executing with inconsistent data. An attacker might manipulate input to trigger this failure and exploit the inconsistent state.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, bypassing security checks, unexpected application states.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test the logic of asynchronous control flows.
        *   Implement robust error handling at each step of the asynchronous flow.
        *   Use clear and well-defined conditions for conditional execution within `async` functions.
        *   Consider using more structured approaches like Promises or async/await for simpler control flow in some cases.

## Attack Surface: [Unhandled Errors in Asynchronous Operations](./attack_surfaces/unhandled_errors_in_asynchronous_operations.md)

*   **Description:** Errors occurring within asynchronous tasks are not properly caught and handled, potentially leading to application crashes, resource leaks, or inconsistent states.
    *   **How `async` Contributes:** `async` relies on callbacks to propagate errors. If a callback doesn't handle an error or pass it along correctly (e.g., by calling the final callback with an error), the error might be silently ignored or cause unexpected behavior later in the application lifecycle.
    *   **Example:** In an `async.parallel` operation involving file uploads, if one upload fails and the error is not handled in its callback, the overall operation might be considered successful, leading to missing files or incomplete data processing.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crashes), data loss, inconsistent application state.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure every callback in `async` operations includes proper error handling logic.
        *   Always check for errors in the final callback of `async` control flow functions.
        *   Use `try...catch` blocks within asynchronous tasks where appropriate.
        *   Implement global error handling mechanisms to catch unhandled exceptions.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection via Unsanitized Data in Callbacks](./attack_surfaces/data_injection_via_unsanitized_data_in_callbacks.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious or unexpected data is injected into the application through data passed between asynchronous tasks via callbacks.
    *   **How `async` Contributes:** `async` facilitates the passing of data between asynchronous operations through callback arguments. If data received in a callback from an external source or a previous asynchronous task is not properly sanitized or validated before being used in subsequent operations (e.g., database queries, API calls), it can become a vector for injection attacks.
    *   **Example:** An `async.waterfall` where the output of one task (e.g., user input processing) is passed as an argument to the next task, which performs a database query. If the initial input is not sanitized, it could lead to SQL injection in the subsequent database query.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, code execution (depending on the context of the injection).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate all data received in callbacks before using it in further operations.
        *   Apply context-specific encoding or escaping to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., parameterized queries for databases).
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when passing data between asynchronous tasks.

## Attack Surface: [Resource Exhaustion through Uncontrolled Parallelism](./attack_surfaces/resource_exhaustion_through_uncontrolled_parallelism.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can trigger the execution of a large number of parallel asynchronous tasks, overwhelming the application's resources and leading to denial of service.
    *   **How `async` Contributes:** `async.parallel` and similar functions allow for the concurrent execution of multiple tasks. If the number of parallel tasks is not limited or controlled, an attacker might be able to initiate a large number of requests or operations, consuming excessive CPU, memory, or network resources.
    *   **Example:** Using `async.parallel` to process a large number of user-submitted files without any concurrency limits. An attacker could submit a massive number of files simultaneously, overloading the server.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, increased infrastructure costs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use `async.parallelLimit` or `async.queue` with appropriate concurrency limits to control the number of parallel tasks.
        *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints or functionalities that trigger asynchronous operations.
        *   Monitor resource usage and implement alerts for unusual activity.
