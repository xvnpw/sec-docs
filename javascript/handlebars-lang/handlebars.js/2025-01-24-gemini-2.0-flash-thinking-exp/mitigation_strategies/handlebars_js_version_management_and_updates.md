#### 4.2. Threats Mitigated Analysis

*   **Exploitation of Known Handlebars.js Vulnerabilities (High Severity - if vulnerabilities exist):**
    *   **Analysis:** This is a highly relevant threat.  If vulnerabilities exist in Handlebars.js, attackers could exploit them to achieve various malicious outcomes, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if Handlebars.js is used to render user-controlled data without proper sanitization (although Handlebars.js itself is designed to mitigate XSS by default, vulnerabilities can still arise).  Keeping Handlebars.js updated directly mitigates this threat by patching known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Effectiveness:**  **High Reduction**.  Regular updates are highly effective in mitigating this threat, assuming timely updates are applied and vulnerabilities are patched by the Handlebars.js maintainers.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (Medium Severity):**
    *   **Analysis:** Supply chain attacks are a growing concern.  Compromised dependencies, even indirectly, can introduce vulnerabilities into an application. While Handlebars.js itself might be less directly targeted for supply chain attacks compared to backend libraries, the risk still exists.  Using dependency management tools and vulnerability scanning helps mitigate this by ensuring dependencies are from trusted sources and known vulnerabilities are identified.
    *   **Effectiveness:** **Medium Reduction**.  Dependency management and vulnerability scanning provide a significant layer of defense against supply chain attacks by increasing visibility into dependencies and identifying potential risks. However, they are not foolproof and require continuous vigilance.
