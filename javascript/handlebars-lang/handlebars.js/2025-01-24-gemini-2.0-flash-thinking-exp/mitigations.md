# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for handlebars-lang/handlebars.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Default HTML Escaping with Double Curly Braces](./mitigation_strategies/default_html_escaping_with_double_curly_braces.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all instances** in Handlebars templates where user-provided data or data from untrusted sources is rendered.
    2.  **Ensure** that these instances use double curly braces `{{expression}}` for outputting the data. Handlebars.js automatically HTML-escapes content within double curly braces.
    3.  **Verify** that triple curly braces `{{{expression}}}` are only used for rendering data that is explicitly trusted and already contains safe HTML.  Understand that triple curly braces bypass Handlebars.js's default escaping.
    4.  **Educate developers** on the importance of using double curly braces for untrusted data and the risks of using triple curly braces incorrectly within Handlebars.js templates.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected and Stored (High Severity):**  Leveraging Handlebars.js's default escaping prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts that execute in users' browsers by automatically escaping HTML characters.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Reflected and Stored (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS by utilizing Handlebars.js's built-in mechanism to neutralize HTML-related injection attempts in most common scenarios.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Implemented globally in all `.hbs` templates within the frontend codebase. Linters are configured to warn against the use of triple curly braces without explicit justification in Handlebars.js templates.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No known missing implementations. Continuous monitoring and code reviews are in place to ensure ongoing adherence to using double curly braces for untrusted data in Handlebars.js templates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Encoding for Non-HTML Contexts within Handlebars.js](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_encoding_for_non-html_contexts_within_handlebars_js.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify template locations** where data is rendered in contexts other than HTML, such as:
        *   URL parameters or paths generated within Handlebars.js templates.
        *   JavaScript strings within `<script>` tags rendered by Handlebars.js.
        *   CSS styles dynamically generated using Handlebars.js.
    2.  **For URL contexts:**
        *   **Helper Functions:** Create custom Handlebars helpers that perform URL encoding (e.g., using `encodeURIComponent` in JavaScript within the helper) within the template before outputting data into URLs.
    3.  **For JavaScript string contexts:**
        *   **Helper Functions:** Create custom Handlebars helpers for JavaScript string escaping (e.g., JSON stringification or specific JavaScript escaping libraries within the helper) within templates before embedding data in `<script>` tags.
    4.  **For CSS contexts:**
        *   **Helper Functions with Validation/Sanitization:** Create custom Handlebars helpers that validate and sanitize data intended for CSS contexts before rendering. This helper should ensure only allowed CSS properties and values are outputted. Consider using CSS sanitization libraries within the helper.
        *   **Prefer Helper Logic for CSS Class Generation:**  Within Handlebars.js helpers, implement logic to dynamically choose from a predefined set of CSS classes based on data, rather than directly injecting user data into CSS values.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Non-HTML Contexts (High to Medium Severity):**  Standard HTML escaping provided by Handlebars.js's default `{{expression}}` is insufficient for contexts like URLs or JavaScript. Context-aware encoding within Handlebars.js templates prevents injection in these specific areas.
    *   **URL Redirection Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Improper URL encoding within Handlebars.js templates can lead to attackers manipulating URLs to redirect users to malicious sites.
    *   **CSS Injection (Medium Severity):**  While less direct than script injection, CSS injection via Handlebars.js templates can be used for defacement, information disclosure, or even in combination with other vulnerabilities for more serious attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS in Non-HTML Contexts (High Reduction):**  Effectively prevents XSS in the targeted contexts when context-aware encoding is correctly implemented within Handlebars.js helpers.
    *   **URL Redirection Attacks (Medium Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of URL redirection attacks when URLs are generated within Handlebars.js templates.
    *   **CSS Injection (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk of CSS injection when dynamic CSS is generated using Handlebars.js, especially when combined with validation and sanitization within helpers.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   URL encoding helpers are implemented for specific components where URLs are dynamically constructed within Handlebars.js templates for search and navigation.
    *   JavaScript string encoding helpers are used in a few components where dynamic configuration data is embedded within `<script>` tags rendered by Handlebars.js.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review and implementation of context-aware encoding helpers across all templates, especially for less frequently used contexts like CSS and potentially overlooked JavaScript contexts within Handlebars.js.
    *   Expansion of the library of reusable Handlebars helpers for common context-aware encoding tasks to improve consistency and ease of use across all templates.
