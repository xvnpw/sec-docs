### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Handlebars Code into Data Source

**Attack Tree Node:** 1.2.1.2. Inject Malicious Handlebars Code into Data Source [CRITICAL NODE]

**Description:** This attack path focuses on exploiting injection vulnerabilities within the application's data sources to store malicious Handlebars code. When the application retrieves and processes this data using Handlebars.js, the malicious code is executed, leading to potentially severe consequences.

**4.1. Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:** The attacker first identifies injection vulnerabilities within the application's data sources. These vulnerabilities could be:
    *   **SQL Injection:** Exploitable in applications using SQL databases where user input is not properly sanitized or parameterized in SQL queries.
    *   **NoSQL Injection:** Similar to SQL Injection, but targeting NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Couchbase, etc., where query syntax and data structures are different.
    *   **Configuration Injection:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how application configurations are managed, allowing attackers to inject malicious code into configuration files or systems.
    *   **API Injection:**  If data is fetched from external APIs and processed by Handlebars, vulnerabilities in API interactions (e.g., manipulating API parameters to inject data) can be exploited.
    *   **Other Data Source Injection:** Any data source where user-controlled input can influence the stored data and is subsequently processed by Handlebars.

2.  **Malicious Handlebars Code Crafting:** The attacker crafts malicious Handlebars code designed to achieve their objectives upon execution. This code can leverage the capabilities of Handlebars.js, which, while designed for templating, can be abused for malicious purposes if user-controlled data is directly rendered.  Examples of malicious actions within Handlebars templates include:
    *   **Accessing and Exfiltrating Sensitive Data:**  Handlebars contexts often contain application data. Malicious code can attempt to access and exfiltrate sensitive information present in the context.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  If the Handlebars context or helpers allow for making external requests, attackers can craft templates to perform SSRF attacks, potentially accessing internal resources or interacting with external systems on behalf of the server.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Less Direct, but Possible):** While Handlebars itself is not directly designed for RCE, vulnerabilities in custom Handlebars helpers or the surrounding application logic, combined with malicious template injection, could potentially lead to RCE. This is less direct and depends on the specific application's setup and custom helpers.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious templates can be designed to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) during rendering, leading to DoS.
    *   **Application Logic Manipulation:**  In some cases, malicious templates might be able to subtly alter the application's behavior or data presentation in unintended ways.

3.  **Injection into Data Source:** The attacker leverages the identified injection vulnerability to inject the crafted malicious Handlebars code into the targeted data source. This could involve:
    *   **SQL Injection Example:** Using SQL Injection to update a database record. For instance, if a website displays user profiles fetched from a database, an attacker could use SQL Injection to modify their profile's "bio" field to contain malicious Handlebars code instead of legitimate text.
        ```sql
        UPDATE users SET bio = '{{process.mainModule.require(\'child_process\').execSync(\'whoami\')}}' WHERE username = \'attacker\';
        ```
        In this example, the `bio` field is updated to contain Handlebars code that attempts to execute the `whoami` command on the server when rendered.

    *   **NoSQL Injection Example:**  Similar injection techniques can be applied to NoSQL databases, depending on the specific NoSQL database and query language.

    *   **Configuration Injection Example:**  Modifying configuration files (e.g., YAML, JSON) if the application reads and processes these files using Handlebars.

4.  **Data Retrieval and Template Rendering:** The application, during its normal operation, retrieves data from the compromised data source. This data now contains the malicious Handlebars code.

5.  **Malicious Code Execution:** When the application uses Handlebars.js to render a template that includes the data retrieved from the compromised source, the malicious Handlebars code is executed on the server or client-side (depending on where Handlebars rendering occurs).

6.  **Impact Realization:** The execution of the malicious Handlebars code leads to the attacker's desired outcome, such as data exfiltration, SSRF, DoS, or other malicious activities.

**4.2. Vulnerabilities Exploited:**

The core vulnerabilities exploited in this attack path are **Injection Vulnerabilities** in data sources. Specifically:

*   **SQL Injection:**  Occurs when user-supplied input is incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **NoSQL Injection:**  Similar to SQL Injection, but targets NoSQL databases.
*   **Configuration Injection:**  Arises when application configuration mechanisms are vulnerable to manipulation, allowing attackers to inject malicious data.
*   **API Injection:**  Vulnerabilities in how applications interact with APIs, allowing injection of malicious data through API parameters or responses.

**4.3. Potential Impact:**

The impact of successfully injecting malicious Handlebars code into a data source can be **CRITICAL** and far-reaching, including:

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  In severe cases, especially if custom Handlebars helpers or application logic are vulnerable, attackers might achieve RCE on the server. Even without direct RCE, malicious code execution within the Handlebars context can be highly damaging.
*   **Data Breach / Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored in the application's context or accessible through the server.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Malicious templates can be used to perform SSRF attacks, potentially compromising internal systems and resources.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Resource-intensive malicious templates can lead to application crashes or performance degradation, resulting in DoS.
*   **Application Defacement or Manipulation:**  Attackers can alter the application's presentation or behavior in unintended ways, potentially damaging the application's reputation or functionality.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  In some scenarios, successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation if the attacker can manipulate user accounts or application roles.

**4.4. Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate the risk of "Inject Malicious Handlebars Code into Data Source", a multi-layered security approach is crucial:

1.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Primary Defense):**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation on all user-supplied data before it is stored in any data source. Validate data type, format, length, and allowed characters.
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping (Context-Aware):**  When rendering data retrieved from data sources using Handlebars, ensure proper output encoding/escaping based on the context.  Handlebars provides mechanisms for escaping HTML, JavaScript, and other contexts. However, relying solely on Handlebars escaping might not be sufficient if the *stored* data itself is malicious code.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements (For SQL Databases):**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with SQL databases. This prevents SQL Injection by separating SQL code from user-supplied data.
    *   **Input Sanitization for NoSQL Databases:**  Implement appropriate input sanitization techniques specific to the NoSQL database being used to prevent NoSQL Injection.
    *   **Secure Configuration Management:**  Implement secure configuration management practices to prevent unauthorized modification of configuration files or systems. Validate configuration data before use.

2.  **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Database Access Control:**  Grant database users only the necessary privileges required for their functions. Avoid using overly permissive database accounts.
    *   **Application Permissions:**  Limit the application's access to system resources and data sources to the minimum required.

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Client-Side Rendering):**
    *   If Handlebars rendering occurs client-side, implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. This can help mitigate some client-side risks if malicious code is injected and attempts to load external resources. However, CSP is less effective against server-side template injection.

4.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate injection vulnerabilities and other security weaknesses in the application.
    *   Specifically test for injection vulnerabilities in data sources and the potential for malicious template injection.

5.  **Secure Development Practices:**
    *   **Security Training for Developers:**  Train developers on secure coding practices, including injection prevention techniques and secure template handling.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Implement code reviews to identify potential security vulnerabilities before code is deployed.
    *   **Static and Dynamic Application Security Testing (SAST/DAST):**  Utilize SAST and DAST tools to automatically detect injection vulnerabilities and other security flaws in the application code.

6.  **Consider Template Engine Security Features:**
    *   While Handlebars is not inherently designed for strict security controls, explore any security-related features or best practices recommended by the Handlebars.js community.
    *   Consider if the application's use case truly requires the dynamic nature of Handlebars in scenarios where user-controlled data is involved. In highly sensitive contexts, consider using safer templating approaches or static content where possible.

**4.5. Example Scenario (SQL Injection leading to Malicious Handlebars Injection):**

Consider a simple web application that displays user profiles. User profiles are stored in a SQL database with a table named `users` and columns like `username`, `bio`, and `profile_picture`. The application uses Handlebars.js to render user profile pages, including the `bio` field.

**Vulnerable Code (Simplified Example - Backend):**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const handlebars = require('handlebars');
const sqlite3 = require('sqlite3').verbose();

const app = express();
const db = new sqlite3.Database('users.db');

app.get('/profile/:username', (req, res) => {
    const username = req.params.username;
    const query = `SELECT username, bio FROM users WHERE username = '${username}'`; // Vulnerable to SQL Injection

    db.get(query, [], (err, row) => {
        if (err) {
            return res.status(500).send('Database error');
        }
        if (!row) {
            return res.status(404).send('User not found');
        }

        const template = handlebars.compile('<h1>Profile: {{username}}</h1><p>Bio: {{{bio}}}</p>'); // Rendering bio with triple braces - potentially unsafe if bio contains HTML or Handlebars
        const html = template(row);
        res.send(html);
    });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

**Attack Steps:**

1.  **Attacker identifies SQL Injection:** The attacker notices that the `/profile/:username` endpoint is vulnerable to SQL Injection because the `username` parameter is directly embedded into the SQL query without proper sanitization.

2.  **Attacker crafts malicious SQL Injection payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious username to inject Handlebars code into the `bio` field. For example, using a username like:

    ```
    ' OR 1=1; UPDATE users SET bio = '{{process.mainModule.require(\'child_process\').execSync(\'id\')}}' WHERE username = 'vulnerable_user'; --
    ```

3.  **Attacker injects malicious code:** The attacker sends a request to `/profile/' OR 1=1; UPDATE users SET bio = '{{process.mainModule.require(\'child_process\').execSync(\'id\')}}' WHERE username = 'vulnerable_user'; --`. This payload exploits the SQL Injection vulnerability to update the `bio` field of the user 'vulnerable_user' with malicious Handlebars code that attempts to execute the `id` command on the server.

4.  **Application retrieves and renders malicious data:** When any user (or the attacker themselves) requests the profile page for 'vulnerable_user' (e.g., `/profile/vulnerable_user`), the application executes the vulnerable SQL query, retrieves the modified `bio` field containing the malicious Handlebars code.

5.  **Malicious Handlebars code executes:** Handlebars.js renders the template, including the malicious code in the `bio` field.  If the Handlebars environment allows access to `process.mainModule.require('child_process')` (which is generally discouraged and should be restricted), the `id` command will be executed on the server.

**Mitigation in this Example:**

*   **Parameterized Queries:**  Use parameterized queries instead of string concatenation to build SQL queries.
    ```javascript
    const query = `SELECT username, bio FROM users WHERE username = ?`;
    db.get(query, [username], (err, row) => { /* ... */ });
    ```
*   **Input Validation:**  Validate the `username` parameter to ensure it conforms to expected characters and format.
*   **Output Escaping:**  If the `bio` field is intended to be displayed as plain text, use Handlebars escaping (e.g., `{{bio}}` instead of `{{{bio}}}`) to prevent HTML or script injection. However, in this attack scenario, even escaping might not fully prevent the malicious Handlebars code from being interpreted if the goal is to execute Handlebars code itself.
*   **Restrict Handlebars Capabilities:**  Carefully configure the Handlebars environment to restrict access to potentially dangerous built-in helpers or functionalities like `process` or `require` if they are not absolutely necessary. Consider using a "sandboxed" Handlebars environment if available.

**4.6. Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious Handlebars Code into Data Source" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications using Handlebars.js. By exploiting injection vulnerabilities in data sources, attackers can inject malicious code that is subsequently executed by the Handlebars template engine.  Effective mitigation requires a strong focus on preventing injection vulnerabilities through input validation, parameterized queries, secure configuration, and adopting secure development practices. Regular security assessments and awareness training for development teams are crucial to defend against this and similar attack vectors.
