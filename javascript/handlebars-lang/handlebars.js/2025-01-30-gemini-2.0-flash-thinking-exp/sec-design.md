# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide a robust and flexible templating engine for JavaScript environments.
  - Enable developers to efficiently create dynamic web pages and applications.
  - Maintain a widely adopted and actively supported open-source templating library.
- Most important business risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the Handlebars.js library could be exploited in applications that use it, leading to data breaches, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, or other security incidents.
  - Performance issues or inefficiencies in the templating engine could negatively impact the performance of applications using Handlebars.js.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated, insecure, or incompatible with newer technologies.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Open source code review. Implemented: Publicly available GitHub repository allows for community review and contributions.
  - security control: Unit and integration testing. Implemented: Comprehensive test suite within the repository ensures functionality and helps prevent regressions.
  - security control: Regular dependency updates. Implemented: Project maintains dependencies and updates them to address known vulnerabilities.
- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the codebase due to complexity and ongoing development.
  - accepted risk: Risk of vulnerabilities being introduced through community contributions, despite code review processes.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of third-party dependencies.
- Recommended security controls:
  - Recommended security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code vulnerabilities.
  - Recommended security control: Integrate Dependency Vulnerability Scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - Recommended security control: Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing by security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses.
  - Recommended security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) in applications using Handlebars.js to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks.
- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the Handlebars.js library itself, as it is a client-side and server-side templating engine. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that utilize Handlebars.js.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the Handlebars.js library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that utilize Handlebars.js to control access to data and functionality rendered by templates.
  - Input validation: Handlebars.js must ensure proper encoding and escaping of template variables to prevent injection attacks, particularly Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The library should provide mechanisms for developers to safely handle user inputs within templates.
  - Cryptography: Cryptographic functionalities are not a core requirement for Handlebars.js as a templating engine. However, if Handlebars.js is used in contexts requiring cryptographic operations (e.g., within helper functions), it should rely on well-established and secure cryptographic libraries provided by the underlying JavaScript environment.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process we are trying to protect:
  - The critical business process is the secure and reliable execution of web applications and systems that depend on Handlebars.js for dynamic content generation. This includes ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of data processed and displayed by these applications.
- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
  - The data being protected is primarily the data processed and rendered by Handlebars.js templates within web applications. The sensitivity of this data varies greatly depending on the application. It can range from publicly available information to highly sensitive personal or financial data. The primary security concern is preventing unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure of this data, especially through vulnerabilities like XSS. Handlebars.js itself does not store data, but it processes data provided by the applications using it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the specific use cases and contexts where Handlebars.js is primarily used? (Assumption: Web application development, both client-side and server-side rendering).
  - Are there any specific security guidelines or best practices recommended by the Handlebars.js project maintainers? (Assumption: Following general secure coding practices and addressing reported vulnerabilities).
  - What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in Handlebars.js? (Assumption: Standard open-source vulnerability reporting and patching process via GitHub).
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure, reliable, and performant templating engine for the JavaScript ecosystem. Security is a high priority due to the potential impact of vulnerabilities on user applications.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Existing security controls include open-source review and testing. Recommended controls like SAST and dependency scanning are not explicitly mentioned but are considered best practices for modern software development and should be implemented. The main security requirement is to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
  - DESIGN: The design is relatively straightforward for a JavaScript library. The focus is on the library's integration into web applications and the build and deployment process for the library itself. The C4 diagrams represent a simplified view, and more detailed diagrams could be created for specific application architectures using Handlebars.js.
