## Attack Tree Path: [Root Node: Execute Arbitrary Code on Server/Client via Handlebars.js Template Injection [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/root_node_execute_arbitrary_code_on_serverclient_via_handlebars_js_template_injection__high_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the attacker's ultimate objective. By injecting malicious Handlebars code, the attacker aims to execute arbitrary JavaScript (or potentially other languages if server-side rendering is used) on either the client's browser or the server itself.
*   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise.  The attacker could steal data, modify content, deface the website, install malware, pivot to other systems, or cause denial of service.
*   **Likelihood:** High, if user-controlled template input is allowed or if SafeString is misused.
*   **Effort:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but generally low to medium.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High, depending on the complexity of the exploit.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  Logs might show unusual template rendering or unexpected server behavior, but it can be difficult to pinpoint the source without proper auditing.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Inject Malicious Handlebars Template [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__inject_malicious_handlebars_template__high_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker successfully introduces a crafted Handlebars template containing malicious code into the application's rendering process.
*   **Impact:**  Direct path to code execution (as described in the Root Node).
*   **Likelihood:** High if user input is directly or indirectly used to construct templates.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 User-Controlled Template Input [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_user-controlled_template_input__high_.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows user input to directly or indirectly influence the structure or content of the Handlebars template being rendered. This is the most common entry point for template injection attacks.
*   **Impact:**  Enables template injection, leading to code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** High in applications that don't properly sanitize or restrict user input used in templates.
*   **Effort:** Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires careful monitoring of user input and template rendering.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Direct Template Upload [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_direct_template_upload__high_.md)

*   **Description:** The application allows users to upload complete Handlebars template files.
*   **Impact:**  Direct code execution. The attacker has full control over the template.
*   **Likelihood:** High if this feature exists and lacks proper restrictions.
*   **Effort:** Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low.  Uploaded files can be inspected, but the attack itself is straightforward.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Indirect Template Rendering [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_indirect_template_rendering__high_.md)

*   **Description:** User input is used to construct parts of the template, such as variable names, helper arguments, or even entire template sections.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution if the input is not properly sanitized.
*   **Likelihood:** High in many web applications. This is a very common vulnerability.
*   **Effort:** Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires understanding of Handlebars syntax and how the application uses user input.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires careful input validation and monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.3 Via Database Poisoning [MEDIUM]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_3_via_database_poisoning__medium_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious Handlebars code into a database field that is later used in a template.
*   **Impact:** Code execution when the poisoned data is rendered.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Requires the attacker to have write access to the database (either directly or through another vulnerability).
*   **Effort:** Medium.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires understanding of the database schema and how data is used in templates.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High.  The injection might be hidden within legitimate-looking data.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3 Bypass SafeString Misuse [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_bypass_safestring_misuse__high_.md)

*   **Description:**  The application developers incorrectly use `Handlebars.SafeString`, marking attacker-controlled input as safe, thus bypassing Handlebars' built-in escaping.
*   **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript, leading to XSS and potentially other vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** High if developers misunderstand the purpose of `SafeString`.  This is a common developer error.
*   **Effort:** Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.  The attacker simply needs to provide input that the developer mistakenly marks as safe.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Requires code review and understanding of how `SafeString` is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Helpers/Partials [MEDIUM]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_helperspartials__medium_.md)

* **Description:** The attacker leverages vulnerabilities within the application's *custom* Handlebars helpers or partials.
* **Impact:** Code execution or other security issues, depending on the vulnerability.
* **Likelihood:** Medium, depends on the quality of custom code.
* **Effort:** Medium to High.
* **Skill Level:** Medium to High.
* **Detection Difficulty:** High. Requires code review and potentially dynamic analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Unsafe Helper Implementation [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_unsafe_helper_implementation__high_.md)

*   **Description:** Custom helpers contain vulnerabilities that allow for code execution or other security issues.
*   **Impact:** High, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** High if helpers are not carefully written with security in mind.
*   **Effort:** Medium.
*   **Skill Level:** High. Requires understanding of JavaScript and Handlebars helper mechanics.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High. Requires code review and potentially dynamic analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 `eval()` or similar function [HIGH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__eval____or_similar_function__high_.md)

*   **Description:** The helper uses `eval()`, `new Function()`, or similar functions to execute arbitrary code based on user input.
*   **Impact:** Direct code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** High if these functions are used with unsanitized user input.
*   **Effort:** Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Can be detected through code review, but dynamic analysis might be needed to confirm exploitability.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Dynamic Property Access [MEDIUM]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_dynamic_property_access__medium_.md)

* **Description:** The helper uses user-controlled input to access properties or methods dynamically (e.g., `object[userInput]`), potentially leading to code execution.
* **Impact:** High, potentially leading to code execution or access to sensitive data.
* **Likelihood:** Medium, depends on how user input is used to access properties.
* **Effort:** Medium.
* **Skill Level:** Medium. Requires understanding of JavaScript object manipulation.
* **Detection Difficulty:** High. Requires careful code review and dynamic analysis.
