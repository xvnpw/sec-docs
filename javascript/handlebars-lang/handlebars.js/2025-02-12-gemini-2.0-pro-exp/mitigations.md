# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for handlebars-lang/handlebars.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Context-Aware Escaping with Custom Helpers](./mitigation_strategies/context-aware_escaping_with_custom_helpers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Contexts:** Analyze all Handlebars templates and identify where user-supplied data is used. Categorize these uses into distinct contexts:
        *   HTML body (text content)
        *   HTML attributes (e.g., `href`, `title`, `value`)
        *   JavaScript code (within `<script>` tags or inline event handlers)
        *   URLs (parts of URLs, query parameters)
        *   CSS (within `<style>` tags or inline styles â€“ *highly discouraged*)
    2.  **Create Custom Helpers:** For *each* identified context (except the basic HTML body, which uses double braces), create a dedicated Handlebars helper.  These helpers will encapsulate the correct escaping logic, directly using Handlebars' API or integrating with other libraries *through* the Handlebars helper mechanism.
        *   `escapeAttribute`: For HTML attributes.
        *   `escapeJS`: For JavaScript contexts.
        *   `escapeURL`: For URL contexts.
        *   `safeString`: *Only* for pre-sanitized HTML, and this helper should internally call a sanitization function before using `Handlebars.SafeString`.
    3.  **Replace Triple Braces:**  Systematically replace all instances of triple braces (`{{{ }}}`) within the Handlebars templates with the appropriate custom helper or double braces (`{{ }}}`).
    4.  **Enforce Usage:**  Through code reviews and potentially custom linting rules (if possible, targeting Handlebars template files), ensure that developers *always* use the correct helper for the given context *within the templates*.
    5.  **Regular Audits:** Periodically review the Handlebars templates and helper implementations to ensure consistency and correctness.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Mitigates XSS attacks by ensuring that user-supplied data is properly escaped *within the Handlebars templating system* for the specific context in which it's used.
    *   **HTML Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting arbitrary HTML tags *through the Handlebars templating system*.
    *   **URL Manipulation (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from manipulating URLs *rendered by Handlebars*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS originating from Handlebars template rendering.
    *   **HTML Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **URL Manipulation:** Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Helpers `escapeAttribute` and `escapeURL` are defined in `helpers.js`. Basic HTML escaping (double braces) is used in most templates.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `escapeJS` helper is missing. Inline JavaScript and `<script>` tag content within templates are not properly escaped.
    *   `safeString` helper is not consistently used; some triple braces remain within templates.
    *   No formal linting rules or code review processes enforce the consistent use of helpers *within the templates*.
    *   No regular audits of Handlebars templates are performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict `SafeString` Usage and Centralized Sanitization (Handlebars-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict__safestring__usage_and_centralized_sanitization__handlebars-specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify `SafeString` Uses:** Locate all instances where `Handlebars.SafeString` or triple braces (`{{{ }}}`) are used *within Handlebars templates*.
    2.  **Centralized Sanitization Function:** Create a single, well-tested, and robust HTML sanitization function. This function should be called *within* a Handlebars helper.
    3.  **`safeString` Helper:** Create a Handlebars helper named `safeString`. This helper should:
        *   Take the potentially unsafe HTML as input.
        *   Call the centralized sanitization function.
        *   Wrap the *sanitized* output in `Handlebars.SafeString`.
        *   Return the `Handlebars.SafeString` object.
    4.  **Eliminate Direct Triple Braces:**  Replace all direct uses of triple braces within Handlebars templates with calls to the `safeString` helper.  *Never* use triple braces directly.
    5.  **Code Reviews:**  Enforce strict code reviews that focus on any use of the `safeString` helper or any attempt to use `Handlebars.SafeString` directly.
    6.  **Auditing:** Regularly audit the Handlebars templates for any new or modified uses of the `safeString` helper or triple braces.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Mitigates XSS by ensuring that only pre-sanitized HTML is rendered without escaping *through the controlled use of `Handlebars.SafeString` within a dedicated helper*.
    *   **HTML Injection (Medium Severity):** Prevents the injection of malicious HTML *via Handlebars*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk, provided the sanitization function is robust and the `safeString` helper is used correctly.
    *   **HTML Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No centralized sanitization function exists.
    *   `SafeString` is used sporadically (and incorrectly) within templates, without consistent sanitization.  Triple braces are also used directly.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The entire strategy is largely missing. A centralized sanitization function needs to be created and integrated *into a Handlebars helper*. Existing uses of `SafeString` and triple braces within templates need to be refactored to use the new `safeString` helper.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Helper Design (Preventing Prototype Pollution *within* Helpers)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_helper_design__preventing_prototype_pollution_within_helpers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Existing Helpers:** Examine all custom Handlebars helpers for potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
    2.  **Safe Property Access:** Within helpers, *avoid* using user-supplied data to directly access object properties using bracket notation (e.g., `object[userData]`).
    3.  **`Object.hasOwn()`:**  Instead, use `Object.hasOwn(object, propertyName)` to check if a property exists *before* accessing it within the helper.  This is the *primary* Handlebars-specific mitigation.
    4. **Input Sanitization within helper:** Sanitize any data that comes from template.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Prototype Pollution (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from modifying the global `Object.prototype` *through malicious input passed to Handlebars helpers*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Prototype Pollution:** Reduces the risk of prototype pollution vulnerabilities originating from *within Handlebars helpers*.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some helpers use bracket notation with user-supplied data without proper checks.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Helpers need to be reviewed and refactored to use `Object.hasOwn()` and avoid unsafe property access.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `eval` and `new Function` in Helpers](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__eval__and__new_function__in_helpers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Reviews:** Mandatory code reviews for *all* custom Handlebars helpers. Specifically check for the use of `eval`, `new Function`, or any other mechanism that dynamically executes code from strings *within the helper code*.
    2.  **Static Analysis:** Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint with security plugins) into the development workflow, if possible, to scan helper code. Configure these tools to automatically detect and flag the use of `eval` and `new Function`.
    3.  **Documentation:** Clearly document the prohibition of `eval` and `new Function` in coding guidelines *specifically for Handlebars helper development*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting and executing arbitrary JavaScript code *through malicious Handlebars helper implementations*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Eliminates the risk if the strategy is strictly enforced within the helper code.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Informal code reviews are performed, but there's no specific focus on `eval` or `new Function` within helpers.
    *   No static analysis tools are currently used that target helper code.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal code review processes need to be established, with a specific focus on helper code.
    *   Static analysis tools (if feasible) should be integrated to scan helper code.
    *   Coding guidelines need to be updated to explicitly prohibit `eval` and `new Function` in helpers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Updates of Handlebars.js](./mitigation_strategies/regular_updates_of_handlebars_js.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, yarn) to manage the Handlebars.js dependency.
    2.  **Automated Updates:** Configure automated dependency updates (e.g., using Dependabot or similar tools) to receive notifications and pull requests for new versions of Handlebars.js.
    3.  **Testing:** After updating Handlebars.js, thoroughly test the application, *paying particular attention to the rendering of templates*, to ensure that the update hasn't introduced any regressions or compatibility issues.
    4.  **Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories or release notifications for Handlebars.js.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in Handlebars.js (Variable Severity):** Addresses vulnerabilities that have been publicly disclosed and patched in newer versions of the *Handlebars.js library itself*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Reduces the risk of exploitation of known vulnerabilities in the Handlebars.js library.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   npm is used for dependency management.
    *   No automated update tools are configured.
    *   Updates are performed manually and infrequently.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated update tools need to be configured.
    *   A more regular update schedule needs to be established.
