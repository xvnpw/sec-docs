# Threat Model Analysis for handlebars-lang/handlebars.js

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe Expression Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsafe_expression_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user-controlled data. If this data is then rendered in a Handlebars template using the triple-brace `{{{ }}}` syntax (which bypasses HTML escaping), the attacker's script will be executed in the victim's browser. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect the user, or deface the website.

**Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement.

**Affected Component:** `JavaScriptCompiler` module, specifically the handling of triple-brace expressions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Avoid using triple-braces `{{{ }}}` for rendering user-provided data.
*   Prefer the default double-brace `{{ }}` syntax, which automatically escapes HTML entities.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Vulnerable Custom Helpers](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_vulnerable_custom_helpers.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a poorly written custom Handlebars helper that doesn't properly escape output or constructs HTML in an unsafe manner. When the template using this helper is rendered with attacker-controlled data, malicious JavaScript can be injected into the HTML output and executed in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement.

**Affected Component:** Custom helper implementation, potentially the `Handlebars.registerHelper` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly review and test all custom Handlebars helpers for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Ensure custom helpers that output HTML properly escape user-provided data using appropriate escaping functions or libraries.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Vulnerable Partials or Layouts](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_vulnerable_partials_or_layouts.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability within a Handlebars partial or layout template. This could involve unsanitized user data within the partial or a vulnerable custom helper used by the partial. When the main template includes this vulnerable partial with attacker-controlled data, the malicious script is rendered and executed.

**Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement.

**Affected Component:** `JavaScriptCompiler` module (for partial inclusion), potentially `Handlebars.registerPartial` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Treat partials and layouts with the same security scrutiny as regular templates.
*   Ensure user data is properly escaped within partials and layouts.

## Threat: [Template Injection](./threats/template_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker manages to inject malicious Handlebars expressions or code directly into the template string that is being compiled by Handlebars. This could happen if the template source itself is dynamically constructed based on untrusted user input. Successful injection can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or information disclosure.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, sensitive data disclosure.

**Affected Component:** `Handlebars.compile` function, potentially the template loading mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Never construct Handlebars template strings dynamically using untrusted user input.
*   Store templates securely and ensure they are not modifiable by unauthorized users.
