## Deep Analysis: Inject Malicious Code via Crafted Partial/Helper Name in Handlebars.js

This analysis delves into the attack path "Inject malicious code via a crafted partial/helper name that gets dynamically included" within a Handlebars.js application. We will break down the mechanics of this vulnerability, explore potential attack vectors, assess the risk, and propose mitigation strategies for the development team.

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

Handlebars.js allows for dynamic inclusion of partials and helpers. Partials are reusable template snippets, while helpers are JavaScript functions that can be invoked within templates to perform custom logic. The vulnerability arises when the *name* of the partial or helper to be included is directly or indirectly influenced by user-controlled input *without proper sanitization or validation*.

If an attacker can manipulate this name, they can potentially force the application to include and execute arbitrary code. This is a form of **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**, specifically targeting the dynamic inclusion mechanism of Handlebars.js.

**Technical Explanation:**

Handlebars.js provides mechanisms like:

* **`{{> dynamicPartialName }}`:**  This syntax allows for the dynamic selection of a partial based on the value of `dynamicPartialName`.
* **`{{lookup . 'dynamicHelperName'}}` or custom helper registration:**  Helpers can be invoked dynamically if their names are not hardcoded.

If the values for `dynamicPartialName` or `dynamicHelperName` originate from user input (e.g., URL parameters, form data, database entries influenced by users) and are not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious values.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine an application that allows users to customize their profile page. The application might use a Handlebars template to render the page, and the layout might include a dynamic partial based on a user preference stored in the database:

```javascript
// Server-side code
app.get('/profile', (req, res) => {
  const userPreferences = getUserPreferences(req.user.id);
  res.render('profile', { layoutPartial: userPreferences.layout });
});

// Handlebars template (profile.hbs)
<div>
  {{> (lookup . 'layoutPartial') }}
</div>
```

If the `userPreferences.layout` value is directly taken from the database without validation, an attacker could modify their stored preference to something like:

```
__proto__.polluted = true
```

This attempts to pollute the prototype chain, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or even code execution in certain JavaScript environments. More directly, an attacker might try to include a partial containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Attack Vectors:**

* **Direct User Input:**
    * **URL Parameters:**  If the partial/helper name is derived from a URL parameter.
    * **Form Data:**  If a form allows specifying a partial/helper name.
    * **API Requests:**  If an API endpoint accepts a partial/helper name as input.
* **Indirect User Input:**
    * **Database Entries:**  If user-controlled data is stored in a database and later used to determine the partial/helper name.
    * **Configuration Files:**  If configuration settings that dictate partial/helper names can be influenced by users.
    * **Third-Party Integrations:**  If data from external sources (vulnerable themselves) is used to select partials/helpers.

**Potential Malicious Payloads:**

The specific payload will depend on the server-side environment and the capabilities of the Handlebars.js implementation. Examples include:

* **Prototype Pollution:** Injecting properties into the `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.
* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  If the server-side environment allows for the execution of arbitrary code through included partials or helpers (e.g., using vulnerable server-side templating engines within the partials themselves).
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Injecting client-side JavaScript code that will be executed in the user's browser if the included partial is rendered on the client-side.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Including partials or helpers that consume excessive resources, leading to application slowdown or crashes.
* **Information Disclosure:**  Including partials that expose sensitive information.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Likelihood: Low-Medium:** While the potential impact is high, exploiting this vulnerability requires a specific application design where user input directly or indirectly controls partial/helper names. Developers might not always be aware of this potential attack vector.
* **Impact: Critical:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the server, data breaches, and other severe consequences due to potential RCE.
* **Effort: Medium:** Identifying the vulnerable code path requires understanding the application's routing, data flow, and Handlebars.js usage. Crafting the malicious payload might require some knowledge of the server-side environment.
* **Skill Level: Medium:**  The attacker needs to understand web application vulnerabilities, template injection concepts, and potentially have some familiarity with Handlebars.js.
* **Detection Difficulty: Medium:**  Simple static analysis might not easily identify this vulnerability. Dynamic analysis and security testing focusing on input validation and template rendering are necessary.

**Mitigation Strategies for the Development Team:**

1. **Input Sanitization and Validation:**
    * **Strict Allowlisting:**  The most effective approach is to strictly define and allowlist the valid names for partials and helpers. Any input that doesn't match the allowed list should be rejected.
    * **Regular Expression Matching:**  Use regular expressions to validate the format of the provided name, ensuring it conforms to expected patterns and doesn't contain potentially harmful characters.
    * **Contextual Escaping:** While Handlebars.js provides escaping for output, it's crucial to sanitize the *input* that determines the partial/helper name *before* it's used in the dynamic inclusion.

2. **Avoid Dynamic Inclusion Based on User Input:**
    * **Hardcode or Configuration:** If possible, avoid deriving partial/helper names directly from user input. Instead, use predefined configurations or mappings based on internal application logic.
    * **Indirect Mapping:** If user input is necessary, map user-provided values to a predefined set of safe partial/helper names. For example, instead of directly using a user-provided layout name, map predefined layout options to their corresponding partial names.

3. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * Implement a strong CSP to limit the sources from which the application can load resources, including scripts. This can help mitigate the impact of injected client-side code.

4. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting template injection vulnerabilities. This can help identify potential weaknesses in the application's Handlebars.js usage.

5. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit the impact of a successful RCE attack.

6. **Keep Handlebars.js and Dependencies Up-to-Date:**
    * Regularly update Handlebars.js and its dependencies to patch any known security vulnerabilities.

7. **Secure Server-Side Environment:**
    * Ensure the underlying server-side environment is secure and hardened against code execution vulnerabilities.

8. **Educate Developers:**
    * Educate the development team about the risks of template injection and the importance of secure coding practices when using templating engines.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject malicious code via a crafted partial/helper name" attack path represents a significant security risk in Handlebars.js applications. By understanding the mechanics of this vulnerability and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of such attacks. Prioritizing input validation, avoiding direct reliance on user input for dynamic inclusion, and conducting regular security assessments are crucial steps in securing applications that utilize Handlebars.js. This detailed analysis provides a solid foundation for the development team to address this high-risk path effectively.
