### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Handlebars Expressions in User Input

**Attack Tree Path:** Inject Malicious Handlebars Expressions in User Input [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **This attack vector involves injecting malicious Handlebars expressions into data that is ultimately processed by the Handlebars templating engine. This can occur in two primary ways:**

    * **Direct Injection into Template Data:** User input is directly used as data within the object passed to the Handlebars `compile` function or used with pre-compiled templates.

        * **Detailed Breakdown:**
            * An attacker crafts input containing Handlebars expressions (e.g., `{{process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('rm -rf /')}}`).
            * This malicious input is stored (e.g., in a database, session, or directly in a request parameter).
            * The application retrieves this data and uses it as part of the data object passed to the Handlebars templating engine.
            * Handlebars, by design, evaluates expressions within the provided data.
            * The malicious expression is executed, potentially leading to severe consequences.

        * **Example Scenario:**
            Imagine a user profile page where the user can set a "greeting message." This message is then displayed on their profile using a Handlebars template. If the application doesn't sanitize the greeting message, a malicious user could set their greeting to `{{process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('whoami')}}`. When the profile page is rendered, this expression could be executed on the server, revealing the server's username.

    * **Indirect Injection via User-Controlled Template Fragments:** User input is used to dynamically construct parts of the Handlebars template itself.

        * **Detailed Breakdown:**
            * The application allows users to influence the structure or content of the Handlebars template. This could be through features like custom layouts, configurable widgets, or even seemingly innocuous features like allowing users to choose a display format.
            * An attacker crafts input that, when incorporated into the template, introduces malicious Handlebars expressions.
            * The application dynamically constructs the template using this user-controlled input.
            * Handlebars compiles and renders the dynamically created template, executing the malicious expressions.

        * **Example Scenario:**
            Consider an application that allows users to customize the layout of a dashboard. The application might use user input to select which "widgets" to display. If the widget names are directly incorporated into the template string without proper sanitization, a malicious user could provide a widget name like `{{> (lookup . 'evilHelper') }}` where `evilHelper` is a malicious helper function registered with Handlebars.

**Potential Consequences:**

Successful injection of malicious Handlebars expressions can lead to a wide range of severe consequences, including:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  As demonstrated in the examples, attackers can execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application. This is the most critical risk, allowing attackers to gain complete control of the server, install malware, steal sensitive data, or disrupt services.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Malicious Handlebars expressions can be used to inject client-side JavaScript code into the rendered HTML. This allows attackers to steal user credentials, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Attackers might be able to craft expressions that force the server to make requests to internal or external resources, potentially exposing sensitive internal services or launching attacks against other systems.
* **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can use expressions to access and extract sensitive data stored within the application's data structures or accessible through the server's environment.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Malicious expressions could be designed to consume excessive server resources, leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
* **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers might be able to access and reveal sensitive information about the server environment, application configuration, or internal data structures.

**Technical Details and Handlebars Specifics:**

Handlebars' flexibility and dynamic nature make it susceptible to this type of attack if not used carefully. Key aspects to consider:

* **Helper Functions:**  Custom helper functions registered with Handlebars can perform arbitrary actions. If an attacker can control which helper function is called or inject malicious code into a helper, they can achieve RCE.
* **`lookup` Helper:** The `lookup` helper allows accessing properties dynamically. If an attacker can control the property name, they might be able to access sensitive objects or functions.
* **`with` and `each` Helpers:** While not inherently dangerous, improper use with unsanitized input can create opportunities for malicious expressions to be evaluated within a specific context.
* **Triple Braces `{{{ }}`:**  Using triple braces bypasses Handlebars' default HTML escaping. While necessary in some cases, it should be used with extreme caution when dealing with user-provided data.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing the injection of malicious Handlebars expressions requires a multi-layered approach:

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input before it is used in Handlebars templates. This includes:
    * **Whitelisting:**  Define allowed characters and patterns for input fields.
    * **Blacklisting:**  Identify and remove or escape potentially dangerous characters and expressions.
    * **Contextual Escaping:**  Escape user input appropriately based on where it will be used in the template (e.g., HTML escaping for display, JavaScript escaping for script contexts). **Crucially, avoid using triple braces `{{{ }}` for user-provided data.**
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. This can help mitigate the impact of XSS attacks even if malicious expressions are injected.
* **Secure Configuration of Handlebars:**
    * **Avoid registering user-defined helpers:**  Limit the registration of custom helpers to trusted code. If necessary, carefully review and sanitize the code of any custom helpers.
    * **Consider using a "safe" mode or a sandboxed environment for Handlebars rendering (if available through extensions or wrappers).**
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential impact of a successful RCE attack.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities and ensure the effectiveness of implemented security measures.
* **Educate Developers:**  Train developers on the risks of template injection and secure coding practices for templating engines.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious Handlebars Expressions in User Input" attack path poses a significant risk to the application due to the potential for severe consequences like RCE and XSS. Implementing robust input validation, contextual escaping, and other security measures is crucial to mitigate this risk. A proactive and layered security approach is necessary to protect the application and its users from this type of attack. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are also essential to identify and address any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
