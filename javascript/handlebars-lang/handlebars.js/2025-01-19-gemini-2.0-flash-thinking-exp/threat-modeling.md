# Threat Model Analysis for handlebars-lang/handlebars.js

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)](./threats/client-side_template_injection__csti_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious Handlebars expressions into data that is subsequently rendered by a Handlebars template in the user's browser. This can be done by manipulating user input fields, URL parameters, or data stored in the application's database that is later used in the template. The attacker might execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to:
* Data theft (e.g., stealing cookies, session tokens, local storage data).
* Account takeover.
* Redirection to malicious websites.
* Defacement of the web page.
* Installation of malware (in some scenarios).

**Affected Component:** Handlebars template rendering engine (specifically when rendering data containing malicious expressions).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Treat all user-provided data as untrusted and sanitize it before using it in Handlebars templates.
* Ensure Handlebars' default HTML escaping is enabled and understand when it might be insufficient (e.g., in specific HTML contexts).
* Be extremely cautious when using triple curly braces `{{{ }}}` for unescaped output. Only use this when you are absolutely certain the data is safe.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

**Description:** If Handlebars is used for server-side rendering and an attacker can control parts of the template itself (e.g., through a vulnerable admin panel, file upload functionality, or by exploiting a vulnerability that allows writing to template files), they can inject malicious Handlebars expressions that execute arbitrary code on the server. The attacker could gain full control of the server, access sensitive data, or disrupt services.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to:
* Full server compromise.
* Data breach and exfiltration.
* Denial of service.
* Installation of malware or backdoors on the server.

**Affected Component:** Handlebars template compilation and rendering engine on the server.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly control access to template files and directories.
* Implement robust authentication and authorization for any functionality that allows template modification.
* Avoid allowing users to directly influence template content or selection.
* Run the server-side rendering process with the least privileges necessary.
* Regularly audit template files for any unauthorized modifications.

## Threat: [Insecure Usage of Helper Functions](./threats/insecure_usage_of_helper_functions.md)

**Description:** Custom Handlebars helper functions, if not implemented securely, can introduce vulnerabilities. An attacker might exploit these vulnerabilities by providing specific input that triggers unintended behavior within the helper, such as executing arbitrary commands on the server or accessing sensitive data.

**Impact:** Depending on the helper function's functionality, the impact could range from:
* Remote code execution on the server (if the helper interacts with the operating system).
* Access to sensitive data or resources.
* Denial of service (if the helper consumes excessive resources).
* Information disclosure through error messages or logs.

**Affected Component:** Custom Handlebars helper functions.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the helper's functionality).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review and audit all custom helper functions for security vulnerabilities.
* Apply strict input validation and sanitization within helper functions.
* Avoid performing sensitive operations or accessing sensitive data directly within helpers without proper authorization checks.
* Follow the principle of least privilege when designing helper functions.
* Consider sandboxing or isolating helper function execution if they perform potentially risky operations.

## Threat: [Bypassing Default Escaping with `{{{ }}}`](./threats/bypassing_default_escaping_with__{{{_}}}_.md)

**Description:** Developers might intentionally or unintentionally use triple curly braces `{{{ ... }}}` to render unescaped HTML. If the data being rendered through this mechanism is sourced from user input or an untrusted source without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript, leading to cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, similar to CSTI, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or redirection.

**Affected Component:** Handlebars template rendering engine when using triple curly braces.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Educate developers on the security implications of using triple curly braces.
* Establish clear guidelines on when and how to use unescaped output.
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data rendered using triple curly braces.
* Consider using a dedicated sanitization library to process HTML before rendering it unescaped.
