## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code on the Server via Handlebars.js [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_on_the_server_via_handlebars_js__critical_node_.md)

* This represents the attacker's ultimate goal. Success at this node means the attacker has gained the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_template_injection__ssti___critical_node_.md)

* This is the primary technique used to achieve the root goal. Successful exploitation of SSTI allows the attacker to inject and execute malicious code within the Handlebars template rendering process on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Handlebars Expressions in User Input [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_handlebars_expressions_in_user_input__high_risk_path_.md)

* This attack vector involves injecting malicious Handlebars expressions into data that is ultimately processed by the Handlebars templating engine. This can occur in two primary ways:

## Attack Tree Path: [User-Controlled Data Directly Rendered [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/user-controlled_data_directly_rendered__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: User-provided input (e.g., from form fields, URL parameters) is directly embedded into a Handlebars template without proper sanitization or escaping.
* Example: A welcome message like `<h1>Welcome, {{username}}!</h1>` where `username` is directly taken from user input. An attacker could input `{{process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('evil command')}}` (for Node.js) to execute commands.
* Why High Risk: This is a common mistake and a direct path to SSTI and code execution. It requires minimal effort and skill from the attacker if the vulnerability exists.

## Attack Tree Path: [User-Controlled Data Used in Helper Functions [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/user-controlled_data_used_in_helper_functions__high_risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: User-provided input is passed as arguments to custom Handlebars helper functions. If these helpers do not properly sanitize or validate the input, an attacker can inject malicious code that is then processed within the helper's logic or passed to other vulnerable functions.
* Example: A helper function that processes user-provided file paths without validation could be exploited to access or manipulate arbitrary files on the server.
* Why High Risk: Custom helpers are often a weaker point in the application's security if not implemented carefully. Attackers can target these functions to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable Helper Functions [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_helper_functions__high_risk_path_.md)

* This attack vector focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within custom Handlebars helper functions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Code Injection in Helper Logic [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/code_injection_in_helper_logic__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: Vulnerabilities exist within the code of a custom helper function that allow for the execution of arbitrary code when specific, malicious input is provided. This could involve using `eval()` on unsanitized input, insecurely interacting with the operating system, or other code injection flaws.
* Example: A helper function that dynamically constructs and executes database queries based on user input without proper sanitization is vulnerable to SQL injection, which can be a form of code injection in this context.
* Why High Risk: Successful code injection within a helper function directly leads to code execution on the server, making it a critical node and a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Measures](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_measures.md)

* This category focuses on techniques to circumvent security controls implemented to prevent SSTI.

## Attack Tree Path: [Circumvent Input Sanitization [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/circumvent_input_sanitization__high_risk_path_.md)

* Attack Vector: The application implements input sanitization to remove or escape potentially malicious characters. However, attackers can find weaknesses or gaps in the sanitization logic and craft payloads that bypass these filters, allowing malicious Handlebars expressions to reach the templating engine.
* Example:  If the sanitization only blocks `<script>` tags, an attacker might use other Handlebars expressions to achieve code execution.
* Why High Risk:  Even with security measures in place, vulnerabilities in their implementation can create high-risk paths for attackers to exploit.
