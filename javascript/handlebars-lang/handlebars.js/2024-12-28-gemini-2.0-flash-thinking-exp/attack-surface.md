* **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)**
    * **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious Handlebars expressions into templates processed on the server, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    * **How Handlebars.js Contributes:** Handlebars' ability to execute code within templates (through helpers, partials, and built-in functions) makes it a target for injecting malicious logic if the template source is controllable.
    * **Example:** An attacker modifies a configuration file that is used to dynamically load a Handlebars template path. They change the path to a malicious template containing `{{ process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('malicious command') }}`.
    * **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Never allow user-supplied input to directly influence the template source code or template paths.**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any data used to dynamically construct template paths or content.
        * Consider using a sandboxed environment for template rendering if dynamic template loading is absolutely necessary.
        * Regularly audit template loading mechanisms.

* **Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
    * **Description:** User-controlled data is directly embedded into a Handlebars template without proper escaping, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
    * **How Handlebars.js Contributes:** Handlebars' `{{{ }}}` (triple curly braces) or `{{& }}` syntax bypasses default HTML escaping, allowing raw HTML and JavaScript to be rendered.
    * **Example:** A comment field is rendered using `{{{comment}}}`. An attacker submits a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which is then executed in other users' browsers.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement, information theft.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Always use the default `{{ }}` syntax for outputting data, which provides HTML escaping.**
        * Be extremely cautious when using the `{{{ }}}` or `{{& }}` syntax. Only use them when you are absolutely certain the data is safe and already properly escaped.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of XSS.
        * Sanitize user-provided data on the server-side before rendering it in the template, even when using default escaping.

* **Abuse of Custom Helpers**
    * **Description:**  Malicious or poorly written custom Handlebars helpers can introduce various vulnerabilities.
    * **How Handlebars.js Contributes:** Handlebars allows developers to create custom helpers with arbitrary JavaScript logic, which can be exploited if not implemented securely.
    * **Example:** A custom helper `readFile` takes a filename as input and reads its content. An attacker could call this helper with a path like `/etc/passwd` to access sensitive information if proper path validation is missing.
    * **Impact:** Command injection, path traversal, information disclosure, denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Thoroughly review and test all custom helpers for potential security vulnerabilities.**
        * Implement strict input validation and sanitization within helpers.
        * Avoid performing sensitive operations (like file system access or external API calls) directly within helpers if possible. Delegate such tasks to secure backend services.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when designing helpers.
