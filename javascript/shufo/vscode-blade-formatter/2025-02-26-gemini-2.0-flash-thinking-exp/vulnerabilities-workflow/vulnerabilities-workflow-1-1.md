### Vulnerability List

#### 1. Compromised VSCE and OVSX Tokens leading to Malicious Extension Release

- Vulnerability name: Compromised VSCE and OVSX Tokens leading to Malicious Extension Release
- Description:
    1. An attacker gains unauthorized access to the GitHub secrets `VSCE_TOKEN` and `OVSX_TOKEN` used in the release workflow.
    2. The attacker forks the repository or creates a local clone of the project.
    3. The attacker modifies the source code of the vscode-blade-formatter extension to include malicious functionalities, such as data exfiltration or a backdoor.
    4. The attacker, using the compromised `VSCE_TOKEN` and `OVSX_TOKEN`, triggers the release workflow either locally or in their forked repository.
    5. This action publishes the attacker's modified, malicious version of the vscode-blade-formatter extension to the Visual Studio Marketplace and the Open VSX Registry, overwriting the legitimate version.
    6. Unsuspecting users who update their installed extension or newly install the vscode-blade-formatter will unknowingly download and install the malicious version.
- Impact:
    - Users of the vscode-blade-formatter extension are at high risk. Installing the malicious extension can lead to arbitrary code execution within their Visual Studio Code environment.
    - This arbitrary code execution can result in severe consequences, including but not limited to:
        - Theft of sensitive data, including source code, credentials, and personal information.
        - Complete compromise of the user's system through backdoors or malware installation.
        - Supply chain attack, potentially affecting a wide range of developers and their projects.
    - The reputation of the vscode-blade-formatter project and its developers would be severely damaged.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None explicitly mentioned in the provided project files. The project relies on GitHub Actions' secret management for protection, which is a standard security practice but not a vulnerability-specific mitigation.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Secret Rotation Policy**: Implementing a regular rotation schedule for `VSCE_TOKEN` and `OVSX_TOKEN` can limit the window of opportunity if a token is compromised.
    - **Release Monitoring**: Setting up automated monitoring for extension releases to detect unauthorized or unexpected publications. This could include comparing release signatures or verifying the integrity of the published extension.
    - **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Enforcing MFA for all accounts that have access to manage and use `VSCE_TOKEN` and `OVSX_TOKEN` secrets to reduce the risk of account compromise.
    - **Least Privilege Access**: Restricting access to `VSCE_TOKEN` and `OVSX_TOKEN` secrets to only the absolutely necessary personnel and automated systems within the CI/CD pipeline.
    - **Code Signing and Verification**: Implementing a robust code signing process for releases, allowing users to verify the authenticity and integrity of the extension before installation.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must successfully gain access to the sensitive GitHub secrets `VSCE_TOKEN` and `OVSX_TOKEN`. This could be achieved through:
        - Compromising a developer's GitHub account that has write access to the repository where these secrets are stored.
        - Insider threats where malicious actors with authorized access misuse their privileges.
        - Exploiting vulnerabilities in GitHub Actions infrastructure or related systems to exfiltrate secrets.
- Source code analysis:
    - The vulnerability stems from the workflow configuration file located at `/code/.github/workflows/create-release.yml`.
    - The relevant code snippet from `/code/.github/workflows/create-release.yml` is:
    ```yaml
          - run: vsce publish -p $VSCE_TOKEN --yarn
            if: ${{ steps.release.outputs.release_created }}
            env:
              VSCE_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VSCE_TOKEN }}
          - run: npm install -g ovsx
            if: ${{ steps.release.outputs.release_created }}
          - run: ovsx publish -p $OVSX_TOKEN --yarn
            if: ${{ steps.release.outputs.release_created }}
            env:
              OVSX_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OVSX_TOKEN }}
    ```
    - This section of the workflow directly utilizes the `VSCE_TOKEN` and `OVSX_TOKEN` GitHub secrets to authenticate and authorize the publication of the extension to the respective marketplaces.
    - An attacker gaining control over these secrets could manipulate this workflow or directly use the secrets to deploy a compromised extension version.
- Security test case:
    1. **Simulate Secret Compromise**: For testing purposes, assume you have gained access to the `VSCE_TOKEN` and `OVSX_TOKEN` secrets. In a real-world scenario, penetration testing would be required to identify potential weaknesses that could lead to secret exfiltration, which is beyond the scope of this test case as per instructions.
    2. **Fork and Clone**: Create a fork of the `vscode-blade-formatter` repository or clone it locally to a controlled testing environment.
    3. **Introduce Malicious Code**: Modify the extension's source code to include malicious code. For example, you could add code that attempts to exfiltrate a dummy file from the user's workspace upon extension activation.
    4. **Local Setup for Token Usage**: Configure your local environment or the forked repository's GitHub Actions settings to allow the use of the compromised `VSCE_TOKEN` and `OVSX_TOKEN` secrets. This step might involve securely injecting these secrets into your testing environment.
    5. **Trigger Release Workflow**: Initiate the release workflow. If testing locally, this might involve running the release commands directly, simulating the CI/CD pipeline steps. In a forked repository, you could modify the workflow to be triggered manually and then run it.
    6. **Publish Malicious Version**: Execute the `vsce publish` and `ovsx publish` commands using the compromised tokens. This step will attempt to publish your modified extension version to the Visual Studio Marketplace and Open VSX Registry.
    7. **Verify Publication**: Manually check the Visual Studio Marketplace and Open VSX Registry to confirm that the latest published version of the `vscode-blade-formatter` extension is indeed the malicious version you published. Check the version number and publication date to ensure it reflects your test release.
    8. **(Optional) User Impact Simulation**: To further demonstrate the impact, install the malicious version of the extension into a test VS Code instance. Observe if the malicious functionalities (e.g., dummy file exfiltration) are executed as expected, simulating the compromise of an end-user environment.
