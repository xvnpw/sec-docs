# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for bpmn-io/bpmn-js

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Regularly Update `bpmn-js` and its Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/1__regularly_update__bpmn-js__and_its_dependencies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update `bpmn-js` and its Dependencies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Dependency Management Process:** Utilize `npm` or `yarn` and maintain `package.json` or `yarn.lock` to track `bpmn-js` and its related libraries (`diagram-js`, `min-dom`, etc.).
    2.  **Monitor for `bpmn-js` Updates:** Regularly check for new versions of `bpmn-js` and its dependencies on npm or the `bpmn-io` GitHub repository. Subscribe to release announcements or use tools that monitor npm package updates.
    3.  **Review `bpmn-js` Release Notes and Security Advisories:** When updates are available, carefully examine the release notes and any associated security advisories specifically for `bpmn-js` and its dependencies. Pay close attention to reported security fixes.
    4.  **Test `bpmn-js` Updates in Development:** Before deploying updates to production, thoroughly test the new `bpmn-js` version in a development or staging environment to ensure compatibility with your application and BPMN diagrams, and to prevent any regressions.
    5.  **Apply `bpmn-js` Updates Promptly:** Prioritize applying security updates for `bpmn-js` as soon as they are tested and verified. Establish a process for quickly patching vulnerabilities in the `bpmn-js` library.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js` and Dependencies (High Severity):** Using outdated versions of `bpmn-js` exposes the application to publicly known security vulnerabilities within the library itself or its dependencies that attackers could exploit when processing or rendering BPMN diagrams.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js` and Dependencies (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of exploitation of known `bpmn-js` vulnerabilities by ensuring the application uses the most recent, patched versions of the library and its ecosystem.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Dependency management with `npm` is in place for `bpmn-js`.  However, proactive monitoring specifically for `bpmn-js` updates and a formal, rapid patching process for `bpmn-js` vulnerabilities are not fully established.
    *   Location: Project's root directory, `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated monitoring and alerting system specifically for `bpmn-js` and its direct dependencies updates and security advisories.
    *   Formalized and documented process for reviewing `bpmn-js` security advisories and applying patches in a timely manner.
    *   Integration of `bpmn-js` update checks into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent versioning.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Vulnerability Scanning of `bpmn-js` Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/2__vulnerability_scanning_of__bpmn-js__dependencies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Vulnerability Scanning of `bpmn-js` Dependencies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Vulnerability Scanning Tool:** Select a vulnerability scanning tool capable of analyzing JavaScript dependencies (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, or dedicated SAST/DAST tools that support JavaScript).
    2.  **Integrate into Development Workflow:** Integrate the chosen tool into your development workflow, ideally as part of your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js`'s dependencies.
    3.  **Run Scans Regularly:** Schedule regular vulnerability scans, ideally on every build or at least daily, to continuously monitor the security of `bpmn-js`'s dependency tree.
    4.  **Analyze Scan Results for `bpmn-js` Dependencies:**  Review the scan results specifically focusing on reported vulnerabilities within the dependency chain of `bpmn-js`.
    5.  **Prioritize and Remediate `bpmn-js` Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Prioritize vulnerabilities found in `bpmn-js` dependencies based on severity and exploitability. Remediate these vulnerabilities by updating dependencies (if updates are available that fix the issue), applying patches, or implementing workarounds if direct updates are not immediately feasible.
    6.  **Track Remediation Efforts for `bpmn-js` Dependencies:** Track the progress of vulnerability remediation for `bpmn-js` dependencies and ensure that all identified vulnerabilities are addressed in a timely manner.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js` Dependencies (High Severity):** Proactively identifies known security vulnerabilities within the libraries that `bpmn-js` relies upon, preventing potential exploitation through these indirect dependencies.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js` Dependencies (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk by proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js`'s dependency tree, even those that are not directly in `bpmn-js` code itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. `npm audit` is run manually on occasion, which can detect vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js` dependencies. However, this is not automated or consistently performed.
    *   Location: Can be run from the command line in the project directory.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Automated vulnerability scanning specifically for `bpmn-js` dependencies integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Regularly scheduled vulnerability scans focused on `bpmn-js` and its dependency tree.
    *   Formal process for reviewing and remediating scan results related to `bpmn-js` dependencies.
    *   Use of a more comprehensive vulnerability scanning tool beyond basic `npm audit` for deeper analysis of `bpmn-js`'s dependencies.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Subresource Integrity (SRI) for `bpmn-js` Library Files](./mitigation_strategies/3__subresource_integrity__sri__for__bpmn-js__library_files.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Subresource Integrity (SRI) for `bpmn-js` Library Files
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate SRI Hashes for `bpmn-js` Files:** When including `bpmn-js` library files (e.g., `bpmn-viewer.production.min.js`, `bpmn-modeler.production.min.js`) from CDNs or external sources in your HTML, generate SRI hashes specifically for these `bpmn-js` files. Use tools or online generators to create these hashes (e.g., `openssl dgst -sha384 -binary <bpmn-js-file> | openssl base64 -`).
    2.  **Integrate SRI Attributes in `<script>` Tags:** Add the `integrity` attribute to the `<script>` tags that load `bpmn-js` library files. Set the value of the `integrity` attribute to the generated SRI hash, prefixed with the algorithm used (e.g., `sha384-HASH_VALUE`).
    3.  **Test SRI Implementation for `bpmn-js`:** Verify that SRI is correctly implemented for `bpmn-js` by checking the browser console for errors when loading the `bpmn-js` files. If a loaded `bpmn-js` file doesn't match the SRI hash, the browser will block it, indicating correct SRI enforcement.
    4.  **Update SRI Hashes on `bpmn-js` Updates:** Whenever you update the version of `bpmn-js`, regenerate the SRI hashes for the new `bpmn-js` library files and update the `integrity` attributes in your HTML to reflect the hashes of the new version.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised CDN or External Source Serving `bpmn-js` (Medium to High Severity):** If a CDN or external source hosting `bpmn-js` files is compromised, an attacker could replace the legitimate `bpmn-js` files with malicious versions.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks Targeting `bpmn-js` Delivery (Medium Severity):** In a MITM attack, an attacker could intercept and modify the `bpmn-js` files being served over HTTP (if HTTPS is not fully enforced or improperly configured), potentially injecting malicious code into the `bpmn-js` library itself.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised CDN or External Source Serving `bpmn-js` (High Reduction):**  SRI effectively prevents the browser from executing compromised `bpmn-js` files from a CDN or external source, mitigating the risk of malicious code injection directly into the `bpmn-js` library.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks Targeting `bpmn-js` Delivery (Medium Reduction):** SRI provides a layer of defense against MITM attacks specifically targeting the delivery of `bpmn-js` files. Even if `bpmn-js` files are intercepted and modified during transit, the browser will detect the hash mismatch and refuse to execute the tampered `bpmn-js` library. HTTPS remains the primary defense against MITM attacks, but SRI adds an important integrity check.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. `bpmn-js` library files are currently loaded from a CDN without SRI attributes.
    *   Location: HTML files where `bpmn-js` is included via `<script>` tags.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Generation and integration of SRI hashes specifically for `bpmn-js` library files loaded from CDNs or external sources.
    *   Automated process for updating SRI hashes for `bpmn-js` files whenever the `bpmn-js` version is updated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Server-Side Validation of BPMN Diagrams Before `bpmn-js` Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/4__server-side_validation_of_bpmn_diagrams_before__bpmn-js__rendering.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Server-Side Validation of BPMN Diagrams Before `bpmn-js` Rendering
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose a Server-Side BPMN Validation Library:** Select a BPMN validation library suitable for your backend language (e.g., Camunda BPMN Model API for Java, `bpmn-moddle` with validation extensions for Node.js). This library will be used to parse and validate BPMN diagrams before they are sent to the client for rendering with `bpmn-js`.
    2.  **Implement a BPMN Validation Endpoint:** Create a server-side API endpoint that accepts BPMN diagrams (typically as XML strings) from the client application. This endpoint will be dedicated to validating BPMN diagrams before they are processed by `bpmn-js`.
    3.  **Validate BPMN Diagram on the Server:** Within the validation endpoint, use the chosen server-side BPMN validation library to parse and rigorously validate the received BPMN diagram. Validation should include checks against the BPMN schema to ensure well-formedness and structural integrity, and potentially custom validation rules relevant to your application's BPMN usage.
    4.  **Return BPMN Validation Results to Client:** The server-side validation endpoint should return detailed validation results to the client application. This should clearly indicate whether the submitted BPMN diagram is valid or invalid. If invalid, provide a comprehensive list of specific validation errors to help with debugging and correction.
    5.  **Reject Invalid BPMN Diagrams for `bpmn-js` Rendering:** If the server-side validation determines that a BPMN diagram is invalid, reject it. Do not send the invalid diagram to the client-side `bpmn-js` for rendering. Only proceed with sending and rendering BPMN diagrams that have passed server-side validation.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malformed or Malicious BPMN Diagrams Causing `bpmn-js` Errors (Medium to High Severity):** Malformed BPMN diagrams can lead to parsing errors, unexpected behavior, or even crashes within `bpmn-js` during rendering. Maliciously crafted diagrams could potentially exploit vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js`'s diagram processing logic.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Complex BPMN Diagrams in `bpmn-js` (Medium Severity):**  Extremely large or overly complex BPMN diagrams could potentially cause excessive resource consumption (CPU, memory) on the client-side browser when `bpmn-js` attempts to render them, leading to a Denial of Service for the user. Server-side validation can help detect and reject such diagrams before they reach `bpmn-js`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malformed or Malicious BPMN Diagrams Causing `bpmn-js` Errors (High Reduction):** Server-side BPMN validation acts as a critical security gate, preventing malformed or potentially malicious BPMN diagrams from being processed by client-side `bpmn-js`, thus mitigating risks of errors or exploits within `bpmn-js`'s rendering engine.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) through Complex BPMN Diagrams in `bpmn-js` (Medium Reduction):**  Server-side validation can incorporate checks for BPMN diagram complexity (e.g., number of elements, nesting depth, size) and reject diagrams that exceed predefined complexity limits, thereby mitigating potential DoS risks associated with rendering overly complex diagrams in `bpmn-js`.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. BPMN diagram validation is currently not performed on the server-side before diagrams are sent to the client for `bpmn-js` rendering. Client-side validation might be present but is insufficient for robust security.
    *   Location: Backend server application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Development and implementation of a server-side BPMN validation endpoint API.
    *   Integration of a robust BPMN validation library on the backend server.
    *   Enforcement of server-side BPMN diagram validation as a mandatory step before any BPMN diagram is passed to the client-side application for rendering with `bpmn-js`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Content Security Policy (CSP) Optimized for `bpmn-js` Usage](./mitigation_strategies/5__content_security_policy__csp__optimized_for__bpmn-js__usage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Content Security Policy (CSP) Optimized for `bpmn-js` Usage
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Strict CSP Policy Considering `bpmn-js` Requirements:** Define a Content Security Policy (CSP) for your application that is as strict as possible while still allowing `bpmn-js` to function correctly. Start with a restrictive policy and carefully adjust it based on `bpmn-js`'s specific needs.
    2.  **Configure CSP Directives Relevant to `bpmn-js`:** Pay close attention to the following CSP directives in the context of `bpmn-js`:
        *   `script-src`:  Carefully control the sources from which scripts can be loaded. If using `bpmn-js` from a CDN, allowlist the CDN domain. Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` if possible. If inline scripts are absolutely necessary for `bpmn-js` (though generally not recommended), use nonces or hashes.
        *   `style-src`: Control style sources. If using `bpmn-js`'s default styles or custom styles, ensure the sources are allowed. Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` for inline styles.
        *   `img-src`: Control image sources, especially if BPMN diagrams or custom extensions might load images.
        *   `default-src`: Set a restrictive `default-src` to control the loading of resources of types not explicitly covered by other directives.
    3.  **Configure CSP Headers or `<meta>` Tag:** Configure your web server to send the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header with the defined policy. Alternatively, you can use the `<meta>` tag with `http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"` in your HTML, but HTTP headers are generally preferred for security.
    4.  **Test and Refine CSP with `bpmn-js` Functionality:** Thoroughly test your CSP implementation to ensure that `bpmn-js` functions correctly (diagram rendering, interaction, extensions, etc.) without CSP violations. Use browser developer tools to identify CSP violations and adjust the policy as needed, always aiming for the strictest possible policy that still allows `bpmn-js` to operate.
    5.  **Monitor CSP Reporting for `bpmn-js` Context:** If you enable CSP reporting (e.g., `report-uri` or `report-to` directives), monitor the reports for any CSP violations that might occur in production, especially those related to `bpmn-js` functionality or resources. This can help identify potential issues or necessary CSP adjustments.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) related to `bpmn-js` Rendering or Extensions (High Severity):** CSP significantly reduces the impact of XSS vulnerabilities that could potentially be introduced through malicious BPMN diagrams rendered by `bpmn-js`, vulnerabilities within `bpmn-js` itself, or insecure custom extensions.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks Exploiting `bpmn-js` Context (Medium Severity):** CSP can help mitigate certain types of data injection attacks that might attempt to load malicious scripts or content within the context of `bpmn-js` rendering or extensions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) related to `bpmn-js` (High Reduction):** CSP acts as a strong defense-in-depth mechanism against XSS attacks targeting or exploiting `bpmn-js`. Even if an XSS vulnerability exists in the application or within `bpmn-js` itself, CSP can prevent the execution of malicious scripts, significantly limiting the attacker's ability to compromise the application through `bpmn-js`.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks Exploiting `bpmn-js` Context (Medium Reduction):** CSP provides a moderate level of protection against certain data injection attacks that might attempt to leverage `bpmn-js`'s rendering or extension mechanisms to load malicious external resources.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. A basic CSP is in place, but it is likely not specifically optimized for `bpmn-js` usage and might be missing directives or using overly permissive settings (e.g., `'unsafe-inline'`) that weaken its effectiveness in the context of `bpmn-js`.
    *   Location: Web server configuration or `<meta>` tag in HTML.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Review and strengthen the existing CSP to make it more restrictive and specifically tailored to the security needs and resource loading patterns of `bpmn-js`.
    *   Remove `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` from `script-src` and `style-src` directives if they are currently used, and find secure alternatives for `bpmn-js` if needed.
    *   Implement nonces or hashes for any unavoidable inline scripts or styles required by `bpmn-js` or its extensions.
    *   Configure CSP reporting to actively monitor for violations in production environments and identify potential CSP adjustments needed for `bpmn-js` compatibility and security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [6. Secure Development Practices for Custom `bpmn-js` Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/6__secure_development_practices_for_custom__bpmn-js__extensions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Development Practices for Custom `bpmn-js` Extensions
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mandatory Security-Focused Code Reviews for `bpmn-js` Extensions:** Implement mandatory and documented code reviews specifically focused on security for all custom `bpmn-js` extensions. Ensure that code reviews are performed by developers with security awareness and expertise in web application security and `bpmn-js` extension development.
    2.  **Input Validation and Output Sanitization in Extensions:** If custom `bpmn-js` extensions handle user input, data from BPMN diagrams, or data from external sources, implement robust input validation and output sanitization within the extension code. This is crucial to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, DOM-based XSS, data injection) within the `bpmn-js` rendering context. Sanitize any data that the extension renders into the BPMN diagram or the UI.
    3.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Extension APIs and Access:** Design custom `bpmn-js` extensions to operate with the principle of least privilege. Grant extensions only the minimum necessary access to `bpmn-js` APIs, internal data structures, and application resources required for their intended functionality. Avoid granting overly broad permissions.
    4.  **Dedicated Security Testing for `bpmn-js` Extensions:** Conduct dedicated security testing specifically for custom `bpmn-js` extensions. This should include unit tests focused on security aspects (e.g., testing input validation, output sanitization), and potentially penetration testing or vulnerability assessments to identify security flaws in the extensions' logic and integration with `bpmn-js`.
    5.  **Follow Secure Coding Guidelines for JavaScript and `bpmn-js` Extension Development:** Establish and strictly follow secure coding guidelines tailored for JavaScript development and specifically addressing common web security vulnerabilities relevant to `bpmn-js` extension development. These guidelines should cover topics like input validation, output encoding, secure API usage, and avoiding common pitfalls.
    6.  **Secure Dependency Management for Extension Dependencies:** If custom `bpmn-js` extensions rely on external JavaScript libraries, manage these dependencies with the same rigor as the main application dependencies. Regularly update extension dependencies, perform vulnerability scanning on extension dependencies, and ensure that extensions do not introduce vulnerable third-party code.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities Introduced by Custom `bpmn-js` Extensions (Medium to High Severity):** Insecurely developed custom `bpmn-js` extensions can introduce new security vulnerabilities into the application, including XSS vulnerabilities (especially DOM-based XSS within the `bpmn-js` rendering context), injection flaws, logic vulnerabilities, and vulnerabilities arising from insecure third-party dependencies used by extensions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities Introduced by Custom `bpmn-js` Extensions (High Reduction):**  Adhering to secure development practices for custom `bpmn-js` extensions significantly reduces the likelihood of introducing security vulnerabilities through extension code. Proactive security measures during development help prevent vulnerabilities from being introduced in the first place.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Code reviews are performed for major extension features, but security-focused code reviews are not consistently mandatory for all extension changes. Secure coding guidelines are not formally documented or specifically enforced for `bpmn-js` extensions. Security testing for extensions is not consistently performed.
    *   Location: Development process for `bpmn-js` extensions.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized and documented secure coding guidelines specifically for `bpmn-js` extension development, covering common security pitfalls and best practices.
    *   Mandatory and documented security-focused code review process for *all* custom `bpmn-js` extension changes, with reviewers trained in secure coding and `bpmn-js` security considerations.
    *   Dedicated and regularly performed security testing (including unit tests and potentially penetration testing) for custom `bpmn-js` extensions.
    *   Integration of automated security checks (e.g., linters, SAST tools configured for JavaScript and web security best practices) into the development process for `bpmn-js` extensions to catch potential vulnerabilities early.
