# BUSINESS POSTURE

The bpmn-js project provides a JavaScript library for rendering and modeling BPMN 2.0 diagrams in web browsers.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable developers to easily integrate BPMN diagram visualization and editing capabilities into web applications.
  - Provide a robust and standards-compliant BPMN 2.0 toolkit.
  - Offer a customizable and extensible platform for BPMN diagram manipulation.
  - Support various use cases, including process modeling, workflow visualization, and business process management.

- Business Risks:
  - Data integrity risk: Incorrect rendering or manipulation of BPMN diagrams could lead to misrepresentation of business processes and flawed decision-making.
  - Availability risk: Bugs or vulnerabilities in bpmn-js could cause application crashes or malfunctions, disrupting business operations that rely on BPMN diagrams.
  - Confidentiality risk: Although bpmn-js is a client-side library and doesn't directly handle sensitive data, vulnerabilities could be exploited to access or modify BPMN diagrams containing confidential business process information within the context of a larger application.
  - Supply chain risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies of bpmn-js could introduce security risks into applications that use the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Implemented via npm and developer practices)
  - security control: Code reviews and testing during development. (Implemented via project development process)
  - security control: Use of npm for package management and distribution. (Implemented via npm infrastructure)
  - accepted risk: Client-side nature of the library means security is heavily reliant on the security of the embedding application and the user's browser environment.
  - accepted risk: Limited control over how the library is used and integrated into different applications.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST and dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers embedding bpmn-js in their applications.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to bpmn-js as a client-side library. Authentication is the responsibility of the embedding application.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to bpmn-js. Authorization for accessing and modifying BPMN diagrams is the responsibility of the embedding application.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: bpmn-js must properly parse and validate BPMN 2.0 XML input to prevent injection attacks or denial-of-service vulnerabilities due to malformed diagrams.
    - Requirement: Implement validation to handle potentially malicious or unexpected elements and attributes within BPMN XML.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to bpmn-js in terms of encrypting BPMN diagrams. Cryptographic requirements would be relevant for the embedding application if it needs to secure BPMN data in transit or at rest.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For bpmn-js itself, the critical process is maintaining the integrity and availability of the library for developers who rely on it.
  - For applications embedding bpmn-js, the critical business processes are those modeled and visualized using BPMN diagrams. These could range from simple workflows to complex business operations. The sensitivity depends on the specific business context.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of bpmn-js: Confidentiality and integrity are important to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of intellectual property.
  - BPMN diagrams: Sensitivity depends on the business processes they represent. Diagrams might contain sensitive information about business logic, workflows, and data flows. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of BPMN diagrams are important in the context of embedding applications.
  - User data within embedding applications: bpmn-js itself does not directly handle user data, but embedding applications will. The sensitivity of this data depends on the application's purpose.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What are the typical use cases for bpmn-js in terms of business criticality and data sensitivity? (Assumption: Use cases vary widely, from low-risk visualization to mission-critical process management.)
  - What security measures are typically implemented by applications embedding bpmn-js? (Assumption: Security practices vary greatly depending on the development team and application context.)
  - Are there specific regulatory compliance requirements relevant to bpmn-js or its typical use cases? (Assumption: Compliance requirements are likely driven by the embedding applications and their specific domains, not bpmn-js directly.)

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a useful and reliable BPMN visualization and modeling library for developers. Business risks are related to library quality, availability, and potential security vulnerabilities that could impact embedding applications.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Existing security controls include standard software development practices and dependency management. Recommended controls focus on automating security checks in the CI/CD pipeline and providing security guidance to users. Security requirements are primarily focused on input validation to protect against vulnerabilities when processing BPMN XML.
  - DESIGN: The design is centered around a client-side JavaScript library distributed via npm and CDN. Deployment involves embedding the library in web applications. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions and includes standard CI/CD practices.
