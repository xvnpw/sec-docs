*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, potential data breach, service disruption, reputational damage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit bpmn-js Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_bpmn-js_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploiting known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in bpmn-js library.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in bpmn-js dependencies (direct and indirect).
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, could lead to:
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Information Disclosure
    *   Prototype Pollution

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Known Vulnerabilities in bpmn-js Library [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__known_vulnerabilities_in_bpmn-js_library__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.1.1. Exploit Publicly Disclosed CVEs [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Using publicly available exploit code or adapting existing exploits for known CVEs in specific bpmn-js versions.
        *   Scanning applications for vulnerable bpmn-js versions and targeting them with exploits.
*   **Impact:**  Same as "Exploit bpmn-js Vulnerabilities" - XSS, RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure, Prototype Pollution.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Vulnerabilities Introduced by bpmn-js Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__vulnerabilities_introduced_by_bpmn-js_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **1.2.1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in bpmn-js's Indirect Dependencies [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Identifying vulnerable indirect dependencies of bpmn-js using dependency scanning tools.
        *   Exploiting known CVEs in these indirect dependencies that can be triggered through bpmn-js usage or interaction.
*   **Impact:** Same as "Exploit bpmn-js Vulnerabilities" - XSS, RCE, DoS, Information Disclosure, Prototype Pollution, originating from dependency vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Abuse bpmn-js Features/Functionality for Malicious Purposes [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2__abuse_bpmn-js_featuresfunctionality_for_malicious_purposes__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious JavaScript code into BPMN diagram content.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by crafting malicious BPMN diagrams that overload the client browser or application.
    *   Information Disclosure by manipulating BPMN diagrams to reveal sensitive data or application logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via BPMN Diagram Content [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_bpmn_diagram_content__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **2.1.1. Inject Malicious JavaScript in BPMN Diagram Labels/Annotations [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Crafting BPMN diagrams where labels or annotations contain malicious JavaScript code.
        *   Submitting or uploading these diagrams to the application.
        *   When the application renders the diagram using bpmn-js, the malicious JavaScript executes in the user's browser.
    *   **2.1.2. Inject Malicious JavaScript in Custom BPMN Properties/Extensions [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   If the application uses custom BPMN properties or extensions, injecting malicious JavaScript code into these custom fields within the BPMN diagram.
        *   Similar to labels, when the application processes or renders these custom properties, the injected script executes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Session hijacking (stealing user session cookies).
    *   Account takeover.
    *   Defacement of the application.
    *   Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   Data theft or manipulation.
    *   Installation of malware on the user's machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Social Engineering Targeting bpmn-js Users/Developers [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__social_engineering_targeting_bpmn-js_usersdevelopers__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Phishing emails or messages targeting developers or users of the application.
    *   Social engineering tactics to trick developers into revealing credentials or granting unauthorized access.
    *   Compromising developer accounts to gain access to application code, infrastructure, or sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Phishing or Social Engineering to Obtain Developer Credentials or Access [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__phishing_or_social_engineering_to_obtain_developer_credentials_or_access__high-risk_path___crit_84b31201.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **3.1.1. Target Developers to Gain Access to Application Code or Infrastructure [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   Sending phishing emails disguised as legitimate communications (e.g., from IT department, project management, or bpmn-io community).
        *   Creating fake login pages or websites to steal developer credentials.
        *   Using social engineering techniques (e.g., pretexting, baiting) to trick developers into revealing passwords, API keys, or other sensitive information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Access to application source code, allowing for deeper vulnerability analysis and potential backdoor insertion.
    *   Access to development and production infrastructure, leading to data breaches, service disruption, and full system compromise.
    *   Ability to modify application logic, workflows, and data.
