# Threat Model Analysis for bpmn-io/bpmn-js

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious BPMN XML](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_bpmn_xml.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious BPMN 2.0 XML diagram containing embedded JavaScript code within BPMN elements or attributes. When `bpmn-js` parses and renders this diagram, the malicious JavaScript executes in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected bpmn-js Component:** `bpmn-js` core diagram rendering and XML parsing modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side BPMN XML Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize BPMN XML on the server-side before client-side rendering.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit script sources and mitigate XSS execution.
        *   **Regular `bpmn-js` Updates:** Keep `bpmn-js` updated to patch potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [DOM-Based XSS through `bpmn-js` Vulnerabilities](./threats/dom-based_xss_through__bpmn-js__vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability within the `bpmn-js` library itself allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript into the application's DOM by exploiting flaws in `bpmn-js` rendering or event handling.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected bpmn-js Component:** Potentially various modules within `bpmn-js` depending on the specific vulnerability, including rendering modules and event handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular `bpmn-js` Updates:**  Maintain up-to-date `bpmn-js` versions to patch library vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct security reviews of application code integrating `bpmn-js`.
        *   **Input Validation (Application-Side):** Validate user input interacting with `bpmn-js`.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js` Dependencies](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__bpmn-js__dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `bpmn-js` relies on third-party JavaScript dependencies. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through `bpmn-js`, potentially leading to XSS, remote code execution, or data breaches.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially severe impacts depending on the dependency vulnerability, including XSS, data theft, or remote code execution.
    *   **Affected bpmn-js Component:** Indirectly affects `bpmn-js` through its reliance on vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if dependency vulnerability is high or critical)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Regularly scan `bpmn-js` dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:**  Update `bpmn-js` and its dependencies to the latest versions.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to monitor and manage dependency security.
