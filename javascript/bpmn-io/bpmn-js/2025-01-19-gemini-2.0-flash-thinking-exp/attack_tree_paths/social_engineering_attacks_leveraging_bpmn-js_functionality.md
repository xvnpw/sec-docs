**Attack Tree Path:** Social Engineering Attacks Leveraging bpmn-js Functionality

**Description:** Attackers manipulate users into performing actions that compromise security, often by exploiting the visual nature of BPMN diagrams.

**Attack Vectors:**

* **Maliciously Crafted BPMN Diagrams:**
    * **Visually Misleading Diagrams:**
        * **Description:** Attackers create diagrams that appear legitimate but contain subtle visual cues or arrangements that trick users into making incorrect decisions or revealing sensitive information. For example, a process flow might subtly direct users to a malicious external link disguised as a legitimate step.
        * **Example:** A diagram for a "Password Reset" process might visually lead the user to click on a task labeled "Confirm Password" which actually links to a phishing site.
        * **Potential Impact:** Credential theft, unauthorized access, data leakage.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **User Education:** Train users to be critical of diagram content and verify external links.
            * **Diagram Review Process:** Implement a review process for externally sourced or user-submitted diagrams.
            * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restrict the domains from which the application can load resources, limiting the effectiveness of embedded malicious links.
    * **Hidden or Obscured Malicious Elements:**
        * **Description:** Attackers embed malicious elements (e.g., links, scripts) within the diagram that are not immediately visible or are disguised as legitimate components. This could involve using custom renderers or manipulating diagram properties.
        * **Example:** A seemingly innocuous task element might have an associated link in its properties that redirects to a malicious website when clicked or interacted with.
        * **Potential Impact:** Malware infection, cross-site scripting (XSS), unauthorized actions.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-provided BPMN diagrams before rendering them.
            * **Secure Default Configurations:** Ensure `bpmn-js` is configured with secure defaults, limiting the ability to embed arbitrary code or links.
            * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application and its integration with `bpmn-js`.
    * **Overly Complex or Confusing Diagrams:**
        * **Description:** Attackers create intentionally complex or confusing diagrams to overwhelm users and make it difficult for them to identify malicious elements or understand the true flow of the process. This can lead to users blindly following instructions or clicking on unintended elements.
        * **Example:** A diagram with numerous interconnected tasks and gateways, with a malicious link hidden within a rarely used path.
        * **Potential Impact:** User error leading to security breaches, manipulation of user actions.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Diagram Complexity Limits:** Consider implementing limits on diagram complexity or providing tools to simplify complex diagrams.
            * **User Training on Diagram Interpretation:** Educate users on how to interpret BPMN diagrams and identify potentially suspicious elements.

* **Exploiting Interactive Features of `bpmn-js`:**
    * **Malicious Links in Element Properties:**
        * **Description:** Attackers embed malicious URLs within the properties of BPMN elements (e.g., documentation, links associated with tasks). When users interact with these elements, they are redirected to malicious sites.
        * **Example:** A task element might have a "Documentation URL" that points to a phishing page instead of legitimate documentation.
        * **Potential Impact:** Credential theft, malware infection, drive-by downloads.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Link Sanitization and Validation:**  Sanitize and validate all URLs retrieved from BPMN diagram properties before rendering them as clickable links.
            * **URL Whitelisting:** Implement a whitelist of allowed domains for external links.
            * **User Warnings:** Display clear warnings to users before redirecting them to external websites from within the diagram.
    * **Custom Renderers with Malicious Behavior:**
        * **Description:** If the application allows for custom renderers in `bpmn-js`, attackers could provide malicious renderers that execute arbitrary code or redirect users to malicious sites when specific elements are rendered or interacted with.
        * **Example:** A custom renderer for a specific task type could include JavaScript code that sends user data to an attacker's server when the task is displayed.
        * **Potential Impact:** XSS, data exfiltration, unauthorized actions.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Restrict Custom Renderer Usage:** Limit or carefully control the ability to use custom renderers.
            * **Code Review for Custom Renderers:**  Thoroughly review the code of any custom renderers before deployment.
            * **Sandboxing:** If possible, sandbox custom renderers to limit their access to system resources.
    * **Fake Interactive Elements:**
        * **Description:** Attackers could create visually convincing but non-functional interactive elements within the diagram that, when "clicked" or interacted with, trigger malicious actions through other means (e.g., a hidden script on the page).
        * **Example:** A visually appealing "Submit" button within the diagram that doesn't actually use `bpmn-js` functionality but triggers a malicious script embedded in the surrounding web page.
        * **Potential Impact:**  Execution of malicious scripts, data theft.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Strict Content Security Policy:** Implement a strong CSP to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts.
            * **Regular Security Scans:** Conduct regular security scans to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application.

* **Contextual Social Engineering:**
    * **Phishing Emails with Malicious BPMN Attachments:**
        * **Description:** Attackers send phishing emails containing malicious BPMN diagram files. When users open these files in the application, the malicious content within the diagram can be exploited.
        * **Example:** An email claiming to be from a legitimate authority with an attached BPMN diagram containing malicious links or instructions.
        * **Potential Impact:** Malware infection, credential theft.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **Email Security Measures:** Implement robust email security measures, including spam filtering and malware detection.
            * **User Education on Phishing:** Train users to recognize and avoid phishing emails.
            * **Sandboxing of Attachments:**  Consider sandboxing BPMN attachments before allowing users to open them.
    * **Malicious Websites Hosting `bpmn-js` Editors:**
        * **Description:** Attackers create fake websites that mimic legitimate applications using `bpmn-js`. These websites can be used to trick users into entering sensitive information or performing malicious actions within the context of a seemingly familiar interface.
        * **Example:** A fake website that looks like a company's process management tool, prompting users to log in with their credentials.
        * **Potential Impact:** Credential theft, data harvesting.
        * **Mitigation Strategies:**
            * **User Education on Website Verification:** Train users to verify the authenticity of websites before entering sensitive information.
            * **Strong Authentication Measures:** Implement multi-factor authentication to reduce the impact of compromised credentials.
