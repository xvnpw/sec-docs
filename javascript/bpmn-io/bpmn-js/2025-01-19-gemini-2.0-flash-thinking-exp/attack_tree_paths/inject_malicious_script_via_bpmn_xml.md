### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject Malicious Script via BPMN XML

**[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
* Attackers aim to embed and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser by crafting specific BPMN XML.

This high-risk path highlights a critical vulnerability: the potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks through the manipulation of BPMN XML data. Successful exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser when the malicious BPMN diagram is rendered. This can lead to a range of severe consequences, including:

*   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies to gain unauthorized access to the application.
*   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data displayed or managed within the application.
*   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or triggering downloads of malware.
*   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance or functionality of the application for other users.
*   **Keylogging:** Capturing user keystrokes within the application.

    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * **Embed JavaScript in BPMN elements (e.g., labels, documentation) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *  Leveraging BPMN elements that allow text input (like labels, documentation fields) to inject JavaScript code.
            *  Exploiting event handlers or rendering logic that interprets and executes this injected script when the diagram is rendered or interacted with.
            *  **Example:** Using `<bpmn:textAnnotation><bpmn:text><script>alert('XSS')</script></bpmn:text></bpmn:textAnnotation>`.

            **Detailed Analysis:**

            *   **Mechanism:**  `bpmn-js` parses the BPMN XML and renders the diagram elements. When it encounters a `<bpmn:textAnnotation>` element, it extracts the text content within the `<bpmn:text>` tag. If this text content contains a `<script>` tag, the browser's HTML rendering engine will interpret and execute the JavaScript code within that tag. This occurs because `bpmn-js` might directly insert this text into the DOM without proper sanitization or escaping.
            *   **Vulnerable Components:** The primary vulnerable component is the part of `bpmn-js` responsible for rendering text-based BPMN elements. This likely involves manipulating the DOM to display the text content. Without proper encoding, the injected script is treated as executable code.
            *   **Execution Context:** The injected script executes within the user's browser, under the same origin as the application. This grants the malicious script access to cookies, local storage, and other resources associated with the application's domain.
            *   **Impact:**  As mentioned above, the impact can be severe, ranging from simple defacement to complete account takeover. The attacker can manipulate the application's behavior, steal data, or even compromise the user's system.
            *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                *   **Input Sanitization:**  Before rendering any text content from BPMN XML, especially from user-provided files, sanitize the input to remove or neutralize potentially malicious HTML tags, including `<script>`. Libraries like DOMPurify can be used for this purpose.
                *   **Contextual Output Encoding:**  When rendering text content into the DOM, use appropriate encoding techniques to prevent the browser from interpreting HTML tags as executable code. For example, HTML entities like `&lt;` and `&gt;` should be used to represent `<` and `>`.
                *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which the browser can load scripts. This can help mitigate the impact of injected scripts by preventing them from executing. Ensure `unsafe-inline` is not allowed for script sources.
                *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the BPMN rendering logic.
                *   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of opening BPMN files from untrusted sources.

        * **Embed SVG with malicious script [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *  Embedding Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) within BPMN diagrams, particularly within custom shapes or elements.
            *  Crafting the SVG to include `<script>` tags or event handlers (like `onload`) that execute malicious JavaScript when the SVG is rendered.
            *  **Example:** Using a custom BPMN shape that renders an SVG containing `<svg><script>...</script></svg>`.

            **Detailed Analysis:**

            *   **Mechanism:** `bpmn-js` allows for the integration of custom shapes and elements, which can be defined using SVG. SVGs themselves can contain embedded JavaScript within `<script>` tags or through event handlers like `onload`. When `bpmn-js` renders a BPMN diagram containing such a custom shape, the browser will also render the embedded SVG. If the SVG contains malicious JavaScript, the browser will execute it.
            *   **Vulnerable Components:** The vulnerability lies in how `bpmn-js` handles and renders custom SVG elements. If it directly injects the SVG code into the DOM without proper sanitization, the embedded script will be executed.
            *   **Execution Context:** Similar to the previous attack vector, the injected script executes within the user's browser, under the application's origin.
            *   **Impact:**  The impact is similar to embedding JavaScript in BPMN elements, allowing for XSS attacks with the same potential consequences. SVGs can also be used for more sophisticated attacks, potentially leveraging SVG-specific features.
            *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
                *   **SVG Sanitization:**  Before rendering any SVG content from BPMN XML, especially from user-provided files, sanitize the SVG to remove or neutralize potentially malicious elements and attributes, including `<script>` tags and event handlers like `onload`, `onerror`, etc. Libraries specifically designed for SVG sanitization should be used.
                *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  A strong CSP can help mitigate the risk by restricting the execution of inline scripts.
                *   **Careful Handling of Custom Shapes:**  If the application allows users to define or upload custom shapes, implement strict validation and sanitization processes for the SVG code associated with these shapes. Consider using a sandboxed environment for rendering custom SVGs if the risk is very high.
                *   **Disable or Restrict Custom SVG Rendering:** If the risk associated with rendering custom SVGs is deemed too high, consider disabling this feature or restricting it to trusted sources only.
                *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Specifically audit the handling of custom SVG elements within `bpmn-js`.

**Cross-Cutting Concerns and Recommendations:**

*   **Secure Defaults:** Ensure that `bpmn-js` is configured with secure defaults, minimizing the potential for script execution.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep `bpmn-js` and all its dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   **Security Testing:** Implement comprehensive security testing, including static analysis (SAST) and dynamic analysis (DAST), to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential damage from a successful attack.

**Conclusion:**

The ability to inject malicious scripts via BPMN XML represents a significant security risk for applications using `bpmn-js`. Both embedding JavaScript directly in BPMN elements and embedding malicious scripts within SVGs are viable attack vectors that can lead to severe consequences. Implementing robust input sanitization, contextual output encoding, and a strong Content Security Policy are crucial mitigation strategies. Regular security audits and keeping the `bpmn-js` library updated are also essential for maintaining a secure application. The development team should prioritize addressing these vulnerabilities to protect users and the application from potential attacks.
