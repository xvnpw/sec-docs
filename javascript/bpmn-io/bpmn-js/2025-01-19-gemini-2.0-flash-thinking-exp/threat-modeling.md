# Threat Model Analysis for bpmn-io/bpmn-js

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious BPMN Diagram Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_bpmn_diagram_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a BPMN diagram containing malicious SVG elements or attributes (e.g., within labels, documentation, or custom properties) that, when rendered by `bpmn-js`, execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. The attacker leverages `bpmn-js`'s rendering capabilities to inject and execute scripts.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application, or further propagation of attacks to other users.
*   **Affected bpmn-js Component:** `diagram-js` (the underlying rendering engine used by `bpmn-js`), specifically the SVG rendering and attribute parsing logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and prevent inline script execution.
    *   Sanitize and encode any user-provided data that is incorporated into the BPMN diagram or its properties before rendering it with `bpmn-js`. This includes labels, documentation, and custom properties.
    *   Avoid using `innerHTML` or similar methods to render diagram content directly. Rely on `bpmn-js`'s rendering mechanisms.
    *   Regularly update `bpmn-js` and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in bpmn-js](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_bpmn-js.md)

*   **Description:** The `bpmn-js` library relies on other JavaScript libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited by attackers if they are not patched. This is a direct threat to applications using `bpmn-js` as it's the library's responsibility to manage its dependencies securely.
*   **Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability in the dependency, but could include XSS, remote code execution, or other security breaches within the context of the `bpmn-js` library and the application using it.
*   **Affected bpmn-js Component:** The specific vulnerable dependency library used by `bpmn-js`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `bpmn-js` to the latest version, which typically includes updates to its dependencies.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js`'s dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for `bpmn-js` and its dependencies.
