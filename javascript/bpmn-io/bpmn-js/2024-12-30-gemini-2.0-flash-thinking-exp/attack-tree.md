**Threat Model: Compromising Applications Using bpmn-js - Focused View**

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: Gain unauthorized access or control over the application or its data by exploiting vulnerabilities within the bpmn-js library or its integration.

**High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using bpmn-js [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Malicious BPMN XML Injection [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via BPMN XML [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]
            * XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Less likely, but possible if server-side processing involved) [CRITICAL NODE]
            * Logic Manipulation via Malicious BPMN Structure [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        * Prototype Pollution via BPMN Properties [CRITICAL NODE]
    * Exploit Configuration or Integration Issues [CRITICAL NODE]
        * Insecure Configuration of bpmn-js [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]
        * Insecure Integration with Application Logic [HIGH-RISK PATH]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application Using bpmn-js:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker, representing a successful breach of the application's security.

* **Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities:** This represents a critical category of attacks that leverage the application's processing of user-provided BPMN data to introduce malicious content or trigger unintended behavior.

* **Malicious BPMN XML Injection:** This is a core critical node as it represents the ability of an attacker to inject malicious code or structures within the BPMN XML that is processed by the application and `bpmn-js`.

* **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (Less likely, but possible if server-side processing involved):**
    * Embed external entity references in BPMN XML to access local files or internal network resources.
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Prototype Pollution via BPMN Properties:**
    * Manipulate object prototypes through specially crafted BPMN properties, potentially leading to code execution or application malfunction.
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: High
        * Skill Level: Expert
        * Detection Difficulty: High

* **Exploit Configuration or Integration Issues:** This critical node highlights vulnerabilities arising from how the application is configured to use `bpmn-js` and how it integrates with the application's overall logic.

* **Insecure Configuration of bpmn-js:**
    * Misconfigure bpmn-js options in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities (e.g., enabling features that allow arbitrary code execution if not properly handled).
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Malicious BPMN XML Injection -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via BPMN XML:**
    * Inject malicious JavaScript within BPMN XML attributes or text nodes that, when rendered by `bpmn-js`, executes in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Malicious BPMN XML Injection -> Logic Manipulation via Malicious BPMN Structure:**
    * Create BPMN diagrams with specific structures or elements that, when interpreted by the application's business logic, lead to unintended or harmful actions (e.g., triggering incorrect workflows, bypassing authorization checks).
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Medium to High
        * Effort: Medium to High
        * Skill Level: Intermediate to Expert
        * Detection Difficulty: High

* **Exploit Configuration or Integration Issues -> Insecure Configuration of bpmn-js:**
    * Misconfigure bpmn-js options in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities (e.g., enabling features that allow arbitrary code execution if not properly handled).
        * Likelihood: Low
        * Impact: High
        * Effort: Low
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Exploit Configuration or Integration Issues -> Insecure Integration with Application Logic:**
    * The application's code that interacts with bpmn-js might introduce vulnerabilities by mishandling data or events.
        * Likelihood: Medium
        * Impact: Medium to High
        * Effort: Medium
        * Skill Level: Intermediate
        * Detection Difficulty: Medium to High
