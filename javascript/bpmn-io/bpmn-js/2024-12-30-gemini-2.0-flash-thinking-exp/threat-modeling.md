*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious BPMN XML
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a BPMN XML diagram containing malicious JavaScript code embedded within attributes (e.g., event listeners, labels) or text nodes. When `bpmn-js` renders this diagram, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser. The attacker might inject scripts to steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application, unauthorized actions performed on the user's behalf.
    *   **Affected Component:** `bpmn-js` rendering engine (specifically the modules responsible for parsing and rendering XML elements and attributes, potentially including label rendering and event handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input sanitization and validation on all BPMN XML data received from untrusted sources before rendering with `bpmn-js`.
        *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and to prevent inline script execution.
        *   Ensure that `bpmn-js` and its dependencies are regularly updated to patch any known XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider server-side rendering or sanitization of BPMN diagrams before displaying them in the client's browser.

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution via Vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js` or Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in `bpmn-js` or one of its dependencies that allows them to manipulate the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects (e.g., `Object.prototype`). This can lead to unexpected behavior, security bypasses, or even the ability to inject malicious properties that affect the entire application's execution. The attacker might achieve this by providing specific input that triggers the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Unpredictable application behavior, potential security breaches, ability to bypass security checks, and in some scenarios, potentially lead to remote code execution (though less likely in a standard browser environment).
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially various modules within `bpmn-js` or its dependencies, depending on the specific vulnerability. This could involve object manipulation or data processing functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `bpmn-js` and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly audit the application's dependencies for security vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   Implement security practices to prevent the introduction of vulnerable dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Diagram Logic Leading to Incorrect Process Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to modify BPMN diagrams could alter the diagram's structure or properties in a way that changes the intended workflow or business logic. This could involve adding or removing tasks, changing sequence flows, or modifying gateway conditions. The attacker might exploit this through vulnerabilities in the `bpmn-js` editing features.
    *   **Impact:** Incorrect execution of business processes, financial losses, regulatory non-compliance, disruption of services.
    *   **Affected Component:** `bpmn-js` editing functionalities and the underlying data model.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to control who can create and modify BPMN diagrams.
        *   Maintain version control for BPMN diagrams to track changes and allow for rollback to previous versions.
        *   Implement validation checks on BPMN diagrams before they are used for process execution to ensure they adhere to expected rules and constraints.
        *   Log all modifications made to BPMN diagrams for auditing purposes.
