## Attack Tree Path: [1. Malicious BPMN XML Injection (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__malicious_bpmn_xml_injection__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a crafted BPMN XML file or input that contains malicious code or data. This is the foundation for many attacks against systems that process BPMN.
*   **Likelihood (Medium):**  Depends on the application's input validation and how it handles user-supplied XML.  Many applications fail to properly validate XML.
*   **Impact (High):**  Can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, and complete system compromise.
*   **Effort (Medium):**  Requires understanding of BPMN XML structure and potential injection points.  Tools and techniques are readily available.
*   **Skill Level (Medium):**  Requires knowledge of XML, XSS, and potentially server-side scripting languages.
*   **Detection Difficulty (Medium):**  Can be difficult to detect if the application doesn't have robust logging and intrusion detection systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Bypass Input Validation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__bypass_input_validation__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker circumvents any checks that are in place to prevent malicious XML from being processed.
*   **Likelihood (Medium):** Many applications have weak or incomplete input validation.
*   **Impact (High):**  Allows the attacker to inject arbitrary XML, enabling further attacks.
*   **Effort (Low):**  Often involves simple techniques like trying different encodings or bypassing client-side checks.
*   **Skill Level (Low):**  Basic understanding of web application security.
*   **Detection Difficulty (Low):**  Failed validation attempts can often be logged, but attackers may try to obfuscate their attempts.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Find an entry point for user-provided XML (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__find_an_entry_point_for_user-provided_xml__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker identifies a location in the application where user input is accepted and used to construct or modify a BPMN XML document.
*   **Likelihood (High):**  Many applications accept user input in various forms.
*   **Impact (High):**  Provides the necessary pathway for the injection attack.
*   **Effort (Low):**  Can be as simple as looking for forms, file upload features, or API endpoints.
*   **Skill Level (Low):**  Basic web application reconnaissance skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty (Low):**  Normal user activity; difficult to distinguish malicious intent at this stage without context.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1.1. Identify vulnerable form fields, API endpoints, or file upload features (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_1__identify_vulnerable_form_fields__api_endpoints__or_file_upload_features__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker specifically targets input fields, API calls, or file upload mechanisms that are not properly secured.
*   **Likelihood (High):**  Vulnerabilities in these areas are common.
*   **Impact (High):**  Directly leads to successful XML injection.
*   **Effort (Low):**  Standard penetration testing techniques can identify these vulnerabilities.
*   **Skill Level (Low):**  Basic web application security testing skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty (Low):**  Can be detected through input validation failures and unusual request patterns.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. Leverage Server-Side Processing](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__leverage_server-side_processing.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how the server processes the BPMN XML. This is particularly dangerous if the server executes code based on the XML content.
*   **Likelihood (Medium):** Depends on the server-side implementation.  If the server uses the XML for logic or database queries, the risk is higher.
*   **Impact (High):** Can lead to remote code execution (RCE), data modification, or denial of service.
*   **Effort (Medium):** Requires understanding of the server-side technology and how it interacts with the BPMN XML.
*   **Skill Level (Medium):** Requires knowledge of server-side vulnerabilities and exploitation techniques.
*   **Detection Difficulty (Medium):** Can be difficult to detect without proper logging and intrusion detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Inject malicious script tags or attributes that trigger server-side logic](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__inject_malicious_script_tags_or_attributes_that_trigger_server-side_logic.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker inserts code into the BPMN XML that will be executed by the server.
*   **Likelihood (Medium):** Depends on the server-side processing logic.
*   **Impact (High):** Can lead to RCE or other severe consequences.
*   **Effort (Medium):** Requires understanding of the server-side scripting language and the BPMN XML structure.
*   **Skill Level (High):** Requires advanced knowledge of server-side vulnerabilities.
*   **Detection Difficulty (Medium):** Can be detected through input validation, code review, and monitoring of server logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Identify vulnerable server-side libraries or functions that process BPMN XML](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__identify_vulnerable_server-side_libraries_or_functions_that_process_bpmn_xml.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker researches the server-side code to find weaknesses in how it handles the XML.
*   **Likelihood (Medium):** Depends on the complexity and security of the server-side code.
*   **Impact (High):** Enables the attacker to craft a targeted exploit.
*   **Effort (Medium):** Requires access to the server-side code or significant reverse engineering effort.
*   **Skill Level (High):** Requires advanced knowledge of server-side programming and security.
*   **Detection Difficulty (Medium):** Difficult to detect without code analysis or vulnerability scanning.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Client-Side Rendering Logic](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_client-side_rendering_logic.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. XSS via Diagram Elements/Attributes (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__xss_via_diagram_elementsattributes__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the BPMN XML, which is then executed by the victim's browser when the diagram is rendered.
*   **Likelihood (High):**  If output encoding is not properly implemented, this is a very common vulnerability.
*   **Impact (High):**  Can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and other client-side attacks.
*   **Effort (Medium):**  Requires knowledge of XSS techniques and the specific attributes of BPMN elements that are rendered.
*   **Skill Level (Medium):**  Requires understanding of JavaScript and DOM manipulation.
*   **Detection Difficulty (Medium):**  Can be detected by web application firewalls (WAFs) and browser security extensions, but sophisticated XSS attacks can bypass these defenses.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1. Inject malicious JavaScript into diagram element properties (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1__inject_malicious_javascript_into_diagram_element_properties__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts a BPMN XML file where attributes like `documentation` or `name` contain JavaScript code.
*   **Likelihood (High):**  If the application doesn't sanitize these attributes, this is a direct path to XSS.
*   **Impact (High):**  Allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
*   **Effort (Medium):**  Requires understanding of HTML and JavaScript.
*   **Skill Level (Medium):**  Standard XSS knowledge.
