## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via BPMN Diagram](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_bpmn_diagram.md)

**Attack:** An attacker embeds malicious code within a BPMN diagram, aiming for either client-side execution (XSS) or server-side execution if the diagram data is processed by the server.
    *   **Impact:** Can range from user session compromise (XSS) to full server compromise (Server-Side Injection).
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium, depending on the specific injection technique.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High, requiring understanding of web vulnerabilities and potentially BPMN structure.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Difficult, depending on the effectiveness of input sanitization and output encoding.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious BPMN Attributes](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_bpmn_attributes.md)

**Attack:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into BPMN element attributes (e.g., documentation, labels). When the application renders or interacts with these elements, the script executes in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session, data theft, actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium, can be mitigated with proper input sanitization and Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Injection via Unsanitized BPMN Data](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_injection_via_unsanitized_bpmn_data.md)

**Attack:** If BPMN diagram data is sent to the server and not properly sanitized, an attacker can embed malicious code that is executed on the server (e.g., command injection, SQL injection if the data is used in database queries).
    *   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, remote code execution.
    *   **Effort:** Medium.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High, depending on the type of injection.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Difficult, requires careful log analysis and code review.

## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Prototype Pollution via Crafted BPMN](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_prototype_pollution_via_crafted_bpmn.md)

**Attack:** By carefully crafting specific BPMN structures and properties, an attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how `bpmn-js` handles object creation, leading to prototype pollution. This can allow injecting properties into built-in JavaScript objects, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution within the browser, bypassing security measures.
    *   **Effort:** High.
    *   **Skill Level:** High to Expert, requiring deep understanding of JavaScript internals and `bpmn-js`.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult to Very Difficult, subtle and might not leave clear traces.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known bpmn-js Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_bpmn-js_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of `bpmn-js` used by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially remote code execution, XSS, or other security breaches depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Effort:** Low, if an exploit is readily available.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium, using existing exploits is easier.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy, if using vulnerability scanners.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in bpmn-js Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_bpmn-js_dependencies.md)

**Attack:** `bpmn-js` relies on other JavaScript libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, potentially leading to code execution, XSS, or other issues.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium, using known exploits.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy, using dependency scanning tools.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Custom Renderers/Overlays for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_custom_renderersoverlays_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Attack:** If the application uses custom renderers or overlays to modify the appearance or behavior of BPMN elements, an attacker might find ways to inject malicious content or logic through these customizations.
    *   **Impact:** XSS, manipulation of the user interface, potentially leading to further attacks.
    *   **Effort:** Medium, requires understanding of the custom renderer implementation.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium, requires code review of custom components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Diagram State for Unauthorized Actions](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_diagram_state_for_unauthorized_actions.md)

**Attack:** If the application relies solely on the client-side diagram state managed by `bpmn-js` without server-side verification, an attacker might manipulate the diagram to perform unauthorized actions (e.g., changing process definitions in a way that bypasses business logic).
    *   **Impact:** Circumvention of business logic, unauthorized data modification.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium, manipulating client-side data is often easy.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Difficult, requires careful monitoring of server-side actions and validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting bpmn-js Features](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_bpmn-js_features.md)

**Attack:** Attackers might craft convincing phishing emails or websites that embed malicious BPMN diagrams or links to diagrams. They could trick users into interacting with these diagrams, potentially leading to credential theft or other malicious activities.
    *   **Impact:** Credential theft, malware infection (if combined with other exploits).
    *   **Effort:** Low.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium, depends on user awareness and email security.
