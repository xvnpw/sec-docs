# Attack Surface Analysis for bpmn-io/bpmn-js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious BPMN XML/JSON Input leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_bpmn_xmljson_input_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  A malicious actor crafts a BPMN diagram (in XML or JSON format) containing script code embedded within element attributes or properties. When `bpmn-js` parses and renders this diagram, the embedded script is executed in the user's browser.
*   **How bpmn-js Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `bpmn-js` is responsible for parsing and rendering the provided BPMN diagram. If it doesn't properly sanitize or escape potentially malicious content within the diagram data, it directly enables the execution of the embedded script.
*   **Example:** A BPMN activity element might have a `documentation` property set to `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`. When `bpmn-js` renders this, the `onerror` event will trigger, executing the JavaScript alert.
*   **Impact:**  Successful XSS can allow attackers to:
    *   Steal user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the application.
    *   Execute arbitrary JavaScript on the user's browser, potentially leading to further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict validation on the server-side before allowing BPMN diagrams to be processed by `bpmn-js`. Sanitize or reject diagrams containing suspicious or potentially executable content.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Ensure that any user-provided data or diagram content rendered by `bpmn-js` is properly encoded or escaped to prevent it from being interpreted as executable code. This might involve using secure templating libraries or browser APIs.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious BPMN XML/JSON Input leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_bpmn_xmljson_input_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious actor crafts an extremely complex or deeply nested BPMN diagram that consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory) when parsed or rendered by `bpmn-js`, leading to a denial of service for the user's browser.
*   **How bpmn-js Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `bpmn-js`'s core functionality involves parsing and rendering the provided BPMN diagram. The library's processing of excessively complex structures can directly lead to resource exhaustion in the user's browser.
*   **Example:** A diagram with thousands of interconnected elements or deeply nested subprocesses could overwhelm the rendering engine.
*   **Impact:**  The user's browser might become unresponsive or crash, disrupting their workflow. In severe cases, it could impact the overall performance of the user's machine.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Size Limits:** Implement limits on the size and complexity of uploaded or processed BPMN diagrams. Reject diagrams exceeding these limits.
    *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for parsing and rendering operations to prevent excessively long processing times from locking up the browser.
    *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor client-side resource usage and potentially alert users or terminate the rendering process if excessive consumption is detected.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in `bpmn-js` Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in__bpmn-js__dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** `bpmn-js` relies on other JavaScript libraries (dependencies). If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, they can indirectly introduce vulnerabilities into applications using `bpmn-js`.
*   **How bpmn-js Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `bpmn-js` integrates and utilizes these dependencies as part of its core functionality. Therefore, vulnerabilities within these dependencies become part of the attack surface of applications using `bpmn-js`.
*   **Example:** A dependency might have a known XSS vulnerability that could be exploited through certain interactions with `bpmn-js`'s rendering or data handling.
*   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from XSS and DoS to more severe client-side vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:** Keep `bpmn-js` and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions. This often includes security patches for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Utilize tools (e.g., npm audit, Yarn audit, Snyk) to scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities and address them promptly.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to `bpmn-js` and its dependencies.
