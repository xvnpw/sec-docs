# Threat Model Analysis for bpmn-io/bpmn-js

## Threat: [Malicious BPMN Definition Leading to Client-Side Denial of Service](./threats/malicious_bpmn_definition_leading_to_client-side_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a crafted BPMN diagram that contains an excessively large number of elements, deeply nested structures, or infinite loops. When `bpmn-js` attempts to render this diagram, it consumes excessive client-side resources (CPU, memory), leading to browser slowdowns, freezes, or crashes.

**Impact:** The user's browser becomes unresponsive, effectively preventing them from using the application. This can disrupt workflows and negatively impact user experience.

**Affected Component:** `bpmn-js` core rendering engine (within the `Viewer` or `Modeler` component).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement client-side resource limits or timeouts for the rendering process to prevent indefinite resource consumption within `bpmn-js`.
*   Consider using a web worker to offload the rendering process initiated by `bpmn-js`, preventing the main browser thread from freezing.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious BPMN Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_bpmn_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code within BPMN diagram elements, such as labels, documentation fields, or custom properties. When `bpmn-js` renders the diagram, and if the application doesn't properly sanitize the output, the embedded script executes in the user's browser. The vulnerability lies in how `bpmn-js` renders these elements.

**Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the application. This can lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, performing actions on behalf of the user, or injecting further malicious content.

**Affected Component:** `bpmn-js` rendering of textual elements (within the `Renderer` component).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep `bpmn-js` updated, as newer versions may include fixes for XSS vulnerabilities in rendering.
*   While the primary responsibility lies with the application, understand how `bpmn-js` renders different BPMN elements and potential injection points.

## Threat: [Denial of Service through Exploiting Rendering Vulnerabilities](./threats/denial_of_service_through_exploiting_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a BPMN diagram that exploits a specific vulnerability within the `bpmn-js` rendering engine. This could involve triggering unexpected behavior, errors, or infinite loops within the library's code, leading to client-side resource exhaustion and denial of service.

**Impact:** The user's browser becomes unresponsive or crashes while attempting to render the malicious diagram using `bpmn-js`, preventing them from using the application.

**Affected Component:** Specific modules or functions within the `bpmn-js` rendering engine (`Renderer`, potentially specific shape or connection renderers).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep the `bpmn-js` library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
*   Implement robust error handling within the application when initiating the rendering process with `bpmn-js`.

## Threat: [DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Rendering of Specific BPMN Elements](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss__through_rendering_of_specific_bpmn_elements.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists in how `bpmn-js` renders specific BPMN elements or attributes, allowing an attacker to craft a diagram that injects malicious scripts into the Document Object Model (DOM) of the application. This occurs purely on the client-side during the rendering process performed by `bpmn-js`.

**Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the application, similar to traditional XSS attacks.

**Affected Component:** Specific rendering logic within `bpmn-js` for particular BPMN elements or attributes (within the `Renderer` component).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Keep the `bpmn-js` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches addressing DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
*   If possible, review and understand the rendering logic of `bpmn-js` for potentially vulnerable elements.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Custom `bpmn-js` Renderers or Modules](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_custom__bpmn-js__renderers_or_modules.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes custom renderers or modules built on top of `bpmn-js`, these custom components might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, arbitrary code execution) within their code that interacts directly with `bpmn-js` internals or the rendered output.

**Impact:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities could compromise the client-side application, allowing attackers to execute malicious code or gain unauthorized access.

**Affected Component:** Custom renderers and modules developed for the application that directly extend or modify `bpmn-js` functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the nature of the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom `bpmn-js` extensions.
*   Conduct thorough security reviews and testing of custom renderers and modules, paying close attention to their interaction with `bpmn-js`.
*   Keep custom dependencies up-to-date and address any identified vulnerabilities in the custom code.
