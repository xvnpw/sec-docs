* **Attack Surface: Prototype Pollution via Malicious Constructor Arguments**
    * **Description:** An attacker can potentially inject malicious properties or code into the prototype chain of objects by manipulating the constructor arguments passed to the `inherits` function. This can lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities across the application.
    * **How `inherits` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `inherits` function directly manipulates the `prototype` property of JavaScript constructors. If the `superCtor` argument is derived from untrusted input or can be influenced by an attacker, a malicious constructor with a polluted prototype could be used. When `inherits` is called, this polluted prototype is then linked to the `subCtor`.
    * **Example:** An application dynamically determines the `superCtor` based on a user-provided string. If an attacker provides a string that resolves to a constructor with a modified `Object.prototype` (e.g., adding a malicious function), calling `inherits` with this constructor could pollute the global `Object.prototype`.
    * **Impact:**  High. Prototype pollution can lead to various vulnerabilities, including:
        * **Bypassing security checks:** If security checks rely on object properties, a polluted prototype could alter these checks.
        * **Remote code execution (in some scenarios):** If application logic accesses properties from the prototype chain in a way that can be controlled by the attacker.
        * **Denial of service:** By modifying core object properties, the application's functionality can be disrupted.
        * **Information disclosure:**  Malicious properties added to prototypes could be accessed by other parts of the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data used to determine the `superCtor` passed to `inherits`. Avoid using user-provided input directly to select constructors.
        * **Avoid Dynamic Constructor Selection:** If possible, avoid dynamically selecting constructors based on external or untrusted input. Use a predefined set of safe and trusted constructors.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing prototype pollution, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of injected scripts if the pollution leads to code execution.
        * **Object Freezing:** In specific scenarios, freezing prototypes of critical objects after initialization can prevent modification, but this needs careful consideration as it can impact legitimate inheritance.
