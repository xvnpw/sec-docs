# Threat Model Analysis for isaacs/inherits

## Threat: [Direct Prototype Pollution via Malicious Arguments](./threats/direct_prototype_pollution_via_malicious_arguments.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that is used as either the `constructor` or `superConstructor` argument when calling the `inherits` function. By carefully crafting these objects, the attacker can inject or modify properties directly on the prototypes of the involved constructors, potentially including built-in object prototypes. This is possible because `inherits` directly manipulates the `prototype` property.

**Impact:** This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the polluted prototype is later accessed by vulnerable code. It can also cause denial of service by modifying the behavior of core JavaScript functions or lead to information disclosure by manipulating object properties.

**Affected Component:** The `inherits` function itself, specifically the way it assigns the prototype of the `constructor` to an instance of the `superConstructor`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure that the `constructor` and `superConstructor` arguments passed to the `inherits` function are never directly derived from untrusted user input or external data without thorough validation and sanitization.
*   Implement strict control over the objects whose prototypes are being manipulated by `inherits`.
*   Consider alternative, more controlled inheritance patterns if the risk of prototype pollution is a significant concern.
