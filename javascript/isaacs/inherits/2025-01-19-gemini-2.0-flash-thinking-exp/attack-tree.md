## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Constructor Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_constructor_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category of attacks focuses on injecting malicious code into the constructors of parent or child classes used with `inherits`. Successful exploitation leads directly to Remote Code Execution, making it a critical area of concern.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Parent Constructor (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_parent_constructor__high_risk_.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the definition of a parent class. When a child class inheriting from this parent is instantiated, the parent's constructor is executed, running the attacker's code.
    Steps:
      - Step 1: Inject Malicious Code into Parent Class Definition: This requires the attacker to find a way to alter the source code or the process by which the parent class is defined and loaded.
      - Step 2: Application Instantiates Child Class (Triggering Parent Constructor): Once the malicious code is in the parent constructor, simply instantiating a child class will trigger the execution of the malicious code.
    Consequence: Remote Code Execution (Server/Client) (CRITICAL NODE): Successful exploitation grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server or client, leading to complete compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Child Constructor (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_child_constructor__high_risk_.md)

Attack Vector: Similar to the parent constructor attack, but the malicious code is injected directly into the constructor of a child class.
    Steps:
      - Step 1: Inject Malicious Code into Child Class Definition: The attacker needs to find a way to modify the source code or the process by which the child class is defined.
      - Step 2: Application Instantiates Child Class: Instantiating the compromised child class will execute the malicious code within its constructor.
    Consequence: Remote Code Execution (Server/Client) (CRITICAL NODE): Successful exploitation leads to the same critical outcome as the malicious parent constructor attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Prototype Chain Manipulation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_prototype_chain_manipulation__critical_node_.md)

This category of attacks targets JavaScript's prototype inheritance mechanism. By manipulating the prototype chain, attackers can alter the behavior of objects throughout the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Prototype Pollution via Inherited Properties (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/prototype_pollution_via_inherited_properties__high_risk_.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker modifies the prototype of a parent class, causing all objects inheriting from it to inherit the modified properties. This can be used to bypass security checks, escalate privileges, or cause denial of service.
    Steps:
      - Step 1: Identify Inherited Properties Used by the Application: The attacker first needs to identify which properties are inherited and used by the application's logic.
      - Step 2: Find a Way to Modify the Prototype of the Parent Class (CRITICAL NODE): This is the crucial step. Attackers might attempt:
        - Indirect Modification via Vulnerable Setter/Getter (HIGH RISK): Exploiting vulnerabilities in setter or getter functions defined on the prototype to inject malicious values.
      - Step 3: Application Accesses the Polluted Inherited Property: Once the prototype is polluted, any access to the affected inherited property will use the attacker's injected value.
    Consequence: Logic Bypass, Privilege Escalation, Denial of Service (CRITICAL NODE): Successful prototype pollution can lead to a range of critical impacts, including bypassing authentication or authorization, gaining administrative privileges, or crashing the application.
