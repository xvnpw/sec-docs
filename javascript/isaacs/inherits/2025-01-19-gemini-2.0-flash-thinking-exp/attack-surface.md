# Attack Surface Analysis for isaacs/inherits

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution via Malicious Constructor Arguments](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution_via_malicious_constructor_arguments.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the prototype chain of JavaScript objects by injecting malicious properties or functions into the prototypes of constructor functions. This can lead to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or even remote code execution.
* **How `inherits` Contributes:** The `inherits` function directly manipulates the `prototype` property of the `subCtor` to link it to the `superCtor`'s prototype. If the `superCtor` argument is derived from an untrusted source or is a constructor with a polluted prototype, this pollution can be propagated to objects created using the `subCtor`.
* **Example:** Imagine a scenario where the `superCtor` is dynamically determined based on user input. An attacker could provide a constructor whose prototype has been maliciously modified (e.g., adding a function that executes arbitrary code). When `inherits` is called with this malicious constructor, the inheriting class's prototype will also be affected.
* **Impact:**
    * Denial of Service (DoS): By polluting fundamental object prototypes (like `Object.prototype`), an attacker could cause unexpected errors or infinite loops, crashing the application.
    * Remote Code Execution (RCE): If the polluted prototype properties are later accessed in a vulnerable way (e.g., used in `eval()` or similar constructs), it could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    * Logic Flaws and Unexpected Behavior: Modifying prototype properties can alter the behavior of existing objects and future instances, leading to unexpected application logic and potential security vulnerabilities.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strictly control the `superCtor` argument:** Ensure the `superCtor` passed to `inherits` is always from a trusted source and is not influenced by user input or external, untrusted data. Avoid dynamically determining the `superCtor` based on external factors.
    * **Validate and sanitize input:** If there's any possibility of external influence on the choice of constructors, implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent the use of malicious constructors.
    * **Consider alternative inheritance patterns:** For scenarios where dynamic constructor selection is necessary, explore safer inheritance patterns or object composition techniques that don't involve direct prototype manipulation in the same way.
