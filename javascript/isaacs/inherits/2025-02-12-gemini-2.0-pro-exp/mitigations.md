# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for isaacs/inherits

## Mitigation Strategy: [Object.freeze() and Object.seal() on Inherited Prototypes](./mitigation_strategies/object_freeze___and_object_seal___on_inherited_prototypes.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Target Prototypes:** Immediately after using `inherits(SubClass, BaseClass)` to establish the inheritance relationship, identify the prototypes you need to protect.  This *always* includes `SubClass.prototype` and usually `BaseClass.prototype`.
2.  **Apply `Object.freeze()`:** Call `Object.freeze(SubClass.prototype)` and `Object.freeze(BaseClass.prototype)`. This makes these prototypes non-writable, non-configurable, and non-extensible.  This prevents *any* subsequent modification, including adding new properties or changing existing ones.
3.  **Consider `Object.seal()` (Less Secure):** If you *absolutely must* allow modification of existing property *values* on the prototype (but not adding or deleting properties), use `Object.seal()` instead of `Object.freeze()`.  This is less secure, so `Object.freeze()` is strongly preferred.
4.  **Critical Timing:** The timing is crucial.  Apply `Object.freeze()` or `Object.seal()` *immediately* after the `inherits` call and *before* any untrusted code or data can interact with instances of `SubClass` or `BaseClass`.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Prototype Pollution:** (Severity: **Critical**) - This directly prevents prototype pollution on the prototypes that are frozen or sealed.  Since `inherits` sets up the prototype chain, this mitigation is directly tied to its use.  If an attacker tries to modify a frozen prototype, a `TypeError` will be thrown (in strict mode).

**Impact:**
*   **Prototype Pollution:** Risk is eliminated for the frozen/sealed prototypes. This is the most effective mitigation for prototype pollution *specifically* related to the inheritance chain established by `inherits`.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Implemented for the `BaseEntity` class and its direct subclasses (`User`, `Product`). The prototypes are frozen immediately after the `inherits` call.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Missing for the `Comment` class, which inherits from `BaseEntity` indirectly. The intermediate class and `Comment.prototype` are not frozen.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prevent Circular Inheritance (When Using `inherits` Dynamically)](./mitigation_strategies/prevent_circular_inheritance__when_using__inherits__dynamically_.md)

**Description:**
*   **Avoid Dynamic `inherits`:** The *best* mitigation is to avoid using `inherits` dynamically based on untrusted input.  If the inheritance structure is known at development time, define it statically.
*   **Depth-Limited `inherits` (If Dynamic is Unavoidable):** If you *must* use `inherits` dynamically (which is a high-risk pattern), implement a strict depth limit.  This means tracking how many times `inherits` has been called in a chain and throwing an error if a predefined limit is exceeded.  This prevents an attacker from causing a stack overflow by providing input that creates a deeply nested or circular inheritance chain.
    1.  Maintain a counter (e.g., in a closure or a dedicated module) to track the inheritance depth.
    2.  Increment the counter *before* each call to `inherits`.
    3.  Check if the counter exceeds a predefined maximum depth (e.g., 10).
    4.  If the limit is exceeded, throw an error *before* calling `inherits`.
    5.  Decrement the counter after the `inherits` call (in a `finally` block to ensure it's always decremented).

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Circular Inheritance:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents a specific type of DoS attack where an attacker could cause a stack overflow by crafting input that leads to a circular inheritance chain when `inherits` is used dynamically.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Risk is significantly reduced or eliminated, depending on the implementation of the depth limit.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   The application's inheritance structure is defined statically; `inherits` is *not* used dynamically based on any external input.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   No specific missing implementation, as the current design avoids dynamic use of `inherits`. If dynamic usage were introduced, the depth-limiting strategy would be *essential*.
