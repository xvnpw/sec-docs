*   **Attack Vector Category:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that arise from how 'inherits' is used to establish inheritance relationships in the application code. This is the primary high-risk area as it directly relates to the application's logic and design.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium - These vulnerabilities are dependent on coding practices and application design, making them reasonably probable in complex applications using inheritance.
*   **Impact:** High - Successful exploitation can lead to significant security breaches, including unauthorized access, data manipulation, and privilege escalation.
*   **Effort:** Low - Medium - Identifying these vulnerabilities often requires code review and understanding of the application's inheritance structure, which is within the reach of moderately skilled attackers.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires a good understanding of object-oriented programming principles, inheritance, and common coding errors.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Detection requires careful code review, security testing focused on inheritance, and potentially runtime monitoring of application behavior.
