# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, `inherits`, is a Javascript library designed to provide a utility function for prototypal inheritance in Node.js and browser environments.

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Provide a reliable and efficient mechanism for prototypal inheritance in Javascript.
  - Simplify code reuse and maintainability for developers using Javascript.
  - Ensure compatibility across different Javascript environments (Node.js and browsers).
  - Maintain a small footprint and minimal dependencies to avoid bloating projects that use it.

- Most important business risks:
  - Defects in the `inherits` library could introduce bugs into dependent projects, impacting their functionality and reliability.
  - Security vulnerabilities in the `inherits` library, though less likely in a utility library, could be exploited if present, potentially affecting dependent applications.
  - Poor performance of the `inherits` function could negatively impact the performance of applications that rely on it.
  - Lack of maintenance or updates could lead to incompatibility with newer Javascript environments or security issues remaining unpatched.
  - Supply chain risks if the library is compromised during development or distribution.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security controls:
  - security control: Code is hosted on GitHub, providing version control and transparency. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
  - security control: npm registry is used for distribution, providing a standard and widely used distribution channel. (Implemented: npm registry)

- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of GitHub and npm infrastructure.
  - accepted risk: Open source nature means code is publicly accessible, but also auditable.
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing or dedicated security team for this small utility library.

- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (e.g., using GitHub Actions and linters) to detect potential code quality and security issues during development.
  - security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities, even for a small library.
  - security control: Consider signing releases to enhance supply chain security and verify the integrity of the distributed package.

- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a library. Authentication is relevant for the development and publishing process (GitHub, npm).
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a library. Authorization is relevant for controlling access to the repository and publishing rights on npm.
  - Input validation: Not directly applicable as a core requirement for this specific library, as it's a utility function and doesn't directly handle external user input. However, internal input validation within the function itself should be considered for robustness.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to this library, as it does not handle sensitive data or require encryption.

## BUILD

- Build process description:
  The build process for `inherits` is relatively simple, typical for a Javascript library. It likely involves:
  1. Developer writes and tests code locally.
  2. Code is pushed to GitHub repository.
  3. (Potentially) Automated tests run via CI (e.g., GitHub Actions).
  4. Developer manually or via CI publishes the package to npm registry using `npm publish`.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business process:
  - Providing a reliable and functional prototypal inheritance utility for Javascript developers.
  - Ensuring the library is available and accessible through the npm registry.

- Data we are trying to protect:
  - Source code of the `inherits` library.
  - Integrity of the published npm package.

- Data sensitivity:
  - Low to Medium. The source code is publicly available on GitHub. However, maintaining the integrity of the published package is important to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure developers are using a safe and unmodified library. Compromise could lead to malicious code injection into dependent projects.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

  - Question: Is there a dedicated team or individual responsible for the long-term maintenance and security of this library?

- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Assumption: Security considerations are important, but for a small utility library, the focus is on basic secure development practices and supply chain security rather than extensive security features within the library itself.
  - Question: Are there any specific security compliance requirements or industry standards that this library needs to adhere to?
  - Question: Is there a formal process for security vulnerability reporting and response for this library?

- DESIGN:
  - Assumption: The design is intentionally simple and focused on providing a single, well-defined function.
  - Question: Are there any plans to expand the functionality of this library in the future?
  - Question: Are there specific dependencies or compatibility requirements with other libraries or frameworks that need to be considered in the design?
