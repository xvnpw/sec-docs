# Attack Surface Analysis for isaacs/inherits

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Supply Chain Attacks](./attack_surfaces/dependency_supply_chain_attacks.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious actors compromise the `inherits` package on npmjs.com or its distribution channels to inject malicious code.
*   **How `inherits` contributes to the attack surface:** Applications declare a direct dependency on `inherits` in their `package.json`. If a compromised version is published and installed, the malicious code becomes part of the application build and runtime environment.
*   **Example:** A compromised `inherits` package is published. Developers installing or updating dependencies fetch this malicious version. The injected code could execute during installation scripts or be triggered when `inherits` is used within the application, leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of applications using the compromised `inherits` package. This can result in data breaches, service disruption, and severe reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize Package Lock Files:** Commit `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to ensure consistent dependency versions and prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions.
    *   **Implement Regular Dependency Audits:** Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` frequently to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies, including `inherits`, and update promptly.
    *   **Employ Dependency Scanning Tools:** Integrate automated tools that continuously monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities and malicious updates throughout the development lifecycle.
    *   **Consider Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN Delivery (If Applicable):** If `inherits` or bundled code containing it is delivered via CDN, explore using SRI to ensure the integrity of fetched files (though less common for backend dependencies).
    *   **Maintain Awareness of Package Reputation:** Be mindful of the package maintainer's reputation and any unusual changes in package details on npmjs.com.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Inheritance Hierarchies Created Using `inherits` Leading to Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/insecure_inheritance_hierarchies_created_using__inherits__leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Developers, using `inherits` to establish inheritance, design insecure class hierarchies that unintentionally expose sensitive functionality or data, or create complex structures prone to security flaws.
*   **How `inherits` contributes to the attack surface:** `inherits` is the mechanism used to create these inheritance relationships. While not inherently flawed, it enables developers to build structures that can become attack vectors if not designed securely. Incorrect use of `inherits` directly leads to the creation of these potentially vulnerable hierarchies.
*   **Example:** A base class, intended for internal logic, contains methods for privileged operations. A derived class, meant for handling user requests, incorrectly inherits these privileged methods through `inherits`. This could allow an attacker to indirectly access and exploit privileged functionality through the publicly accessible derived class.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive functionality, potential for privilege escalation, information disclosure, and logic flaws that can be exploited to compromise application security.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Apply Secure Inheritance Design Principles:**  Adhere to principles of least privilege and encapsulation when designing inheritance structures. Carefully control which methods and properties are inherited and accessible in derived classes.
    *   **Conduct Thorough Code Reviews Focusing on Inheritance:** Specifically review inheritance hierarchies created with `inherits` to identify potential unintended exposure of sensitive functionality or data.
    *   **Favor Composition Over Inheritance Where Possible:**  Consider using composition instead of inheritance to achieve code reuse and flexibility. Composition often provides better control over access and reduces the risk of unintended exposure through inheritance.
    *   **Ensure Clear Documentation and Developer Training:** Provide clear documentation of inheritance structures and train developers on secure inheritance practices to prevent misuse of `inherits` and the creation of insecure hierarchies.
