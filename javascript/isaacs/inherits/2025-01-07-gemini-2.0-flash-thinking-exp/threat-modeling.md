# Threat Model Analysis for isaacs/inherits

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution via Malicious Constructor](./threats/prototype_pollution_via_malicious_constructor.md)

**Description:** An attacker could influence the constructor functions passed to `inherits`. If the "superConstructor" (the parent) has vulnerabilities that allow setting arbitrary properties on its prototype, and the attacker can control or influence the selection of this superConstructor, they can pollute the prototype of the parent, affecting all inheriting objects. This directly leverages `inherits`' role in establishing the prototype chain.

**Impact:**
*   **Code Injection/Modification:**  Setting malicious properties on the prototype can lead to the execution of unintended code when methods of inheriting objects access or interact with these properties.
*   **Denial of Service:** Modifying critical prototype properties can cause application crashes or unexpected behavior.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Attackers might be able to add properties to the prototype that expose sensitive information.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  If authentication logic relies on properties that can be manipulated through prototype pollution, an attacker might bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Which `inherits` component is affected:** The core functionality of `inherits` which modifies the `prototype` property of the "constructor" argument based on the "superConstructor".

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input or configuration that determines which constructors are used with `inherits`.
*   **Trusted Sources for Constructors:** Ensure that both the constructor and superConstructor used with `inherits` originate from trusted and well-vetted sources.
*   **Object Freezing:**  Consider freezing the prototypes of critical constructors after they are defined.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Limit the ability of untrusted code or users to influence the selection of constructors used with `inherits`.

## Threat: [Accidental or Malicious Overriding of Parent Properties/Methods](./threats/accidental_or_malicious_overriding_of_parent_propertiesmethods.md)

**Description:** When a constructor inherits using `inherits`, it can define properties or methods with the same name as those in its parent's prototype. An attacker with control over the code defining the inheriting constructor could intentionally override critical methods or properties of the parent, altering the intended behavior. This directly exploits how `inherits` sets up the prototype chain, allowing shadowing of parent properties.

**Impact:**
*   **Logic Errors:** Accidental overriding can introduce subtle bugs and unexpected behavior.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** Malicious overriding can be used to bypass security checks or alter the intended behavior of critical functions.
*   **Data Corruption:** Overriding methods responsible for data manipulation could lead to data corruption.

**Which `inherits` component is affected:** The mechanism by which `inherits` establishes the prototype chain, allowing the inheriting constructor to define properties that shadow those of the parent.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Clear Naming Conventions:**  Adopt consistent and descriptive naming conventions for properties and methods.
*   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential instances of accidental or malicious overriding.
*   **Linters and Static Analysis:**  Utilize linters and static analysis tools to detect potential naming conflicts.
*   **Documentation:**  Clearly document the inheritance structure and the purpose of each method and property.

## Threat: [Inheritance from a Compromised or Vulnerable Parent Constructor](./threats/inheritance_from_a_compromised_or_vulnerable_parent_constructor.md)

**Description:** If the "superConstructor" passed to `inherits` itself has vulnerabilities (e.g., prototype pollution vulnerabilities), these vulnerabilities can be inherited by the child constructor through the prototype chain established by `inherits`. An attacker could then exploit these inherited vulnerabilities through instances of the child constructor.

**Impact:**
*   **Inherited Vulnerabilities:** The application becomes susceptible to vulnerabilities present in the parent constructor's prototype chain.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** If the compromised parent constructor comes from a third-party library, this represents a supply chain attack vector.

**Which `inherits` component is affected:** The core functionality of `inherits` that establishes the prototype chain by linking the `constructor.prototype` to an instance of the `superConstructor`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Careful Dependency Management:**  Thoroughly vet all third-party libraries and dependencies used as parent constructors with `inherits`.
*   **Security Scanning of Dependencies:**  Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   **Principle of Least Trust:**  Exercise caution when inheriting from constructors in external or untrusted code.
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep all dependencies involved in the inheritance chain up-to-date.
