# Attack Tree Analysis for isaacs/inherits

Objective: Execute arbitrary code within the application or manipulate its core logic by exploiting vulnerabilities related to the `inherits` library.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Application via inherits [CRITICAL]
*   Exploit Prototype Manipulation [CRITICAL]
    *   Direct Prototype Pollution [CRITICAL]
        *   Vulnerability in Application Code Directly Modifying Prototypes (High-Risk Path)
        *   Vulnerability in a Dependency Allowing Prototype Pollution (High-Risk Path) [CRITICAL]
    *   Indirect Prototype Pollution via Inherited Properties (High-Risk Path)
    *   Overriding Inherited Methods with Malicious Implementations (High-Risk Path)
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via inherits [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_inherits__critical_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this level signifies a complete breach of the application's security through vulnerabilities related to the `inherits` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Prototype Manipulation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_prototype_manipulation__critical_.md)

*   This represents the core attack strategy targeting the fundamental mechanism of `inherits`: prototype inheritance. By manipulating prototypes, attackers can alter the behavior of objects throughout the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Direct Prototype Pollution [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/direct_prototype_pollution__critical_.md)

*   This involves directly modifying the prototype of an object, often `Object.prototype` or constructor prototypes. This can have widespread and often unintended consequences, affecting all objects inheriting from the polluted prototype.

    *   **Vulnerability in Application Code Directly Modifying Prototypes (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  The application code itself contains flaws that allow an attacker to directly modify object prototypes. This could occur through:
            *   Using bracket notation with user-controlled keys to set properties on constructor prototypes.
            *   Poorly designed plugin systems that allow direct access to prototype modification.
            *   Developer errors leading to unintended prototype modifications.
        *   **Consequences:**  Attackers can inject malicious properties or methods into the prototype chain. These injected properties or methods will then be available to all objects inheriting from the modified prototype, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or manipulation of application logic.

    *   **Vulnerability in a Dependency Allowing Prototype Pollution (High-Risk Path) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** A third-party library used by the application contains a prototype pollution vulnerability.
        *   **Consequences:**  Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to pollute the prototypes of objects used by the application. Since `inherits` establishes prototype chains, pollution in a dependency can affect constructors that use `inherits`, leading to similar consequences as direct prototype pollution in application code. This is a critical node because dependency vulnerabilities are a common attack vector and can have a broad impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Indirect Prototype Pollution via Inherited Properties (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/indirect_prototype_pollution_via_inherited_properties__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Instead of directly modifying prototypes, the application logic copies user-controlled data to properties of objects that are part of an inheritance chain. If these properties are later accessed through the prototype chain, the attacker can effectively "pollute" the prototype indirectly.
*   **Consequences:**  By controlling the data copied to these inherited properties, attackers can overwrite critical values in parent or child prototypes. This can lead to unexpected application behavior, logic flaws, or even the introduction of malicious data that is later used in sensitive operations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overriding Inherited Methods with Malicious Implementations (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/overriding_inherited_methods_with_malicious_implementations__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify critical methods defined in parent prototypes that are inherited by child objects. They then find a way to modify the parent or child prototype to replace the original method with a malicious implementation.
*   **Consequences:** When instances of the child constructor call the overridden method, the attacker's malicious code will be executed instead of the intended functionality. This can allow attackers to bypass security checks, execute arbitrary code, or manipulate application logic in a targeted way.
