## Combined Vulnerability List

This document combines the following vulnerabilities into a single list, removing any duplicates and standardizing the format.

### 1. Hardcoded Godot download URL in CI script

- **Vulnerability Name:** Hardcoded Godot download URL in CI script
- **Description:** The CI script for continuous integration downloads the Godot Engine from a hardcoded URL without integrity checks. An attacker who compromises the download source or performs a man-in-the-middle attack could replace the legitimate Godot binary with a malicious one. This malicious binary would then be used in the CI process to build and test the Godot Tools extension.
- **Impact:** Compromise of the CI environment. If a malicious Godot binary is injected, it could potentially compromise the built extension, leading to a supply chain attack where users of the extension could be affected. This could allow for arbitrary code execution on developer machines or in user's VSCode environments if the malicious code is embedded in the extension.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently implemented mitigations:** None. The download URLs for Godot are hardcoded in the CI script without any integrity checks.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Implement integrity checks for downloaded Godot binaries using checksums or digital signatures. Verify these checksums or signatures against a trusted source before using the binary in the CI process.
    - Use a more robust and secure method for managing dependencies and tools in the CI environment, such as a package manager or a dedicated tool version management system that includes integrity verification.
    - Regularly review and update the download URLs and the source of the Godot binaries to ensure they are still trustworthy and secure.
- **Preconditions:** None. The vulnerability exists in the CI configuration and is triggered every time the CI workflow is executed.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - File: `/code/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
    - The CI script contains steps to download Godot Engine for Linux, macOS, and Windows.
    - For example, the Linux step uses the following commands:
        ```yaml
        - name: Install Godot (Ubuntu)
          if: matrix.os == 'ubuntu-latest'
          run: |
            wget https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/4.3-stable/Godot_v4.3-stable_linux.x86_64.zip
            unzip Godot_v4.3-stable_linux.x86_64.zip
            sudo mv Godot_v4.3-stable_linux.x86_64 /usr/local/bin/godot
            chmod +x /usr/local/bin/godot
        ```
    - Similar hardcoded URLs are used for macOS and Windows.
    - The `wget`, `curl`, and `Invoke-WebRequest` commands download the Godot binaries from `https://github.com/godotengine/godot/releases/download/4.3-stable/`.
    - There is no verification of the downloaded files' integrity (e.g., checksum verification) after downloading.
    - An attacker compromising `github.com`, the `godotengine/godot` repository, or performing a man-in-the-middle attack could replace the legitimate Godot binary hosted at these URLs with a malicious executable.
    - Because the CI script directly executes the downloaded binary (`godot --import ...`, `npm test`), a malicious binary could compromise the CI environment.
- **Security test case:**
    1. Set up a local testing environment that mimics the GitHub Actions CI environment.
    2. Modify the host file or network configuration to redirect the hardcoded Godot download URLs (e.g., `github.com`) to a local malicious server.
    3. Host a malicious Godot binary on the local malicious server, making it accessible via the redirected URLs.
    4. Run the CI workflow (e.g., by triggering a `push` or `pull_request` in a test repository with the modified `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file).
    5. Observe the CI execution logs to confirm that the CI script attempts to download Godot from the redirected malicious server.
    6. Verify that the malicious Godot binary is downloaded and used in subsequent CI steps.
    7. Further, to confirm the impact, the malicious Godot binary could be designed to execute a benign command (e.g., `touch /tmp/ci_compromised`) upon execution. Check for the execution of this command in the CI environment after the test run to confirm successful injection and execution of the malicious binary.

### 2. Command Injection via Unsanitized Exec Flags

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via Unsanitized Exec Flags
- **Description:**
    - The extension allows users to configure the command line used to launch the Godot editor via an “Exec Flags” template (for example, `{project} --goto {file}:{line}:{col}`).
    - An attacker can craft a malicious Godot project by embedding shell metacharacter sequences (such as `;` or `&&`) in file names or project metadata.
    - When the extension substitutes these placeholders without properly escaping the input, the resulting command line may contain injected commands.
    - When the user triggers the command (e.g., “Open workspace with Godot editor”), the unsanitized input is passed to the shell and can lead to execution of arbitrary commands.
- **Impact:**
    - Exploitation can result in Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user’s machine.
    - An attacker could run arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the VS Code process, potentially compromising system integrity and accessing sensitive data.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - No explicit safeguards or input‐sanitization measures are present in the configuration documentation; the Exec Flags are simply populated with user/project values.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input validation and proper sanitization/escaping for values substituted into the Exec Flags template.
    - Use of secure process-spawning APIs that pass arguments as separate parameters (thus avoiding shell interpretation).
    - Code reviews or static analysis enforcement to ensure that command-line construction does not introduce injection flaws.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user opens a Godot project that has been maliciously crafted (e.g., file names or project names containing shell metacharacters).
    - The user’s Exec Flags configuration is left as configured (without additional local sanitization).
- **Source code analysis:**
    - **Step 1:** The README and configuration guidelines instruct users to set Exec Flags which include placeholders (e.g., `{project}`, `{file}`).
    - **Step 2:** When a project is opened, these placeholders are replaced with values derived directly from project metadata.
    - **Step 3:** If these values include characters like `;` or `&&` and no escaping is applied, the final command string is passed to a system shell.
    - **Visualization:**
      - _User-controlled Input_ → _Placeholder substitution in Exec Flags_ → _Unsanitized command string_ → _Shell command execution_
- **Security test case:**
    - Create a Godot project that includes a malicious project name such as:
      `ValidProjectName; echo hacked;`
    - Configure the extension’s Exec Flags using the default template.
    - Open the malicious project in Visual Studio Code and invoke the “Open workspace with Godot editor” command.
    - Monitor the command output or system logs to verify if the injected command (e.g., `echo hacked`) executes.
    - Confirm that arbitrary commands run in the shell, demonstrating successful exploitation of the vulnerability.

### 3. Cross‐Site Scripting (XSS) in Documentation Webview

- **Vulnerability Name:** Cross‐Site Scripting (XSS) in Documentation Webview
- **Description:**
    - The extension renders documentation (including native symbols and GDScript comments) inside an internal webview by converting markdown or structured text to HTML.
    - If the conversion process does not thoroughly sanitize the input, any malicious HTML or JavaScript embedded (for example, in a doc‑comment) can be rendered and executed.
    - An attacker can distribute a Godot project that contains malicious documentation content designed to execute scripts when viewed.
    - When a user opens such a project with the extension active, the webview displays the unsanitized HTML and the embedded script executes.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can achieve arbitrary script execution within the VS Code context.
    - This may lead to exfiltration of sensitive information, session hijacking, or further compromise of the host environment.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - Although documentation rendering improvements and a dedicated webview renderer were introduced (see CHANGELOG version 2.0.0), there is no clear evidence that robust sanitization (or a strict Content Security Policy) is applied.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Implementation of robust HTML sanitization on all markdown-to-HTML conversion outputs.
    - Enforcing a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) within the webview to block inline scripts and disallow dangerous tags.
    - Escaping or filtering any user-controlled content before it is rendered in the webview.
- **Preconditions:**
    - A Godot project contains maliciously crafted documentation or doc-comments that include executable HTML/JavaScript.
    - The user loads this project into VS Code and the extension processes the content without appropriate sanitization.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - **Step 1:** The README and CHANGELOG indicate that a webview renderer is used to display documentation.
    - **Step 2:** The renderer likely converts markdown (or similar structured text) into HTML, which is then injected into the webview.
    - **Step 3:** In the absence of proper sanitization measures, any malicious embedded scripts in the markdown pass through and become active.
    - **Visualization:**
      - _Malicious Markdown (from project)_ → _Markdown-to-HTML conversion (without sanitization)_ → _HTML injected into webview_ → _Execution of embedded scripts_
- **Security test case:**
    - Develop a Godot project that includes a GDScript file with a doc-comment containing malicious HTML, for example:
      `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
    - Open this project in Visual Studio Code with the Godot Tools extension installed.
    - Use the extension to open the documentation viewer for the native symbol or code element affected.
    - Observe whether the alert box appears (or if any JavaScript runs), which would indicate that the malicious script was executed.
    - Document the findings to prove that unsanitized input can lead to XSS.
