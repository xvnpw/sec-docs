*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Media Metadata**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the metadata of a video file (e.g., within MP4 atoms or HLS manifests). When video.js parses and renders this metadata, the injected script executes in the user's browser.
    *   **How video.js Contributes:** video.js is responsible for parsing and rendering the metadata associated with the video source. If it doesn't properly sanitize or escape this data, it can become a vector for XSS.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor uploads a video file with a crafted title tag containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When a user views the video, video.js displays the title, executing the script.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the user's session, including stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Sanitization:**  Sanitize or strip potentially malicious HTML tags and JavaScript from video metadata before it's served to the client.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be executed.
        *   **Regularly Update video.js:** Ensure you are using the latest version of video.js, as updates often include security fixes.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Subtitle Files**
    *   **Description:** Attackers craft malicious subtitle files (e.g., VTT or SRT) containing JavaScript code. When video.js renders these subtitles, the embedded script executes in the user's browser.
    *   **How video.js Contributes:** video.js handles the parsing and rendering of subtitle files. If it doesn't properly sanitize the content of these files, it can be exploited for XSS.
    *   **Example:** A malicious subtitle file contains a line like `<v tt="&lt;script&gt;alert('XSS')&lt;/script&gt;">`. When video.js renders this subtitle, the script executes.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session, similar to metadata XSS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Sanitization:** Sanitize subtitle files before serving them to the client, removing or escaping potentially harmful content.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  While CSP can help, it might not fully mitigate subtitle-based XSS depending on the implementation.
        *   **Careful Handling of User-Provided Subtitles:** If users can upload subtitles, implement strict validation and sanitization.

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via User-Provided Video URLs**
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to provide video URLs, a malicious user can input URLs pointing to internal resources or unintended external targets. When video.js attempts to load these URLs, it can trigger requests from the server hosting the application.
    *   **How video.js Contributes:** video.js is instructed to fetch and load the video content from the provided URL. It doesn't inherently validate the safety or intended destination of the URL.
    *   **Example:** A user provides a video URL like `http://localhost:8080/admin/delete_all_data`. If the server hosting the application can access this internal endpoint without proper authentication checks, video.js's attempt to load the "video" will trigger the unintended action.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of internal services, access to sensitive data, or triggering unintended actions on internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **URL Whitelisting:**  Maintain a strict whitelist of allowed video source domains or protocols.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate user-provided URLs to ensure they conform to expected formats and don't point to internal or restricted resources.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the application server from internal resources that should not be directly accessible.
