- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via vetur.config.js
  - **Description:**
    Vetur lets users override its settings (and even define project boundaries) by placing a JavaScript configuration file (typically named vetur.config.js) in the workspace. The extension loads this file by simply calling Node’s built‑in “require” function and merging its returned object into its runtime settings without any sandboxing or input validation. An attacker who can persuade a user to open a project containing a malicious vetur.config.js can therefore execute arbitrary code in the VS Code extension host (and by extension, on the user’s machine).
    _Step‑by‑step triggering:_
    1. An adversary creates (or commits to an untrusted external repository) a vetur.config.js file containing malicious JavaScript (for example, code that writes files, spawns subprocesses, or exfiltrates data).
    2. The user (or organization) opens this project in VS Code with Vetur enabled.
    3. During extension initialization, Vetur loads and “executes” the vetur.config.js as part of the configuration merge process.
    4. The malicious payload executes in the context of the extension host, compromising the development environment.
  - **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation could give the attacker full remote code execution in the developer’s local environment. This might lead to data exfiltration, installation of malware, or complete control over the system running the extension.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Vetur’s design assumes that the project workspace is trusted. In modern versions of VS Code the built‑in “workspace trust” feature may warn users before opening an untrusted project.
    - Documentation in the repository and configuration references warn users to set up projects only from trusted sources.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no internal sandboxing or isolation for vetur.config.js—the file is loaded as plain JavaScript without any validation or safe‑execution mechanism.
    - No built‑in checks exist to sanitize or restrict what configuration files may do.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user (or a corporate development environment) opens a project that includes a vetur.config.js file supplied by an untrusted or malicious source.
    - The user either has not enabled or is bypassing the VS Code workspace trust security prompt.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The project’s documentation in “docs/reference/Readme.md” shows examples of vetur.config.js where the file is required (via Node’s CommonJS “module.exports”) and its properties are merged directly into Vetur’s runtime configuration using (for example) lodash’s merge function.
    - There is no indication of any sandbox layer, validation function, or other isolation mechanism that would prevent arbitrary code in the config file from executing.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a minimal test repository containing a vetur.config.js file with a clearly malicious payload (for instance, code that creates a file in a known location or spawns a harmless command whose side‑effect can be observed).
    2. Open the repository in VS Code with Vetur installed (and with workspace trust either disabled or overridden).
    3. Observe that the malicious code executes (e.g. the expected file is created or output is produced), thus proving that arbitrary code execution is possible via vetur.config.js.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposed Debug Port in the Vue Language Server
  - **Description:**
    For performance profiling and debugging purposes, the Vetur project (via the Vue Language Server, or VLS) allows configuration of a debug port by setting a parameter (e.g. “vetur.dev.vlsPort”). The documentation in the “.github/PERF_ISSUE.md” file explains that when this setting is enabled, one may connect to the VLS using Chrome’s “chrome://inspect” interface. If a developer inadvertently (or due to mis‑configuration) binds this debug port to a publicly accessible network interface (for example, binding to 0.0.0.0 rather than localhost), then an external attacker may connect to the debugging endpoint.
    _Step‑by‑step triggering:_
    1. A user or remote developer enables the VLS debugging port via “vetur.dev.vlsPort” and (mistakenly) allows the port to be open on a non‑loopback interface.
    2. An external attacker scans for open ports and locates this debug endpoint.
    3. The attacker connects to the debug endpoint using a debugger client, potentially triggering debug commands or reading internal state.
    4. The attacker leverages the debugging access to either disrupt the language server’s operation or execute arbitrary debug commands.
  - **Impact:**
    Exposure of the debug port could result in unauthorized access to internal state information from the language server (such as project configuration, file contents, or even code that might be used in code completions). In a worst‑case scenario, it could be used as a stepping‑stone toward remote code execution via the debugger interface.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The debug port feature is not enabled by default and is intended only for controlled non‑production (local development) use.
    - The documentation explicitly instructs users to use the feature only for profiling and testing.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - VLS does not enforce that the debug port listens only on localhost (127.0.0.1); no access control is implemented to block external network access.
    - There is no authentication, IP‑whitelisting, or secure tunneling applied to the debug interface.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The “vetur.dev.vlsPort” setting is enabled and mis‑configured so that the VLS binds to a public interface.
    - The system running Vetur is publicly accessible on that network interface (for example, in a remote development or cloud IDE scenario).
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The “.github/PERF_ISSUE.md” file provides instructions to set a debug port without any restrictions on network binding.
    - No evidence is found (in these documentation and configuration files) that the debug port is bound exclusively to localhost or that any protective measures (such as authentication) are employed.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a test environment, enable “vetur.dev.vlsPort” in the developer settings and deliberately bind the port to an interface that is accessible from the external network (for example, 0.0.0.0).
    2. From a separate machine, scan for open ports and verify that the VLS debug port is visible.
    3. Use a remote debugger (or simply try to initiate a debugging session via Chrome’s “chrome://inspect”) to connect to the exposed port and observe that internal state information (or debug prompts) are made available.
    4. Confirm that the exposure of this interface could allow an attacker to interact with the language server.
