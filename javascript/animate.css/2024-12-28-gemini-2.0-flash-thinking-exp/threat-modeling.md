### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving animate.css

Here's a list of high and critical threats directly involving the animate.css library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious CSS Injection via `animate.css` Class Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the application's logic to directly manipulate the CSS classes applied to HTML elements, specifically targeting and misusing the classes provided by `animate.css`. This involves injecting or modifying class names to achieve unintended visual effects *through the animate.css library*. For example, an attacker might inject a class sequence that, when interpreted by `animate.css`, hides critical information or displays misleading content in a way that leverages the library's animation capabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Defacement of the user interface, display of misleading information, potential for social engineering attacks by creating fake UI elements or overlays that are animated using `animate.css`.
    *   **Affected animate.css Component:** The core CSS classes defined in `animate.css` (e.g., `animate__animated`, `animate__fadeIn`, etc.) and how the application's code allows for their manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to control the sources of CSS and prevent inline styles.
        *   Sanitize and validate any user-provided input that directly influences the application of `animate.css` classes.
        *   Carefully control how and where `animate.css` classes are dynamically added or modified in the application's JavaScript code.
        *   Regularly review the application's code for potential vulnerabilities that allow for unintended manipulation of CSS classes, especially those from `animate.css`.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Excessive Animation Usage
    *   **Description:** An attacker could intentionally trigger a large number of resource-intensive animations provided by `animate.css` simultaneously or repeatedly. This could be achieved by manipulating the application's state or sending malicious requests specifically designed to overload the user's browser with complex `animate.css` animations. For instance, an attacker might script the rapid addition and removal of multiple visually demanding `animate.css` classes on numerous elements.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unusable for legitimate users due to extreme performance degradation or browser crashes, leading to frustration and potential loss of productivity or business.
    *   **Affected animate.css Component:** All animation classes within `animate.css` that trigger visual changes and consume significant browser resources (e.g., complex transformations, opacity changes on many elements).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium (While potentially high impact, the direct involvement of `animate.css` as the sole vulnerability might be less frequent than broader DoS attacks)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on actions that trigger animations, especially those involving multiple elements or complex animations from `animate.css`.
        *   Avoid triggering a large number of complex `animate.css` animations simultaneously based on user input or external events.
        *   Carefully consider the performance implications of using certain `animate.css` animations and avoid overuse.
        *   Implement client-side checks to prevent excessive animation triggers before they are processed.
