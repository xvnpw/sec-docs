## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines the identified vulnerabilities, combining information from the provided lists and removing duplicates. Each vulnerability is detailed in its own section, covering description, impact, rank, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, and a security test case.

### Vulnerability 1: Command Injection via `jest.shell` setting

- **Description:**
    - Step 1: An attacker gains the ability to influence the `jest.shell` setting, for example by tricking a user into importing a malicious workspace configuration or through a more complex settings injection vulnerability.
    - Step 2: The attacker sets the `jest.shell` setting to a malicious command, such as `"bash -c 'touch /tmp/pwned && '"`. This crafted setting is designed to execute the `touch /tmp/pwned` command before the intended jest command.
    - Step 3: The user triggers a test run within the workspace using any of the extension's features, such as running all tests via the "Jest: Run All Tests" command.
    - Step 4: When the extension executes the jest command, it unsafely incorporates the malicious `jest.shell` setting, leading to the execution of the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` alongside the intended jest command.
    - Step 5: The attacker verifies the successful command injection by checking for the existence of the `/tmp/pwned` file, which would be created if the injected command was executed.
- **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the user's system. This vulnerability could allow an attacker to perform various malicious actions, including but not limited to:
    - Data exfiltration: Stealing sensitive information from the user's file system.
    - Malware installation: Installing malware or backdoors on the user's machine.
    - System compromise: Gaining complete control over the user's system.
    - Denial of Service (indirect):  While direct DoS is excluded, command injection could be used to perform resource-intensive operations, indirectly leading to system slowdown or unresponsiveness.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. Based on the documentation, there is no indication of input sanitization or validation for the `jest.shell` setting, nor any mentioned safeguards against command injection in the context of shell command execution.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Sanitization: Implement robust sanitization and validation for the `jest.shell` setting to prevent the injection of malicious commands. Restrict allowed characters and patterns, or ideally, avoid using user-provided strings directly in shell command construction.
    - Parameterized Execution: Refactor the command execution logic to utilize parameterized methods like `childProcess.spawn` with separate arguments array, which inherently prevents shell injection by avoiding shell interpretation of the command string.
    - Security Code Review: Conduct a thorough security code review of all modules involved in command execution, particularly where user-provided settings like `jest.shell` are incorporated, to identify and rectify any potential command injection vulnerabilities.
    - Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure the extension operates with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential damage from successful command injection.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have a way to influence the `jest.shell` configuration setting. This could be achieved if:
        - The user imports a workspace configuration file from an untrusted source that contains a malicious `jest.shell` setting.
        - There is another vulnerability in VS Code or a related extension that allows for the injection or modification of workspace settings.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - (Hypothetical Scenario): Assuming the extension's source code includes a section that constructs and executes shell commands using the `jest.shell` setting without proper sanitization. For instance, if the code directly concatenates the `jest.shell` string with the jest command and uses a function like `childProcess.exec` to run it, this would create a command injection vulnerability.

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical vulnerable code snippet
    const vscode = require('vscode');
    const childProcess = require('child_process');

    function runJestTests() {
        const shellSetting = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('jest').get('shell');
        const jestCommand = 'node_modules/.bin/jest --no-cache'; // Example Jest command

        // Vulnerable command construction - unsafe concatenation
        const commandToExecute = `${shellSetting} ${jestCommand}`;

        childProcess.exec(commandToExecute, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
            if (error) {
                console.error(`Execution error: ${error}`);
                return;
            }
            console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
            console.error(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
        });
    }
    ```

    - In this hypothetical code, if `shellSetting` is set to `"bash -c 'malicious_command && '"`, the `commandToExecute` would become `"bash -c 'malicious_command && ' node_modules/.bin/jest --no-cache"`. When `childProcess.exec` is called, the shell interprets the entire string, executing `malicious_command` before attempting to run jest.

- **Security Test Case:**
    - Step 1: Open Visual Studio Code with a workspace where the vscode-jest extension is activated.
    - Step 2: Modify the workspace settings to set a malicious `jest.shell` command. This can be done by editing the `.vscode/settings.json` file in the workspace and adding or modifying the jest.shell setting as follows:

    ```json
    {
        "jest.shell": "bash -c 'touch /tmp/vscode_jest_pwned && '"
    }
    ```

    - Step 3: Trigger a Jest test run using the extension. For example, use the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P) and execute "Jest: Run All Tests".
    - Step 4: After the test run completes (or even if it fails due to the injected command), open a terminal in your system (outside of VS Code if necessary).
    - Step 5: Check if the file `/tmp/vscode_jest_pwned` exists using the command `ls -l /tmp/vscode_jest_pwned`.
    - Step 6: If the file `/tmp/vscode_jest_pwned` exists, this confirms that the command injected via the `jest.shell` setting was successfully executed, demonstrating a command injection vulnerability.

### Vulnerability 2: Unpinned GitHub Actions in CI Workflows

- **Description:**
    The repository’s Continuous Integration (CI) configuration files (located in the “.github/workflows” folder) reference third‑party GitHub Actions using floating tags (for example, “@master”). Specifically, files such as “.github/workflows/stale.yml” reference
    • `rokroskar/workflow-run-cleanup-action@master`
    and “.github/workflows/node-ci.yml” references
    • `coverallsapp/github-action@master`
    Rather than pinning these actions to a specific release version or commit hash, the floating references automatically pull in whatever commit is current on the master branch of each action’s repository. An external attacker who is able to compromise (or maliciously update) one of those upstream repositories could inject arbitrary code that runs during every CI build triggered on the public repository. This would allow the attacker to (for example) exfiltrate secrets or otherwise compromise the build process.

  - **Impact:**
    An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could achieve arbitrary code execution inside the CI environment. This may lead to:
    • Leakage of sensitive information (for example, CI secrets or tokens)
    • Compromise of the build outputs and artifacts
    • A broader supply‑chain compromise that undermines the overall integrity of the extension’s build and test process

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The repository does use versioned references for some actions (for example, “actions/checkout@v2” and “actions/setup‑node@v2”), but the specific third‑party actions listed above are still referenced via the floating “@master” tag.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Pin all third‑party GitHub Actions (especially those not maintained directly by the VS Code or GitHub teams) to an explicit commit hash or a fixed, well‑versioned release tag instead of a floating branch reference.
    • Implement a review process (or use automated tools) to verify that the exact pinned versions are safe and unchanged.

  - **Preconditions:**
    • The repository’s CI workflows run on every push/PR on public branches.
    • The floating “@master” references cause the GitHub runner to automatically fetch the latest commit from the upstream repository.
    • An attacker must either compromise or intentionally update the master branch of one of the referenced third‑party actions.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    • In “.github/workflows/stale.yml”, the workflow uses:
    ```yaml
    uses: rokroskar/workflow-run-cleanup-action@master
    ```
    • In “.github/workflows/node-ci.yml”, the workflow uses:
    ```yaml
    uses: coverallsapp/github-action@master
    ```
    These lines show that the repository depends on the latest commit from the master branch of these actions. Floating tags like “@master” are inherently unpinned and could point to any future commit (or even a malicious change) once pushed upstream. There is no additional logic or safeguard present in the workflows to restrict the version being used.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled test environment (or using a forked version of the repository), modify one of the affected GitHub Actions (for example, create a test fork of “coverallsapp/github-action” and update its master branch to include an identifiable malicious payload, such as writing a “compromised.txt” file).
    2. Update the CI workflow temporarily to reference your test action (for example, replace “@master” with your fork’s “@master”).
    3. Trigger a CI build by making a commit to the repository.
    4. Observe the CI logs and outputs. If the malicious payload executes (e.g., the “compromised.txt” file is created or logged messages indicate execution of the injected code), this demonstrates that the floating reference allowed arbitrary code to run.
    5. Document the findings and conclude that pinning the actions to a fixed revision prevents this attack vector.
