- **Vulnerability Name:** Unpinned GitHub Actions in CI Workflows

  - **Description:**
    The repository’s Continuous Integration (CI) configuration files (located in the “.github/workflows” folder) reference third‑party GitHub Actions using floating tags (for example, “@master”). Specifically, files such as “.github/workflows/stale.yml” reference
    • `rokroskar/workflow-run-cleanup-action@master`
    and “.github/workflows/node-ci.yml” references
    • `coverallsapp/github-action@master`
    Rather than pinning these actions to a specific release version or commit hash, the floating references automatically pull in whatever commit is current on the master branch of each action’s repository. An external attacker who is able to compromise (or maliciously update) one of those upstream repositories could inject arbitrary code that runs during every CI build triggered on the public repository. This would allow the attacker to (for example) exfiltrate secrets or otherwise compromise the build process.

  - **Impact:**
    An attacker exploiting this vulnerability could achieve arbitrary code execution inside the CI environment. This may lead to:
    • Leakage of sensitive information (for example, CI secrets or tokens)
    • Compromise of the build outputs and artifacts
    • A broader supply‑chain compromise that undermines the overall integrity of the extension’s build and test process

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The repository does use versioned references for some actions (for example, “actions/checkout@v2” and “actions/setup‑node@v2”), but the specific third‑party actions listed above are still referenced via the floating “@master” tag.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • Pin all third‑party GitHub Actions (especially those not maintained directly by the VS Code or GitHub teams) to an explicit commit hash or a fixed, well‑versioned release tag instead of a floating branch reference.
    • Implement a review process (or use automated tools) to verify that the exact pinned versions are safe and unchanged.

  - **Preconditions:**
    • The repository’s CI workflows run on every push/PR on public branches.
    • The floating “@master” references cause the GitHub runner to automatically fetch the latest commit from the upstream repository.
    • An attacker must either compromise or intentionally update the master branch of one of the referenced third‑party actions.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    • In “.github/workflows/stale.yml”, the workflow uses:
    ```yaml
    uses: rokroskar/workflow-run-cleanup-action@master
    ```
    • In “.github/workflows/node-ci.yml”, the workflow uses:
    ```yaml
    uses: coverallsapp/github-action@master
    ```
    These lines show that the repository depends on the latest commit from the master branch of these actions. Floating tags like “@master” are inherently unpinned and could point to any future commit (or even a malicious change) once pushed upstream. There is no additional logic or safeguard present in the workflows to restrict the version being used.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled test environment (or using a forked version of the repository), modify one of the affected GitHub Actions (for example, create a test fork of “coverallsapp/github-action” and update its master branch to include an identifiable malicious payload, such as writing a “compromised.txt” file).
    2. Update the CI workflow temporarily to reference your test action (for example, replace “@master” with your fork’s “@master”).
    3. Trigger a CI build by making a commit to the repository.
    4. Observe the CI logs and outputs. If the malicious payload executes (e.g., the “compromised.txt” file is created or logged messages indicate execution of the injected code), this demonstrates that the floating reference allowed arbitrary code to run.
    5. Document the findings and conclude that pinning the actions to a fixed revision prevents this attack vector.
