# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for veged/coa

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Type Validation and Whitelisting](./mitigation_strategies/strict_type_validation_and_whitelisting.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Argument Types:** For each command-line option, determine the expected data type (e.g., number, string, boolean, array, a specific set of strings).
2.  **Use `coa` Type Definitions:** Within the `coa` command definition, use the appropriate type specifiers:
    *   `Number`: For numerical values.
    *   `String`: For string values (but *always* with additional validation, see below).
    *   `Boolean`: For true/false flags.
    *   `Array`: For options that accept multiple values.
    *   `val([...])`: For options with a limited set of allowed values (whitelisting). Define the allowed values explicitly within the array. Example: `cmd.opt().name('level').val(['debug', 'info', 'warn', 'error'])`.
3.  **Custom Validation Functions (`val()`):** For string arguments, *always* implement a custom validation function using `coa`'s `val()` method. This function should:
    *   **Check for Dangerous Characters:** Reject the input if it contains characters commonly used in command injection attacks (`;`, `|`, `&`, `$`, `()`, backticks, etc.). *Do not* attempt to sanitize; reject outright.
    *   **Enforce Length Limits:** Set a reasonable maximum length for the string to prevent potential denial-of-service issues.
    *   **Pattern Matching (if applicable):** If the string is expected to follow a specific pattern (e.g., a filename, an email address), use regular expressions to validate the format.
4.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test the application with various valid and invalid inputs to ensure the type validation and whitelisting are working correctly.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Command Injection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious commands by ensuring that argument values conform to expected types and do not contain dangerous characters.  This is mitigated *at the parsing stage*, making it harder for malicious input to reach command execution.
*   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):** Limits the length of string arguments, reducing the risk of excessive resource consumption during parsing.
*   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):** Ensures that arguments are interpreted correctly by the application, preventing unintended actions.

**Impact:**
*   **Command Injection:** Significantly reduces the risk. Proper type validation and whitelisting *within `coa`* are crucial first steps.
*   **Denial of Service:** Reduces the risk.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **(Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project):** Type validation for numerical options is implemented in `src/commands/processData.js`. Whitelisting for the `--log-level` option is implemented in `src/commands/startServer.js`. Custom validation function for filename arguments is *partially* implemented in `src/utils/validation.js` (lacks character blacklist).

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **(Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project):** Custom validation functions are missing for several string arguments, including `--user-input` in `src/commands/runTask.js` and `--config-file` in `src/config.js`. The existing validation function in `src/utils/validation.js` needs to be expanded to include a blacklist of dangerous characters. Whitelisting is not used consistently for options with a limited set of valid values.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Conditional Validation (Cross-Option Validation)](./mitigation_strategies/conditional_validation__cross-option_validation_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Option Dependencies:** Analyze the command-line options and identify any dependencies or conflicts between them. For example:
    *   Mutually exclusive options (e.g., `--verbose` and `--quiet`).
    *   Options that require other options to be set (e.g., `--output-file` requires `--process`).
    *   Options that modify the behavior of other options (e.g., `--dry-run`).
2.  **Implement `apply()` Function:** Use `coa`'s `apply()` method to create a function that performs cross-option validation.
3.  **Check for Incompatibilities:** Within the `apply()` function, write code to check for invalid combinations of options.
4.  **Throw Errors:** If an invalid combination is detected, throw an error or exit the application with an appropriate error message. This prevents the application from running in an insecure or undefined state.
5.  **Test All Combinations:** Test the application with various combinations of options, including valid and invalid ones, to ensure the conditional validation is working correctly.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):** Prevents the application from running with incompatible or conflicting options, which could lead to security vulnerabilities or data corruption.
*   **Bypassing Security Checks (Medium Severity):** Ensures that options intended to enhance security (e.g., `--dry-run`) are not overridden by other options.

**Impact:**
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Significantly reduces the risk.
*   **Bypassing Security Checks:** Reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **(Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project):** No `apply()` function is currently implemented. No cross-option validation is performed.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **(Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project):** An `apply()` function needs to be added to the main `coa` command definition to handle cross-option validation. Specific checks need to be implemented for known option dependencies (e.g., `--dry-run` and `--force` should be mutually exclusive).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Length Limits](./mitigation_strategies/input_length_limits.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify String Arguments:** Identify all command-line options that accept string values.
2.  **Determine Reasonable Limits:** For each string argument, determine a reasonable maximum length based on its intended use.
3.  **Implement Custom Validation:** Use `coa`'s `val()` method to add a custom validation function to each string argument.
4.  **Check Length:** Within the validation function, check the length of the input string.
5.  **Reject Excessive Input:** If the length exceeds the defined limit, throw an error or reject the input.
6.  **Test with Various Lengths:** Test the application with inputs of various lengths, including those that exceed the limit, to ensure the validation is working correctly.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of DoS attacks that attempt to consume excessive resources by providing extremely long input strings *during the parsing phase*.

**Impact:**
*   **Denial of Service:** Reduces the risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **(Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project):** Partially implemented. Some string arguments have length checks in ad-hoc validation functions, but not consistently applied through `coa`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **(Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project):** Length limits need to be consistently applied to *all* string arguments using `coa`'s `val()` method. A centralized validation utility function could be created to avoid code duplication.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Stay Updated and Audit (for `coa` Library)](./mitigation_strategies/stay_updated_and_audit__for__coa__library_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `npm`, `yarn`, `pip`) to manage the `coa` library and its dependencies.
2.  **Regular Updates:** Regularly update `coa` to the latest version using the dependency management tool.
3.  **Review Changelogs:** Before updating, review the `coa` changelog or release notes for any security-related fixes.
4.  **Automated Updates (Optional):** Consider using tools like Dependabot (for GitHub) to automate dependency updates and receive alerts about security vulnerabilities.
5.  **Security Audits (High-Risk Scenarios):** For highly sensitive applications, consider performing a security audit of the `coa` source code or engaging a third party to do so.
6. **Input Fuzzing (Advanced):** Use fuzzing tools to test the library.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of `coa` Bugs (Low to High Severity, depending on the bug):** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities within the `coa` library itself being exploited.

**Impact:**
*   **Exploitation of `coa` Bugs:** Reduces the risk by ensuring that known vulnerabilities are patched.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   **(Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project):** `coa` is listed as a dependency in `package.json`. Manual updates are performed occasionally.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **(Example - Needs to be filled in based on your project):** Automated dependency updates are not configured. No regular schedule for checking for updates is in place. No security audit of `coa` has been performed. Fuzzing is not implemented.
