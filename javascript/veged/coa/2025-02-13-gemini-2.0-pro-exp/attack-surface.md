# Attack Surface Analysis for veged/coa

## Attack Surface: [Unexpected Command Execution](./attack_surfaces/unexpected_command_execution.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker manipulates input to execute commands or subcommands they shouldn't have access to.
    *   **How `coa` Contributes:** `coa` is *directly responsible* for command and subcommand routing based on user-provided input.  Without proper application-side validation, `coa` will route to the attacker-specified command. This is the core function of `coa`, making it directly involved.
    *   **Example:**  An application has commands `view` and `admin`.  If input isn't validated, an attacker might provide "admin" as input when they should only have access to "view". `coa` executes the "admin" command.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code, data breaches, privilege escalation, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement a strict whitelist of allowed commands. Reject any input that doesn't match.  Avoid dynamic command construction based on user input.  Use strong input validation.

## Attack Surface: [Indirect Command Injection](./attack_surfaces/indirect_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects shell metacharacters into arguments parsed by `coa`. While the injection itself happens in the application logic *using* the parsed arguments, `coa`'s role in providing those arguments is direct and essential.
    *   **How `coa` Contributes:** `coa` *directly parses* the attacker-provided input containing malicious metacharacters, making this data available to the application. Without `coa` parsing the input, the injection wouldn't be possible in this specific way (through the command-line interface).
    *   **Example:** A command takes a filename: `app process --file [user_input]`. The application then uses `cat [user_input]` internally. An attacker provides `"; rm -rf /; #"` as the filename. `coa` parses this string and passes it to the application.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary shell commands, system compromise, data loss, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** **Avoid shell commands whenever possible.** Use language-specific APIs. If unavoidable, use parameterized execution (e.g., `exec.Command` in Go with separate arguments). *Never* concatenate user input into shell commands. Strictly validate and sanitize all input *before* passing it to `coa` and *after* receiving it from `coa`.

## Attack Surface: [Type Confusion/Mismatch (Integer Overflow/Underflow)](./attack_surfaces/type_confusionmismatch__integer_overflowunderflow_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker provides input that, while technically matching the basic type expected by `coa` (e.g., "number"), is outside the valid range, leading to integer overflows/underflows.
    * **How `coa` Contributes:** `coa` performs *basic* type checking (e.g., is it a number string?). It *directly* parses the input and converts it to the specified type. The vulnerability arises because `coa`'s type checking is insufficient for security; the application must perform additional range validation.
    * **Example:** An option expects a positive integer. An attacker provides a very large number. `coa` parses this as a number (its direct role), but the application doesn't check the range, leading to an overflow.
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, memory corruption, potentially code execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Validate the *range* of numerical input *after* `coa` parses it. Use appropriate data types. Implement robust error handling.
