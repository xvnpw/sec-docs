# Threat Model Analysis for veged/coa

## Threat: [Threat 1: Command Injection](./threats/threat_1_command_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when processed by `coa`, results in the execution of unintended commands. This occurs when user-provided data directly influences the command string or options passed to `coa` without sufficient validation and sanitization. The attacker might inject shell metacharacters (e.g., `;`, `|`, `&&`) to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), granting the attacker complete control over the application and potentially the underlying system. This can lead to data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
    *   **Affected `coa` Component:**  `cmd()` (command definition), `.act()` (action handler), and any API points where user input is used to construct command strings or option values. The core parsing logic is the vulnerable component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement allow-lists (whitelists) for commands and options. Reject any input that doesn't match the predefined, allowed set.
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Remove or escape any potentially dangerous characters (shell metacharacters) from user input *before* it's used to build commands or options.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction:**  Prefer static command definitions. If dynamic construction is absolutely necessary, use parameterized queries or similar techniques to prevent injection.  Never directly concatenate user input into command strings.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with the lowest necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if they achieve command execution.
        *   **Avoid Shell Execution:** If possible, avoid using `coa` to build commands that are executed directly by the shell. Use safer alternatives like `child_process.spawn` with carefully controlled arguments, rather than `child_process.exec`.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Option Type Confusion (String to Number)](./threats/threat_2_option_type_confusion__string_to_number_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a string value for an option that `coa` is configured to treat as a number (using `.opt()` with `type: Number`). If the application doesn't perform *additional* validation after `coa`'s parsing, this can bypass security checks that rely on numeric comparisons. For example, a check for a numeric user ID might be bypassed.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing security checks (e.g., authorization based on numeric IDs), application logic errors, potentially leading to denial of service or unauthorized data access.
    *   **Affected `coa` Component:** `.opt()` (option definition), specifically the `type` parameter (e.g., `Number`, `String`). The parsing and type coercion logic within `coa` is the target.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Precise Type Definitions:**  Ensure the `type` parameter in `.opt()` is correctly set for each option.
        *   **Post-Parsing Validation:**  *After* `coa` parses the options, perform rigorous type validation and coercion within the application logic. Use functions like `Number.isInteger()` or `typeof` to verify the type and ensure it's within expected bounds.
        *   **Defensive Programming:**  Handle potential type errors gracefully.  Don't assume the parsed value is always of the correct type or within the expected range.

## Threat: [Threat 3: Option Type Confusion (Number to String)](./threats/threat_3_option_type_confusion__number_to_string_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker provides a numeric value for an option expected to be a string (using `.opt()` with `type: String`). If the application uses this value in string operations (e.g., file paths, database queries) without proper validation, it could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Application logic errors, potential file system access vulnerabilities (if the string is used in file paths), SQL injection (if used in database queries), denial of service.
    *   **Affected `coa` Component:** `.opt()` (option definition), specifically the `type` parameter. The parsing and type coercion logic within `coa`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Precise Type Definitions:**  Ensure the `type` parameter in `.opt()` is correctly set for each option.
        *   **Post-Parsing Validation:**  Perform additional type validation and coercion *after* `coa` parses the options. Explicitly convert the value to a string and validate its format if necessary.
        *   **Defensive Programming:**  Handle potential type errors gracefully.

## Threat: [Threat 4: Overly Permissive Actions](./threats/threat_4_overly_permissive_actions.md)

* **Description:** `coa` is used to define actions (using `.act()`) that are too broad or powerful. If an attacker can successfully inject a command or manipulate options, they might gain access to functionality or data they shouldn't have. The vulnerability lies in the *application's* logic within the action handler, but `coa` is the mechanism by which the attacker triggers this logic.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, unauthorized data access, data modification, denial of service.
    * **Affected `coa` Component:** `.act()` (action handler). The logic within the action handler, as defined by the application developer, determines the scope and potential impact of the action.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design actions to perform only the *minimum* necessary operations. Avoid granting unnecessary permissions or access to sensitive data.
        *   **Granular Commands:** Break down complex tasks into smaller, more specific commands. This limits the potential damage from a single compromised command.
        *   **Input Validation (within actions):** Even if the command itself is valid (according to `coa`), rigorously validate *all* parameters and data used *within* the action handler to ensure they are within expected bounds and do not represent malicious input. This is crucial even if `coa` has already parsed the options.
