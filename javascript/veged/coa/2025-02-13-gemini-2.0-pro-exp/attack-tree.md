## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Unsanitized Command Names/Aliases](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_unsanitized_command_namesaliases.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts malicious input that is used directly by the application to construct the command name or alias that `coa` will parse.  This is less common than injecting into option/argument values, but extremely dangerous if present.
*   **Sub-Steps:**
    *   **1.1.1 Craft command name containing shell metacharacters:** The attacker includes characters like `;`, `|`, `>`, `<`, `$`, or backticks in the command name itself.  For example, if the application uses user input directly to form a command like `mycommand <user_input>`, the attacker could provide `mycommand; rm -rf /`. 
        *   **1.1.1.1 Bypass any input validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize the user-provided command name *before* passing it to `coa`.  This is the critical vulnerability.
    *   **1.1.2 Craft command alias containing shell metacharacters:** Similar to 1.1.1, but the attacker targets command aliases defined within the `coa` configuration or potentially provided through user input.
        *   **1.1.2.1 Bypass any input validation:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided alias definitions *before* passing it to `coa`.
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: Very High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Novice
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Exploit Unsanitized Option Values](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_exploit_unsanitized_option_values.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides malicious input as the *value* of a command-line option.  This input is then used by the application, often within a shell command, without proper sanitization.
*   **Sub-Steps:**
    *   **1.2.1 Craft option value containing shell metacharacters:** The attacker provides an option value like `--file="; rm -rf /;"`.  If the application uses this value directly in a shell command (e.g., `some_command --file=$file_value`), the injected command will be executed.
        *   **1.2.1.1 Bypass any input validation:** The application fails to sanitize the option value *before* or *after* `coa` parses it.  This is the most common and critical vulnerability.
    *   **1.2.2 Target options designed to accept file paths, attempting path traversal or injection of malicious files:** The attacker provides a file path like `../../../../etc/passwd` or a path to a malicious script.
        *   **1.2.2.1 Bypass file path sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize file paths, allowing the attacker to access or create files outside of the intended directory.
*   **Risk Assessment (1.2.1):**
    *   Likelihood: High
    *   Impact: Very High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Novice
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   **Risk Assessment (1.2.2):**
    *   Likelihood: High
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit Unsanitized Argument Values](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_unsanitized_argument_values.md)

*   **Description:**  Identical to 1.2, but the attacker targets command-line *arguments* instead of options.
*   **Sub-Steps:**
    *   **1.3.1 Craft argument value containing shell metacharacters:** The attacker provides an argument value like `some_command "input; rm -rf /"`.
        *   **1.3.1.1 Bypass any input validation:** The application fails to sanitize the argument value *before* or *after* `coa` parses it. This is a critical vulnerability.
    *   **1.3.2 Target arguments designed to accept file paths, attempting path traversal or injection of malicious files:** The attacker provides a malicious file path as an argument.
        *   **1.3.2.1 Bypass file path sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize file paths provided as arguments.
*   **Risk Assessment (1.3.1):**
    *   Likelihood: High
    *   Impact: Very High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Novice
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium
*   **Risk Assessment (1.3.2):**
    *   Likelihood: High
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Intermediate
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Key Takeaways and Critical Nodes](./attack_tree_paths/key_takeaways_and_critical_nodes.md)

The critical nodes are the points where user input is directly used without sanitization:

*   **1.1.1.1:**  Failure to validate command names.
*   **1.1.2.1:** Failure to validate command aliases.
*   **1.2.1.1:** Failure to validate option values.
*   **1.2.2.1:** Failure to sanitize file paths in options.
*   **1.3.1.1:** Failure to validate argument values.
*   **1.3.2.1:** Failure to sanitize file paths in arguments.

These points represent the *absolute highest priority* for security hardening.  Any failure in these areas can lead to complete system compromise. The application *must* assume all input from `coa` is potentially malicious and validate it accordingly *before* using it in any potentially dangerous operation (especially shell command execution or file system access).
