* **Command Injection via Unsanitized Argument Values:**
    * **Description:** When an application uses values parsed by `coa` directly in shell commands or system calls without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands.
    * **How `coa` Contributes:** `coa` parses command-line arguments and provides their values to the application. It doesn't inherently sanitize these values, leaving the application vulnerable if it directly uses them in system commands.
    * **Example:** An application uses `coa` to parse a `--filename` option and then executes `os.system(f"cat {options.filename}")`. An attacker could provide `--filename="; rm -rf /"` to execute the `rm` command.
    * **Impact:**  Critical. Full system compromise, data loss, and unauthorized access are possible.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid direct execution of shell commands with user-provided input. Use safer alternatives like dedicated libraries or functions for specific tasks.
        * Implement strict input sanitization and validation on all values obtained from `coa` before using them in system calls. Use whitelisting and escaping techniques.
        * Employ parameterized commands or subprocess modules that prevent direct injection of shell commands.

* **Argument Injection/Manipulation Leading to Unexpected Behavior:**
    * **Description:** Attackers can craft command-line arguments to manipulate how `coa` parses them, leading to unintended application behavior.
    * **How `coa` Contributes:** `coa`'s parsing logic can be exploited if the application doesn't anticipate or handle unusual argument combinations or formats.
    * **Example:** An application expects a single `--config` file. An attacker might provide multiple `--config` arguments or arguments with unexpected characters, potentially overriding intended configurations or triggering error conditions that expose vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:** High to Medium. Can lead to bypassing security checks, unexpected code execution paths, or denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Define clear and strict argument specifications in `coa`.
        * Validate the number and format of arguments received by the application after parsing by `coa`.
        * Avoid relying solely on the order of arguments if possible, as this can be manipulated.
        * Implement robust error handling for unexpected argument combinations.

* **Vulnerabilities in Custom Action Handlers (if used):**
    * **Description:** If the application uses `coa`'s custom action handler functionality, vulnerabilities in these handlers can introduce new attack surfaces.
    * **How `coa` Contributes:** `coa` allows defining custom functions to be executed based on parsed commands or options. If these functions are not implemented securely, they can be exploited.
    * **Example:** A custom action handler that directly interacts with the file system based on user input without proper validation could be vulnerable to path traversal attacks.
    * **Impact:** High to Critical, depending on the functionality of the custom handler.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly review and test all custom action handlers for security vulnerabilities.
        * Apply the same security principles (input validation, sanitization, etc.) to the code within custom action handlers.
        * Minimize the privileges of the code executed within custom action handlers.
