# Attack Surface Analysis for veged/coa

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Malicious Arguments](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_malicious_arguments.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious command-line arguments that, when processed by the application via `coa` and used in system calls or shell commands, execute unintended commands on the underlying operating system.

**How `coa` Contributes:** `coa` parses the command-line arguments and provides their values to the application *without inherent sanitization or validation*. This direct provision of potentially malicious input is a key factor in this attack surface.

**Example:** An application uses `coa` to parse a `--file` argument and then executes `cat <parsed_file_value>`. An attacker provides `--file "; rm -rf /"`, and `coa` passes this value to the application, leading to the execution of `cat ; rm -rf /`.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the system, data loss, service disruption, and potential lateral movement within the network.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:**
    * **Avoid direct execution of shell commands with user-provided input obtained via `coa`.** If necessary, use parameterized commands or safer alternatives.
    * **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all command-line arguments *after they are parsed by `coa`* before using them in any system calls or shell commands. Use allow-lists and escape special characters.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Argument Flooding](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_argument_flooding.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides an excessively large number of command-line arguments, overwhelming `coa`'s parsing logic and consuming excessive resources, leading to performance degradation or application crashes.

**How `coa` Contributes:** `coa` is responsible for parsing each provided argument. The act of parsing a massive number of arguments directly impacts `coa`'s performance and can lead to resource exhaustion within the application.

**Example:** An attacker launches the application with thousands of arbitrary or specially crafted arguments, such as `--arg1 value1 --arg2 value2 ... --argN valueN`. `coa` attempts to process each of these, consuming CPU and memory.

**Impact:** Application unavailability, resource exhaustion on the server, and potential impact on other services running on the same infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:**
    * **Implement limits on the number of accepted arguments *before or during `coa`'s parsing process*.**
    * **Consider `coa`'s performance characteristics when handling a large number of arguments.**
    * **Implement resource monitoring and throttling to prevent resource exhaustion if `coa` consumes excessive resources.**

## Attack Surface: [Type Coercion Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/type_coercion_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** `coa` might perform implicit type coercion on argument values. If the application relies on strict type checking but `coa` allows for unexpected type conversions, this can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities.

**How `coa` Contributes:** `coa`'s parsing logic might automatically convert argument types (e.g., string to number) without explicit configuration or warning. This implicit conversion can lead to the application receiving data in an unexpected format.

**Example:** An argument expected to be an integer is provided as a string like "1.5". `coa` might convert it to a float or truncate it to an integer, and the application proceeds with this altered value, potentially leading to incorrect calculations or logic. If this altered value is used in a security-sensitive context (e.g., a size limit), it could lead to a vulnerability.

**Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, potential logic flaws, and in some cases, security vulnerabilities depending on how the coerced value is used (e.g., bypassing validation checks).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developer:**
    * **Explicitly define expected argument types in `coa` configuration to minimize implicit coercion.**
    * **Perform explicit type checking and validation within the application *immediately after parsing arguments with `coa`* to ensure the received data matches the expected type.**
    * **Be fully aware of `coa`'s type coercion behavior and handle potential discrepancies proactively.**
