## Attack Tree Path: [[Critical Node] Exploit coa's Argument Parsing Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_coa's_argument_parsing_weaknesses.md)

This represents a broad category of vulnerabilities arising from how the application processes command-line arguments parsed by `coa`. Weaknesses here can allow attackers to inject malicious code or manipulate the application's intended behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [[High-Risk Path, Critical Node] Inject Malicious Code via Argument Values](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__critical_node__inject_malicious_code_via_argument_values.md)

*   **Provide Argument with Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a command-line argument value that contains malicious code or commands. This payload is designed to be executed by the application.
    *   **[Critical Node] Application Executes Unsanitized Argument:** The application directly uses the attacker-controlled argument value in a way that allows code execution. This often involves using functions like `eval()` or directly passing the argument to system commands without proper sanitization. This is a critical node because it directly leads to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[High-Risk Path] Manipulate Application Logic via Argument Values](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__manipulate_application_logic_via_argument_values.md)

*   **Provide Specific Argument Combinations:** The attacker identifies specific combinations of command-line arguments that, when provided together, trigger unintended or vulnerable application states or logic flows.
    *   **Application Logic Flawed in Handling Specific Arguments:** The application's internal logic contains flaws that are exposed when these specific argument combinations are processed, leading to security breaches such as data manipulation or privilege escalation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Critical Node] Exploit coa's Configuration Loading Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_coa's_configuration_loading_mechanisms.md)

This encompasses vulnerabilities related to how the application loads and processes configuration data using `coa`. Exploiting these mechanisms can allow attackers to inject malicious settings or control the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [[High-Risk Path] Influence Configuration File Path](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__influence_configuration_file_path.md)

*   **[Critical Node] coa Allows Specifying Configuration Path via Arguments:** The `coa` library or the application's implementation allows specifying the path to the configuration file through command-line arguments or environment variables. This is a critical node because it gives the attacker control over which configuration file is loaded.
    *   **Attacker Provides Path to Malicious Configuration:** The attacker leverages the ability to specify the configuration path and provides a path to a configuration file they control. This malicious configuration file contains settings designed to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[High-Risk Path] Inject Malicious Data into Configuration File](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_data_into_configuration_file.md)

*   **Application Loads Configuration via coa:** The application uses `coa`'s functionality to load configuration data from a file.
    *   **Attacker Modifies Configuration File:** The attacker gains write access to the configuration file used by `coa`. This could be through a separate vulnerability or by compromising the system where the file resides. They then inject malicious data into the configuration file, which will be loaded and processed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Critical Node] Exploit coa's Action Handling Features](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_coa's_action_handling_features.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from the application's use of `coa` to define and trigger actions based on command-line arguments.

## Attack Tree Path: [[High-Risk Path] Trigger Execution of Malicious Actions](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__trigger_execution_of_malicious_actions.md)

*   **coa Allows Defining Actions Based on Arguments:** The application utilizes `coa`'s feature to define specific actions that are executed when certain command-line arguments are provided.
    *   **Attacker Triggers a Maliciously Defined Action:** The attacker provides command-line arguments that trigger an action. This action, due to flaws in its implementation or design, performs malicious operations, leading to compromise.
