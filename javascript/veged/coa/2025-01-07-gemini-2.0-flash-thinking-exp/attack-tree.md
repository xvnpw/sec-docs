## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Values into Existing Parameters -> Shell Injection via Parameter Value](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_values_into_existing_parameters_-_shell_injection_via_parameter_value.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker crafts malicious input and injects it into an existing parameter that is processed by the `coa` library. This malicious input is then passed to a system command, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands on the server.
    * Example:  An application uses `coa` to parse a `--filename` argument. An attacker provides `--filename="file.txt; rm -rf /"`. If the application then uses this filename in a shell command without proper sanitization, the `rm -rf /` command will be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Local Configuration -> Inject Malicious Code via Config Value](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_local_configuration_-_inject_malicious_code_via_config_value.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker with local access to the server creates or modifies a configuration file that is read by the application using `coa`. This configuration file contains malicious code or commands that are executed by the application when it processes the configuration.
    * Example: A configuration file contains a setting `script_path: "/path/to/user_provided.sh"`. An attacker replaces this with `script_path: "malicious.sh"`, where `malicious.sh` contains harmful commands. If the application executes the script at `script_path`, the malicious script will be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code via COA Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code_via_coa_vulnerability.md)

* Significance: This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Argument Parsing Logic](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_argument_parsing_logic.md)

* Significance: Successful exploitation of argument parsing logic allows attackers to manipulate the application's behavior by controlling the input it receives. This is a common entry point for many vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Injection](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_injection.md)

* Significance: The ability to inject malicious content into parameters processed by `coa` can lead to various vulnerabilities, including command injection and code injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Shell Injection via Parameter Value](./attack_tree_paths/shell_injection_via_parameter_value.md)

* Significance: This allows for direct execution of arbitrary system commands, granting the attacker significant control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Handling](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_handling.md)

* Significance:  Compromising configuration handling allows attackers to alter the application's behavior and potentially inject malicious code that will be executed during startup or runtime.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Config Value](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_config_value.md)

* Significance: Directly leads to code execution when the application processes the malicious configuration value.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Remote Configuration Source](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_remote_configuration_source.md)

* Significance: If the application fetches configuration from a remote source, compromising this source allows the attacker to inject malicious configurations that will be applied to all instances of the application.
