# Attack Surface Analysis for veged/coa

## Attack Surface: [Command Injection via Action Handlers](./attack_surfaces/command_injection_via_action_handlers.md)

* **Description:**  Attackers can inject arbitrary commands into the system by providing malicious input through command-line arguments or options that are directly used in action handlers without proper sanitization.
* **How coa Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `coa` parses command-line arguments and passes them to defined action handlers. If these handlers directly execute shell commands or system calls using unsanitized input *received from `coa`*, it creates an entry point for command injection.
* **Example:**
    * A `coa` action handler might execute a command like `grep <user_provided_string> file.txt`.
    * An attacker could provide an argument like `--string-to-search "; rm -rf /"` which, if not sanitized by the handler receiving it *from `coa`*, would lead to the execution of `rm -rf /`.
* **Impact:**  Full system compromise, data loss, service disruption, privilege escalation.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * **Never directly execute shell commands with user-provided input *received via `coa`*.**  Utilize safer alternatives like dedicated libraries or functions for specific tasks.
        * **If shell execution is unavoidable, strictly sanitize all user input *obtained through `coa`*.**  Use allow-lists for acceptable characters and patterns. Escape special characters properly.
        * **Employ parameterized commands or prepared statements** where applicable to separate commands from data *received from `coa`*.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Arguments/Options](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_excessive_argumentsoptions.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can overwhelm the application by providing an extremely large number of arguments or options, consuming excessive resources (CPU, memory) and potentially crashing the application or making it unresponsive.
* **How coa Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `coa` is responsible for parsing all provided arguments and options. A large number of these can strain *`coa`'s parsing logic* and resource allocation.
* **Example:**
    * Launching the application with hundreds or thousands of randomly generated or deeply nested arguments that *`coa` needs to process*.
    * Providing extremely long strings as argument values that *`coa` needs to handle*.
* **Impact:** Service disruption, application unavailability, resource exhaustion on the server.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * **Implement limits on the number of accepted arguments and options *that `coa` will process*.**
        * **Set maximum lengths for argument values *that `coa` will handle*.**
        * **Implement timeouts for *`coa`'s argument parsing process*.**
        * **Monitor resource usage during argument processing *by `coa`* and implement safeguards against excessive consumption.**

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Injection via Argument Overrides](./attack_surfaces/configuration_injection_via_argument_overrides.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can manipulate application behavior by overriding critical configuration settings through command-line arguments or options that `coa` handles.
* **How coa Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If `coa` is used to allow command-line overrides of configuration parameters, it creates a potential avenue for attackers to inject malicious or unexpected configurations *through `coa`'s parsing mechanism*.
* **Example:**
    * An application might allow overriding the database connection URL via an argument like `--database-url` *handled by `coa`*.
    * An attacker could provide `--database-url malicious_server` to redirect the application to a compromised database *through `coa`'s argument processing*.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, modification of application behavior, redirection to malicious resources.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * **Carefully consider which configuration parameters should be overridable via command-line arguments *handled by `coa`*.** Minimize the number of overridable critical settings.
        * **Implement strict validation and sanitization for configuration values set through arguments *processed by `coa`*.**  Verify data types, formats, and expected ranges.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via File System Related Arguments](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_file_system_related_arguments.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can access or modify files outside the intended scope by manipulating file paths provided as command-line arguments or options.
* **How coa Contributes to the Attack Surface:** If `coa` handles arguments that specify file paths (e.g., input files, output directories), and these paths are not properly validated *after being parsed by `coa`*, it opens the door for path traversal attacks.
* **Example:**
    * An application might accept an input file path via `--input-file` *handled by `coa`*.
    * An attacker could provide `--input-file ../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read a sensitive system file *after `coa` has passed this value to the application*.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, modification of critical files, potential for arbitrary code execution if write access is gained.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Developers:**
        * **Thoroughly validate and sanitize all file paths provided as arguments *received from `coa`*.**
        * **Use absolute paths whenever possible *when processing arguments from `coa`*.**
        * **Canonicalize relative paths to resolve symbolic links and ".." components *after `coa` has parsed the input*.
