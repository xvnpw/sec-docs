# Threat Model Analysis for veged/coa

## Threat: [Argument Injection](./threats/argument_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could craft malicious input within command-line arguments that are processed by `coa`. This input, if not properly sanitized by the application *after* `coa`'s parsing, could be interpreted as commands by the underlying system or other components. The attacker might manipulate arguments to execute unintended actions, bypass security checks, or gain unauthorized access. This threat directly involves `coa`'s argument parsing functionality.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected `coa` Component:** `coa`'s argument parsing module (specifically the functions responsible for interpreting and extracting values from command-line arguments).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data obtained from `coa`'s argument parsing before using it in any sensitive operations, especially when constructing system commands or database queries.
*   Avoid directly using argument values in shell commands. If necessary, use secure methods for executing commands with user-provided input, such as parameterized commands or escaping techniques.
*   Implement input validation to ensure arguments conform to expected types and formats.

## Threat: [Configuration Poisoning](./threats/configuration_poisoning.md)

**Description:** An attacker could modify configuration files or sources that `coa` uses to load application settings. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in file permissions, insecure storage locations, or weaknesses in how the application retrieves configuration. By injecting malicious configuration values, the attacker could alter the application's behavior, redirect it to malicious resources, or expose sensitive information. This threat directly involves `coa`'s configuration loading functionality.

**Impact:**  Compromised application functionality, redirection to malicious sites, exposure of sensitive data, potential for further attacks based on the manipulated configuration.

**Affected `coa` Component:** `coa`'s configuration management module (specifically the functions responsible for loading, merging, and accessing configuration data from various sources).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store configuration files in secure locations with restricted access permissions.
*   Implement integrity checks (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures) for configuration files to detect unauthorized modifications.
*   Validate the structure and content of loaded configuration data to ensure it conforms to the expected schema and does not contain malicious values.
*   If loading configuration from remote sources, ensure secure communication channels (HTTPS) and proper authentication/authorization.

## Threat: [Plugin/Extension Exploitation (if applicable)](./threats/pluginextension_exploitation__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes `coa`'s plugin or extension mechanisms, vulnerabilities within these plugins or in how `coa` loads and interacts with them could be exploited. An attacker could introduce malicious plugins or leverage existing vulnerable ones to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or disrupt application functionality. This threat directly involves `coa`'s plugin management functionality.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, compromised application functionality.

**Affected `coa` Component:** `coa`'s plugin/extension management module (the functions responsible for loading, registering, and interacting with plugins).

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on plugin capabilities)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet and audit all plugins or extensions used with `coa`.
*   Ensure plugins are loaded from trusted sources and use secure communication channels if retrieving them remotely.
*   Implement a mechanism to verify the integrity and authenticity of plugins before loading them.
*   Restrict the capabilities and permissions of plugins to the minimum necessary.
*   Regularly update plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Path Traversal in Configuration Loading](./threats/path_traversal_in_configuration_loading.md)

**Description:** If `coa` allows specifying file paths for configuration loading without proper sanitization, an attacker might be able to use path traversal techniques (e.g., using "../") to load configuration files from unexpected locations outside the intended configuration directory. This could allow them to access sensitive configuration data or potentially load malicious configuration files. This threat directly involves `coa`'s file path handling during configuration loading.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for loading malicious configurations leading to further compromise.

**Affected `coa` Component:** `coa`'s configuration loading module, specifically the functions that handle file path resolution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize any file paths provided to `coa` for configuration loading.
*   Restrict configuration loading to specific allowed directories or use a whitelist approach.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths for configuration loading.
