# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for veged/coa

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization within Action Handlers](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_within_action_handlers.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Locate all action handler functions defined in your `coa` application. These functions are executed by `coa` based on parsed commands and options.
    2.  Within each action handler, treat all arguments and options provided by `coa` as untrusted user input.
    3.  Implement validation logic *inside* the action handler functions to ensure that each input conforms to expected types, formats, and values. Use techniques like:
        *   **Type checking:** Verify data types match expectations (e.g., string, number).
        *   **Format validation:** Use regular expressions or libraries to validate formats (e.g., email, URL).
        *   **Whitelist validation:**  Compare inputs against a predefined list of allowed values.
        *   **Range checks:** Ensure numerical inputs are within acceptable ranges.
    4.  After validation, sanitize inputs to remove or escape potentially harmful characters before using them in any operations. Sanitization methods include:
        *   **Encoding/Escaping:** Encode special characters relevant to the context where the input will be used (e.g., shell escaping if used in shell commands).
        *   **Character removal:** Strip out disallowed or unexpected characters.
    5.  If validation fails, reject the input and provide informative error messages to the user.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Command Injection (High Severity): Prevents command injection by sanitizing arguments before they are used in shell commands (if your action handlers execute shell commands).
    *   Argument Injection (Medium Severity): Prevents manipulation of application logic through unexpected or malformed arguments passed via `coa`.
    *   Path Traversal (Medium Severity, if file paths are handled by action handlers): Prevents attackers from accessing unauthorized files by validating and sanitizing file path arguments processed by `coa` action handlers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Command Injection: High - Significantly reduces risk if action handlers interact with shell commands.
    *   Argument Injection: Medium - Substantially reduces risk by ensuring arguments are well-formed.
    *   Path Traversal: Medium - Reduces risk if action handlers process file paths.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Input validation is partially implemented in the `process-image` action handler in `src/commands/image.js` for `--input-file` and `--output-format` arguments.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Input sanitization is generally missing across action handlers. Validation should be expanded to more arguments in various commands (e.g., numerical validation for timeouts, string validation for report titles in other commands).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Define Strict Argument and Command Structure using `coa` API](./mitigation_strategies/define_strict_argument_and_command_structure_using__coa__api.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Utilize `coa`'s API to explicitly define the expected command-line interface structure. This includes:
        *   Defining available commands and subcommands.
        *   Specifying options (flags) for each command.
        *   Defining arguments for each command and option.
    2.  Use `coa`'s features to enforce argument types (e.g., `.string()`, `.number()`, `.boolean()`).
    3.  Mark required arguments and options as mandatory using `.required()` in `coa` definitions.
    4.  Provide clear descriptions for commands, options, and arguments using `coa`'s API (e.g., `.title()`, `.description()`). These descriptions are used in help messages generated by `coa`, guiding users and reducing misuse.
    5.  Avoid overly permissive argument definitions. Be specific and restrictive in defining expected input patterns and types using `coa`'s API.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Argument Injection (Medium Severity): Reduces argument injection by enforcing a rigid structure, making it harder to inject unexpected arguments that `coa` would parse.
    *   Misconfiguration/Misuse (Low Severity): Reduces developer errors and misconfigurations by clearly defining the CLI structure with `coa`, leading to more predictable and secure application behavior.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Argument Injection: Medium - Reduces risk by limiting flexibility for attackers to inject unexpected arguments recognized by `coa`.
    *   Misconfiguration/Misuse: Low - Improves code clarity and reduces potential for developer errors in CLI definition.
*   **Currently Implemented:** The application uses `coa` to define commands and options in `src/cli.js` and command-specific files. Argument types are often specified.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  More consistent use of `.required()` for mandatory options and more specific validation rules beyond basic type checking using `coa`'s validation capabilities could be implemented. Custom validators could be added for more complex argument constraints within `coa`'s definition.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Argument Lengths Parsed by `coa`](./mitigation_strategies/limit_argument_lengths_parsed_by__coa_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Within your input validation logic in action handlers (functions called by `coa`), implement checks to limit the maximum length of string-based arguments parsed by `coa`.
    2.  Consider setting a limit on the total combined length of all arguments and options processed by `coa` if your application is sensitive to excessively long command lines.
    3.  Enforce these length limits *after* `coa` has parsed the arguments and *before* further processing in action handlers.
    4.  When length limits are exceeded, reject the input with an error message and log the event.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) through Argument Complexity (Low to Medium Severity): Prevents DoS attacks that rely on sending extremely long arguments to overwhelm the application's processing, especially argument parsing or subsequent operations on long strings.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Low to Medium - Reduces the risk of DoS attacks based on argument length, depending on how string processing intensive your application is.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No explicit argument length limits are currently implemented in the application related to `coa` parsed arguments.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Length limit checks should be added to the input validation within action handlers, particularly for string arguments like file paths, report titles, or any arguments that could potentially be very long and cause issues if excessively large.
