Objective: Compromise Application using `coa` vulnerabilities via High-Risk Paths.

## Attack Tree Visualization

Compromise Application via Coa Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE]
└── OR ── Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses in Coa Parsing [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    ├── AND ── Command Injection via Unsanitized Arguments [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]
    │   ├── Exploit: Identify command arguments passed directly to shell execution without sanitization.
    │   ├── Example: Application uses `coa` to parse arguments and then executes a shell command like `exec('command ' + coaParsedArgs.filename)`.
    └── AND ── Path Traversal via File Path Arguments [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]
        ├── Exploit: If `coa` is used to handle file path arguments, exploit lack of path sanitization to access files outside the intended directory.
        ├── Example: Application uses `coa` to parse `--file <path>` and then reads the file. Attacker provides `../../../../etc/passwd` as path.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Input Validation Weaknesses in Coa Parsing [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_input_validation_weaknesses_in_coa_parsing__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** This is the overarching vulnerability category. It refers to the failure to properly validate and sanitize user-provided input that is parsed by the `coa` library before it is used by the application.  This lack of validation is the root cause of the most critical high-risk paths.
*   **Exploitation:** Attackers target application endpoints that utilize `coa` to process command-line arguments. They craft malicious inputs designed to bypass intended application logic or directly exploit underlying system functionalities through the parsed arguments.
*   **Potential Impact:**  The impact is broad and severe, ranging from arbitrary code execution and data breaches to complete system compromise, depending on how the unsanitized input is used within the application.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:**  Implement rigorous input sanitization for all arguments parsed by `coa`. This includes removing or escaping potentially harmful characters or sequences.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate that parsed arguments conform to expected formats, types, and values. Reject any input that does not meet the defined criteria.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the damage if input validation is bypassed.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Command Injection via Unsanitized Arguments [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__command_injection_via_unsanitized_arguments__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** Command injection occurs when an application executes shell commands using unsanitized input that is derived from `coa` parsed arguments. If an attacker can control part of the command string, they can inject malicious commands that will be executed by the system.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker identifies application code that uses `coa` parsed arguments to construct and execute shell commands (e.g., using `exec`, `system`, `spawn` in Node.js or similar functions in other languages). They then craft malicious arguments that, when parsed by `coa` and incorporated into the shell command, will execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Complete system compromise is possible. Attackers can gain full control of the server, steal sensitive data, install malware, or use the compromised system as a launchpad for further attacks.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Shell Execution with Unsanitized Input:**  The most effective mitigation is to avoid constructing shell commands directly from user input.
    *   **Parameterized Commands:**  Use parameterized commands or prepared statements where possible. These techniques separate the command structure from the user-provided data, preventing injection.
    *   **Input Sanitization (Shell Specific):** If shell execution is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize all `coa` parsed arguments before incorporating them into shell commands. Use shell escaping functions provided by the programming language.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run application processes with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of command injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Path Traversal via File Path Arguments [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__path_traversal_via_file_path_arguments__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Vulnerability:** Path traversal (also known as directory traversal) vulnerabilities arise when an application uses `coa` parsed arguments to handle file paths without proper sanitization. Attackers can manipulate file path arguments to access files and directories outside of the intended application scope.
*   **Exploitation:** An attacker identifies application functionality that uses `coa` to accept file path arguments (e.g., for file uploads, downloads, or processing). They then provide malicious file paths, such as `../../../../etc/passwd`, which, if not properly validated, can allow them to read sensitive system files or access other parts of the file system that should be restricted.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Reading sensitive files (like configuration files, password hashes, source code), data breaches, and in some cases, the ability to write or upload files to arbitrary locations on the server, potentially leading to further compromise.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Path Sanitization:** Sanitize file paths received from `coa` parsed arguments. Use functions to resolve paths to their canonical form and remove relative path components like `..`.
    *   **Path Validation (Whitelist Approach):** Validate that parsed file paths are within expected allowed directories or conform to a whitelist of allowed paths or patterns.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File System):** Run the application with minimal file system permissions. Restrict access to only the necessary directories and files.
    *   **Input Validation (Path Specific):** Validate that the parsed path does not contain malicious path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\`).
