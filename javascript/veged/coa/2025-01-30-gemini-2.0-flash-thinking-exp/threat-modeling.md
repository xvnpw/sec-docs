# Threat Model Analysis for veged/coa

## Threat: [Command Injection via `coa`'s Action Handlers (Misuse)](./threats/command_injection_via__coa_'s_action_handlers__misuse_.md)

*   **Threat:** Command Injection via `coa`'s Action Handlers (Misuse)
*   **Description:** A malicious developer (or through code injection vulnerability elsewhere) might misuse `coa`'s action handlers to execute system commands based on user-controlled input parsed by `coa`. An attacker could then manipulate web request parameters to inject malicious commands into the system command constructed within the action handler. For example, if an action handler uses user input to build a shell command string, an attacker could inject shell metacharacters to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, full server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the privileges of the application and the injected commands.
*   **Affected COA Component:** `coa`'s action handler mechanism (`cmd.action()`) when misused for system command execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Absolutely avoid** using `coa`'s action handlers to directly execute system commands based on user-provided input in web applications.
    *   If system command execution is unavoidable, sanitize and validate all input rigorously *before* command construction.
    *   Use parameterized commands or secure command execution libraries.
    *   Prefer alternative approaches to system command execution if possible, like using APIs or libraries.
    *   Implement strict code review processes to prevent misuse of action handlers for command execution.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in `coa` Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in__coa__dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `coa` Dependencies
*   **Description:** `coa` relies on third-party dependencies. If any of these dependencies contain security vulnerabilities, applications using `coa` become indirectly vulnerable. An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in a `coa` dependency to compromise the application. This is a common supply chain vulnerability that arises from using `coa` and its ecosystem.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the dependency vulnerability, potentially including remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.
*   **Affected COA Component:** Indirectly affects the application through `coa`'s dependency chain.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potential severity depending on the specific dependency vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update `coa` and its dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and monitor for vulnerabilities in `coa`'s dependency tree.
    *   Implement a robust dependency management process for timely updates and patching.
    *   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to continuously monitor dependencies.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for `coa` and its dependencies to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
