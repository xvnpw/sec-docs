# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: Provide a command-line tool to simplify and automate cloud operations across multiple cloud providers (AWS, GCP, Azure).
 - Priority: Enhance cloud efficiency, reduce operational overhead, and improve cloud security posture for users.
 - Goal: Enable users to gain better visibility into their cloud environments, especially regarding cost and security.
 - Priority: Offer a user-friendly and extensible tool that can be easily adopted and integrated into existing workflows.

- Business Risks:
 - Risk: Misconfiguration or misuse of the tool leading to unintended changes or security vulnerabilities in the cloud environments.
 - Risk: Lack of user adoption due to complexity, insufficient documentation, or lack of desired features.
 - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the tool itself could be exploited to compromise user cloud environments.
 - Risk: Dependency on external cloud provider APIs and services, which could change or become unavailable, impacting the tool's functionality.
 - Risk: Open-source nature of the project might lead to slower development or lack of dedicated support compared to commercial alternatives.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for repository access control and vulnerability scanning. (Implemented: GitHub platform)
 - security control: Open-source project, allowing community review and contribution to identify and fix security issues. (Implemented: Open-source development model)
 - security control: Use of standard libraries and frameworks, potentially benefiting from their inherent security features and community scrutiny. (Implemented: Codebase - needs further investigation)
 - accepted risk: Reliance on user's cloud provider credentials and permissions, assuming users follow best practices for credential management.
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies, requiring regular updates and dependency scanning.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process.
 - security control: Conduct regular dependency vulnerability scanning and updates to mitigate risks from vulnerable libraries.
 - security control: Implement input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks.
 - security control: Implement secure credential management practices within the tool, avoiding hardcoding or insecure storage of credentials.
 - security control: Provide clear documentation and guidance on secure usage of the tool, including least privilege principles and secure credential handling.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: The tool itself does not require user authentication as it is a command-line tool executed in the user's environment.
  - Requirement: Authentication to cloud providers is handled by the respective cloud provider SDKs and CLIs, leveraging existing cloud authentication mechanisms (e.g., IAM roles, service accounts, API keys).
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: The tool should respect and enforce the authorization policies defined in the target cloud environments.
  - Requirement: Users must have appropriate permissions in their cloud accounts to perform actions using the tool.
  - Requirement: The tool should not escalate user privileges or bypass existing authorization controls.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: All user inputs, including command-line arguments and configuration files, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, argument injection).
  - Requirement: Input validation should be performed on both the client-side (within the tool) and potentially on the server-side if the tool interacts with any backend services (currently not evident).
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Sensitive data, such as cloud provider credentials or API keys, should be handled securely and potentially encrypted at rest if stored locally by the tool.
  - Requirement: Communication with cloud provider APIs should be encrypted using HTTPS.
  - Requirement: Consider using cryptographic signatures to verify the integrity of downloaded components or updates if applicable.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Protecting user cloud environments from misconfiguration or unintended actions caused by the tool.
 - Ensuring the integrity and security of the tool itself to prevent it from becoming a vulnerability vector.
 - Maintaining user trust and confidence in the tool's reliability and security.

- Data Sensitivity:
 - Cloud Provider Credentials (High Sensitivity): The tool handles cloud provider credentials (API keys, access keys, service account keys) which are highly sensitive and must be protected to prevent unauthorized access to cloud environments.
 - Cloud Resource Metadata (Medium Sensitivity): The tool accesses and processes metadata about cloud resources (e.g., resource names, configurations, costs). This data is less sensitive than credentials but still needs to be protected to prevent information disclosure or unauthorized modification.
 - User Configuration Data (Low to Medium Sensitivity): User-provided configuration files might contain sensitive information depending on the specific configurations.
