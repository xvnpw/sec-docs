# Threat Model Analysis for cypress-io/cypress

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./threats/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

### Threat: Malicious Test Code Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code directly into Cypress test files. This could occur through compromised developer machines, insecure code repositories, or vulnerabilities in CI/CD pipelines. The injected code leverages the Cypress Test Runner's capabilities and browser context.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious test code running within the Cypress environment can access and transmit sensitive application data, environment variables, or API keys to external locations.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Tests run with elevated privileges within the browser context. Malicious code can exploit this to perform actions beyond normal user capabilities within the tested application.
    *   **Application State Manipulation:** Malicious tests can directly interact with and alter the application's data or configuration during the test execution.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Tests can be crafted to overload the application or its dependencies, causing temporary or prolonged unavailability.
*   **Affected Cypress Component:** Cypress Test Runner, `cy` commands, Test Files
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls and mandatory code review processes for all Cypress test files.
    *   Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools specifically designed for JavaScript to scan Cypress test code for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Secure developer machines and CI/CD pipelines with robust security measures to prevent unauthorized code injection.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing test environments and code repositories.

## Threat: [Compromised Cypress Plugin](./threats/compromised_cypress_plugin.md)

### Threat: Compromised Cypress Plugin
*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a Cypress plugin, either by injecting malicious code into an existing plugin or by creating a seemingly legitimate but malicious plugin. Developers unknowingly install and integrate this compromised plugin into their Cypress setup. The malicious code executes within the Cypress process.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A malicious plugin can execute arbitrary code on the machine running the Cypress tests, potentially compromising the developer's system or CI/CD infrastructure.
    *   **Data Theft:** The plugin can intercept and exfiltrate sensitive data accessed by Cypress during testing, including environment variables, API responses, or application data.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** A compromised plugin could manipulate network requests made by the application during testing, potentially capturing sensitive data in transit or introducing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Test Manipulation:** The plugin could alter test results to hide failures or vulnerabilities, providing a false sense of security.
*   **Affected Cypress Component:** Cypress Plugins API, `cypress.config.js`/`cypress.config.ts`, `pluginsFile`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Exercise extreme caution when installing third-party Cypress plugins. Thoroughly vet and audit the source code of any plugin before use.
    *   Only install plugins from trusted sources and maintain awareness of reported plugin vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a formal process for reviewing and approving all new plugin installations.
    *   Regularly update Cypress and its plugins to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in Cypress plugins.

## Threat: [Exposure of Secrets in Cypress Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_secrets_in_cypress_configuration.md)

### Threat: Exposure of Secrets in Cypress Configuration
*   **Description:** Developers inadvertently store sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets, directly within Cypress configuration files (`cypress.config.js`/`cypress.config.ts`) or environment variables that are easily accessible by Cypress. An attacker gaining access to these files or the testing environment can retrieve these secrets.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Exposed API keys or credentials can allow attackers to access protected resources or services on behalf of the application.
    *   **Data Breaches:** Compromised database credentials can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive application data.
    *   **Infrastructure Compromise:** Access to other exposed secrets could potentially compromise other parts of the application's infrastructure.
*   **Affected Cypress Component:** `cypress.config.js`/`cypress.config.ts`, Environment Variables
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** store sensitive information directly in Cypress configuration files or easily accessible environment variables.
    *   Utilize secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and retrieve secrets.
    *   Inject secrets into the Cypress environment at runtime using environment variables provided by the CI/CD pipeline or hosting environment.
    *   Implement strict access controls on configuration files and the systems where environment variables are managed.
    *   Regularly scan configuration files and environment variables for inadvertently stored secrets.
