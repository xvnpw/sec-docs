# Attack Surface Analysis for cypress-io/cypress

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Compromised Test Code](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_compromised_test_code.md)

*   **Description:**  The Cypress test code itself contains malicious logic or is altered by an attacker.
    *   **How Cypress Contributes:** Cypress executes JavaScript code within the browser context of the application under test, giving test code significant power to interact with the application.
    *   **Example:** A compromised developer account pushes test code that extracts sensitive user data from the application's UI and sends it to an external server during test execution.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, modification of application data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all Cypress test code.
        *   Utilize version control and track changes to test files.
        *   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for developers accessing the test codebase.
        *   Regularly scan test code repositories for vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools for test code.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Cypress Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_cypress_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Cypress configuration files contain sensitive information or are set up in a way that introduces security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Cypress Contributes:** Cypress configuration files (e.g., `cypress.config.js`) can store environment variables, API keys, or other sensitive data required for testing.
    *   **Example:**  API keys for accessing external services are hardcoded directly in the `cypress.config.js` file and are accidentally committed to a public repository.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Cypress configuration files.
        *   Use environment variables or secure secrets management solutions to handle sensitive credentials.
        *   Ensure Cypress configuration files are not publicly accessible.
        *   Regularly review and audit Cypress configuration settings.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Cypress Plugins and Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_cypress_plugins_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Third-party Cypress plugins or their underlying dependencies contain security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Cypress Contributes:** Cypress's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality, but introduces dependencies on external code.
    *   **Example:** A popular Cypress plugin has a known security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the machine running the tests.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the testing environment, potential for lateral movement, data breaches.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and select Cypress plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Regularly audit and update Cypress plugins and their dependencies.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Integration with CI/CD Pipelines](./attack_surfaces/insecure_integration_with_cicd_pipelines.md)

*   **Description:** The integration of Cypress tests into the CI/CD pipeline introduces security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Cypress Contributes:** Cypress tests are often integrated into automated build and deployment processes, requiring access to application environments and potentially sensitive credentials.
    *   **Example:**  CI/CD pipeline configurations expose credentials used for running Cypress tests, allowing an attacker who compromises the CI/CD system to gain access to the testing environment or the application itself.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the CI/CD pipeline, unauthorized access to application environments, potential for deploying malicious code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely manage credentials used in the CI/CD pipeline (e.g., using secrets management tools).
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for accessing the CI/CD system.
        *   Harden the CI/CD environment to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.
        *   Regularly audit CI/CD pipeline configurations and logs.
