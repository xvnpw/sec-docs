## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Cookies [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_cookies__critical_node_-_high_impact_.md)

*   Description: Cypress could be used to set or modify cookies, potentially escalating privileges or bypassing authentication.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Request Payloads [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_request_payloads__high-risk_path_.md)

*   Description: Cypress intercepts network requests. A compromised Cypress instance or malicious test code could modify request payloads before they are sent to the server, potentially injecting malicious data or commands.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Impersonate Users by Manipulating Requests [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT] [HIGH-RISK PATH - if tokens are easily accessible]](./attack_tree_paths/impersonate_users_by_manipulating_requests__critical_node_-_high_impact___high-risk_path_-_if_tokens_342d0d60.md)

*   Description: If Cypress has access to authentication tokens or session information, it could be used to craft requests impersonating legitimate users.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Plugins [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_plugins__critical_node_-_high_impact_.md)

*   Description: Cypress allows the use of plugins. A compromised plugin or a deliberately malicious plugin could introduce vulnerabilities or exfiltrate data during test execution.
    *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium-High
    *   Skill Level: Medium-High
    *   Detection Difficulty: High

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Environment Variables [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT] [HIGH-RISK PATH - can enable other attacks]](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_environment_variables__critical_node_-_high_impact___high-risk_path_-_can_enable_ot_131702ad.md)

*   Description: Accidentally exposing sensitive environment variables in the Cypress configuration could leak credentials or API keys.
    *   Likelihood: Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Low
    *   Skill Level: Low
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low-Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exfiltrate Data During Test Execution [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT]](./attack_tree_paths/exfiltrate_data_during_test_execution__critical_node_-_high_impact_.md)

*   Description: Maliciously crafted test code could be designed to exfiltrate data from the application under test during the testing process.
    *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-High

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Application State Persistently [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT]](./attack_tree_paths/modify_application_state_persistently__critical_node_-_high_impact_.md)

*   Description: Test code could be written to make persistent changes to the application's backend or database if the test environment is not properly isolated.
    *   Likelihood: Low
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium
    *   Skill Level: Medium
    *   Detection Difficulty: High

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Tests into the CI/CD Pipeline [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT] [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_tests_into_the_cicd_pipeline__critical_node_-_high_impact___high-risk_path_.md)

*   Description: If the CI/CD pipeline is compromised, attackers could inject malicious Cypress tests that execute automatically, potentially compromising the application or its data.
    *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium-High
    *   Skill Level: Medium-High
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-High

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Machines [CRITICAL NODE - HIGH IMPACT] [HIGH-RISK PATH - gateway to many other attacks]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_machines__critical_node_-_high_impact___high-risk_path_-_gateway_to_many_other__bff5234a.md)

*   Description: If a developer's machine is compromised, attackers could modify Cypress configurations or test code to introduce malicious behavior.
    *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
    *   Impact: High
    *   Effort: Medium-High
    *   Skill Level: Medium-High
    *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-High
