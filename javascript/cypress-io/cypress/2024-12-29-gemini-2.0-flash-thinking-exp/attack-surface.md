* **Test Code as an Attack Vector:**
    * **Description:** Malicious or poorly written test code can interact with the application in unintended ways, potentially triggering vulnerabilities or exposing sensitive information during testing.
    * **How Cypress Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cypress's powerful API allows tests to interact deeply with the application, including making arbitrary requests, manipulating the DOM, and accessing local storage. This power, if misused, can be an attack vector.
    * **Example:** A test script could be crafted to intentionally submit malicious input to a form field, bypassing client-side validation and potentially exploiting a server-side vulnerability.
    * **Impact:**  Unintended data modification, triggering application errors, exposure of sensitive data within the testing environment, or even denial of service if tests overload the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement code review processes for Cypress test code, similar to application code.
        * Follow secure coding practices when writing tests, avoiding hardcoded credentials or sensitive data.
        * Isolate testing environments from production environments to prevent accidental data modification.
        * Use parameterized tests and data sanitization within tests to prevent injection attacks.

* **Cypress Configuration and Environment Variables:**
    * **Description:** Misconfigured Cypress settings or insecurely managed environment variables can expose sensitive information or weaken security during testing.
    * **How Cypress Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Cypress relies on configuration files (cypress.config.js/ts) and environment variables to define its behavior and access external resources. If these are compromised or misconfigured, it can lead to vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:**  Storing API keys or database credentials directly in the `cypress.config.js` file, which could be exposed if the repository is compromised.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, unauthorized access to external services, or manipulation of test behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Store sensitive configuration values and credentials securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        * Avoid committing sensitive information directly into version control.
        * Implement access controls on configuration files and the testing environment.
        * Regularly review and audit Cypress configuration settings.
