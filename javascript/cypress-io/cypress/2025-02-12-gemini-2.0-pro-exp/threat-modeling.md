# Threat Model Analysis for cypress-io/cypress

## Threat: [Unauthorized Test Code Modification](./threats/unauthorized_test_code_modification.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Test Code Modification

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the source code repository and modifies the Cypress test code. They could disable security checks, introduce false positives, alter assertions, or inject malicious code that executes during the test run. This directly impacts the integrity of the testing process.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromised test integrity, leading to false confidence in the application's security.  Malicious code injected into tests could potentially compromise the test environment or other systems.
    *   **Cypress Component Affected:**  All Cypress test files (`*.spec.js`, `*.cy.js`, etc.), support files, and custom commands.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict version control (e.g., Git) with mandatory code reviews and approvals for *all* changes to Cypress test code.
        *   Use a CI/CD pipeline that automatically runs tests on every code change, preventing malicious modifications from going unnoticed.
        *   Regularly audit the test code for unauthorized changes, potentially using automated code analysis tools.
        *   Employ code signing for Cypress test scripts to ensure their integrity and prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   Restrict access to the source code repository to authorized personnel only.

## Threat: [Malicious Network Request Injection (within Cypress)](./threats/malicious_network_request_injection__within_cypress_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Network Request Injection (within Cypress)

    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the Cypress test code could modify or inject network requests *within the Cypress environment itself* using features like `cy.intercept()`, `cy.route()`, or `cy.request()`. This abuses Cypress's intended functionality for malicious purposes. The attacker could exfiltrate data, bypass application logic *during testing*, or interact with malicious services.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the testing environment, potential exfiltration of data gathered *during* testing (which might include sensitive information), skewed test results, and potential for the Cypress runner to be used as a launchpad for further attacks.
    *   **Cypress Component Affected:** `cy.intercept()`, `cy.route()`, `cy.request()`, network request handling within the Cypress runner.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Mandatory, thorough code reviews of all Cypress test code, with a specific focus on network request interception and modification.
        *   Restrict the use of `cy.intercept()`, `cy.route()`, and `cy.request()` to only when absolutely necessary, with clear documentation.
        *   Run Cypress tests in a sandboxed environment (e.g., Docker) with limited network access.
        *   Use environment variables for sensitive data and manage them securely.
        *   Implement network monitoring within the test environment.

## Threat: [Cypress Configuration Tampering](./threats/cypress_configuration_tampering.md)

*   **Threat:** Cypress Configuration Tampering

    *   **Description:** An attacker modifies the Cypress configuration file (`cypress.config.js` or `cypress.config.ts`). They could disable security features, change the `baseUrl`, or alter configurations to manipulate the testing environment and potentially introduce vulnerabilities or skew results. This directly affects how Cypress operates.
    *   **Impact:**  Tests may not accurately reflect real-world behavior, leading to false positives/negatives. Security checks might be bypassed.
    *   **Cypress Component Affected:** `cypress.config.js` (or `cypress.config.ts`), Cypress environment variables.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Treat the configuration file with the same security as test code (version control, code reviews, access controls).
        *   Validate the configuration file's integrity before running tests (e.g., checksum).
        *   Limit access to modify the configuration file.
        *   Regularly audit the configuration file.
        *   Use environment variables for sensitive settings and manage them securely.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Tests](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_tests.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Tests

    *   **Description:**  Sensitive data (API keys, passwords, PII) is inadvertently included in Cypress test code, configuration files, or test reports. This could happen through hardcoding, logging sensitive data, or failing to sanitize reports. This is a direct threat related to how Cypress tests are written and managed.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive information, potentially leading to data breaches and unauthorized access.
    *   **Cypress Component Affected:**  All Cypress test files, configuration files, custom commands, support files, and test reports (including screenshots and videos).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   *Never* hardcode sensitive data.
        *   Use environment variables or a secrets management solution.
        *   Sanitize test reports.
        *   Use `.gitignore` to prevent committing sensitive files.
        *   Avoid `console.log` for sensitive data; use Cypress's logging with redaction.
        *   Regularly review test code and reports.
        *   Educate developers on secure coding practices.

## Threat: [Cypress Running with Excessive Privileges](./threats/cypress_running_with_excessive_privileges.md)

*   **Threat:** Cypress Running with Excessive Privileges

    *   **Description:**  Cypress tests are run with higher privileges than necessary (e.g., root/administrator).  A vulnerability in Cypress or a compromised test could allow an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system. This is a direct threat related to the execution context of Cypress.
    *   **Impact:**  Potential for an attacker to gain complete control of the test execution machine.
    *   **Cypress Component Affected:**  The entire Cypress runner process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Run Cypress tests with the *least privilege* necessary. Use a dedicated user account.
        *   *Never* run Cypress as root or administrator.
        *   Use a containerized environment (e.g., Docker) with limited privileges.
        *   Regularly review and audit permissions.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive Cypress Access to External Resources](./threats/overly_permissive_cypress_access_to_external_resources.md)

* **Threat:** Overly Permissive Cypress Access to External Resources
    * **Description:** Cypress tests are configured to access external resources (databases, APIs, cloud services, etc.) with overly broad permissions. An attacker who compromises the Cypress tests could leverage these permissions to access or modify sensitive data in those external resources. This is a direct threat related to the execution context of Cypress.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification of data in external systems, potential for lateral movement to other systems.
    * **Cypress Component Affected:** Any Cypress command that interacts with external resources (e.g., `cy.request()`, custom commands that use external libraries).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when granting access to external resources.
        * Use dedicated service accounts with limited, specific permissions for Cypress to interact with external systems.
        * Regularly review and audit the permissions granted to Cypress for accessing external resources.
        * Use environment variables or a secrets management solution to securely store credentials for accessing external resources.
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms on the external resources themselves.
