# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for cypress-io/cypress

## Mitigation Strategy: [Environment-Controlled Authentication Bypass (Cypress Code)](./mitigation_strategies/environment-controlled_authentication_bypass__cypress_code_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Within your Cypress test files, identify all instances of `cy.request()` used for authentication/authorization bypass.
    2.  Ensure you have environment variables defined in your Cypress configuration (e.g., `cypress.config.js` or environment-specific files) â€“ for example, `BYPASS_AUTH` (boolean) and `ENVIRONMENT` (string).
    3.  Wrap the bypass logic within a conditional block *inside your Cypress test code*:

        ```javascript
        if (Cypress.env('BYPASS_AUTH') === true && Cypress.env('ENVIRONMENT') === 'test') {
          // ... cy.request() calls for authentication bypass ...
        } else {
          // ... Standard login flow through the UI using cy.get(), cy.type(), etc. ...
        }
        ```
    4.  For any test that *requires* the standard login flow, ensure it's *not* within the conditional block, or add an explicit `else` condition to handle the UI-based login.
    5.  Document within the test file comments the purpose and conditions of the bypass.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass Backdoor (Severity: Critical):** Prevents bypass code from executing in unintended environments (staging/production) *if* environment variables are correctly configured externally.
    *   **Unauthorized API Access (Severity: High):** Limits the scope of the bypass to the testing environment, reducing the risk of misuse *if* environment variables are correctly configured.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass Backdoor:** Risk significantly reduced, dependent on external CI/CD configuration.  Within Cypress itself, the code is now conditional.
    *   **Unauthorized API Access:** Risk reduced, as the bypass is conditionally active only within the test environment (again, dependent on external configuration).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Cypress test files: `cypress/e2e/auth.cy.js`, `cypress/e2e/api_tests.cy.js` (conditional logic implemented).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive Review: Need to review *all* test files to ensure *no* `cy.request()` calls bypass authentication outside of the conditional block.
    *   Test Coverage: Ensure tests exist that explicitly cover both the bypass and non-bypass scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secrets Access via `Cypress.env()`](./mitigation_strategies/secrets_access_via__cypress_env___.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Within your Cypress test files, identify all instances where sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.) is hardcoded.
    2.  Replace all hardcoded values with calls to `Cypress.env()`:

        ```javascript
        // BAD:
        const apiKey = 'my-secret-api-key';

        // GOOD:
        const apiKey = Cypress.env('API_KEY');
        ```
    3.  Ensure that the corresponding environment variables (e.g., `API_KEY`) are defined in your Cypress configuration or are provided through your CI/CD pipeline.  (This part is *external* to Cypress, but the *usage* is within Cypress).
    4.  Add comments within the test file to indicate which environment variables are used and their purpose.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Test Code (Severity: High):** Prevents hardcoding of sensitive data directly within the test scripts.
    *   **Credential Leakage (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk if the test code repository is compromised (as the secrets themselves are not in the code).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Test Code:** Risk significantly reduced, *assuming* the environment variables are managed securely externally.
    *   **Credential Leakage:** Risk reduced, dependent on the security of the external secrets management system.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Cypress test files: Partially implemented. Some tests use `Cypress.env()`, but others still have hardcoded values.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Complete Migration: Need to refactor *all* Cypress tests to use `Cypress.env()` for *all* sensitive data.
    *   Consistency Check:  Ensure all environment variables used in tests are documented and consistently defined across different environments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [XSS Input Validation Testing (Cypress Assertions)](./mitigation_strategies/xss_input_validation_testing__cypress_assertions_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Within your Cypress test files, create dedicated tests (or add to existing tests) that specifically target input fields susceptible to XSS.
    2.  Use `cy.get()` to select the input field.
    3.  Use `cy.type()` to inject XSS payloads (e.g., `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
    4.  *Crucially*, use Cypress assertions to verify that the XSS payload is *not* executed:
        *   `cy.on('window:alert', (str) => { expect(str).to.not.equal('XSS'); });` (Check that no alert box with the payload appears).
        *   `cy.get('script').should('not.exist');` (Check that no script tag was injected into the DOM).
        *   `cy.contains('<script>').should('not.exist');` (Check for the presence of the injected script tag text).
    5.  Repeat this process with a variety of XSS payloads.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS Vulnerabilities Introduced by Test Code (Severity: Medium):** Ensures the test code itself doesn't trigger XSS.
    *   **Application XSS Vulnerabilities (Severity: High):** Helps identify and prevent XSS in the application (secondary benefit, as the focus is on Cypress-specific risks).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS Vulnerabilities Introduced by Test Code:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **Application XSS Vulnerabilities:** Contributes to reducing application XSS risk (but relies on the application's own security).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Cypress test files: A few basic XSS tests exist in `cypress/e2e/security.cy.js`, but they are not comprehensive.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive Coverage: Need tests for *all* relevant input fields.
    *   Wider Payload Range: Use a broader range of XSS payloads (OWASP cheat sheet).
    *   Specific Assertions: Use more specific assertions (like `cy.on('window:alert')`) to directly check for XSS execution.
