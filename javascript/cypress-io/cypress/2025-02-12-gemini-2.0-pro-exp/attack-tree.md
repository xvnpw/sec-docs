## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Supply Chain Attack (NPM) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_supply_chain_attack__npm___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a legitimate NPM package that Cypress (or one of its dependencies) relies on. The attacker injects malicious code into the package. When Cypress (or the application using Cypress) installs or updates this compromised package, the malicious code is executed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1 Supply Chain Attack (NPM) on Cypress Runner [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_supply_chain_attack__npm__on_cypress_runner__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1.1.2, but specifically targets packages used within the Cypress runner environment, such as Cypress plugins. A compromised plugin can execute arbitrary code within the testing context.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3 Compromise Test Runner (e.g., via Compromised CI/CD) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3_compromise_test_runner__e_g___via_compromised_cicd___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline used to run Cypress tests. They modify the pipeline configuration or inject malicious code into the test environment, allowing them to execute arbitrary code or manipulate test results.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.2 Inject Malicious Code via `cy.visit`, `cy.task` [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_2_inject_malicious_code_via__cy_visit____cy_task___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the application or test code where unsanitized user input is passed directly to `cy.visit` or, more critically, `cy.task`.  `cy.task` executes code in the Node.js environment, providing a direct path to arbitrary code execution.  `cy.visit` could be used to load a malicious page.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (with input validation) to Medium (without)
*   **Impact:** Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Bypass CORS Configuration (e.g., Disable Web Security) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_bypass_cors_configuration__e_g___disable_web_security___high_risk_.md)

*    **Description:** Cypress allows disabling web security features, including Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), for testing purposes. If this configuration is accidentally or maliciously enabled in a production-like environment, it opens the application to cross-origin attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (should be prevented by configuration management)
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [2.3.3 Abuse `cy.request` or `cy.task` [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2_3_3_abuse__cy_request__or__cy_task___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses `cy.request` to send sensitive data extracted from the application or testing environment to an attacker-controlled server.  Alternatively, `cy.task` could be used to execute Node.js code that performs the exfiltration.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
