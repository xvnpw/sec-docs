# Attack Surface Analysis for cypress-io/cypress

## Attack Surface: [1. Vulnerable Test Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/1__vulnerable_test_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:**  Third-party Node.js packages used within Cypress tests (plugins, custom commands, helper libraries) may contain security vulnerabilities.
*   **Cypress Contribution:** Cypress's extensibility through plugins and custom commands necessitates the use of external dependencies, increasing the potential for introducing vulnerable code.  This is a *direct* consequence of Cypress's design.
*   **Example:** A Cypress plugin used for generating test data relies on an outdated version of `faker.js` that has a known Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker could exploit the vulnerability in the dependency during test execution, potentially leading to denial of service in the CI/CD environment, or even code execution if the vulnerability allows it.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if the vulnerability allows code execution in a sensitive environment).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update test dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    *   Use a lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
    *   Employ a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Carefully vet and select only well-maintained and reputable Cypress plugins.

## Attack Surface: [2. Secrets Exposure in Test Code](./attack_surfaces/2__secrets_exposure_in_test_code.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, passwords, database credentials) are inadvertently included in test code or configuration files.
*   **Cypress Contribution:** Cypress tests often require interaction with APIs and services, creating a temptation to hardcode credentials for convenience.  The need to interact with real or mock services *within the Cypress test context* is the direct link.
*   **Example:** A Cypress test includes a hardcoded AWS access key ID and secret access key to interact with an S3 bucket during testing.  This code is committed to a public GitHub repository.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker could gain access to the exposed secrets and use them to compromise the associated services (e.g., access data, modify resources, incur costs).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Never* hardcode secrets in test code or configuration files.
    *   Use environment variables (e.g., `CYPRESS_API_KEY`) and access them within tests using `Cypress.env()`.
    *   Utilize a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
    *   Implement pre-commit hooks or CI/CD checks (e.g., using tools like `git-secrets` or TruffleHog) to scan for potential secrets exposure.

## Attack Surface: [3. Malicious Test Code Injection (CI/CD)](./attack_surfaces/3__malicious_test_code_injection__cicd_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline or source code repository and injects malicious code into Cypress tests.
*   **Cypress Contribution:** Cypress tests are executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline, making them a potential target.  The fact that Cypress *is the testing framework being executed* is the direct link.  The attacker is targeting the Cypress test execution itself.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a developer's credentials and modifies a Cypress test to include a script that exfiltrates environment variables from the CI/CD runner.
*   **Impact:**  The injected code could compromise the CI/CD environment, steal sensitive data, deploy malicious artifacts, or even compromise the application being tested.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls and the principle of least privilege for the CI/CD pipeline and source code repository.
    *   Require multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all users with access to these systems.
    *   Use code reviews and require approvals for all changes to test code.
    *   Run Cypress tests in isolated environments (e.g., Docker containers) to limit the impact of any potential compromise.
    *   Monitor CI/CD logs for suspicious activity and implement security alerts.

## Attack Surface: [4. Running Tests Against Production](./attack_surfaces/4__running_tests_against_production.md)

*   **Description:** Executing Cypress end-to-end tests directly against a live production environment.
*   **Cypress Contribution:** Cypress's ability to interact with a live application *as a browser automation tool* makes it tempting (but dangerous) to test directly against production. This is a direct consequence of Cypress's capabilities.
*   **Example:** A Cypress test that creates and deletes user accounts is accidentally run against the production database, resulting in the deletion of real user data.
*   **Impact:**  Data loss, service disruption, exposure of sensitive information, and potential legal or reputational damage.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   *Never* run Cypress tests directly against a production environment without extreme caution and safeguards.
    *   Always use a dedicated testing or staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible.
    *   If absolutely necessary to test *read-only* functionality in production, do so with extreme care, robust monitoring, and alerting, and with a clear understanding of the risks. Implement circuit breakers or kill switches to quickly stop tests if issues arise.

## Attack Surface: [5. Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Cypress Plugins](./attack_surfaces/5__vulnerabilities_in_third-party_cypress_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within third-party Cypress plugins that extend Cypress's core functionality.
*   **Cypress Contribution:** Cypress's plugin architecture allows for easy extension, but this also introduces the risk of using vulnerable plugins. The direct link is the use of the *Cypress plugin system itself*.
*   **Example:** A Cypress plugin designed to interact with a specific API contains a vulnerability that allows for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   **Impact:** The plugin's vulnerability could be exploited to compromise the test environment or potentially the application being tested, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet any third-party plugins before using them. Research the plugin's reputation, review its source code (if available), and check for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Prefer plugins from reputable sources and those that are actively maintained.
    *   Regularly update plugins to the latest versions to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider contributing to the security of open-source plugins by reporting any vulnerabilities you find.
