# Threat Model Analysis for cypress-io/cypress

## Threat: [Malicious Test Injection](./threats/malicious_test_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the test codebase injects malicious JavaScript code into Cypress test files. This code executes within the browser context during test runs, allowing interaction with the application under test with Cypress's elevated privileges. The attacker might exfiltrate data, manipulate application data, or perform actions on behalf of a user.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, account takeover, denial of service, reputational damage, financial loss.

**Cypress Component Affected:** Cypress Test Runner, Test Code, Browser Context

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict code review processes for all Cypress test code changes.
* Enforce strong access control and permission management for the test codebase.
* Utilize static code analysis and linting tools to detect suspicious code in tests.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to developers working with test code.
* Implement robust CI/CD pipeline security measures to prevent unauthorized code injection.

## Threat: [Compromised Test Environment Exploited via Cypress](./threats/compromised_test_environment_exploited_via_cypress.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the test environment and leverages Cypress to further their attack.  In a compromised test environment, an attacker could manipulate Cypress test execution, modify test scripts or Cypress configuration to inject malicious code into the application *during* Cypress testing, or tamper with test results to hide malicious activity. They could use Cypress's browser automation capabilities to interact with the application in ways that facilitate further exploitation.

**Impact:** Tampered test results leading to undetected vulnerabilities, data breaches, lateral movement to other environments, injection of malware into the application under test *through* the testing process.

**Cypress Component Affected:** Cypress Test Runner, Test Environment Infrastructure, Cypress Configuration

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Harden the test environment operating system and infrastructure with security patches and strong configurations.
* Implement network segmentation to isolate the test environment.
* Establish strong access controls and authentication for the test environment.
* Implement security monitoring and logging within the test environment.
* Regularly perform vulnerability scanning and penetration testing of the test environment.

## Threat: [Compromised CI/CD Pipeline Integration Leading to Malicious Cypress Execution](./threats/compromised_cicd_pipeline_integration_leading_to_malicious_cypress_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline and uses this access to manipulate Cypress tests or their execution within the pipeline. This could involve injecting malicious Cypress tests into the pipeline workflow, tampering with existing tests to bypass security checks, or modifying the Cypress execution environment in CI/CD to introduce vulnerabilities or exfiltrate data during automated testing.

**Impact:** Deployment of vulnerable code due to bypassed security checks, data breaches through manipulated test execution in CI/CD, unauthorized access to CI/CD secrets, supply chain compromise affecting the testing process.

**Cypress Component Affected:** CI/CD Pipeline, Cypress Test Execution within CI/CD, Cypress Configuration within CI/CD

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure and access controls with strong authentication and authorization.
* Implement code signing and integrity checks for Cypress tests within the pipeline.
* Regularly audit and monitor the CI/CD pipeline for suspicious activity.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to CI/CD pipeline users and processes.
* Harden CI/CD agents and runners, keeping them updated and secure.
* Implement robust dependency management and vulnerability scanning for CI/CD tools.

## Threat: [Compromised Cypress Toolchain (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/compromised_cypress_toolchain__supply_chain_attack_.md)

**Description:** The Cypress toolchain, including distribution channels like npm or download servers, is compromised. This leads to the distribution of malicious versions of Cypress or its dependencies. Developers unknowingly download and use a compromised Cypress version, leading to compromise of their testing environment and potentially the application under test.

**Impact:** Installation of backdoored or malicious Cypress versions, widespread compromise of testing processes, potential compromise of applications under test, large-scale supply chain impact.

**Cypress Component Affected:** Cypress Distribution Channels (npm, download servers), Cypress CLI, Cypress Core

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use package lock files (`package-lock.json`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
* Verify checksums or signatures of Cypress downloads when possible.
* Monitor for security advisories related to Cypress and its toolchain from trusted sources.
* Implement network security measures to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks during Cypress downloads.
* Consider using private npm registries or mirroring Cypress dependencies for greater control.
