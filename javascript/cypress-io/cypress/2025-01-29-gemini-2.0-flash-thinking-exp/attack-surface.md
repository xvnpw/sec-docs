# Attack Surface Analysis for cypress-io/cypress

## Attack Surface: [Data Exposure via Cypress Dashboard](./attack_surfaces/data_exposure_via_cypress_dashboard.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive test data (recordings, screenshots, results) uploaded to the Cypress Dashboard could be exposed to unauthorized parties.
*   **How Cypress Contributes:** Cypress Dashboard is a cloud service provided by Cypress.io, designed to store and manage test results and artifacts generated by Cypress tests. Using the Dashboard inherently involves transmitting and storing potentially sensitive data on Cypress's infrastructure.
*   **Example:** A misconfiguration in Cypress Dashboard project settings or a vulnerability in Cypress.io's platform allows unauthorized users to access test recordings that contain sensitive customer data, API responses revealing internal system details, or screenshots showing confidential application interfaces.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive application and customer data, potential regulatory compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA), reputational damage, loss of customer trust.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Dashboard Access Control:** Implement the most restrictive access control policies possible on the Cypress Dashboard. Limit access to projects and test results to only essential personnel on a need-to-know basis. Utilize role-based access control features if available.
    *   **Regular Permission Audits:** Periodically audit and review Cypress Dashboard project permissions to ensure they remain appropriate and aligned with the principle of least privilege. Remove unnecessary user access promptly.
    *   **Minimize Data Capture:**  Proactively minimize the capture and upload of sensitive data to the Cypress Dashboard. Avoid including sensitive information in test descriptions, custom commands, or application data used during tests. Sanitize or mask sensitive data within the application itself before tests are executed.
    *   **Consider Self-Hosting Alternatives (If Available):** For extremely sensitive projects where cloud data storage is unacceptable, investigate if Cypress offers or integrates with self-hosted dashboard solutions. If not, carefully evaluate the risk of using the cloud dashboard against the benefits.
    *   **Data Retention Policies and Purging:** Implement and strictly enforce data retention policies for test data stored on the Cypress Dashboard. Regularly purge old or unnecessary test recordings and artifacts to minimize the window of potential exposure.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Secrets in Test Code](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_secrets_in_test_code.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive credentials, API keys, or internal application details hardcoded or inadvertently exposed within Cypress test code can be compromised, leading to unauthorized access and potential breaches.
*   **How Cypress Contributes:** Cypress tests are written in JavaScript and are part of the application's codebase. Developers, when creating tests, might mistakenly embed secrets directly within test files or expose them through logging or debugging statements within the test code. Cypress's execution environment then runs this code, potentially revealing these secrets.
*   **Example:** An API key required to interact with a backend service is directly hardcoded as a string within a Cypress test file for convenience. This test file is then committed to a version control system, potentially exposing the API key to anyone with access to the repository, including external attackers if the repository is public or compromised.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, compromise of external services, service disruption, financial loss due to unauthorized usage of APIs or services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Eliminate Hardcoded Secrets:**  Absolutely avoid hardcoding any secrets directly within Cypress test code. This is a fundamental security best practice.
    *   **Utilize Environment Variables:** Store all secrets as environment variables. Access these secrets within Cypress tests using `Cypress.env()`. Configure your test environments (local, CI/CD) to securely provide these environment variables.
    *   **Secure Secret Management Tools Integration:** Integrate Cypress test environments with dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault). Retrieve secrets dynamically at runtime from these secure vaults instead of relying on environment variables where possible.
    *   **Rigorous Code Reviews:** Conduct mandatory and thorough code reviews of all Cypress test code before merging changes. Specifically scrutinize test files for any potential hardcoded secrets, sensitive data, or insecure logging practices.
    *   **Automated Secret Scanning:** Implement automated secret scanning tools within your development pipeline to continuously scan Cypress test code and configuration files for accidentally committed secrets.
    *   **`.gitignore` and Secure Storage for Configuration:** Ensure sensitive configuration files or files that might contain secrets (even temporarily) are properly added to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits to version control. Store sensitive configuration separately and securely, outside of the codebase.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Cypress and Node.js Ecosystem](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_cypress_and_node_js_ecosystem.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities present in Cypress itself, the underlying Node.js runtime environment, or any of the numerous dependencies used by Cypress can be exploited to compromise the testing process, the system running Cypress, or potentially even the application under test.
*   **How Cypress Contributes:** Cypress is built upon Node.js and relies on a vast ecosystem of open-source Node.js packages (dependencies).  Vulnerabilities discovered in any of these components directly impact Cypress users, as these vulnerabilities can be exploited through Cypress's execution environment or by crafting malicious test cases that leverage these weaknesses.
*   **Example:** A critical security vulnerability is identified in a widely used Node.js package that Cypress depends on (directly or indirectly). An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious Cypress test that, when executed, triggers the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution on the machine running Cypress or allowing them to compromise the test environment.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, supply chain attacks, compromise of developer machines or CI/CD infrastructure, potential lateral movement to production systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Proactive Cypress and Dependency Updates:**  Establish a process for regularly updating Cypress itself and all its dependencies to the latest versions. Stay informed about Cypress release notes and security advisories.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning and Management:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, Yarn audit, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) within your development and CI/CD pipelines. These tools should continuously monitor for known vulnerabilities in Cypress dependencies and alert developers to remediate them promptly.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Integrate SCA tools into your development lifecycle to gain comprehensive visibility into all open-source components used by Cypress and your application. SCA helps manage and track vulnerabilities, licenses, and other risks associated with open-source dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring and Alerting:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD, GitHub Security Advisories) for Cypress, Node.js, and their dependencies. Set up alerts to be notified immediately of newly disclosed vulnerabilities that might affect your Cypress setup.
    *   **Dependency Pinning and Lock Files:** Utilize dependency pinning and lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json` for npm, `yarn.lock` for Yarn) to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments and prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities. Regularly review and update these lock files when dependencies are intentionally upgraded.
    *   **Regular Security Assessments:** Include Cypress and its dependencies in regular security assessments and penetration testing activities to proactively identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
