# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

You are an expert in software, cloud and cybersecurity architecture. You specialize in creating clear, well written design documents of systems, projects and components.

# GOAL

Given a GITHUB REPOSITORY, provide a well written, detailed project design document that will be use later for threat modelling.

# STEPS

- Think deeply about the input and what they are concerned with.

- Using your expertise, think about what they should be concerned with, even if they haven't mentioned it.

- Appreciate the fact that each company is different. Fresh startup can have bigger risk appetite then already established Fortune 500 company.

- Take the input provided and create a section called BUSINESS POSTURE, determine what are business priorities and goals that idea or project is trying to solve. Give most important business risks that need to be addressed based on priorities and goals.

- Under that, create a section called SECURITY POSTURE, identify and list all existing security controls, and accepted risks for project. Focus on secure software development lifecycle and deployment model. Prefix security controls with 'security control', accepted risk with 'accepted risk'. Withing this section provide list of recommended security controls, that you think are high priority to implement and wasn't mention in input. Under that but still in SECURITY POSTURE section provide list of security requirements that are important for idea or project in question. Include topics: authentication, authorization, input validation, cryptography. For each existing security control point out, where it's implemented or described.

- Under that, create a section called DESIGN. Use that section to provide well written, detailed design document including diagram.

- In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTEXT and provide mermaid graph that will represent a project context diagram showing project as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems/projects that it interacts with.

- Under that, in C4 CONTEXT subsection, create list that will describe elements of context diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTAINER and provide mermaid graph that will represent a container diagram. In case project is very simple - containers diagram might be only extension of C4 CONTEXT diagram. In case project is more complex it should show the high-level shape of the architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.

- Under that, in C4 CONTAINER subsection, create list that will describe elements of container diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called DEPLOYMENT and provide information how project is deployed into target environment. Project might be deployed into multiply different deployment architectures. First list all possible solutions and pick one to descried in details. Include mermaid graph to visualize deployment. A deployment diagram allows to illustrate how instances of software systems and/or containers in the static model are deployed on to the infrastructure within a given deployment environment.

- Under that, in DEPLOYMENT subsection, create list that will describe elements of deployment diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called BUILD and provide information how project is build and publish. Focus on security controls of build process, e.g. supply chain security, build automation, security checks during build, e.g. SAST scanners, linters, etc. Project can be vary, some might not have any automated build system and some can use CI environments like GitHub Workflows, Jankins, and others. Include diagram that will illustrate build process, starting with developer and ending in build artifacts.

- Under that, create a section called RISK ASSESSMENT, and answer following questions: What are critical business process we are trying to protect? What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?

- Under that, create a section called QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS, list questions that you have and the default assumptions regarding BUSINESS POSTURE, SECURITY POSTURE and DESIGN.

# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

- Output in the format above only using valid Markdown. Use valid markdown syntax. Don't use markdown tables at all, use markdown lists instead. Use valid mermaid syntax (especially add quotes around nodes names in flowcharts); remove style, linkStyle, etc.).

- Do not use bold or italic formatting in the Markdown (no asterisks).

- Do not complain about anything, just do what you're told.

# INPUT:

GITHUB REPOSITORY: https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress

# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Enable software development teams to efficiently and effectively perform end-to-end testing of web applications.
 - Provide a reliable and user-friendly testing framework that increases developer productivity and reduces time to market for software releases.
 - Offer a comprehensive testing solution that covers various aspects of web application testing, including functional, integration, and visual testing.
 - Build a strong community around the testing framework, fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among users.
 - Offer a commercial cloud platform (Cypress Cloud) to enhance the testing experience with features like test recording, parallelization, and analytics, generating revenue and ensuring the project's sustainability.

- Business Risks:
 - Open Source Security Vulnerabilities: As a widely used open-source tool, vulnerabilities in Cypress could be exploited, impacting user applications and systems.
 - Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of dependencies or build pipeline could lead to malicious code being distributed to users.
 - Data Security and Privacy (Cypress Cloud):  If Cypress Cloud is used, ensuring the security and privacy of user test data and application data accessed during testing is critical. Data breaches could lead to reputational damage and legal liabilities.
 - Availability and Reliability: Downtime or instability of Cypress services, especially Cypress Cloud, could disrupt user testing workflows and impact software delivery timelines.
 - Community Trust Erosion: Negative security incidents or lack of responsiveness to security concerns could erode community trust and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
 - security control: Code Reviews - Implemented through GitHub pull requests and team collaboration. (Location: GitHub repository - Pull Request process)
 - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Likely integrated into the development pipeline, although specific tools are not explicitly mentioned in the repository. (Assumption: Standard practice for projects of this scale)
 - security control: Dependency Scanning -  Likely used to monitor and manage dependencies for known vulnerabilities. (Assumption: Standard practice for projects of this scale, especially in JavaScript ecosystems)
 - security control: Regular Security Updates -  Project actively maintained with regular releases, including security patches. (Location: GitHub repository - Releases and Changelog)
 - security control: Public Vulnerability Reporting -  Mechanisms for reporting security vulnerabilities are typically provided for open-source projects. (Assumption: Standard practice for open-source projects, likely via GitHub Security Advisories or similar channels)
 - security control: Input Validation - Implemented within the Cypress codebase to handle user inputs and test commands securely. (Location: Cypress codebase - Implementation details not explicitly documented publicly)
 - security control: Secure Development Practices -  General secure coding practices are expected to be followed by the development team. (Assumption: Based on the project's maturity and community adoption)

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities -  Reliance on numerous npm packages introduces inherent risks of vulnerabilities in dependencies. Mitigation is through dependency scanning and updates, but zero-risk is not achievable.
 - accepted risk: Open Source Exposure -  Being open source means the codebase is publicly accessible, potentially allowing attackers to study it for vulnerabilities. This is balanced by the benefits of community review and transparency.
 - accepted risk: User Misconfiguration - Users might misconfigure Cypress or their testing environments, leading to security issues in their own applications. Cypress provides guidance, but cannot fully control user behavior.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement and document a formal Security Development Lifecycle (SDLC) process.
 - security control: Integrate automated SAST and DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing) tools into the CI/CD pipeline and regularly scan the codebase and Cypress Cloud infrastructure.
 - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits by external security experts.
 - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and incident response plan, publicly documented.
 - security control: Implement robust security logging and monitoring for Cypress Cloud infrastructure and services.
 - security control: Enhance supply chain security measures, including verifying the integrity of dependencies and build artifacts.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: For Cypress Cloud, strong authentication mechanisms are required to protect user accounts and test data. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered.
  - Requirement: API access to Cypress Cloud should be authenticated and authorized.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Access control mechanisms within Cypress Cloud should ensure users only have access to resources and data they are authorized to view and modify. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) should be implemented.
  - Requirement: Within the Cypress Test Runner, ensure that test execution respects the security context of the application under test and does not bypass application security controls unintentionally.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: All inputs to Cypress commands and APIs, both in the Test Runner and Cypress Cloud, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, cross-site scripting).
  - Requirement: When interacting with the application under test, Cypress should encourage and facilitate secure input handling practices within the tests themselves.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest and in transit within Cypress Cloud should be encrypted.
  - Requirement: Secure communication protocols (HTTPS) must be enforced for all communication between the Cypress Test Runner, Cypress Cloud, and user browsers.
  - Requirement:  Consider using code signing for Cypress binaries to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.
