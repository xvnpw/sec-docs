*   Modify Cypress Configuration to Execute Malicious Code
*   Replace Cypress Binaries with Malicious Versions

## Attack Tree Path: [1. HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Cypress's Execution Context](./attack_tree_paths/1__high-risk_path__critical_node_exploit_cypress's_execution_context.md)

*   This path leverages the fact that Cypress runs within the browser alongside the application, granting it access to the same data and capabilities as the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE: Access Sensitive Application Data](./attack_tree_paths/2__high-risk_path__critical_node_access_sensitive_application_data.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting Cypress's ability to access data within the browser's context.
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Read Cookies:** Attackers can use Cypress commands to read cookies, potentially exposing session tokens or other sensitive credentials.
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Read Local Storage:** Cypress can access local storage, which might contain user data or application configurations.
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Intercept Network Requests:** `cy.intercept()` allows intercepting and modifying network requests. Attackers can capture sensitive data in transit or manipulate requests to bypass security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. HIGH-RISK PATH: Execute Malicious Actions as a Legitimate User](./attack_tree_paths/3__high-risk_path_execute_malicious_actions_as_a_legitimate_user.md)

*   This path exploits Cypress's ability to automate user actions.
    *   Attackers can script Cypress to perform actions a legitimate user could, but with malicious intent (e.g., submitting harmful data, triggering unintended workflows).
    *   Cypress can bypass client-side validation by directly interacting with the DOM or sending requests without going through the UI.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. HIGH-RISK PATH: Exfiltrate Data](./attack_tree_paths/4__high-risk_path_exfiltrate_data.md)

*   This path focuses on using Cypress to send captured data to an attacker-controlled location.
    *   Attackers can use `cy.request()` to send captured data to an external server they control.
    *   If the test environment allows, attackers might write data to the file system using `cy.writeFile()` for later retrieval.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Cypress's API and Features](./attack_tree_paths/5__critical_node_exploit_cypress's_api_and_features.md)

*   This node represents the potential for misusing Cypress's built-in functions for malicious purposes.
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Abuse `cy.request()`:**
        *   Attackers can use `cy.request()` to interact with internal APIs directly, potentially bypassing authentication or authorization checks intended for the UI.
        *   If the application relies on Cypress tests to interact with external services, attackers might manipulate these tests to make the application send requests to attacker-controlled servers or internal resources (SSRF).
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Abuse `cy.task()`:** `cy.task()` allows running code on the Node.js server where Cypress is running. If not properly secured, attackers could execute arbitrary commands on the test runner environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. CRITICAL NODE: Compromise the Test Environment](./attack_tree_paths/6__critical_node_compromise_the_test_environment.md)

*   This node focuses on attacks that target the environment where Cypress tests are executed.
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Inject Malicious Code into Test Files:**
        *   Attackers could alter existing test files to include malicious logic that runs during test execution.
        *   New test files can be created to specifically target vulnerabilities or exfiltrate data.
    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH: Compromise the CI/CD Pipeline:**
        *   Attackers could alter the Cypress configuration file (`cypress.config.js` or similar) to execute malicious code during test runs.
        *   In a compromised CI/CD environment, attackers could replace legitimate Cypress binaries with malicious versions.
