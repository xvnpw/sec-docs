# Threat Model Analysis for cypress-io/cypress

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./threats/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Test Code Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker, with access to the test codebase, could inject malicious JavaScript code into Cypress test files. This code is then executed by the Cypress Test Runner, allowing interaction with the application under test in unintended ways. The attacker might exfiltrate data, manipulate application state, or access the testing infrastructure *through the Cypress execution environment*.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, application compromise, testing infrastructure compromise, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Cypress Component:** Test Runner, `cy` commands, test files (`.spec.js`, `.cy.js`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all Cypress test code.
        *   Enforce strong access controls and authentication for code repositories.
        *   Utilize static code analysis tools to scan test code for potential vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly audit developer access and permissions.
        *   Consider using a separate, isolated environment for test development.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Test Artifacts](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_test_artifacts.md)

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure via Test Artifacts**
    *   **Description:** Cypress automatically captures screenshots and video recordings of test runs. If these artifacts contain sensitive information and access to them is not properly controlled, particularly within the Cypress Dashboard, an attacker could gain unauthorized access. This risk is directly tied to how Cypress manages and presents these artifacts.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach, privacy violations, compliance violations, reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Cypress Component:** Test Runner (screenshot and video capture functionality), Cypress Dashboard (storage and access of artifacts).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Cypress Dashboard project visibility settings to restrict access to authorized users only.
        *   Be mindful of the data displayed during tests and avoid displaying sensitive information unnecessarily.
        *   Implement data masking or redaction techniques within the application under test to prevent sensitive data from appearing in test artifacts.
        *   Review Cypress Dashboard security settings and access logs regularly.
        *   Consider the implications of storing test artifacts on a third-party service and explore self-hosted options if necessary.

## Threat: [Configuration Manipulation Leading to Security Bypass](./threats/configuration_manipulation_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

*   **Configuration Manipulation Leading to Security Bypass**
    *   **Description:** An attacker gaining access to Cypress configuration files (e.g., `cypress.config.js`) could modify settings that directly impact Cypress's security posture. Disabling `chromeWebSecurity` is a prime example, allowing tests to bypass standard browser security restrictions, potentially masking vulnerabilities that would be present in a real-world scenario. This directly involves Cypress's configuration options.
    *   **Impact:**  False sense of security, undetected vulnerabilities, potential for exploitation in production.
    *   **Affected Cypress Component:** Configuration loading mechanism, `cypress.config.js`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure Cypress configuration files with appropriate file system permissions.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive configuration directly in the configuration file; use environment variables or secrets management.
        *   Implement checks and balances to ensure critical security settings are not inadvertently disabled.
        *   Regularly review Cypress configuration for any unauthorized or suspicious changes.
