# Attack Surface Analysis for cypress-io/cypress

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Application State and Data](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_application_state_and_data.md)

* **Description:** Cypress has direct access to the application's DOM, JavaScript state, local storage, session storage, and cookies during testing. This privileged access can expose sensitive information.
* **How Cypress Contributes:** Cypress's core functionality involves inspecting and interacting with the application's internal state. This inherent capability allows access to potentially sensitive data.
* **Example:** A Cypress test might inadvertently log the value of a user's password stored in local storage or capture a screenshot displaying sensitive personal information.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive user data, potential violation of privacy regulations, and reputational damage.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid storing sensitive data in local storage or session storage if possible.
    * Implement robust data masking or redaction techniques in the application, especially for data displayed on the UI.
    * Review Cypress test logs and artifacts (screenshots, videos) regularly to ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently captured.
    * Configure Cypress to avoid logging sensitive network requests or responses.
    * Implement access controls for Cypress test artifacts.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Injection via Compromised Pipelines](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_injection_via_compromised_pipelines.md)

* **Description:** If the development or CI/CD pipeline where Cypress tests are executed is compromised, attackers can inject malicious Cypress tests.
* **How Cypress Contributes:** Cypress tests have the ability to interact with the application programmatically, including making API calls and manipulating the DOM. This power can be abused by malicious tests.
* **Example:** An attacker injects a Cypress test that uses `cy.request()` to exfiltrate data to an external server or modifies application data in a harmful way.
* **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modifications to application data, denial of service, and potential introduction of vulnerabilities into the application.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the CI/CD pipeline with strong authentication, authorization, and regular security audits.
    * Implement code review processes for Cypress tests, especially those interacting with sensitive parts of the application.
    * Use signed commits and verify the integrity of the test codebase.
    * Isolate the test environment from production environments.
    * Implement monitoring and alerting for unusual activity in the CI/CD pipeline.
