# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, impress.js, is a JavaScript presentation framework that allows users to create visually engaging presentations using CSS3 transforms and transitions.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable users to create dynamic and visually appealing presentations.
  - Provide an open-source, customizable alternative to traditional slide-based presentation software.
  - Foster a community around creative web-based presentations.
  - Offer a lightweight and flexible solution for web-based presentations.

- Business Risks:
  - Reputational damage if the framework is found to have security vulnerabilities that lead to website compromise or user data exposure (if presentations handle user data).
  - Risk of supply chain attacks if dependencies are compromised, affecting users who rely on the framework.
  - Risk of reduced adoption if the framework is perceived as insecure or unreliable.
  - Risk of intellectual property infringement if the framework incorporates code or concepts that violate existing patents or copyrights.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Review - The project is open source, allowing for community review of the code. Implemented: GitHub repository and community contributions.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Project uses standard JavaScript dependency management practices (likely npm or similar). Implemented: package.json and build process.
  - security control: Client-Side Execution - The framework runs entirely client-side, reducing server-side attack surface. Implemented: Design of impress.js as a client-side library.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Client-Side Vulnerabilities - As a client-side JavaScript framework, it is inherently susceptible to client-side vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if used improperly or if vulnerabilities are discovered in the framework itself.
  - accepted risk: Browser Security Reliance - Security relies heavily on the security features and policies of modern web browsers.
  - accepted risk: Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities - Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies could be introduced into the framework.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) - Integrate SAST tools into the build process to automatically scan the codebase for potential security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) - Encourage users to implement CSP in websites embedding impress.js presentations to mitigate XSS risks.
  - security control: Subresource Integrity (SRI) - Recommend and potentially provide SRI hashes for impress.js and its dependencies when served from CDNs to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to impress.js itself as it is a client-side framework. Authentication might be relevant for systems that manage or host impress.js presentations, but not for the core library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to impress.js itself. Authorization would be relevant for systems managing access to presentations created with impress.js.
  - Input Validation: While impress.js primarily renders HTML and CSS, if there are any features that accept user input (e.g., through JavaScript APIs), proper input validation is crucial to prevent injection attacks. Users of impress.js should be educated on the importance of sanitizing any user-provided content they incorporate into their presentations.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for impress.js functionality. However, if presentations handle sensitive data, encryption in transit (HTTPS) and potentially encryption at rest (if presentations are stored) would be relevant considerations for the hosting environment, not impress.js itself.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Development and maintenance of the impress.js library.
  - Distribution of the impress.js library to users.
  - Usage of impress.js to create and deliver presentations.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of impress.js: High sensitivity (confidentiality and integrity). Compromise could lead to vulnerabilities in the framework.
  - Build artifacts (JavaScript, CSS): Medium sensitivity (integrity and availability). Compromise could lead to distribution of malicious code.
  - Project infrastructure (build systems, repositories): High sensitivity (confidentiality, integrity, and availability). Compromise could disrupt development and distribution.
  - Presentation content created by users: Sensitivity varies depending on the content. Could range from public information to confidential business data. Security of presentation content is primarily the responsibility of the users and hosting providers, not the impress.js project itself.
