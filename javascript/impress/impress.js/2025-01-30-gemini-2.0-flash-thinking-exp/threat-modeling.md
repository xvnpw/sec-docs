# Threat Model Analysis for impress/impress.js

## Threat: [Client-Side Script Injection (XSS) via Presentation Content](./threats/client-side_script_injection__xss__via_presentation_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the impress.js presentation content. This is achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles user input or external data used to generate the presentation. The attacker can manipulate text content, HTML attributes, or custom data attributes within the presentation steps. When a user views the presentation, the injected script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Session hijacking: Stealing user session cookies or tokens to impersonate the user.
        *   Malicious redirection: Redirecting the user to a phishing or malware-hosting website.
        *   Presentation defacement: Altering the presentation content to display misleading or harmful information.
        *   Data theft: Accessing sensitive data accessible by JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially including data from the application itself or other browser resources.
        *   Malware distribution: Injecting code that downloads and executes malware on the user's machine.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Presentation Content Rendering: Specifically how impress.js processes and renders the HTML content provided for each step. The vulnerability lies in the application's handling of data *before* it reaches impress.js for rendering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all data from untrusted sources (user input, external APIs) before incorporating it into impress.js presentation content. Use context-aware escaping (e.g., HTML escaping for text content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript contexts).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP header to control the sources from which scripts can be loaded and restrict inline script execution. This significantly reduces the impact of XSS.
        *   **Template Security:** If using templating engines, ensure they are configured and used securely to prevent template injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities in presentation content generation and handling.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in impress.js Library (Dependency Vulnerability)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_impress_js_library__dependency_vulnerability_.md)

*   **Description:** The impress.js library itself might contain security vulnerabilities. If the application uses a vulnerable version of impress.js, attackers could exploit these known vulnerabilities to compromise the application or user browsers. Vulnerabilities could range from XSS flaws within impress.js itself to other types of security issues.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exploitation of impress.js vulnerabilities: Attackers could leverage known vulnerabilities in impress.js to perform various attacks, such as XSS, DOM manipulation, or potentially more severe exploits depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
        *   Application compromise: In some cases, vulnerabilities in impress.js could be exploited to gain control over parts of the application or user sessions.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Impress.js Library Codebase: The core JavaScript code of the impress.js library itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep impress.js Updated:** Regularly update impress.js to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities. Monitor the impress.js project for security advisories and updates.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, OWASP Dependency-Check) to automatically identify known vulnerabilities in impress.js and its dependencies.
        *   **Security Monitoring:** Subscribe to security mailing lists or vulnerability databases that might report vulnerabilities related to JavaScript libraries like impress.js.
        *   **Consider using a well-maintained fork (if necessary):** If the official impress.js project is no longer actively maintained, consider using a reputable and actively maintained fork that addresses security concerns and receives updates. However, always carefully evaluate the trustworthiness of any fork.
