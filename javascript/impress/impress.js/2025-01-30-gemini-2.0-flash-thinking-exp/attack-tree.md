## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via impress.js Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_impress_js_weaknesses.md)

This is the overall attacker goal and is critical as it represents the successful compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.0] Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in impress.js](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_0__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_impress_js.md)

This path is high-risk because client-side vulnerabilities, especially XSS, can have a significant impact and are often difficult to detect and prevent completely.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.1] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Attributes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_1__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_data_attributes__critical_node_.md)

**Critical Node:** XSS is a highly impactful vulnerability allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the context of the application.
* **High-Risk Path:**  Impress.js heavily relies on `data-*` attributes, making this a prime attack surface. If these attributes are not handled securely, XSS is highly likely.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.1.1] Inject Malicious JavaScript in Data Attributes [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_1_1__inject_malicious_javascript_in_data_attributes__critical_node_.md)

**Critical Node:** Direct injection of malicious JavaScript into data attributes is a direct path to XSS.
* **High-Risk Path:** Attackers can attempt to inject JavaScript through various means if the application or impress.js itself doesn't properly sanitize or handle data attribute values.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.1.1.a] Modify Data Attributes via DOM Manipulation (Client-Side) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_1_1_a__modify_data_attributes_via_dom_manipulation__client-side___critical_node_.md)

**Critical Node:**  Client-side DOM manipulation is a readily available attack vector.
* **High-Risk Path:**  Attackers with even basic skills can use browser developer tools or browser extensions to modify `data-*` attributes in the loaded HTML. If impress.js processes these modified attributes without proper validation, XSS can occur.
* **Risk Factors**:
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Relatively easy for an attacker to perform client-side DOM manipulation.
    * **Impact:** Significant - Full XSS vulnerability.
    * **Effort:** Low - Requires minimal effort and readily available tools.
    * **Skill Level:** Low-Medium - Basic understanding of web development and browser tools.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Client-side modifications are often not logged server-side and can be difficult to detect without specific client-side monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.1.2] Leverage Vulnerabilities in impress.js's Data Attribute Parsing [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_1_2__leverage_vulnerabilities_in_impress_js's_data_attribute_parsing__critical_n_97c3a3eb.md)

**Critical Node:** Vulnerabilities within impress.js itself are critical as they affect all applications using the library.
* **High-Risk Path:** If impress.js has vulnerabilities in how it parses and processes `data-*` attributes, attackers could exploit these to inject malicious code even without directly modifying the attributes themselves.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.1.2.a] Exploit Improper Sanitization/Escaping of Data Attribute Values [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_1_2_a__exploit_improper_sanitizationescaping_of_data_attribute_values__critical__1c7b9e3a.md)

**Critical Node:** Improper sanitization is a common source of XSS vulnerabilities.
* **High-Risk Path:** If impress.js fails to properly sanitize or escape values read from `data-*` attributes before using them in DOM manipulation or other operations, it becomes vulnerable to XSS.
* **Risk Factors**:
    * **Likelihood:** Low-Medium - Depends on the code quality of impress.js and whether such vulnerabilities exist.
    * **Impact:** Significant - Full XSS vulnerability.
    * **Effort:** Medium - Requires vulnerability research and potentially exploit development.
    * **Skill Level:** Medium-High - Requires deeper understanding of web security and potentially reverse engineering.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries can be difficult to detect without code audits and security testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.2.2] Abuse Custom CSS/JavaScript Integration](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_2_2__abuse_custom_cssjavascript_integration.md)

* **High-Risk Path:** If the application extends impress.js with custom CSS or JavaScript, vulnerabilities in this custom integration can lead to code injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.2.2.b] Inject Malicious JavaScript via Custom Handlers (If Implemented by Application) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_2_2_b__inject_malicious_javascript_via_custom_handlers__if_implemented_by_applic_ab5ceba1.md)

**Critical Node:** Custom handlers are application-specific code and can be prone to vulnerabilities if not developed securely.
* **High-Risk Path:** If the application implements custom JavaScript handlers that interact with impress.js or are triggered by impress.js events, vulnerabilities in these handlers could be exploited to inject malicious JavaScript.
* **Risk Factors**:
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - If the application uses custom handlers, the likelihood of vulnerabilities depends on the security practices during their development.
    * **Impact:** Significant - Full XSS vulnerability.
    * **Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding of the application's custom code and finding vulnerabilities within it.
    * **Skill Level:** Medium - Requires web development and security testing skills.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard - Vulnerabilities in custom application code can be difficult to detect without thorough code review and testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.4] Information Disclosure via Client-Side Code](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_4__information_disclosure_via_client-side_code.md)

* **High-Risk Path:** Client-side code is inherently visible, and if sensitive information is present, it can be disclosed.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.4.1] Reverse Engineer Client-Side Logic](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_4_1__reverse_engineer_client-side_logic.md)

* **High-Risk Path:** Reverse engineering client-side code is always possible and relatively easy.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] [1.4.1.b] Extract Sensitive Information Embedded in Client-Side Code (API Keys, Configuration - Less Likely in impress.js itself, but possible in application using it) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path___1_4_1_b__extract_sensitive_information_embedded_in_client-side_code__api_keys__con_8e87a874.md)

**Critical Node:** Leaking sensitive information like API keys or configuration details can have severe consequences.
* **High-Risk Path:** If developers mistakenly embed sensitive information directly in client-side JavaScript code (including within impress.js presentation data or custom scripts), attackers can easily extract this information by examining the client-side code.
* **Risk Factors**:
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on developer practices and awareness of secure coding principles.
    * **Impact:** Significant-Critical - Depending on the sensitivity of the leaked information (API keys, credentials, internal URLs, etc.).
    * **Effort:** Low - Requires minimal effort to view client-side code.
    * **Skill Level:** Low - Basic web browsing skills are sufficient.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard - No active attack is occurring, making it difficult to detect without code reviews and security audits.
