# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a JavaScript library for creating presentations using HTML and CSS3 features.
*   Offer a more visually engaging and dynamic alternative to traditional slide-based presentations.
*   Enable developers and designers to leverage their existing web development skills.
*   Maintain a lightweight and performant library.
*   Foster an open-source community around the project.
*   Ensure cross-browser compatibility.

Business Risks:

*   **Data Integrity:** Since the library processes user-provided HTML and CSS, there's a risk of malicious code injection if not properly handled. This could lead to data breaches or website defacement if presentations are displayed online.
*   **Reputation:** Vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited, leading to negative publicity and loss of trust in the project and its maintainers.
*   **Availability:** If the library has bugs or performance issues, it could lead to presentations failing to load or render correctly, impacting the user experience.
*   **Intellectual Property:** While the project is open-source, there's a minor risk of copyright infringement if external code is incorporated without proper attribution.
*   **Compliance:** Depending on how and where the presentations created with impress.js are used, there might be compliance requirements related to data privacy (e.g., GDPR) or accessibility (e.g., WCAG).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project is open-source, allowing for community review and contributions to identify and fix security issues. (Described in the GitHub repository's README and contribution guidelines).
*   security control: The library relies on the browser's built-in security mechanisms for handling HTML and CSS. (Implicit in the design, as it's a JavaScript library running in the browser).
*   security control: The project uses a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of XSS attacks. (Described in documentation and examples).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The library does not perform server-side sanitization of user input. It relies on the user to provide safe HTML and CSS.
*   accepted risk: The library may be vulnerable to browser-specific quirks or vulnerabilities that are outside the project's control.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement input validation and sanitization on the client-side to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. This should be done before the content is processed by the library.
*   security control: Provide clear documentation and examples on how to use the library securely, including best practices for handling user-generated content.
*   security control: Regularly update dependencies to address any known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Consider integrating with a static analysis tool to automatically scan for potential security issues during development.
*   security control: Provide a security.md file with vulnerability reporting instructions.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself, but authentication may be required for accessing or editing presentations depending on the hosting environment.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself, but authorization may be required for accessing or editing presentations depending on the hosting environment.
*   Input Validation:
    *   The library should provide guidance and examples on how to validate and sanitize user-provided HTML and CSS to prevent XSS attacks.
    *   Consider offering built-in functions or options for sanitizing input, although this should be optional to avoid breaking existing presentations.
*   Cryptography: Not directly applicable, as the library primarily deals with presentation logic and rendering. However, if presentations contain sensitive data, users should be advised to use HTTPS for transport encryption.

    LocalMachine["Local Machine"]
    Git["Git Repository\n(GitHub)"]
    Linters["Linters\n(HTML, CSS, JS)"]
    GitHubActions["GitHub Actions\n(CI/CD)"]
    Artifacts["Build Artifacts\n(Static Files)"]

    Developer -- "Writes code on" --> LocalMachine
    Developer -- "Commits and pushes code to" --> Git
    Git -- "Triggers" --> GitHubActions
    GitHubActions -- "Runs" --> Linters
    GitHubActions -- "Creates" --> Artifacts
```

Build Process Description:

1.  **Development:** The developer writes the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code for the presentation on their local machine.
2.  **Commit and Push:** The developer commits the code changes and pushes them to the Git repository (GitHub).
3.  **CI/CD Trigger:** The push to the repository triggers a GitHub Actions workflow.
4.  **Linting:** The workflow runs linters (e.g., HTMLHint, CSSLint, ESLint) to check for code quality and potential errors.
5.  **Build Artifacts:** If the linters pass, the workflow creates the build artifacts, which are simply the static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. No compilation or bundling is required for impress.js itself, as it's a client-side library.
6.  **Deployment (not shown in diagram, but part of the build process):** The workflow then deploys the build artifacts to the chosen hosting environment (e.g., GitHub Pages).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: **Linters:** Linters help to identify potential coding errors and style issues, which can indirectly improve security by reducing the likelihood of vulnerabilities.
*   security control: **GitHub Actions:** Using a CI/CD pipeline like GitHub Actions ensures that the build process is automated and consistent, reducing the risk of manual errors.
*   security control: **Dependency Management:** If the project has external dependencies (although impress.js itself has minimal dependencies), a dependency management tool (e.g., npm, yarn) should be used to keep them up-to-date and address any known vulnerabilities. GitHub's Dependabot can be used for automated dependency updates.
*   security control: **Code Review:** Although not explicitly part of the automated build process, code reviews are a crucial security control to ensure that code changes are reviewed by another developer before being merged.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   **Presentation Delivery:** The primary business process is the ability to create and deliver visually engaging presentations.
*   **Content Creation:** Enabling users to easily create and customize presentations using their existing web development skills.
*   **Community Engagement:** Maintaining an active open-source community around the project.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   **Presentation Content:** The content of the presentations themselves may contain sensitive information, depending on the user and the purpose of the presentation. Sensitivity can range from low (public presentations) to high (confidential business information).
*   **User Data:** If presentations are hosted on a platform that requires user accounts, user data (e.g., usernames, passwords, email addresses) needs to be protected. However, impress.js itself does not handle user data.
*   **Source Code:** The source code of the impress.js library is publicly available, but protecting its integrity is important to prevent malicious modifications.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, WCAG) that need to be considered for presentations created with impress.js?
*   Will presentations be hosted on a platform that requires user authentication and authorization?
*   Are there any plans to add features that might introduce new security risks (e.g., server-side rendering, user input forms)?
*   What is the expected level of technical expertise of the users creating presentations with impress.js?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a free and open-source tool for creating presentations. Revenue generation is not a primary concern.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Users are expected to have a basic understanding of web security and will take responsibility for sanitizing any user-generated content included in their presentations. The project maintainers will address any reported security vulnerabilities in the library itself.
*   DESIGN: The library will remain primarily client-side, with no server-side components. The focus will be on leveraging browser features for rendering and animation.
