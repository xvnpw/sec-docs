# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for impress/impress.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Separation of Data and Presentation (impress.js Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_separation_of_data_and_presentation__impress_js_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **No Sensitive Data in `data-*`:**  Ensure that *no* sensitive information (API keys, user details, internal notes, etc.) is ever placed directly within the impress.js `data-*` attributes used for positioning, rotation, scaling, or any other presentation parameters.  These attributes are part of the HTML and are easily visible in the browser's developer tools.
2.  **JavaScript-Driven Data Loading:**  Use JavaScript to fetch any dynamic data *after* the impress.js presentation has initialized.  This should be done using secure AJAX requests (HTTPS) and the data should be stored in appropriately scoped JavaScript variables, *not* directly inserted into the `data-*` attributes.
3.  **Avoid `innerHTML` with Untrusted `data-*` Values:** Even if the `data-*` attributes themselves don't contain sensitive data, if their *values* are derived from user input, be extremely cautious.  Prefer using DOM manipulation methods that don't involve parsing HTML strings. If you *must* use `innerHTML`, ensure the values are thoroughly sanitized *before* being used to construct the HTML.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Leakage through Step Attributes (Severity: High):** Directly prevents the primary threat of exposing sensitive data embedded in impress.js's configuration attributes.
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of accidentally exposing sensitive data through the presentation structure.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Leakage:** Risk is virtually eliminated if implemented correctly.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Significantly reduced, as sensitive data is never directly part of the easily inspectable HTML.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's specifics)
*   All presentation data is loaded via AJAX after `impress:init` in `src/js/data-loader.js`.
*   `data-*` attributes only contain presentation-related values (position, rotation, etc.).

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Replace with your project's specifics)
*   Need to audit all uses of `data-*` attributes to double-check that no dynamically generated content (even if not directly sensitive) is being inserted without proper sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate `goto()` Targets (impress.js Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/validate__goto____targets__impress_js_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Whitelist of Step IDs:** Maintain a JavaScript array or object containing a list of all *valid* step IDs in your impress.js presentation. This whitelist represents the allowed navigation targets.
2.  **Input Validation:**  Whenever `impress().goto()` is called, *before* executing the navigation, check if the target step ID (which might come from a URL parameter, user input, or another source) exists in the whitelist.
3.  **Rejection/Redirection:** If the provided step ID is *not* found in the whitelist, either:
    *   Reject the navigation request entirely (do nothing).
    *   Redirect the presentation to a safe, default step (e.g., the first step).
4. **Never Trust User Input:** Never directly use user-provided input as the argument to `impress().goto()` without this validation.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **JavaScript Injection via `goto()` (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from crafting malicious URLs or inputs that would cause `impress().goto()` to execute arbitrary JavaScript code (e.g., using a `javascript:` URI).

**Impact:**
*   **JavaScript Injection:** Eliminates the risk of this specific type of injection if the whitelist is correctly maintained and the validation is consistently applied.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
*   No `goto()` calls currently use direct user input. All navigation is handled internally.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
*   Implement a whitelist check in `src/js/navigation.js` for the URL hash-based navigation, even though it currently only uses internal step IDs. This adds a layer of defense in depth.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Handling of impress.js Event Handlers (impress.js Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_handling_of_impress_js_event_handlers__impress_js_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Event Handlers:** Identify all custom event handlers that you've attached to impress.js events (e.g., `impress:stepenter`, `impress:stepleave`, `impress:init`).
2.  **Data Source Analysis:** For each event handler, carefully analyze where the data it processes comes from. Is any of this data derived from user input, URL parameters, or external sources?
3.  **Sanitization and Validation:** If any data processed by the event handler originates from an untrusted source, apply rigorous sanitization and validation *before* using that data. This is the same process as for preventing XSS in general, but applied specifically within the context of impress.js event handlers.
4. **Avoid `eval()` and related:** Never use `eval()`, `Function()`, `setTimeout` or `setInterval` with string containing unsanitized user input that comes from event.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Event Handlers (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code that would be executed when specific impress.js events are triggered.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities arising from custom event handler logic.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example)
*   The `impress:stepenter` handler in `src/js/custom-events.js` only uses data from the `event.target` (the step element itself) and does not process any external data.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example)
*   Add a new event handler for `impress:message` (a hypothetical custom event) that receives data from a WebSocket connection. This handler *must* sanitize the incoming message data before displaying it.
