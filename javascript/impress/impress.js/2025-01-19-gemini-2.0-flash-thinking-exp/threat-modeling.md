# Threat Model Analysis for impress/impress.js

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_content.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the impress.js presentation through unsanitized user-provided content. This occurs because impress.js renders this content within the HTML structure. When a user views the presentation, impress.js's rendering of the malicious script leads to its execution in their browser.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the presentation, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected Component:** Rendering of user-provided content within the HTML structure managed by impress.js. Specifically, the parts of impress.js that handle the insertion of dynamic content into the `div` elements with the `step` class or their attributes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input sanitization (e.g., HTML escaping) on all user-provided content *before* it is passed to impress.js for rendering.
* Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded, mitigating the impact of scripts that might bypass sanitization.
* Avoid directly embedding user input into the HTML structure that impress.js manages without proper encoding.

## Threat: [DOM-Based XSS through Data Attribute Manipulation](./threats/dom-based_xss_through_data_attribute_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when used to populate `data-*` attributes on `step` elements, leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript. Impress.js directly reads and processes these `data-*` attributes to control presentation behavior. If these attributes contain malicious code, impress.js itself triggers its execution.

**Impact:** Similar to regular XSS, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution with the same potential consequences.

**Affected Component:** The impress.js core logic that reads and processes `data-*` attributes on the `step` elements to control transitions, positioning, and other presentation aspects.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Treat `data-*` attributes as potentially untrusted input when they are derived from user input or external sources.
* Sanitize any user-provided data before setting it as a `data-*` attribute value that will be processed by impress.js. Use appropriate encoding techniques for attribute values.
* Avoid dynamically generating `data-*` attribute values based on unsanitized user input that impress.js will interpret.
