## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Data Attributes](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_htmljavascript_via_data_attributes.md)

**Goal:** Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

**Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit the fact that impress.js relies on HTML data attributes to configure the presentation steps. If the application allows user-controlled data to populate these attributes without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code directly into the attributes. When impress.js processes these attributes, the injected script will be executed in the user's browser.

**Mitigation:** Sanitize all data used to populate impress.js data attributes. Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript within Step Content](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_htmljavascript_within_step_content.md)

**Goal:** Execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

**Attack Vector:** This is a classic Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. If the application dynamically generates the content of the impress.js presentation steps based on user input or data from external sources without proper sanitization and output encoding, attackers can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code directly into the step content. When a user views the presentation, the injected script will be executed in their browser.

**Mitigation:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all data used within impress.js step content. Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Persisted Presentation Data](./attack_tree_paths/stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_persisted_presentation_data.md)

**Goal:** Inject malicious scripts that are stored and executed when other users view the presentation.

**Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to save and share impress.js presentations, and the server-side does not properly sanitize the presentation data (including HTML and data attributes) before storing it, attackers can inject malicious scripts into the presentation data. When other users load and view this compromised presentation, the stored malicious script will be executed in their browsers.

**Mitigation:** Implement strict server-side input validation and output encoding for all presentation data before storing it in the database or file system.
