## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Malicious Data Attributes -> Inject Malicious JavaScript via `data-*` attributes -> Directly embed `<script>` tags within `data-*` values](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_malicious_data_attributes_-_inject_malicious_javascript_via__data-__attribu_f5e96e75.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker crafts HTML content where the `data-*` attributes used by impress.js contain `<script>` tags.
* Vulnerability: The impress.js library or the application's custom code fails to properly sanitize or escape HTML within these data attributes before rendering them in the DOM.
* Impact: Successful execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to:
    * Session hijacking and account takeover.
    * Theft of sensitive information.
    * Redirection to malicious websites.
    * Defacement of the application.
* Critical Node: Exploit Malicious Data Attributes - This is a critical entry point, as compromising data attributes allows for various malicious manipulations.
* Critical Node: Inject Malicious JavaScript via `data-*` attributes - This node directly leads to the execution of attacker-controlled scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Malicious Data Attributes -> Inject Malicious JavaScript via `data-*` attributes -> Utilize event handlers within `data-*` attributes (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_malicious_data_attributes_-_inject_malicious_javascript_via__data-__attribu_0752bb35.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker crafts HTML content where the `data-*` attributes used by impress.js contain JavaScript code within event handler attributes (e.g., `<div data-step data-onload="alert('XSS')">`).
* Vulnerability: The browser executes the JavaScript code within these event handlers when the corresponding event occurs (e.g., the element is loaded).
* Impact: Similar to embedding `<script>` tags, this allows for arbitrary JavaScript execution with the same potential consequences.
* Critical Node: Exploit Malicious Data Attributes - As above, this is a crucial initial compromise.
* Critical Node: Inject Malicious JavaScript via `data-*` attributes - Again, this node directly leads to script execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Custom JavaScript Interacting with impress.js -> Inject malicious JavaScript through application features that dynamically generate impress.js slides or content -> User-generated content is directly used in impress.js slides without sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploit_lack_of_input_sanitization_in_custom_javascript_interacting_with_impress_js_50a683a5.md)

* Attack Vector: The application uses custom JavaScript to dynamically generate impress.js slides or content based on user input. If this input is not properly sanitized, an attacker can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript.
* Vulnerability: The application lacks proper input validation and output encoding when handling user-provided data that is used to construct impress.js elements.
* Impact: This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript, hijack sessions, steal data, etc.
* Critical Node: Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Custom JavaScript Interacting with impress.js - This highlights a fundamental security flaw in how the application handles data.
* Critical Node: Inject malicious JavaScript through application features that dynamically generate impress.js slides or content - This is the direct consequence of the lack of sanitization.
