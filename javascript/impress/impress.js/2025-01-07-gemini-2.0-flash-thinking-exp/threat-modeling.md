# Threat Model Analysis for impress/impress.js

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the presentation content (e.g., within step content, links, or custom data attributes). This code is then executed in the victim's browser *by impress.js* when it renders the presentation. The attacker might steal cookies, redirect the user, deface the presentation, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** User account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, phishing attacks.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `impress.js` core library (renders the content and processes attributes).
    *   DOM manipulation performed *by impress.js* when inserting and updating content.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly sanitize all user-provided content *before* it is passed to impress.js for rendering. Use appropriate encoding and escaping techniques for HTML, JavaScript, and URLs.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources. This can help mitigate the impact of injected scripts.
    *   Avoid using `innerHTML` directly in conjunction with impress.js for rendering user-provided content. Prefer safer methods like creating DOM elements and setting their properties programmatically before passing them to impress.js.
    *   Regularly review and update impress.js to patch potential vulnerabilities in its content rendering logic.

## Threat: [DOM-Based XSS via Malicious Attributes](./threats/dom-based_xss_via_malicious_attributes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious HTML attributes within the presentation structure that, when processed *by impress.js* or the browser during impress.js operation, execute arbitrary JavaScript. This could involve manipulating event handlers or using JavaScript URLs within attributes that impress.js interacts with.
*   **Impact:** Similar to reflected or stored XSS, including user account compromise, data theft, and malicious actions.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `impress.js` core library (parses and applies attributes to steps and other elements).
    *   Browser's HTML parsing and JavaScript execution engine *as triggered by impress.js*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize all input used to generate the presentation's HTML structure, including attribute values, *before* it is used by impress.js.
    *   Avoid dynamically generating HTML attributes based on user input without strict validation and sanitization before impress.js processes them.
    *   Be cautious when using custom data attributes that might be processed by custom JavaScript interacting with impress.js elements, ensuring these attributes cannot be used for script injection.

## Threat: [Security Vulnerabilities in impress.js Library](./threats/security_vulnerabilities_in_impress_js_library.md)

*   **Description:** The impress.js library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (e.g., bugs in its parsing logic, handling of events, or rendering). Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code or bypass security restrictions *within the context of the impress.js functionality*.
*   **Impact:** Range from minor disruptions to complete compromise of the client-side application, depending on the nature of the vulnerability within impress.js.
*   **Affected Component:** Any part of the `impress.js` core library.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical to High depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep impress.js updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   Monitor the impress.js project's security advisories and community discussions for reported vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the impress.js code (though this is primarily for library developers, understanding potential issues can inform usage).
