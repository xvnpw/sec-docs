## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes in Hyper Application

**Objective:** Compromise an application that utilizes the `vercel/hyper` terminal emulator by exploiting vulnerabilities within Hyper itself.

**Attacker's Goal:** Execute arbitrary code on the user's machine where the application using Hyper is running, or gain access to sensitive information accessible through the Hyper instance.

* **Impact:** High.
* **Effort:** Low.
* **Skill Level:** Low-Medium.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-Low.

**6. Exploit Vulnerability in Existing Plugin (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**

* **Description:** Discovering and exploiting a security flaw in a legitimate, already installed plugin. This could involve known vulnerabilities or zero-day exploits.
* **Impact:** Depends on the plugin's permissions and functionality, potentially leading to code execution or data access.
* **Likelihood:** Medium-High (plugins are often less scrutinized than core software).
* **Impact:** Medium-High.
* **Effort:** Medium.
* **Skill Level:** Medium.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium-High.

**7. Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**

* **Description:**  Taking advantage of flaws in how Hyper processes user input to execute unintended commands or scripts.
* **Impact:** Code execution with the privileges of the Hyper process.

**8. Command Injection through specially crafted commands or arguments (High-Risk Path, Critical Node):**

* **Description:** Injecting malicious commands into the terminal input that are then executed by the underlying shell.
* **Impact:** Code execution with the privileges of the Hyper process.
* **Likelihood:** Medium (common vulnerability if input is not properly sanitized).
* **Impact:** High.
* **Effort:** Medium.
* **Skill Level:** Medium.
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

**9. Exploit Hyper's Configuration (Critical Node):**

* **Description:**  Manipulating Hyper's configuration settings to execute malicious code or gain unauthorized access.
