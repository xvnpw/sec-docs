### Combined Vulnerability List for Intelephense Project

This document outlines the identified vulnerabilities in the Intelephense project, combining information from multiple vulnerability lists and removing duplicates.

#### 1. Potential Remote Code Execution via License Key Activation

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Remote Code Execution via License Key Activation
- **Description:**
    1. The Intelephense extension sends a POST request to `https://intelephense.com/activate` during license key activation.
    2. The response from the server is directly written to a file in the user's global storage path without sanitization or validation.
    3. If the `intelephense.com` server is compromised, a threat actor could manipulate the server to return malicious content in the response.
    4. This malicious content, if crafted as executable code, could be written to the user's file system.
    5. If the extension or another process executes this file, it could lead to remote code execution on the user's machine.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution. A successful attack could allow a threat actor to execute arbitrary code on the machine of a user who activates a license key, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, or further malicious activities.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code directly writes the server response to a file without any security measures.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization of the response received from `intelephense.com/activate` before writing it to a file.
    - Ensuring that the file written with the server response is never executed as code by the extension or any other process.
    - Implementing integrity checks for the server's response to ensure it originates from a trusted source and hasn't been tampered with.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must initiate the license key activation process within the Intelephense extension.
    - The `intelephense.com` domain or the server hosting the activation endpoint must be compromised by a threat actor.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/src/extension.ts`
    - Function: `activateKey`

    ```typescript
    function activateKey(context: ExtensionContext, licenceKey: string): Promise<void> {
        // ...
        return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
            let responseBody: string = '';
            let req = https.request(options, res => {
                res.on('data', chunk => {
                    responseBody += chunk.toString(); // Step 1: Accumulate response body
                });
                res.on('end', () => {
                    if (res.statusCode === 200) {
                        let filepath = path.join(context.globalStoragePath, 'intelephense_licence_key_' + licenceKey);
                        fs.writeFile(filepath, responseBody).then(resolve, reject); // Step 2: Write response body to file
                    } else {
                        reject(new Error('Failed to activate key'));
                    }
                });
                res.on('error', reject);
            });
            req.write(postData);
            req.on('error', reject);
            req.end();
        });
    }
    ```

    The code in `activateKey` function directly takes the `responseBody` received from the `intelephense.com/activate` endpoint and writes it to a file using `fs.writeFile`. There is no validation, sanitization, or security context consideration of the `responseBody` before writing it to the file system. This creates a vulnerability if the server is compromised and serves malicious content.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Mock Server:** Configure a local mock server to listen on `https://intelephense.com/activate` (requires DNS spoofing or similar to redirect `intelephense.com` to localhost, or modifying the extension code to point to localhost for testing). This mock server should respond to POST requests to `/activate` with a crafted JSON payload containing malicious Javascript or shell commands within a string value (e.g., `{"licence": "<script>console.log('pwned')</script>"}`).
    2. **Modify Extension (for testing purposes):** For testing, temporarily modify the `activateKey` function in `/code/src/extension.ts` to point the `hostname` in `options` to `localhost` or your mock server's address instead of `intelephense.com`. In a real attack, this step is not needed as the attacker would compromise the actual `intelephense.com` server.
    3. **Run Extension in VS Code:** Launch VS Code with the Intelephense extension activated.
    4. **Trigger License Activation:** Execute the command `Intelephense: Enter licence key` from the VS Code command palette.
    5. **Enter License Key:** Input any arbitrary license key value in the input box and press Enter.
    6. **Observe File System:** Check the global storage path for the Intelephense extension (`context.globalStoragePath`). A file named `intelephense_licence_key_<your_license_key>` should have been created.
    7. **Inspect File Content:** Open the created file and verify if the malicious content (e.g., `<script>console.log('pwned')</script>`) from your mock server's response is present in the file.
    8. **Attempt Code Execution (Advanced):** Further investigate if this file is subsequently parsed or executed by the extension or any other process. If the malicious content is crafted to be executable in a context that the extension uses (e.g., if the extension attempts to load or interpret this file as Javascript or executes shell commands based on its content), it would confirm Remote Code Execution. For a simpler proof of concept, successful injection of malicious content into the file system is sufficient to demonstrate a high-risk vulnerability.

#### 2. Exposure of User Home Directory Hash in License Activation

- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposure of User Home Directory Hash in License Activation
- **Description:**
    1. The Intelephense extension requires users to activate a license key for premium features.
    2. During the license activation process, the `activateKey` function in `src/extension.ts` is executed.
    3. This function calculates a SHA256 hash of the user's home directory path using `os.homedir()`.
    4. This hash, labeled as `machineId`, is then included in a POST request body sent to `intelephense.com/activate` to activate the license.
    5. An external attacker intercepting this network request or gaining access to server-side logs could potentially obtain this hash.
    6. While the hash itself does not directly reveal the contents of the home directory, it represents a piece of user-specific system information.
    7. This information could be used for user profiling, correlation across different services if the same hashing method is used, or as a component in a broader attack strategy targeting users of this extension.
- **Impact:**
    - Exposure of user-specific system information, specifically a hash derived from the user's home directory path.
    - Potential for user profiling and correlation of user activity if the hash is consistently used or leaked across different services.
    - Minor privacy risk as it reveals information about the user's system configuration.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The application currently calculates and transmits the hash of the home directory path during license activation without any obfuscation or alternative mechanisms.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Avoid transmitting user-specific directory information**: The extension should avoid sending any information derived from user's file system paths, especially the home directory, to external servers for license activation or any other purposes.
    - **Use a randomly generated, non-identifying machine ID**: If machine identification is necessary for license management, the extension should generate a cryptographically random UUID upon installation and store it locally. This UUID, rather than a hash of a personal path, should be used for communication with the license server.
    - **Server-side hashing if path information is essential**: If, for some reason, information related to the user's environment is deemed absolutely necessary for license validation, the sensitive information (like directory path) should be transmitted securely to the server, and the hashing should be performed server-side, not client-side.
    - **Transparency and User Consent**: If user-specific data collection is necessary, provide clear and explicit information to the user about what data is collected, why it is collected, and obtain user consent. This is especially important for privacy-sensitive information like directory structures.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must attempt to activate a premium license within the Intelephense extension by entering a license key.
    - An active network connection is required to communicate with the license activation server at `intelephense.com`.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. Open the file `/code/src/extension.ts`.
    2. Locate the function `activateKey(context: ExtensionContext, licenceKey: string)`.
    3. Examine the `postData` variable definition within this function:
       ```typescript
       let postData = querystring.stringify({
           machineId: createHash('sha256').update(os.homedir(), 'utf8').digest('hex'),
           licenceKey: licenceKey
       });
       ```
    4. The code clearly uses `createHash('sha256').update(os.homedir(), 'utf8').digest('hex')` to generate a SHA256 hash of the output of `os.homedir()`, which returns the path to the current user's home directory.
    5. This `machineId` is then included as a parameter in the POST request to `intelephense.com/activate`.
    6. The following code block sets up the HTTPS request options and includes the `postData`:
       ```typescript
       let options: https.RequestOptions = {
           hostname: 'intelephense.com',
           port: 443,
           path: '/activate',
           method: 'POST',
           headers: {
               'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
               'Content-Length': postData.length
           }
       };
       ```
    7. The `postData`, containing the home directory hash, is then sent to the server:
       ```typescript
       req.write(postData);
       ```
    8. This analysis confirms that the SHA256 hash of the user's home directory is generated client-side and transmitted to the license server during the activation process.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Install the Intelephense extension in VSCode.
    2. Install and configure a network interception proxy tool such as Burp Suite or Wireshark on your system to monitor network traffic.
    3. Ensure the proxy tool is actively intercepting HTTPS traffic from VSCode.
    4. In VSCode, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    5. Type and select "Intelephense: Enter licence key".
    6. Enter any license key (a valid or invalid key will suffice for this test as the hash is sent regardless of key validity). Press Enter.
    7. Examine the network traffic in your proxy tool. Look for an HTTPS POST request to `intelephense.com/activate`.
    8. Inspect the body of this POST request. You should find a parameter named `machineId`.
    9. The value of `machineId` should be a 64-character hexadecimal string, which is the SHA256 hash of your user's home directory path.
    10. This confirms that the home directory hash is being transmitted during license activation.
