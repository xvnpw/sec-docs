### Vulnerability List for Intelephense Project

- Vulnerability Name: Exposure of User Home Directory Hash in License Activation
- Description:
    1. The Intelephense extension requires users to activate a license key for premium features.
    2. During the license activation process, the `activateKey` function in `src/extension.ts` is executed.
    3. This function calculates a SHA256 hash of the user's home directory path using `os.homedir()`.
    4. This hash, labeled as `machineId`, is then included in a POST request body sent to `intelephense.com/activate` to activate the license.
    5. An external attacker intercepting this network request or gaining access to server-side logs could potentially obtain this hash.
    6. While the hash itself does not directly reveal the contents of the home directory, it represents a piece of user-specific system information.
    7. This information could be used for user profiling, correlation across different services if the same hashing method is used, or as a component in a broader attack strategy targeting users of this extension.
- Impact:
    - Exposure of user-specific system information, specifically a hash derived from the user's home directory path.
    - Potential for user profiling and correlation of user activity if the hash is consistently used or leaked across different services.
    - Minor privacy risk as it reveals information about the user's system configuration.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None. The application currently calculates and transmits the hash of the home directory path during license activation without any obfuscation or alternative mechanisms.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Avoid transmitting user-specific directory information**: The extension should avoid sending any information derived from user's file system paths, especially the home directory, to external servers for license activation or any other purposes.
    - **Use a randomly generated, non-identifying machine ID**: If machine identification is necessary for license management, the extension should generate a cryptographically random UUID upon installation and store it locally. This UUID, rather than a hash of a personal path, should be used for communication with the license server.
    - **Server-side hashing if path information is essential**: If, for some reason, information related to the user's environment is deemed absolutely necessary for license validation, the sensitive information (like directory path) should be transmitted securely to the server, and the hashing should be performed server-side, not client-side.
    - **Transparency and User Consent**: If user-specific data collection is necessary, provide clear and explicit information to the user about what data is collected, why it is collected, and obtain user consent. This is especially important for privacy-sensitive information like directory structures.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must attempt to activate a premium license within the Intelephense extension by entering a license key.
    - An active network connection is required to communicate with the license activation server at `intelephense.com`.
- Source code analysis:
    1. Open the file `/code/src/extension.ts`.
    2. Locate the function `activateKey(context: ExtensionContext, licenceKey: string)`.
    3. Examine the `postData` variable definition within this function:
       ```typescript
       let postData = querystring.stringify({
           machineId: createHash('sha256').update(os.homedir(), 'utf8').digest('hex'),
           licenceKey: licenceKey
       });
       ```
    4. The code clearly uses `createHash('sha256').update(os.homedir(), 'utf8').digest('hex')` to generate a SHA256 hash of the output of `os.homedir()`, which returns the path to the current user's home directory.
    5. This `machineId` is then included as a parameter in the POST request to `intelephense.com/activate`.
    6. The following code block sets up the HTTPS request options and includes the `postData`:
       ```typescript
       let options: https.RequestOptions = {
           hostname: 'intelephense.com',
           port: 443,
           path: '/activate',
           method: 'POST',
           headers: {
               'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded',
               'Content-Length': postData.length
           }
       };
       ```
    7. The `postData`, containing the home directory hash, is then sent to the server:
       ```typescript
       req.write(postData);
       ```
    8. This analysis confirms that the SHA256 hash of the user's home directory is generated client-side and transmitted to the license server during the activation process.

- Security test case:
    1. Install the Intelephense extension in VSCode.
    2. Install and configure a network interception proxy tool such as Burp Suite or Wireshark on your system to monitor network traffic.
    3. Ensure the proxy tool is actively intercepting HTTPS traffic from VSCode.
    4. In VSCode, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P).
    5. Type and select "Intelephense: Enter licence key".
    6. Enter any license key (a valid or invalid key will suffice for this test as the hash is sent regardless of key validity). Press Enter.
    7. Examine the network traffic in your proxy tool. Look for an HTTPS POST request to `intelephense.com/activate`.
    8. Inspect the body of this POST request. You should find a parameter named `machineId`.
    9. The value of `machineId` should be a 64-character hexadecimal string, which is the SHA256 hash of your user's home directory path.
    10. This confirms that the home directory hash is being transmitted during license activation.
