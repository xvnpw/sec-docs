Based on your instructions and the provided vulnerability analysis, here is the updated vulnerability list:

**Updated Vulnerability List: No High or Critical Vulnerabilities Identified**

Based on the criteria provided for filtering and ranking vulnerabilities, no entries from the original list qualify for inclusion. The initial analysis concluded that no high or critical vulnerabilities exist within the provided project files. The files consist solely of documentation, changelogs, issue templates, and configuration files, lacking any runtime code or exploitable configurations that could be targeted by an external attacker.

Therefore, according to your requirements, the updated vulnerability list is empty as no vulnerabilities meeting the 'high' or 'critical' rank and other inclusion criteria were identified.
