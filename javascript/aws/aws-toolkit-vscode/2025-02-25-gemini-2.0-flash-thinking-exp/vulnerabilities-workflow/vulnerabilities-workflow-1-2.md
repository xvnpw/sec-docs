- **No New High-Severity Vulnerabilities Identified**

  - **Description:**
    An external attacker would typically attempt to trigger vulnerabilities via publicly exposed network endpoints or unsanitized inputs in runtime application logic. In this batch of project files, we see that:
      - The additional files consist primarily of documentation, design and configuration artifacts, test fixtures, cloudformation/SAM templates, and CI/CD build scripts.
      - The core production code (the VS Code extension) continues to rely on secure design practices. For example, any remote‐facing functionality (such as the remote connect feature) is governed by explicit user confirmation prompts and proper use of AWS clients.
      - The local debugging infrastructure (e.g. the debugpy wrapper) is intended solely for developer or testing purposes and—unless explicitly enabled in a developer-controlled mode—remains dormant and bound only to localhost.
      - Although some Dockerfiles use unpinned tags (e.g. `FROM ubuntu:latest` or `FROM public.ecr.aws/sam/build-java17:latest`), these images are used in testing or CI/CD contexts rather than being deployed as part of a publicly accessible service.

  - **Impact:**
    Because none of the new files introduce any runnable network-facing logic or unsanitized input paths that an external attacker could manipulate, there is no pathway for remote code execution, data leakage, or privilege escalation in the production (marketplace-distributed) instance of the extension.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    N/A (None identified)

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension’s runtime (whether in desktop or web mode) is architected to operate within the VS Code ecosystem, with its public APIs and commands gated behind user actions.
    - Features that could have been sensitive (e.g. remote connect, SAM debugging) include explicit confirmation prompts and rely on AWS‐provided, secure client libraries.
    - Debugging functionalities (such as the debugpy wrapper) by default restrict listening to localhost unless a developer deliberately enables debug mode.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    There are no gaps identified in the currently provided files that would permit an external attacker to trigger a high-severity vulnerability.

  - **Preconditions:**
    An external attacker would need to be able to reach a network endpoint of the running application or inject malicious inputs into a public API. In the current release, all runtime interfaces (commands, AWS interactions, local debugging, etc.) are either internal (local to the VS Code client) or secured by explicit user interaction.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The additional documentation (e.g. web.md, arch_features.md, telemetry-perf.md) and design documents do not contain operational code paths that could be remotely invoked.
    - The Dockerfiles and buildspec scripts, while using sometimes loosely pinned base images, are used only in build and test scenarios and are not executed as part of the production extension runtime.
    - Test fixtures and CloudFormation/SAM templates illustrate correct usage scenarios and do not include unsanitized inputs or network endpoints that would be exposed publicly.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    There is no reproducible, externally triggered test case because none of the new artifacts—in isolation or integrated with the production VS Code extension—provide a network-accessible attack surface or unsanitized input handler. Existing internal testing (unit, integration, and end-to-end tests) confirms that all externally exposed functionality (such as confirmation prompts or AWS client interactions) adheres to safe practices.
