# Attack Surface Analysis for mochajs/mocha

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Test Code Execution](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_test_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Execution of JavaScript test code from untrusted sources (e.g., user-submitted tests, compromised repositories).
*   **Mocha Contribution:** Mocha's core function is to execute JavaScript code, making it the *direct enabler* of this attack if used with untrusted input. Mocha provides no built-in protection against malicious code within tests.
*   **Example:** A user uploads a Mocha test file containing `require('child_process').exec('rm -rf /')`, attempting to delete the entire filesystem.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Arbitrary file read/write.
    *   System command execution.
    *   Environment variable access.
    *   Network access.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Sandboxing:** Execute untrusted tests within highly restricted environments like isolated VMs or containers with minimal privileges and *no* network access. This is the *primary* defense.
    *   **Dedicated User Account:** Run tests as a dedicated, low-privilege user account with *no* access to sensitive files or system resources.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Enforce strict limits on CPU, memory, and network usage for the test execution environment.
    *   **Never Run Untrusted Tests:** The most secure approach is to *completely avoid* running tests from untrusted sources. This is the *ideal* mitigation.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Reporter Usage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_reporter_usage.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in custom or third-party Mocha reporters, or exfiltration of data through malicious reporters.
*   **Mocha Contribution:** Mocha's support for custom reporters, and its mechanism for passing test results to these reporters, *directly enables* this attack vector. The reporter runs within the Mocha process.
*   **Example:** A custom reporter that generates HTML output without proper sanitization is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if test names or error messages contain malicious JavaScript. A malicious reporter could send test results (including sensitive data) to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS (if the reporter generates HTML or interacts with a browser).
    *   Template injection.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Potentially RCE, depending on the reporter's functionality and vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Trusted Reporters:** *Only* use reporters from reputable sources and well-maintained projects. Avoid lesser-known or unmaintained reporters.
    *   **Code Review:** *Thoroughly* review the code of *any* custom reporters for security vulnerabilities, paying *critical* attention to input handling and data output.
    *   **Sanitization:** *Rigorously* sanitize *all* data displayed by the reporter, especially if it generates HTML or interacts with a web browser. Use appropriate escaping techniques for the target context.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** If the reporter generates HTML, implement a *strong* CSP to mitigate XSS risks.
    *   **Network Restrictions:** If possible, restrict the network access of the reporter process to prevent unauthorized data exfiltration. This can be done at the OS level or through containerization.

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Test Output](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure_in_test_output.md)

*   **Description:** Tests inadvertently printing sensitive information (API keys, passwords, database credentials, etc.) to the console or logs, which are then handled by Mocha's reporting mechanism.
*   **Mocha Contribution:** Mocha's reporters are *directly responsible* for displaying and handling the test output. While the tests themselves generate the output, Mocha's reporting is the mechanism through which the sensitive data becomes visible.
*   **Example:** A test that interacts with an API logs the API key to the console for debugging purposes, and this output is captured and displayed by the default Mocha reporter.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive credentials.
    *   Unauthorized access to systems or services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Logging Secrets:** *Never* log sensitive information directly in tests. This is the most important mitigation.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables or secrets management tools to store sensitive data, and access them within tests *without* printing their values.
    *   **Reporter Configuration:** Configure the Mocha reporter (if possible) to suppress or redact sensitive information from the output. Some reporters offer options for filtering or masking specific patterns.
    *   **Log Review:** Regularly review test logs and output (even if redaction is attempted) to ensure no sensitive data is being leaked.
    *   **Mocking:** Use mocking techniques to avoid interacting with real services that require sensitive credentials during testing. This reduces the need to handle real credentials in the first place.
