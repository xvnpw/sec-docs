# BUSINESS POSTURE

Mocha is a Javascript test framework that runs on Node.js and in the browser, making asynchronous testing simple and fun. Mocha tests run serially, allowing for flexible and accurate reporting, while mapping uncaught exceptions to the correct test cases. Hosted on GitHub, it is available as an open-source project.

Business priorities and goals:
- Provide a flexible, reliable, and feature-rich testing framework for Javascript developers.
- Ensure ease of use and integration into various Javascript development workflows.
- Maintain a strong and active open-source community around the project.
- Support a wide range of Javascript environments (Node.js and browsers).
- Continuously improve the framework with new features and bug fixes based on community feedback and evolving Javascript ecosystem.

Most important business risks:
- Security vulnerabilities within Mocha could be exploited by malicious actors, potentially impacting projects that depend on it.
- Instability or bugs in Mocha could lead to unreliable test results, affecting software quality and release cycles.
- Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to stagnation and eventual obsolescence of the framework.
- Compatibility issues with new Javascript versions or environments could reduce its usability and adoption.
- Supply chain attacks targeting Mocha's dependencies could introduce vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: GitHub repository with public visibility, allowing community review of code. (Implemented: GitHub)
- security control: Standard Javascript development practices are likely followed by contributors. (Implemented: Development process)
- security control: npm package registry for distribution, which includes some basic security checks. (Implemented: npm registry)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: As an open-source project, resources for dedicated security testing might be limited.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions means security vulnerabilities might be identified and patched reactively rather than proactively.
- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies of Mocha could introduce security issues.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify vulnerabilities in Mocha's dependencies.
- security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Conduct regular security audits or penetration testing, especially before major releases.
- security control: Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies and facilitate vulnerability management.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable for Mocha itself as a library. Authentication is relevant for the development and release processes (e.g., GitHub account for contributors, npm account for publishing).
- Authorization: Not applicable for Mocha itself. Authorization is relevant for repository access control on GitHub and npm package publishing permissions.
- Input validation: Mocha needs to handle various inputs from test files and command-line arguments. Input validation is crucial to prevent injection attacks or unexpected behavior. This should be implemented in Mocha's core logic, especially when parsing test files and command-line options.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a primary requirement for Mocha's core functionality. However, if Mocha introduces features that require secure communication or data storage in the future, appropriate cryptographic measures should be implemented. For now, ensure no sensitive data is logged or exposed in error messages.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

What are critical business process we are trying to protect?
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Mocha testing framework for the Javascript development community.
- Ensuring that Mocha does not introduce security vulnerabilities into projects that use it.
- Maintaining the reputation and trust in the Mocha project as a reliable testing tool.

What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?
- Mocha codebase: Sensitivity is medium to high. Protecting the codebase from unauthorized modifications and vulnerabilities is crucial for the project's integrity.
- Test files (example tests within Mocha repository): Sensitivity is low to medium. These are primarily for testing Mocha itself, but could contain examples that might reveal internal logic.
- Build artifacts (npm package): Sensitivity is high. Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the published npm package is critical to prevent supply chain attacks.
- Developer credentials and secrets used in the build process: Sensitivity is high. Protecting these credentials is vital to prevent unauthorized access and malicious activities in the CI/CD pipeline.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the current process for handling security vulnerability reports for Mocha?
- Are there any existing security audits or penetration testing reports for Mocha?
- What dependency scanning tools are currently used, if any?
- Is there a documented security policy for the Mocha project?
- What is the process for managing and rotating secrets used in the build and release pipeline?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: Mocha's primary goal is to serve the Javascript developer community as a reliable testing tool. Security is important for maintaining trust and preventing harm to users.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are basic, relying on open-source community review and standard development practices. There is room for improvement in proactive security measures like automated security scanning and formal vulnerability management.
- DESIGN: Mocha's architecture is relatively simple, consisting of a core library and a CLI. Security considerations should focus on input validation, dependency management, and secure build/release processes.
