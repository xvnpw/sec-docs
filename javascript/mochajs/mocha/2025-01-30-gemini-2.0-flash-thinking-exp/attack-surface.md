# Attack Surface Analysis for mochajs/mocha

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test File Injection/Modification](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_file_injectionmodification.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject or modify test files that Mocha executes, introducing malicious JavaScript code into the testing process. This directly leverages Mocha's core function of running JavaScript test files.
*   **Mocha Contribution:** Mocha is designed to execute JavaScript files provided as tests. If these files are compromised, Mocha becomes the execution engine for attacker-controlled code. Mocha's file loading and execution mechanism is the direct enabler of this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the test directory and modifies `test/example.test.js` to include code that reads sensitive environment variables (e.g., API keys, database credentials) and sends them to an attacker-controlled server when Mocha runs the test suite.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution within the testing environment, potentially leading to:
    *   Full control over the testing process and the machine running Mocha.
    *   Exfiltration of sensitive data accessible in the testing environment (environment variables, application secrets, test data).
    *   Complete compromise of the application under test if the testing environment is closely linked to production or development infrastructure.
    *   Denial of service by crashing the testing process or the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Access Control:** Implement robust access control to test file directories and repositories. Use role-based access control and the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Immutable Test Files in Production/CI:** Treat test files as immutable in production and CI/CD environments. Prevent dynamic generation or modification in these environments.
    *   **Code Review and Version Control:** Mandate code reviews for all test files and utilize version control to track and audit changes.
    *   **Secure Development Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding practices for test files, emphasizing the avoidance of hardcoded secrets and sensitive operations within tests.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Injection via Command-line Arguments](./attack_surfaces/configuration_injection_via_command-line_arguments.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious commands or arguments into the Mocha command-line invocation, manipulating Mocha's execution flow and potentially achieving code execution or other malicious actions. Mocha's command-line parsing is the entry point for this attack.
*   **Mocha Contribution:** Mocha's design relies on command-line arguments for configuration.  If the application or build process unsafely constructs these arguments from untrusted sources, it directly exposes this attack surface. Mocha's argument parsing and processing become the vulnerable point.
*   **Example:** A CI/CD pipeline dynamically constructs the Mocha command using a variable derived from an external, potentially attacker-influenced source. An attacker injects `--reporter=../../../../../../../../tmp/malicious_reporter.js` into this variable. Mocha, without proper validation, attempts to load and execute the malicious JavaScript file as a reporter, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Can lead to:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting malicious reporter paths or other arguments that can trigger code execution.
    *   **Path Traversal:**  Manipulating file paths to include arbitrary files for execution or reporting, potentially exposing sensitive files.
    *   **Indirect Command Injection:** In certain scenarios, argument manipulation could lead to the execution of unintended commands if Mocha or its reporters process arguments unsafely.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Providing arguments that cause Mocha to consume excessive resources or crash.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Command Construction from Untrusted Sources:**  Minimize or eliminate dynamic construction of Mocha command-line arguments based on untrusted input.
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:** If dynamic construction is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize and validate all inputs used to build the command line. Use allow-lists and escape special characters.
    *   **Parameterization and Configuration Files:** Prefer using configuration files or parameterized approaches for Mocha configuration instead of directly embedding untrusted input into command-line arguments.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run Mocha processes with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential command injection.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Injection via Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/configuration_injection_via_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers modify Mocha configuration files (`mocha.opts`, `package.json` Mocha settings) to alter Mocha's behavior maliciously, potentially leading to code execution or other compromises. Mocha's configuration file loading mechanism is the direct vector.
*   **Mocha Contribution:** Mocha directly reads and applies configurations from files like `mocha.opts` and `package.json`. If these files are compromised, Mocha will execute based on the attacker's modified configuration. Mocha's configuration loading process is the direct contributor to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the project's repository and modifies `mocha.opts` to include `--require malicious_setup.js`. When developers or CI/CD systems run Mocha, it will automatically execute `malicious_setup.js` before running tests, allowing for arbitrary code execution within the testing environment.
*   **Impact:** **High**. Similar to command-line injection, can lead to:
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By injecting `--require` or similar options that force Mocha to load and execute attacker-controlled JavaScript files.
    *   **Path Traversal:**  Potentially manipulating file paths within configuration options to access or execute arbitrary files.
    *   **Indirect Code Execution via Malicious Reporters:**  Changing the reporter setting to a malicious custom reporter hosted externally.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Modifying configurations to cause resource exhaustion or crashes.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Configuration File Management:** Treat configuration files as highly sensitive. Implement strict access control to prevent unauthorized modification.
    *   **Configuration File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files.
    *   **Static Configuration:** Prefer static and version-controlled configuration files. Avoid dynamic generation or modification based on untrusted sources.
    *   **Code Review for Configuration Changes:** Mandate code review processes for any changes to Mocha configuration files.
