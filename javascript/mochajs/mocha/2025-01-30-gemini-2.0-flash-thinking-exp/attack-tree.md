## Attack Tree Path: [1.0 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Mocha Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_0_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_mocha_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities present in the dependencies used by Mocha.  Node.js projects heavily rely on external libraries, and these dependencies can contain security flaws.
*   **Critical Node:**  The root of this path, "Exploit Vulnerabilities in Mocha Dependencies," is critical because successful exploitation can lead to severe consequences like Remote Code Execution.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **1.2 Exploit Vulnerability in Dependency [CRITICAL NODE]:** Once a vulnerable dependency is identified (through methods like using vulnerability databases or manual analysis), the attacker attempts to exploit it.
        *   **1.2.1 Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Dependency [CRITICAL NODE]:** This is the most severe outcome. A vulnerability in a dependency could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running the Mocha tests (developer machine, CI server).
            *   **1.2.1.1 Trigger Vulnerable Code Path in Dependency through Mocha Tests:** Attackers craft specific test cases or manipulate test data to trigger the vulnerable code within the dependency during test execution. This can lead to full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.0 Malicious Test Injection/Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2_0_malicious_test_injectionmanipulation__critical_node_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** This path centers on attackers injecting or manipulating test code to achieve malicious objectives.  If tests are compromised, they can be used to bypass security checks, introduce backdoors, or exfiltrate data.
*   **Critical Node:** "Malicious Test Injection/Manipulation" is critical because it represents a direct compromise of the testing process, undermining the security assurance provided by tests.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **2.1 Inject Malicious Test Code [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers aim to insert entirely new, malicious test files or code snippets into the project.
        *   **2.1.1 Compromise Code Repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) [CRITICAL NODE]:** Gaining unauthorized access to the code repository is a primary method for injecting malicious tests.
            *   **2.1.1.1 Steal Developer Credentials:** Attackers steal developer credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) through phishing, credential stuffing, or other methods to gain repository access.
            *   **2.1.1.2 Exploit Repository Vulnerabilities:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the repository platform itself (e.g., GitHub, GitLab) to gain unauthorized access or modify code.
        *   **2.1.2 Compromise CI/CD Pipeline [CRITICAL NODE]:**  CI/CD pipelines automate testing and deployment. Compromising the pipeline allows attackers to inject malicious tests into the automated workflow.
            *   **2.1.2.1 Inject Malicious Code into CI/CD Configuration:** Attackers modify CI/CD configuration files (e.g., Jenkinsfiles, GitLab CI YAML) to include steps that execute malicious test code.
            *   **2.1.2.2 Compromise CI/CD Server:** Attackers gain control of the CI/CD server itself, allowing them to directly manipulate the testing and deployment processes, including injecting malicious tests.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.0 Indirect Exploitation through Test Environment [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4_0_indirect_exploitation_through_test_environment__critical_node_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the test environment infrastructure itself, and then leveraging that compromised environment to attack production systems.
*   **Critical Node:** "Indirect Exploitation through Test Environment" is critical because it highlights that the test environment, often considered less critical than production, can be a stepping stone for wider compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors within this path:**
    *   **4.1 Compromise Test Environment Infrastructure [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers target the underlying infrastructure of the test environment.
        *   **4.1.1 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Test Servers/Containers:** Test environments often use servers or containers that may have unpatched vulnerabilities. Attackers exploit these to gain access to the test environment.
        *   **4.1.2 Gain Access to Test Databases or External Services:** Test environments frequently connect to databases or external services. Compromising these connected systems can provide access to sensitive test data or allow manipulation of test data, potentially impacting application behavior.
    *   **4.2 Leverage Test Environment Access for Lateral Movement [CRITICAL NODE]:** Once the test environment is compromised, attackers use it as a base to move laterally into more sensitive areas, like production.
        *   **4.2.1 Use Test Environment as Pivot Point to Access Production Environment:** If the test environment has network connectivity to the production environment (which is sometimes the case for testing integrations), attackers can use the compromised test environment as a pivot point to launch attacks against production systems.
        *   **4.2.2 Steal Credentials or Secrets Stored in Test Environment:** Test environments might inadvertently contain credentials or secrets that are also valid for production or can be used to access production systems. Attackers steal these credentials to gain access to production.
