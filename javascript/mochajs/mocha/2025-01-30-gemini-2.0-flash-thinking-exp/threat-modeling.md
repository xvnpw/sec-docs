# Threat Model Analysis for mochajs/mocha

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./threats/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into test files. Because Mocha directly executes these test files, the malicious code will be executed with the same privileges as the user running Mocha. This can be achieved by compromising developer machines, exploiting vulnerabilities in the development workflow (e.g., insecure file sharing, vulnerable IDE plugins), or through supply chain attacks that inject malicious code into test dependencies or test file templates.  Successful injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the development or CI/CD system.

**Impact:**
*   **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the development or CI/CD system.
*   **Critical:** Full compromise of the development or CI/CD environment.
*   **High:** Data exfiltration from the development environment, including source code, secrets, and internal data.
*   **High:** Introduction of backdoors or malware into the codebase through manipulated test results or build processes, potentially leading to supply chain attacks on downstream users.

**Mocha Component Affected:**
*   Test Runner (Mocha core execution engine responsible for executing test files).
*   Test Files (JavaScript files that Mocha interprets and executes).

**Risk Severity:** **Critical**

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Mandatory Code Review for Test Files:** Implement rigorous and mandatory code review processes for *all* test files, treating them with the same security scrutiny as production code. Focus on identifying any suspicious or unexpected code execution paths.
*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization in Tests:**  If tests interact with external data sources, APIs, or user inputs (even for mocking purposes), enforce strict input validation and sanitization within the test code to prevent injection attacks *within the test environment itself*.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Test Execution:**  **Crucially**, run Mocha tests with the minimum necessary privileges.  Never run tests as root or administrator. Utilize dedicated, restricted user accounts specifically for test execution within development and CI/CD environments.
*   **Secure and Isolated Development Environment:** Harden the development and CI/CD environments where Mocha tests are executed. Implement strong access controls, network segmentation, intrusion detection systems, and regular security patching. Isolate test environments from sensitive production systems.
*   **Dependency Management and Security Scanning for Test Dependencies:**  Maintain a strict inventory of test dependencies (including those used within test files and Mocha itself). Regularly audit and scan these dependencies for known vulnerabilities using automated tools like `npm audit`, `Snyk`, or dedicated dependency scanning solutions integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Secure Test File and Template Management:** Securely store and manage test files and templates. Control access to prevent unauthorized modification or injection of malicious code. Use version control and access control mechanisms.

## Threat: [Configuration Manipulation for Arbitrary Code Execution](./threats/configuration_manipulation_for_arbitrary_code_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates Mocha's configuration files (`.mocharc.js`, `package.json`) or command-line arguments to achieve arbitrary code execution. This could exploit potential vulnerabilities in how Mocha parses configuration options, especially if it involves dynamic code evaluation or insecure handling of file paths. For example, a maliciously crafted configuration might trick Mocha into loading and executing arbitrary JavaScript files outside of the intended test suite, or leverage vulnerable reporters to execute code during report generation.

**Impact:**
*   **Critical:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running Mocha.
*   **Critical:** Potential for full system compromise if the attacker gains sufficient privileges.
*   **High:**  Ability to bypass security checks by altering test execution flow to skip critical tests or manipulate test outcomes.
*   **High:** Information disclosure if configuration manipulation leads to verbose logging or altered output configurations that expose sensitive data.

**Mocha Component Affected:**
*   Configuration Loading (Mocha's configuration parsing logic, especially handling of file paths and dynamic options).
*   Reporters (Test result output mechanisms, if vulnerabilities exist in reporter implementations that can be exploited via configuration).
*   Command-line Argument Parsing (if vulnerabilities exist in how command-line arguments are processed and interpreted).

**Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (Critical if arbitrary code execution is reliably achievable through configuration manipulation).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Configuration File Storage and Access:**  Protect `.mocharc.js` and `package.json` files with strict file system permissions. Limit write access to only authorized and trusted personnel and processes. Implement version control and audit logging for configuration changes.
*   **Configuration Validation and Sanitization:** If configuration is dynamically generated or influenced by external sources, rigorously validate and sanitize all configuration values before they are processed by Mocha.  Prevent injection of malicious code or commands through configuration options.
*   **Regular Mocha Updates and Security Audits:** Keep Mocha and its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch any known configuration parsing vulnerabilities.  Consider periodic security audits of Mocha configuration handling and related code paths.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Configuration Access:** Restrict access to modify Mocha configuration files and command-line arguments to only authorized users and automated processes within secure CI/CD pipelines.
*   **Disable or Restrict Dynamic Configuration Features (If Possible):** If your workflow allows, consider disabling or restricting the use of dynamic or overly flexible configuration features in Mocha that might increase the attack surface (e.g., overly permissive file path handling in configuration).

These updated threats and mitigation strategies focus specifically on the high and critical risks directly related to Mocha, emphasizing the importance of secure test code, configuration management, and environment hardening. Regularly review and adapt these strategies as your application and testing practices evolve.
