## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Test Execution Flow](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_test_execution_flow.md)

- This path represents the attacker's ability to control the execution of tests, leading to the execution of malicious code within the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code into Tests](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_tests.md)

This is the central point where the attacker successfully introduces malicious code into the testing process. Success here directly leads to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers target vulnerabilities in Mocha's dependencies to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise a Mocha Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_a_mocha_dependency.md)

Gaining control over a dependency allows attackers to inject malicious code that will be executed when the dependency is loaded during tests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerability in Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerability_in_dependency.md)

Leveraging publicly known security flaws in a dependency to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/modify_configuration_files.md)

Attackers modify Mocha's configuration files to execute malicious code during test runs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via `.mocharc.js` or similar](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via___mocharc_js__or_similar.md)

Specifically targeting Mocha's configuration files to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Modify Test Files (Requires Prior Access)](./attack_tree_paths/directly_modify_test_files__requires_prior_access_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to the Filesystem](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_the_filesystem.md)

While requiring prior access, gaining control over the filesystem allows attackers to directly inject malicious code into test files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Mocha Internals](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_mocha_internals.md)

- This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities within the Mocha library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Mocha Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_mocha_vulnerabilities.md)

Attackers leverage publicly disclosed security flaws in Mocha.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target specific versions of Mocha with known issues](./attack_tree_paths/target_specific_versions_of_mocha_with_known_issues.md)

Targeting applications using outdated versions of Mocha that are known to be vulnerable.
