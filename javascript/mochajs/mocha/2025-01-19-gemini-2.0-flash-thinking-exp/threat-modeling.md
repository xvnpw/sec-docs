# Threat Model Analysis for mochajs/mocha

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./threats/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with the ability to modify test files injects malicious JavaScript code into a test case. When Mocha's `run` function executes these tests, the injected code runs with the privileges of the testing process. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as reading sensitive environment variables, accessing local files, or making network requests.

**Impact:** Data breach (sensitive information accessed), system compromise (malware installation, remote access).

**Affected Component:** Mocha's `run` function, individual test files.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls and code review processes for test files.
* Use a secure version control system with proper authentication and authorization.
* Regularly scan developer machines for malware.
* Implement supply chain security measures for test dependencies.
* Consider running tests in isolated environments (e.g., containers).

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Malicious Tests](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_malicious_tests.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts test cases that intentionally consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, disk I/O) when executed by Mocha's test execution engine. This can lead to denial-of-service conditions on the testing environment, slowing down development or disrupting CI/CD pipelines.

**Impact:** Denial of service, delayed development cycles.

**Affected Component:** Mocha's test execution engine.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement timeouts for individual test cases within Mocha's configuration.
* Monitor resource usage during test execution.
* Enforce code review practices to identify and prevent resource-intensive test logic.
* Run tests in environments with resource limits (e.g., using containerization).

## Threat: [Malicious Custom Reporters](./threats/malicious_custom_reporters.md)

**Description:** If using custom Mocha reporters, and these reporters are sourced from untrusted locations or are compromised, they could contain malicious code. When Mocha utilizes these reporters during the test reporting phase, the malicious code executes, potentially exfiltrating test results, system information, or compromising the system.

**Impact:** Data breach, system compromise.

**Affected Component:** Mocha's reporter interface, custom reporter modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only use built-in Mocha reporters or custom reporters from trusted and verified sources.
* Review the code of custom reporters before using them.
* Implement security scanning for custom reporter code.
