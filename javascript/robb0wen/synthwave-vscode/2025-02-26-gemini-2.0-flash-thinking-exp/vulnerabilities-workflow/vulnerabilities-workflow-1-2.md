- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Modification of VS Code Core Files during Neon Dreams Activation
  - **Description:**
    The new (v0.1.0) glow activation process works by having the extension modify internal files of VS Code. An attacker who is able to influence or intercept this process (for example, via a compromised update mechanism or by tricking a user into performing the action under malicious conditions) could inject altered or malicious code into VS Code’s internals. The typical exploitation chain is as follows:
    1. The victim installs the SynthWave ’84 theme and then—relying on the README instructions—runs VS Code with elevated privileges (on Windows, this involves running as administrator; on Linux/Mac, ensuring that the installation is in a writable location).
    2. The victim activates the glow effect using the “Enable Neon Dreams” command from the Command Palette.
    3. The underlying module (not shown in the documentation but implied by the text) opens key VS Code core files for writing and injects modifications intended solely to enable a neon glow effect.
    4. An external attacker who can either intercept the update channel or manipulate the installation package (or convince the victim to install a malicious variant) may replace or tamper with the payload that gets written, resulting in arbitrary code execution when VS Code restarts.

  - **Impact:**
    An attacker could achieve arbitrary code execution within the VS Code process—running with the user’s privileges (or even elevated privileges if on Windows). This might lead to a complete compromise of the development environment, persistent malware on the system, and even escalation to full system compromise.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The README clearly documents that enabling the glow effect involves modifying core files.
    - Users are warned to execute the process only if they understand the risks (e.g. running as administrator and accepting that VS Code’s internal files will be altered).
    - The process is manually triggered via a Command Palette command (i.e. “Enable Neon Dreams”), which at least requires deliberate user action.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No automatic or built-in integrity verification (e.g. cryptographic signatures) is in place to ensure that only the intended modifications are applied.
    - There is no sandboxing or rollback mechanism to restore the original VS Code files if tampering is detected.
    - The “glow activation” process does not validate that no additional code has been inserted beyond what is strictly necessary for the neon effect.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have installed the SynthWave ’84 theme and opt to activate the glow effect.
    - The user must run VS Code with administrative privileges (or on Linux/Mac, have write permission on the installation directory).
    - The attacker must be able to influence the activation process (for example, by compromising the update channel or tricking the user into executing a modified version).

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    Although no source code is provided in these markdown files, the README.md states that “to enable the glow, the extension has to modify the internal files of VS Code.” This implies that the extension contains a module that:
    1. Listens for the “Enable Neon Dreams” command from the command palette.
    2. Opens specific core files in the VS Code installation directory with elevated privileges.
    3. Alters the file contents to insert custom CSS/JS payloads that enable the neon glow.
    Due to the required elevated privileges and direct file modification, there is no intermediate validation or sandboxing layer. Visualizing the flow:
       • **User Action:** Initiates neon glow →
       • **Module Execution:** Opens hidden VS Code files and writes new content →
       • **Result:** Modified files are loaded on restart, and any malicious code (if injected) is executed.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Prepare a test environment installing a standard version of VS Code on Windows. Ensure you have a fresh, unmodified VS Code install.
    2. **Installation:** Install the SynthWave ’84 theme per documentation.
    3. **Elevation:** Run VS Code as an administrator (or ensure write permissions for the installation directory on Linux/Mac).
    4. **Activation:** Open the Command Palette and trigger “Enable Neon Dreams.”
    5. **Observation:** Monitor the VS Code core directories (e.g. by using file integrity monitoring tools) to detect which files are modified.
    6. **Tampering Simulation:** In a controlled lab environment, substitute the expected modifications with a benign “payload” (for example, one that writes to a log file or displays an alert on startup).
    7. **Restart:** Launch VS Code and verify that the tampered changes were applied and that the injected code was executed.
    This test demonstrates that an attacker who can control or mimic the modification process could inject malicious code leading to system compromise.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Legacy Custom CSS/JS Injection
  - **Description:**
    The legacy installation procedure (described in README_LEGACY.md) instructs users to manually copy a CSS file (either `synthwave84.css` or `synthwave84-noglow.css`) and then configure VS Code’s `settings.json` by adding a file protocol URL for the custom CSS/JS injection extension. This third-party extension (vscode-custom-css) does not perform any integrity or signature checks when loading the custom files. An attacker who can gain write access to the CSS file location—or hijack the update or hosting location of the file—could replace it with a malicious payload. When VS Code loads this custom file, the injected JavaScript code would run with the same privileges as VS Code.
    The exploitation chain is as follows:
    1. The victim follows the legacy instructions and configures VS Code to load a local custom CSS/JS file via a file:// URL.
    2. An attacker who has compromised the file storage (or deceives the user into using a malicious file) replaces the legitimate CSS/JS file with a version containing hostile JavaScript.
    3. VS Code loads and executes the injected code on startup.

  - **Impact:**
    This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of VS Code, which can lead to a complete compromise of the user’s development environment and potentially the entire system. Given that the code runs with the privileges of the user (which might be administrative), the impact is critical.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The legacy documentation warns the user to “carefully read the ReadMe regarding permission for that extension” and to include the file protocol explicitly.
    - The process is heavily manual, meaning the user must intentionally copy the file and modify settings.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no integrity or cryptographic signature check to verify that the CSS/JS file has not been tampered with.
    - The third-party extension does not sandbox or otherwise restrict the execution context of the loaded CSS/JS.
    - There is no mechanism to limit the privileges with which the injected code runs.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user has chosen to use the legacy method by installing the third-party Custom CSS and JS extension.
    - The user places the CSS file in a location referenced by their VS Code settings (`settings.json`), using a file:// URL.
    - The attacker must either have write access to the file location or be able to substitute the file with a malicious version (for example, via a compromised hosting server or by tricking the user).

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    The README_LEGACY.md clearly details a process where the user is instructed to:
    1. Download and copy the CSS file (e.g. `synthwave84.css`) to a local directory.
    2. Edit `settings.json` to add an import line such as:
       ```
       "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
         "file:///Users/{your username}/synthwave84.css"
       ]
       ```
    3. Execute “Enable custom CSS and JS” from the Command Palette to load the custom file.
    Because the extension that performs this injection does not validate the file’s content, the integrity of the CSS/JS payload is entirely dependent on the user’s manual copy. If an attacker can replace or modify this file, the malicious code will be injected into VS Code’s running process.
    The flow can be depicted as:
       • **Configuration:** User adds a file path in settings.json →
       • **Extension Action:** The custom CSS and JS extension reads the file at the specified path →
       • **Injection:** The file content (which may now include arbitrary JS) is injected into VS Code’s interface and executed.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create a test machine with VS Code installed and add the third-party Custom CSS and JS extension.
    2. **Legacy Configuration:** Follow the legacy installation routine—copy the provided CSS file to a known location and update `settings.json` with the file:// path.
    3. **Malicious Modification:** In a controlled lab environment, modify the copied CSS file to include a small snippet of JavaScript (e.g., one that writes a marker to a log file or displays an alert on startup).
    4. **Activation:** Run the “Enable custom CSS and JS” command via the Command Palette and restart VS Code.
    5. **Verification:** Verify that the malicious code executes (e.g., by checking for the log marker or an on-screen alert).
    This test case demonstrates that an attacker who can influence the contents of the CSS file can trigger arbitrary code execution in VS Code.
