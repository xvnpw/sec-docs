## Vulnerability List for SynthWave '84 VS Code Theme

This document outlines the identified vulnerabilities within the SynthWave '84 VS Code theme.

### 1. Potential for Malicious Code Injection through Core File Modification

- **Description:**
  The "Neon Dreams" feature of the Synthwave '84 VS Code theme functions by modifying core VS Code files to implement the glow effect. This process, while intended to enhance the theme's visual appeal, introduces a potential vulnerability. If the mechanism used to modify these core files is not meticulously secured, it could be exploited to inject malicious code into VS Code itself.  An attacker could potentially craft a malicious version of the theme, or compromise the update process, to subtly alter the file modification logic. When a user then activates the "Neon Dreams" feature, this altered logic could be used to inject and execute arbitrary code within the user's VS Code environment, effectively leveraging the theme's intended functionality for malicious purposes. While the user initiates the process by enabling "Neon Dreams", the underlying vulnerability lies in the potential for insecure file modification within the extension.  Specifically, an attacker who is able to influence or intercept this process (for example, via a compromised update mechanism or by tricking a user into performing the action under malicious conditions) could inject altered or malicious code into VS Code’s internals.

  The typical exploitation chain is as follows:
    1. The victim installs the SynthWave ’84 theme and then runs VS Code with elevated privileges (on Windows, this involves running as administrator; on Linux/Mac, ensuring that the installation is in a writable location).
    2. The victim activates the glow effect using the “Enable Neon Dreams” command from the Command Palette.
    3. The underlying module opens key VS Code core files for writing and injects modifications intended solely to enable a neon glow effect.
    4. An external attacker who can either intercept the update channel or manipulate the installation package (or convince the victim to install a malicious variant) may replace or tamper with the payload that gets written, resulting in arbitrary code execution when VS Code restarts.

- **Impact:**
  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the VS Code environment, operating with the privileges of the VS Code process. This would grant an attacker significant control, potentially allowing them to:
    - Access and exfiltrate sensitive user files and data, including source code, credentials, and personal information.
    - Modify project files, inject backdoors into projects, or introduce malware into the development environment.
    - Pivot to further compromise the user's system beyond the VS Code environment.
    - Cause instability or unpredictable behavior in VS Code, disrupting the user's workflow.
    - Potentially achieve a complete compromise of the development environment, persistent malware on the system, and even escalation to full system compromise.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  The project includes the following mitigations:
    - **Disclaimers and Warnings:** The `README.md` file prominently features disclaimers about the experimental nature of the glow effect and explicitly warns users about the risks associated with modifying core VS Code files. It advises users to proceed with caution and at their own risk. The README clearly documents that enabling the glow effect involves modifying core files. Users are warned to execute the process only if they understand the risks (e.g. running as administrator and accepting that VS Code’s internal files will be altered).
    - **User Consent:** Enabling the "Neon Dreams" feature requires explicit user action via the VS Code command palette, ensuring that the user is aware and actively initiates the core file modification process. The process is manually triggered via a Command Palette command (i.e. “Enable Neon Dreams”), which at least requires deliberate user action.
    - **Guidance on Checksum Fix:** The documentation mentions the "Fix VSCode Checksums" extension to address the VS Code corruption warning, indirectly acknowledging and providing a solution for the side effects of core file modification.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  Despite the warnings, the following security mitigations are missing:
    - **Secure File Modification Process:** The extension lacks explicit security measures to ensure the file modification process is robust and secure against code injection and path traversal attacks. Input validation and sanitization for file paths and injected content are crucial missing elements. No automatic or built-in integrity verification (e.g. cryptographic signatures) is in place to ensure that only the intended modifications are applied.
    - **Code Review and Security Audit:** There is no indication of a formal security review or code audit specifically focused on the "Enable Neon Dreams" functionality and its core file modification mechanism. Such a review would be essential to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** The file modification process likely runs with the privileges of the VS Code process. Ideally, it should operate with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential damage from exploitation.
    - **Alternative Implementation Exploration:**  The project does not discuss exploration of alternative methods to achieve the glow effect that avoid modifying core VS Code files altogether. Investigating less intrusive approaches would inherently reduce the risk.
    - **Sandboxing or Rollback Mechanism:** There is no sandboxing or rollback mechanism to restore the original VS Code files if tampering is detected.
    - **Code Injection Validation:** The “glow activation” process does not validate that no additional code has been inserted beyond what is strictly necessary for the neon effect.

- **Preconditions:**
  The following preconditions must be met to potentially exploit this vulnerability:
    - **Theme Installation:** The user must have installed the Synthwave '84 VS Code theme.
    - **User Action - Enable "Neon Dreams":** The user must explicitly enable the "Neon Dreams" feature by executing the "Enable Neon Dreams" command from the VS Code command palette. This implies a degree of user awareness and intent to use the feature.
    - **File System Permissions:** The user's operating system and VS Code installation must allow the extension to modify files within the VS Code installation directory. This is typically the case for user-installed applications, especially when VS Code is run with default permissions.
    - **Elevated Privileges (Potentially):** The user must run VS Code with administrative privileges (or on Linux/Mac, have write permission on the installation directory) for the core file modification to succeed.
    - **Attacker Influence (for Exploitation):** The attacker must be able to influence the activation process (for example, by compromising the update channel or tricking the user into executing a modified version).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  Although no source code is provided in these markdown files, the README.md states that “to enable the glow, the extension has to modify the internal files of VS Code.” This implies that the extension contains a module that:
    1. Listens for the “Enable Neon Dreams” command from the command palette.
    2. Opens specific core files in the VS Code installation directory with elevated privileges.
    3. Alters the file contents to insert custom CSS/JS payloads that enable the neon glow.
    Due to the required elevated privileges and direct file modification, there is no intermediate validation or sandboxing layer. Visualizing the flow:
       • **User Action:** Initiates neon glow →
       • **Module Execution:** Opens hidden VS Code files and writes new content →
       • **Result:** Modified files are loaded on restart, and any malicious code (if injected) is executed.

    Potential Vulnerabilities in the file modification process:
        - **Path Traversal:** If the script constructs file paths using string concatenation or other insecure methods without proper validation and sanitization, an attacker could potentially manipulate the file paths to write to arbitrary locations outside of the intended VS Code core directories.
        - **Code Injection:** If the script dynamically constructs or interprets CSS code to be injected, and if this process is not properly sanitized, an attacker could inject malicious CSS code.
        - **Race Conditions/File Corruption:** If the file modification process is not atomic or properly handles concurrency, there could be a risk of race conditions leading to corrupted VS Code files.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:** Prepare a test environment installing a standard version of VS Code on Windows. Ensure you have a fresh, unmodified VS Code install.
  2. **Installation:** Install the SynthWave ’84 theme per documentation.
  3. **Elevation:** Run VS Code as an administrator (or ensure write permissions for the installation directory on Linux/Mac).
  4. **Activation:** Open the Command Palette and trigger “Enable Neon Dreams.”
  5. **Observation:** Monitor the VS Code core directories (e.g. by using file integrity monitoring tools) to detect which files are modified.
  6. **Tampering Simulation:** In a controlled lab environment, substitute the expected modifications with a benign “payload” (for example, one that writes to a log file or displays an alert on startup). Or prepare a malicious CSS payload designed to exploit a potential path traversal vulnerability or code injection.
  7. **Restart:** Launch VS Code and verify that the tampered changes were applied and that the injected code was executed.
  8. **File System Monitoring:** Monitor file system activity to see if files are being modified in unexpected locations, indicating a path traversal vulnerability.
  9. **VS Code Behavior:** Observe VS Code for any unexpected behavior, crashes, UI glitches, or signs of compromise after enabling "Neon Dreams" with the malicious payloads.
  10. **Network Monitoring:** Monitor network traffic for any unexpected outbound connections initiated by VS Code after enabling "Neon Dreams" with malicious CSS, which could indicate attempts to exfiltrate data or load external resources.
  11. **Examine Modified Files:** Inspect the core VS Code files that were modified by the "Enable Neon Dreams" command to see if the malicious payloads were successfully injected and if they are present in the modified files as intended.

  This test demonstrates that an attacker who can control or mimic the modification process could inject malicious code leading to system compromise.

### 2. Arbitrary Code Execution via Legacy Custom CSS/JS Injection

- **Description:**
  The legacy installation procedure (described in README_LEGACY.md) instructs users to manually copy a CSS file (either `synthwave84.css` or `synthwave84-noglow.css`) and then configure VS Code’s `settings.json` by adding a file protocol URL for the custom CSS/JS injection extension. This third-party extension (vscode-custom-css) does not perform any integrity or signature checks when loading the custom files. An attacker who can gain write access to the CSS file location—or hijack the update or hosting location of the file—could replace it with a malicious payload. When VS Code loads this custom file, the injected JavaScript code would run with the same privileges as VS Code.

  The exploitation chain is as follows:
    1. The victim follows the legacy instructions and configures VS Code to load a local custom CSS/JS file via a file:// URL.
    2. An attacker who has compromised the file storage (or deceives the user into using a malicious file) replaces the legitimate CSS/JS file with a version containing hostile JavaScript.
    3. VS Code loads and executes the injected code on startup.

- **Impact:**
  This vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of VS Code, which can lead to a complete compromise of the user’s development environment and potentially the entire system. Given that the code runs with the privileges of the user (which might be administrative), the impact is critical.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The legacy documentation warns the user to “carefully read the ReadMe regarding permission for that extension” and to include the file protocol explicitly.
  - The process is heavily manual, meaning the user must intentionally copy the file and modify settings.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no integrity or cryptographic signature check to verify that the CSS/JS file has not been tampered with.
  - The third-party extension does not sandbox or otherwise restrict the execution context of the loaded CSS/JS.
  - There is no mechanism to limit the privileges with which the injected code runs.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The user has chosen to use the legacy method by installing the third-party Custom CSS and JS extension.
  - The user places the CSS file in a location referenced by their VS Code settings (`settings.json`), using a file:// URL.
  - The attacker must either have write access to the file location or be able to substitute the file with a malicious version (for example, via a compromised hosting server or by tricking the user).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  The README_LEGACY.md clearly details a process where the user is instructed to:
    1. Download and copy the CSS file (e.g. `synthwave84.css`) to a local directory.
    2. Edit `settings.json` to add an import line such as:
       ```json
       "vscode_custom_css.imports": [
         "file:///Users/{your username}/synthwave84.css"
       ]
       ```
    3. Execute “Enable custom CSS and JS” from the Command Palette to load the custom file.
    Because the extension that performs this injection does not validate the file’s content, the integrity of the CSS/JS payload is entirely dependent on the user’s manual copy. If an attacker can replace or modify this file, the malicious code will be injected into VS Code’s running process.
    The flow can be depicted as:
       • **Configuration:** User adds a file path in settings.json →
       • **Extension Action:** The custom CSS and JS extension reads the file at the specified path →
       • **Injection:** The file content (which may now include arbitrary JS) is injected into VS Code’s interface and executed.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:** Create a test machine with VS Code installed and add the third-party Custom CSS and JS extension.
  2. **Legacy Configuration:** Follow the legacy installation routine—copy the provided CSS file to a known location and update `settings.json` with the file:// path.
  3. **Malicious Modification:** In a controlled lab environment, modify the copied CSS file to include a small snippet of JavaScript (e.g., one that writes a marker to a log file or displays an alert on startup).
  4. **Activation:** Run the “Enable custom CSS and JS” command via the Command Palette and restart VS Code.
  5. **Verification:** Verify that the malicious code executes (e.g., by checking for the log marker or an on-screen alert).
  This test case demonstrates that an attacker who can influence the contents of the CSS file can trigger arbitrary code execution in VS Code.
