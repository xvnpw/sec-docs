### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Webview XSS via Malicious Dictionary Word
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious custom dictionary file.
    2. The malicious dictionary file contains a word that includes a JavaScript payload, for example: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`.
    3. A user configures the Code Spell Checker extension to use this malicious custom dictionary. This could be done through VS Code settings or a `cspell.json` file, as described in the documentation for custom dictionaries.
    4. The user opens a text file and types a word that triggers a suggestion from the malicious dictionary. This could be any misspelled word that the malicious dictionary also contains as a "correct" word for suggestion purposes.
    5. The Code Spell Checker extension, when displaying suggestions in a webview, renders the malicious dictionary word without proper sanitization.
    6. The JavaScript payload within the malicious word is executed in the context of the webview, resulting in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Impact: Successful XSS exploitation in a VS Code webview could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the VS Code extension. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure (e.g., access tokens, workspace data), modification of user settings, or potentially gaining control over the user's VS Code instance and system, depending on the extension's privileges and VS Code's security model.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Based on the provided PROJECT FILES, including `CHANGELOG.md` for `_integrationTests` and `_server`, `CONTRIBUTE.md`, `FAQ.md`, `SECURITY.md`, website documentation files, and code of conduct, there is no explicit mention of input sanitization or output encoding for webview content related to dictionary words.  The `CHANGELOG.md` files show updates to CSpell, which is the underlying spell-checking library, but these updates do not provide details on security enhancements related to XSS prevention in webviews.  The `FAQ.md` and `docs/settings.md` files describe extension features and settings but do not discuss security mitigations.  The provided files do not contain any evidence of implemented mitigations for this XSS vulnerability. It remains unknown if any mitigations are currently implemented within the project to prevent XSS in webviews, specifically when rendering dictionary words in suggestions.
- Missing Mitigations: Input sanitization and output encoding are crucial to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. All data displayed in webviews that originates from potentially untrusted sources (like custom dictionaries) should be rigorously sanitized or encoded before being rendered. Specifically, HTML escaping should be applied to text content to prevent the browser from interpreting it as HTML tags or JavaScript. Employing a Content Security Policy (CSP) for webviews could also serve as an additional security measure, although it might require careful configuration to avoid breaking legitimate extension functionality.
- Preconditions:
    1. The Code Spell Checker extension utilizes webviews to display dynamic content, such as spelling suggestions.
    2. The webview content includes data derived from custom dictionaries, which are user-provided and potentially untrusted sources.
    3. The data from custom dictionaries, specifically words used for suggestions, is rendered in the webview without proper sanitization or encoding to prevent XSS.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Access to the source code responsible for rendering webviews and handling dictionary suggestions is still unavailable. Therefore, a detailed code analysis remains infeasible.
    - Based on the project documentation and file structure (specifically the presence of `_server` and `client` packages), it's assumed that the extension likely follows a client-server architecture. The vulnerability is presumed to be in the `client` package, where webviews are rendered and user interactions are handled.
    - The vulnerability would be located in the code path that processes dictionary suggestions and displays them in the webview. Specifically, the lack of sanitization when rendering words from custom dictionaries in the suggestion webview allows for the execution of injected HTML or JavaScript.
    - To trigger the vulnerability, an attacker needs to inject malicious code into a custom dictionary word. If this word is then displayed as a suggestion without sanitization, the injected script executes within the webview's context.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a new text file named `malicious_dict.txt` with the following content:
    ```text
    <img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
    ```
    2. In VS Code, open the settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings on macOS).
    3. Search for "cSpell.customDictionaries" and click "Edit in settings.json".
    4. Add the following configuration to your `settings.json` file within the `cSpell.customDictionaries` section. If the section doesn't exist, create it. Adjust the path to `malicious_dict.txt` to be an absolute path or relative to your workspace/user settings location. For example, if `malicious_dict.txt` is in your user home directory in a folder named `dictionaries`, the path would be like `"~/dictionaries/malicious_dict.txt"` on Linux/macOS or `"C:\\Users\\YourUserName\\dictionaries\\malicious_dict.txt"` on Windows.
    ```json
    "cSpell.customDictionaries": {
        "maliciousDict": {
            "name": "maliciousDict",
            "path": "~/dictionaries/malicious_dict.txt"
        }
    },
    "cSpell.dictionaries": [
        "maliciousDict"
    ]
    ```
    **Note:** Replace `"~/dictionaries/malicious_dict.txt"` with the actual path to your `malicious_dict.txt` file. Ensure the path is correct for your operating system.
    5. Create a new text file or open an existing one in VS Code.
    6. Type a misspelled word that is likely to trigger suggestions. For example, type "wordd".
    7. Trigger the suggestion popup by positioning the cursor on "wordd" and using the "Quick Fix" command (e.g., `Ctrl+.` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd+.` on macOS) or clicking on the lightbulb icon if it appears.
    8. Observe if an alert box with "XSS" is displayed. If an alert box appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability. If no alert appears, the vulnerability might not be present, or the test case needs adjustment.
