- **No High-Severity Vulnerabilities Detected**
  - **Description:**  
    A complete review of all project files—including the static syntax definition files, snippet templates, build script, and configuration documents—reveals that the extension is designed to supply static content for Visual Studio Code. There is no code path that accepts or processes untrusted external user input. All file I/O operations (for example, in the build script) operate over controlled, hardcoded filenames and directories. There is no execution of code from user-supplied data, no dynamic evaluation, and no network endpoints where an attacker could inject malicious payloads.
  - **Impact:**  
    Since there are no means for an external attacker to trigger any injection, remote code execution, file inclusion, or similar issues, there is no risk of compromising the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the extension based on the current codebase.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:**  
    *None detected (no issues meeting high or critical rank were found).*
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - All file accesses in the build process are performed using hardcoded paths and a controlled set of syntax names (e.g. `"django-html"` and `"django-txt"`).
    - The project exclusively uses static definitions for snippets and syntax highlighting, without dynamic interpretation of untrusted input.
    - There is no exposure of network endpoints or user-submitted data.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    *No additional mitigations are needed because no high-severity vulnerabilities were identified.*
  - **Preconditions:**  
    *None. There is no externally controllable input or behavior that could be exploited.*
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - **Build Script (`syntaxes/build.py`):**  
      Reads fixed TOML files from a dedicated syntax directory and writes out JSON files. All file openings are based on preconfigured paths. Although the `tomlkit.load` function is overridden with a simple file reader, the input files are controlled and not derived from external sources.
    - **Syntax and Snippets Files:**  
      These files are static configuration files meant for syntax highlighting and snippet insertion. They contain regular expressions or template strings that are not executed dynamically in a manner that would allow code injection.
    - **Other Documentation and Configuration Files:**  
      The remaining project files (README, CHANGELOG, GitHub funding info, etc.) are static and do not affect runtime behavior.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    - **Test Step 1:**  
      Install the extension from a clean, verified source and launch VS Code.  
    - **Test Step 2:**  
      Inspect the extension’s installation directory to verify that the syntax JSON files are generated only from the controlled set of TOML files.
    - **Test Step 3:**  
      Attempt to invoke any commands or interact with the extension’s functionality through the VS Code command palette. Note that there are no commands that accept external input for processing.
    - **Test Step 4:**  
      Verify that no file I/O operations are performed on unexpected file paths by reviewing the extension’s logs (if available) or by monitoring file system activity during extension execution.
    - **Expected Result:**  
      The extension behaves as expected, using only the preconfigured static files and performing no dynamic or insecure processing. No externally exploitable behavior is observed.
