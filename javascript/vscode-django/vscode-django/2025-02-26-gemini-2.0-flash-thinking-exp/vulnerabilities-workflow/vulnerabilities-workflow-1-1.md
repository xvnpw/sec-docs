## Vulnerability List for vscode-django project

After analyzing the project files and applying the specified criteria for vulnerability selection, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank, exploitable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance of an application, were identified within the scope of the vscode-django project.

**Reasoning:**

The vscode-django project is a Visual Studio Code extension focused on enhancing Django template development. It provides syntax highlighting, code snippets, and go-to-definition support within the VS Code editor. It is not a publicly accessible web application or service.

Based on the instructions to exclude vulnerabilities that are:

*   Caused by developers using insecure code patterns from project files.
*   Only missing documentation for mitigation.
*   Denial of Service vulnerabilities.

And to include only vulnerabilities that:

*   Are valid and not already mitigated.
*   Have a vulnerability rank of at least high.
*   Are exploitable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance.

The vscode-django project does not present vulnerabilities meeting these inclusion criteria for the following reasons:

1.  **Not a publicly available application:** vscode-django is a VS Code extension that runs locally within a developer's VS Code environment. There is no publicly accessible instance that an external attacker can target.
2.  **Focus on client-side features:** The extension's functionality is limited to syntax highlighting, code snippets, and editor integrations within VS Code. It does not handle server-side logic, user data, or network requests that are typical attack vectors in web applications.
3.  **Exclusion of developer-induced vulnerabilities:**  The project provides code snippets, but vulnerabilities arising from *using* these snippets in a Django project are attributed to the developer's implementation, not the extension itself. This is explicitly excluded by the instructions.
4.  **No high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable in a public context:**  Given the nature of a VS Code extension and the exclusion criteria, no high-rank vulnerabilities relevant to an external attacker on a public instance were found within the project's code.

**Conclusion:**

According to the provided instructions and the scope of the vscode-django project, there are no vulnerabilities to list that meet the specified criteria for inclusion. The project is not designed to be deployed as a publicly accessible application and its functionality is limited to enhancing the local development experience within VS Code.
