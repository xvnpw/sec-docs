## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Regular PixiJS Updates](./mitigation_strategies/1__regular_pixijs_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update PixiJS Library
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor PixiJS Releases:** Track releases on the official PixiJS GitHub repository ([https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js](https://github.com/pixijs/pixi.js)) and community channels for security updates and bug fixes.
    2.  **Review PixiJS Changelogs:** When updating, specifically review the PixiJS changelogs for mentions of security patches or bug fixes that could impact your application.
    3.  **Test PixiJS Updates:** Before deploying to production, thoroughly test PixiJS updates in a staging environment to ensure compatibility with your application's PixiJS implementation and identify any regressions.
    4.  **Update PixiJS Dependency:** Use your package manager (npm, yarn, etc.) to update the `pixi.js` dependency to the latest stable version.
    5.  **Maintain Update Schedule:** Establish a regular schedule for checking and applying PixiJS updates to benefit from the latest security improvements.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Vulnerability Scanning for PixiJS Dependencies](./mitigation_strategies/2__vulnerability_scanning_for_pixijs_dependencies.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Vulnerability Scanning for PixiJS and its Dependencies
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Dependency Scanning Tools:** Employ vulnerability scanning tools (like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, OWASP Dependency-Check, or commercial SCA tools) to analyze `pixi.js` and its direct and transitive dependencies.
    2.  **Focus on PixiJS Dependency Tree:** Configure the scanning tool to specifically analyze the dependency tree originating from `pixi.js` in your project's `package.json` or `yarn.lock` file.
    3.  **Prioritize PixiJS Related Vulnerabilities:** Review scan results, prioritizing vulnerabilities identified within the PixiJS dependency chain, as these directly impact the security of your PixiJS implementation.
    4.  **Remediate PixiJS Dependency Issues:** Address identified vulnerabilities by updating `pixi.js` or its vulnerable dependencies to patched versions.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploits of Known PixiJS Dependencies Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** PixiJS relies on third-party libraries, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect PixiJS security and your application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploits of Known PixiJS Dependencies Vulnerabilities (High Reduction):** Proactively identifies and allows remediation of vulnerabilities within the libraries PixiJS relies upon.

    *   Yes, `npm audit` is integrated into the CI pipeline, scanning `pixi.js` dependencies on every pull request and nightly build.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Exploring more comprehensive SCA tools beyond `npm audit` could enhance vulnerability detection within the broader PixiJS dependency ecosystem.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration for PixiJS](./mitigation_strategies/3__content_security_policy__csp__configuration_for_pixijs.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) to Secure PixiJS Usage
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define PixiJS-Specific CSP Directives:**  When configuring CSP, consider the specific resource loading requirements of PixiJS, particularly for:
        *   **`script-src`:** Control script sources, ensuring only trusted origins for PixiJS scripts and any plugins. Minimize or eliminate `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` which can weaken CSP and are generally not required for standard PixiJS usage.
        *   **`img-src`:** Restrict image sources to trusted domains for textures and sprites used by PixiJS.
        *   **`connect-src`:** If PixiJS or your application loads assets via network requests (e.g., AJAX for textures), configure `connect-src` to whitelist allowed origins.
    2.  **Test CSP Compatibility with PixiJS:**  Thoroughly test your CSP configuration to ensure it doesn't interfere with PixiJS functionality, especially WebGL rendering or plugin loading.
    3.  **Monitor PixiJS CSP Violations:**  Set up CSP violation reporting to detect any unexpected resource loading attempts by PixiJS or your application within the PixiJS context.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) impacting PixiJS Context (High Severity):** CSP can prevent execution of malicious scripts that might attempt to manipulate PixiJS or access data within the PixiJS rendering environment.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) impacting PixiJS Context (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks that could compromise the PixiJS rendering and application logic.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. A basic CSP exists, but needs refinement for PixiJS specific needs and stricter directives.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CSP needs to be tightened by removing `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`, explicitly configuring `connect-src` and `style-src` for PixiJS resources, and setting up CSP violation reporting to monitor PixiJS related policy breaches.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Sanitize User-Provided Text for PixiJS Text Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/4__sanitize_user-provided_text_for_pixijs_text_rendering.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User-Provided Text Before Rendering with PixiJS Text Objects
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify PixiJS Text Input Points:** Locate all instances where user-provided text is used to set the `text` property of PixiJS `Text` objects or similar text rendering functionalities within PixiJS.
    2.  **Sanitize Before PixiJS Rendering:**  Apply HTML sanitization to user-provided text *before* passing it to PixiJS for rendering. Use a JavaScript sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove or encode potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
    3.  **Focus on Text Content:** Ensure sanitization is applied specifically to the text content that will be rendered by PixiJS, preventing interpretation of malicious code within the PixiJS text rendering process.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via PixiJS Text Rendering (High Severity):**  Unsanitized user text rendered by PixiJS `Text` objects could be exploited to inject and execute malicious JavaScript within the application context.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No, user-provided text is currently directly used in PixiJS Text objects in some application areas without sanitization.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sanitization must be implemented for all user text inputs used in PixiJS Text rendering across the application, especially in user-generated content areas.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Validate User-Provided Image URLs and Assets for PixiJS Textures](./mitigation_strategies/5__validate_user-provided_image_urls_and_assets_for_pixijs_textures.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit User Control Over Direct PixiJS API Parameters
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User-Influenced PixiJS API Calls:**  Analyze code to find areas where user input directly controls parameters of PixiJS API functions, especially those related to rendering, resource loading, or event handling.
    2.  **Abstract PixiJS API Interactions:**  Introduce an abstraction layer to mediate user interactions with PixiJS. Instead of direct API access, create controlled functions that validate and sanitize user inputs before translating them into PixiJS API calls.
    3.  **Validate and Sanitize PixiJS API Parameters:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input that will be used as parameters for PixiJS API functions to prevent unexpected behavior or manipulation of PixiJS rendering logic.

    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via PixiJS API Abuse (Medium Reduction):** Helps prevent DoS attacks by controlling user influence over resource-intensive PixiJS API calls.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic input validation exists for some user interactions affecting PixiJS elements, but more comprehensive control is needed.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A stronger abstraction layer is needed to further isolate user input from direct PixiJS API access. Comprehensive validation and sanitization should be applied to all user inputs that influence PixiJS API parameters.
