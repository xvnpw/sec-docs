# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a high-performance and flexible 2D rendering library for web developers.
  - Enable creation of rich, interactive graphics, games, and visualizations in web browsers.
  - Maintain broad browser compatibility and device support.
  - Foster a strong community and ecosystem around the library.
  - Ensure ease of use and a developer-friendly API.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in PixiJS could be exploited in applications using the library, leading to attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or denial of service.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting the distribution channels (e.g., npm, CDN) could compromise the library's integrity.
  - Reputational damage and loss of user trust if security issues are discovered and not addressed promptly.
  - Performance issues or lack of compatibility could lead developers to choose alternative libraries.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub Dependabot is likely used to identify vulnerable dependencies. (Implemented in: GitHub Repository Settings)
  - security control: Code reviews are performed by maintainers and community contributors. (Implemented in: GitHub Pull Request Process)
  - security control: GitHub code scanning might be enabled to detect potential code vulnerabilities. (Implemented in: GitHub Repository Settings)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and fixing security vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature means vulnerabilities may be publicly disclosed before a patch is available.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Security Scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
  - security control: Establish a formal vulnerability disclosure policy and security contact.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts.
  - security control: Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for releases to enhance supply chain transparency.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to PixiJS library itself, as it does not handle user authentication. Applications using PixiJS will need to implement their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to PixiJS library itself. Applications using PixiJS will need to implement authorization based on their specific requirements.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: PixiJS should validate all external inputs, such as texture URLs, shader code, and user-provided data used in rendering, to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, Shader injection).
    - Requirement: Input validation should be applied on both data types and data ranges to avoid unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: PixiJS itself may not require extensive cryptography, but if it handles sensitive data or interacts with secure APIs in the future, appropriate cryptographic measures (e.g., HTTPS for network requests) should be used.
    - Requirement: Applications using PixiJS might require cryptography for secure communication or data storage, which should be implemented by the application developers, not directly within the PixiJS library.
