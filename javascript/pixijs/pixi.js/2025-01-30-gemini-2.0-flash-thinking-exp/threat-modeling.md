# Threat Model Analysis for pixijs/pixi.js

## Threat: [Known PixiJS Library Vulnerability](./threats/known_pixijs_library_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits a publicly known security vulnerability within the PixiJS library itself. This is achieved by crafting specific inputs or interactions with the PixiJS application that trigger the vulnerability in the PixiJS code.
*   **Impact:**  Can lead to severe consequences such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in users' browsers. In critical cases, it could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the browser environment, or Denial of Service (DoS) making the application unusable. Data breaches or unauthorized actions might be possible depending on the vulnerability.
*   **PixiJS Component Affected:** Core PixiJS library code (various modules and functions depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Update:**  As soon as a vulnerability is announced, update PixiJS to the patched version immediately.
    *   **Proactive Monitoring:** Continuously monitor PixiJS release notes, security advisories, and community channels for vulnerability disclosures.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated tools in the development pipeline to regularly scan project dependencies, including PixiJS, for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Transitive Dependency Vulnerability (High Severity)](./threats/transitive_dependency_vulnerability__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker indirectly exploits a high or critical severity vulnerability present in a library that PixiJS depends on (a transitive dependency).  PixiJS's reliance on this vulnerable dependency becomes the attack vector.
*   **Impact:** Similar to direct PixiJS vulnerabilities, exploitation can result in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Denial of Service (DoS), or potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the user's browser. The impact severity is dictated by the nature of the vulnerability in the transitive dependency.
*   **PixiJS Component Affected:** Indirectly affects the entire PixiJS application due to its dependency on the vulnerable library.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (when the transitive dependency vulnerability is of high or critical severity)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Tree Analysis and Monitoring:** Regularly analyze the PixiJS dependency tree to identify transitive dependencies and monitor them for reported vulnerabilities.
    *   **Update PixiJS and Tooling:** Update PixiJS and related build tools to versions that address or mitigate known transitive dependency vulnerabilities. Sometimes updating PixiJS might indirectly update its dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning Tools:** Utilize vulnerability scanning tools that can detect vulnerabilities in transitive dependencies within the project.

## Threat: [Malicious Image/Asset Loading Leading to XSS/RCE](./threats/malicious_imageasset_loading_leading_to_xssrce.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker uploads or provides a link to a maliciously crafted image or other asset (e.g., texture, sprite sheet) that is loaded and processed by PixiJS. This crafted asset is designed to exploit vulnerabilities in image decoding or processing libraries used by the browser when PixiJS loads and renders it. This exploitation can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if, for example, malicious code is embedded in image metadata and then processed and displayed by the application, or in more severe cases, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if browser-level image processing vulnerabilities are triggered.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or further malicious actions. In extreme cases, Remote Code Execution (RCE) could allow attackers to gain control over the user's system (though RCE via image processing in browsers is less common but theoretically possible).
*   **PixiJS Component Affected:** `PIXI.Loader`, `PIXI.Texture`, `PIXI.Sprite` (and related asset loading and rendering components are the entry points for processing the malicious assets).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential for XSS and, in less likely but severe scenarios, RCE).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement robust validation of file types and sizes for all uploaded assets. Sanitize filenames and asset paths rigorously.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Enforce a strict Content Security Policy to limit the origins from which assets can be loaded, significantly reducing the risk of loading malicious external assets.
    *   **Secure Asset Hosting and Serving:** Store uploaded assets in a secure manner and serve them from a separate, isolated domain or with restrictive security headers to prevent XSS.
    *   **Server-Side Image Processing and Validation:** Employ secure and actively maintained server-side image processing libraries to thoroughly validate, sanitize, and potentially re-encode images before they are used by PixiJS in the client-side application. This adds a crucial layer of defense against malicious image payloads.
