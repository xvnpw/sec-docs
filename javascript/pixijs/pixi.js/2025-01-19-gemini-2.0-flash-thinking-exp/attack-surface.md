# Attack Surface Analysis for pixijs/pixi.js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Image Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_image_loading.md)

- **Attack Surface: Malicious Image Loading**
    - **Description:** Loading and processing specially crafted image files can exploit vulnerabilities in the browser's image decoding libraries.
    - **How PixiJS Contributes:** PixiJS uses the browser's built-in mechanisms to load and decode images for textures. If a malicious image is loaded via PixiJS (e.g., using `PIXI.Texture.fromURL`), the underlying browser vulnerability can be triggered.
    - **Example:** An attacker provides a link to a specially crafted PNG file that, when loaded by PixiJS, causes a buffer overflow in the browser's PNG decoding library, potentially leading to a crash or even remote code execution.
    - **Impact:** Denial of Service (browser crash), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the client machine.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which images can be loaded, limiting exposure to untrusted sources.
        - **Input Validation:** If possible, perform server-side validation on image files before allowing them to be loaded by the client-side application.
        - **Regularly Update Browsers:** Encourage users to keep their browsers updated to patch known vulnerabilities in image decoding libraries.
        - **Consider Server-Side Rendering/Processing:** For sensitive applications, consider processing images server-side before displaying them with PixiJS.

## Attack Surface: [Untrusted Texture Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/untrusted_texture_data_injection.md)

- **Attack Surface: Untrusted Texture Data Injection**
    - **Description:** Providing malicious or unexpected data when creating textures directly (e.g., using `PIXI.Texture.fromBuffer` or `PIXI.BaseTexture`).
    - **How PixiJS Contributes:** PixiJS allows creating textures from raw buffer data. If this data originates from an untrusted source and is not validated, it could be crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in PixiJS's texture handling or the underlying WebGL implementation.
    - **Example:** An attacker provides a `Uint8Array` with carefully crafted data that, when used to create a PixiJS texture, triggers a buffer overflow in the WebGL driver or PixiJS's internal texture management.
    - **Impact:** Denial of Service (browser crash), potential for unexpected behavior or memory corruption.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any raw data used to create PixiJS textures. Ensure data conforms to expected formats and sizes.
        - **Limit Data Sources:** Restrict the sources from which raw texture data can originate.
        - **Use Higher-Level Abstractions:** Prefer using image URLs or pre-processed image data over directly manipulating raw buffers when possible.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Known PixiJS Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_known_pixijs_vulnerabilities.md)

- **Attack Surface: Exploiting Known PixiJS Vulnerabilities**
    - **Description:**  Utilizing publicly known security vulnerabilities within the PixiJS library itself.
    - **How PixiJS Contributes:**  Like any software library, PixiJS might have undiscovered or publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. Using an outdated version of PixiJS exposes the application to these risks.
    - **Example:** A known vulnerability in a specific version of PixiJS allows an attacker to craft a specific sequence of API calls that leads to arbitrary code execution within the browser.
    - **Impact:**  Potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service, data manipulation depending on the specific vulnerability.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Keep PixiJS Updated:** Regularly update PixiJS to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        - **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for PixiJS to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
        - **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan your project's dependencies (including PixiJS) for known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Shader Code Injection (if used)](./attack_surfaces/custom_shader_code_injection__if_used_.md)

- **Attack Surface: Custom Shader Code Injection (if used)**
    - **Description:**  Injecting malicious code into custom shaders used with PixiJS.
    - **How PixiJS Contributes:** PixiJS allows developers to use custom shaders for advanced rendering effects. If the application allows users to provide or influence shader code, this introduces a significant risk.
    - **Example:** An attacker injects malicious GLSL code into a custom shader that, when executed by the GPU, allows them to read sensitive data from the graphics buffer or cause the GPU to perform unintended operations.
    - **Impact:**  Potentially Remote Code Execution (within the WebGL context), information disclosure, Denial of Service (GPU crash).
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - **Avoid User-Provided Shader Code:**  Ideally, do not allow users to directly provide or influence shader code.
        - **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** If user input influences shader parameters, rigorously validate and sanitize this input to prevent the injection of malicious code snippets.
        - **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review all custom shader code for potential security vulnerabilities.
