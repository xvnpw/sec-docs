# Threat Model Analysis for pixijs/pixi.js

## Threat: [Malicious Event Handlers via User-Provided Data](./threats/malicious_event_handlers_via_user-provided_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into event handlers if the application allows users to define or influence these handlers for PixiJS interactive objects. This could be done by manipulating input fields, configuration files, or other data sources that the application uses to set up event listeners. Upon triggering the event (e.g., a click or mouseover), the injected script would execute within the user's browser.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the application, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected PixiJS Component:** `InteractionManager` (specifically the event handling mechanisms for interactive display objects).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided data before using it to define or influence event handlers.
*   Avoid allowing users to directly define JavaScript functions as event handlers.
*   If custom logic is needed, use a secure, sandboxed environment or a predefined set of safe actions.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Loading Malicious Assets via User-Controlled URLs](./threats/loading_malicious_assets_via_user-controlled_urls.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to provide URLs for assets (images, fonts, etc.) that PixiJS loads, an attacker could supply URLs pointing to malicious content. This could include SVG images containing embedded JavaScript (leading to XSS), extremely large files causing resource exhaustion, or files designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the browser's rendering engine.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), denial of service due to resource exhaustion, or potential exploitation of browser vulnerabilities.

**Affected PixiJS Component:** `Loader` (specifically the resource loading functionality).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided URLs.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which assets can be loaded.
*   Consider using a proxy or CDN to serve assets from a trusted domain.
*   Verify the integrity of loaded assets using techniques like Subresource Integrity (SRI).

## Threat: [Shader Injection (if custom shaders are used)](./threats/shader_injection__if_custom_shaders_are_used_.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to provide or influence custom shaders used by PixiJS (e.g., through filters or custom effects), a malicious user could inject code into the shader that performs unintended actions. This could include computationally intensive operations leading to denial of service, or attempts to access or manipulate data outside the intended scope.

**Impact:** Denial of service due to GPU overload, potential information disclosure or visual manipulation.

**Affected PixiJS Component:** `Shader` and related modules for custom rendering effects.

**Risk Severity:** High (if direct shader code injection is possible).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly sanitize and validate any user-provided shader code.
*   Consider using a restricted or pre-defined set of shader parameters instead of allowing arbitrary code.
*   Implement robust error handling for shader compilation and execution.
