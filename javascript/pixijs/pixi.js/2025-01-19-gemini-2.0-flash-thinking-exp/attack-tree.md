## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in PixiJS Library -> Trigger Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via PixiJS](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_pixijs_library_-_trigger_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_pixijs.md)

**Inject Malicious Data into PixiJS Rendered Content [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   This involves an attacker providing malicious data that is intended to be rendered by PixiJS. This data could be in various forms:
    *   Malicious Text Content: Injecting script tags or event handlers within text that the application intends to display using PixiJS's text rendering capabilities.
    *   Malicious Image/Texture Data: Providing image files, such as SVG images, that contain embedded JavaScript code. When PixiJS renders this image, the embedded script can execute within the application's context.
    *   Malicious Shader Code: In scenarios where the application uses custom shaders and allows user input to influence shader code (a less common but potentially severe vulnerability), an attacker could inject malicious code that executes on the GPU.

**PixiJS Renders the Malicious Data Without Proper Sanitization [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   This critical node highlights the core vulnerability enabling XSS. If the application fails to sanitize or encode user-provided data before passing it to PixiJS for rendering, the malicious data injected in the previous step will be interpreted as code by the browser. PixiJS, as a rendering engine, primarily focuses on displaying content and does not inherently provide comprehensive sanitization for all possible input types. The responsibility for sanitization lies with the application developer.

**Exploit the plugin's vulnerability (e.g., insecure data handling, XSS) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   PixiJS utilizes a plugin system to extend its functionality. If the application uses third-party or custom plugins that contain security vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit these weaknesses. Common vulnerabilities in plugins include:
    *   Insecure Data Handling: Plugins might process user input or external data without proper validation or sanitization, leading to vulnerabilities like XSS or injection attacks.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):  A plugin might render user-controlled data without proper encoding, allowing an attacker to inject and execute malicious scripts.
    *   Authentication or Authorization Flaws: Plugins might have weaknesses in how they authenticate users or authorize access to certain functionalities, allowing unauthorized actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in PixiJS Library -> Exploit Resource Loading Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_pixijs_library_-_exploit_resource_loading_vulnerabilities.md)

**Manipulate Resource Paths or URLs used by PixiJS [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   This attack vector involves an attacker influencing the paths or URLs from which PixiJS loads resources (like images, textures, or fonts). This can be achieved if the application dynamically constructs resource URLs based on user input or external data without proper validation.
    *   Inject Malicious URLs for Images/Textures: An attacker could manipulate the URL to point to a malicious image hosted on an attacker-controlled server. If this image is an SVG containing embedded scripts, it can lead to code execution within the application's context.
    *   Inject Malicious URLs for Fonts: While less common for direct code execution, manipulating font URLs could potentially lead to browser crashes or be used for social engineering attacks.

**PixiJS Loads Resources from Untrusted Sources [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   This critical node highlights a configuration or implementation flaw where the application allows PixiJS to load resources from sources that are not trusted or are controlled by an attacker. This could happen if:
    *   The application doesn't implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the origins from which resources can be loaded.
    *   The application dynamically loads resources based on user-provided URLs without proper validation.
    *   There are misconfigurations in the server or application settings that allow loading resources from arbitrary origins. If PixiJS loads a malicious resource (like an SVG with scripts) from an untrusted source, it can compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Application Logic Leveraging PixiJS Functionality -> Exploit Insecure Handling of User-Generated Content Rendered by PixiJS](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_application_logic_leveraging_pixijs_functionality_-_exploit_insecure_handling_of_user-generate_144fdacd.md)

**User Uploads Malicious Assets (e.g., images with embedded scripts) [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   If the application allows users to upload content, such as avatars, custom textures, or other assets that are later rendered by PixiJS, an attacker can upload malicious files. A common example is uploading an SVG image that contains embedded JavaScript code.

**Application Renders These Assets Without Proper Sanitization [CRITICAL NODE]:**
*   This critical node emphasizes the failure of the application to sanitize user-uploaded content before rendering it with PixiJS. If the application directly uses the uploaded asset without any form of validation or sanitization, malicious content like embedded scripts in an SVG will be executed by the browser when PixiJS renders the asset. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other security issues.
