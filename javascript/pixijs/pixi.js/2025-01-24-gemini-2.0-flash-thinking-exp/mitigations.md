# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for pixijs/pixi.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization for User-Provided Text Content](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_for_user-provided_text_content.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify User Input Points:** Locate all areas where user-provided text is used as input for Pixi.js text rendering (e.g., chat messages, user names displayed in-game).
2.  **Choose a Sanitization Library:** Select an HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify for client-side) to remove or encode potentially harmful HTML tags and JavaScript code.
3.  **Implement Sanitization Function:** Create a function that sanitizes user text using the chosen library, removing elements like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, and event handlers.
4.  **Apply Sanitization Before Pixi.js Rendering:** Before passing user text to Pixi.js's `Text` object or text rendering functions, apply the sanitization function.
5.  **Regularly Update Sanitization Library:** Keep the sanitization library updated to protect against new XSS vectors.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Prevents injection of malicious scripts through user-provided text rendered by Pixi.js, protecting against account hijacking and data theft.

**Impact:** Significantly reduces XSS risk from text rendered by Pixi.js.

**Currently Implemented:** No (Assume initially not implemented for demonstration purposes, replace with actual status).

**Missing Implementation:** Missing in areas where user-provided text is rendered using Pixi.js, such as chat displays and user profile names in the game UI.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validation of Image and Asset URLs](./mitigation_strategies/validation_of_image_and_asset_urls.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Asset Loading Points:** Find all code locations where Pixi.js loads images, spritesheets, or other assets, especially if URLs are from user input or external sources.
2.  **Implement URL Validation Function:** Create a function to validate URLs before Pixi.js uses them for asset loading. This function should:
    *   **Check URL Format:** Verify the URL is a valid URL format.
    *   **Domain Allow-listing:** Compare the URL's domain against a list of trusted domains. Only allow loading from allowed domains.
    *   **Protocol Restriction:** Restrict protocols to `https://` for secure connections.
3.  **Apply Validation Before Asset Loading:** Before using any URL to load assets in Pixi.js (e.g., `PIXI.Sprite.from`, `PIXI.Loader.add`), pass it through the validation function.
4.  **Handle Invalid URLs:** If validation fails, prevent Pixi.js from loading the asset and log an error or use a placeholder.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - High Severity:** Prevents attackers from manipulating URLs to make the server request internal resources or external resources on their behalf via Pixi.js asset loading.
*   **Malicious Content Loading - Medium Severity:** Reduces the risk of Pixi.js loading images or assets from untrusted sources that could contain malicious code or inappropriate content.

**Impact:** Significantly reduces SSRF risk and the risk of loading malicious content through Pixi.js.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Domain allow-listing is used for user profile images, but not for all dynamically loaded game assets.

**Missing Implementation:** Missing for dynamically loaded game assets, level backgrounds, and assets loaded from game configuration files or external data sources. Needs implementation in the game asset loading module.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validation and Limiting User-Controlled Data in Graphics](./mitigation_strategies/validation_and_limiting_user-controlled_data_in_graphics.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify User-Controlled Graphics Parameters:** Determine which Pixi.js graphical properties users can control (e.g., object positions, sizes, colors, animation speeds).
2.  **Define Validation Rules and Limits:** For each parameter, define validation rules and acceptable ranges (e.g., numeric ranges, data type validation, complexity limits for objects/effects).
3.  **Implement Validation Logic:** Write code to validate user inputs against rules and limits *before* applying them to Pixi.js objects.
4.  **Handle Invalid Input:** If input is invalid, reject it, log an error, and prevent Pixi.js rendering with invalid data.
5.  **Regularly Review Limits:** Periodically review and adjust validation rules and limits as the application evolves.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium to High Severity:** Prevents attackers from sending crafted inputs that cause excessive resource consumption by Pixi.js rendering, leading to application slowdown or crashes.
*   **Unexpected Behavior/Errors - Low to Medium Severity:** Prevents invalid inputs from causing visual glitches, rendering errors, or application instability in Pixi.js rendering.

**Impact:** Moderately reduces DoS risk and prevents unexpected behavior from invalid user inputs in Pixi.js graphics.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic range checks exist for player movement, but no validation for particle effects or complex graphical manipulations.

**Missing Implementation:** Missing validation and limits for user-controlled particle effects, custom shape drawing, and advanced graphical features users can influence. Needs implementation in game logic and UI input handling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration - `img-src` and `media-src` Directives](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__configuration_-__img-src__and__media-src__directives.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Configure CSP Header:** Ensure your server sends the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header.
2.  **Define Allow-lists for `img-src` and `media-src`:** In the CSP header, configure `img-src` and `media-src` directives to control sources for Pixi.js images and media:
    *   **Use `'self'`:** Allow loading from your own domain.
    *   **Allow Trusted Domains:** Add specific trusted domains for assets (e.g., CDN, asset server). Be restrictive.
    *   **Consider `data:` (Use with Caution):** If using data URLs for images, include `data:` in `img-src` cautiously.
    *   **Restrict Wildcards:** Avoid wildcards (`*`) unless necessary.
3.  **Test CSP Implementation:** Test CSP to ensure legitimate images/media load and untrusted sources are blocked. Monitor browser console for CSP violations.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Malicious Content Loading - Medium Severity:** Prevents Pixi.js from loading images/media from untrusted domains, reducing the risk of malicious or inappropriate content.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Indirect) - Low Severity:** Can indirectly help prevent data exfiltration attempts relying on loading images from attacker-controlled servers.

**Impact:** Moderately reduces malicious content loading risk and provides some defense-in-depth.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. `img-src` and `media-src` include `'self'`, but no specific allow-list for external trusted domains yet.

**Missing Implementation:** Needs a specific allow-list for trusted CDN or asset server domains in `img-src` and `media-src`. Identify legitimate external asset sources and add them to CSP.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Pixi.js Updates](./mitigation_strategies/regular_pixi_js_updates.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Monitor Pixi.js Releases:** Subscribe to Pixi.js release announcements for new versions and security updates.
2.  **Check for Vulnerability Disclosures:** Regularly check security advisories for reported Pixi.js vulnerabilities.
3.  **Update Pixi.js Dependency:** When a new stable version is released, especially with security fixes, update your project's Pixi.js dependency using your package manager.
4.  **Test After Update:** Thoroughly test your application after updating Pixi.js to ensure no regressions or broken functionality.
5.  **Automate Dependency Updates (Optional):** Consider automated dependency update tools.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Exploitation of Known Pixi.js Vulnerabilities - High Severity:** Prevents exploitation of known security vulnerabilities in outdated Pixi.js versions.

**Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known Pixi.js vulnerabilities.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Pixi.js is updated periodically, but not on a strict schedule or immediately after security releases.

**Missing Implementation:** Needs a proactive and regular schedule for checking and applying Pixi.js updates, especially security updates. Consider automating dependency update checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Resource Limits for Pixi.js Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/implement_resource_limits_for_pixi_js_rendering.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Resource-Intensive Pixi.js Features:** Determine which Pixi.js features are most resource-intensive (e.g., many sprites, complex filters, particle effects).
2.  **Set Limits on Resource Usage:** Implement limits to control resource consumption:
    *   **Object Limits:** Limit the number of sprites, text, graphics objects.
    *   **Texture Size Limits:** Restrict maximum texture sizes.
    *   **Particle Effect Limits:** Limit particle counts or system complexity.
    *   **Filter Limits:** Limit filter count or complexity.
3.  **Implement Limit Enforcement:** Enforce limits in code:
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate user inputs to prevent exceeding limits.
    *   **Dynamic Resource Management:** Adjust resource usage based on performance.
    *   **Object Pooling:** Reuse Pixi.js objects to reduce overhead.
4.  **Monitor Resource Usage:** Monitor client-side resource usage (CPU, GPU, memory) to identify bottlenecks and adjust limits.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium to High Severity:** Prevents attackers from causing excessive resource consumption by Pixi.js rendering, leading to slowdowns or crashes.
*   **Performance Degradation - Medium Severity:** Limits resource usage to maintain performance, especially on lower-end devices.

**Impact:** Moderately reduces DoS risk and improves performance and stability by controlling Pixi.js resource use.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic limits exist for sprite counts in some game elements, but no comprehensive resource limits for all Pixi.js features.

**Missing Implementation:** Needs more comprehensive resource limits for various Pixi.js features, especially particle effects, filters, and complex graphics. Requires analyzing resource usage and setting appropriate limits.
