# Threat Model Analysis for pixijs/pixi.js

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input or manipulates existing content to cause excessive GPU/CPU usage. This could involve:
        *   Creating a huge number of `Sprite` objects.
        *   Using extremely large textures.
        *   Applying complex, computationally expensive custom `Filter` instances.
        *   Triggering frequent and unnecessary re-renders of the entire scene graph.
        *   Exploiting inefficiencies in specific `Renderer` methods.
        *   Abusing particle systems (`pixi/particle-emitter`) with excessive particle counts and lifetimes.

    *   **Impact:** The user's browser becomes unresponsive, potentially crashing the tab or even the entire browser.  The application becomes unusable.  In extreme cases, it could lead to system instability.

    *   **PixiJS Component Affected:**
        *   `Renderer` (and its subclasses like `WebGLRenderer` and `CanvasRenderer`)
        *   `Sprite`
        *   `Texture`
        *   `Filter`
        *   `Container` (and its subclasses, as excessive nesting can impact performance)
        *   `Graphics` (if used to draw extremely complex shapes repeatedly)
        *   `pixi/particle-emitter` (if installed and used)

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit Sprite Count:** Impose a reasonable maximum on the number of sprites that can be displayed simultaneously.
        *   **Texture Size Restrictions:** Validate and limit the dimensions and file size of textures loaded, especially from user-provided sources.
        *   **Filter Complexity Control:**  Restrict the use of custom filters, or carefully review and profile their performance impact.  Limit the number of filters applied to a single object.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on user actions that trigger rendering updates.
        *   **Scene Graph Optimization:**  Use techniques like object pooling, culling (removing objects outside the viewport), and minimizing the depth of the scene graph.
        *   **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor GPU/CPU usage and frame rate.  If thresholds are exceeded, throttle rendering or take other corrective actions.
        *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize any user input that affects rendering parameters.
        *   **Particle System Limits:** If using `pixi/particle-emitter`, strictly limit the number of particles, emission rate, and particle lifetime.

## Threat: [Browser/System Instability via WebGL Exploits](./threats/browsersystem_instability_via_webgl_exploits.md)

*   **Threat:** Browser/System Instability via WebGL Exploits

    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages vulnerabilities in the browser's WebGL implementation (which PixiJS uses) by crafting malicious PixiJS content. This is *not* a PixiJS bug, but PixiJS is the *vector*. The attacker might:
        *   Provide a specially crafted shader (`Filter`) that triggers a known WebGL vulnerability.
        *   Use a combination of PixiJS features in a way that exposes a browser bug.

    *   **Impact:** Browser crash, potential system instability, or in rare cases, arbitrary code execution (though this is more likely to be a browser vulnerability than a PixiJS one).

    *   **PixiJS Component Affected:**
        *   `Renderer` (specifically `WebGLRenderer`)
        *   `Filter` (custom shaders are the most likely vector)
        *   Any component that interacts with WebGL (indirectly, most PixiJS components)

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if a WebGL exploit exists), but the likelihood depends on the browser's vulnerability, not PixiJS itself.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **User Education:** Encourage users to keep their browsers up-to-date.
        *   **Stay Updated with PixiJS:** Use the latest stable version of PixiJS, as it may include workarounds for known browser issues.
        *   **Avoid Experimental WebGL Features:**  Stick to well-tested WebGL features.
        *   **Shader Validation (Difficult):**  Ideally, validate custom shaders, but this is extremely complex.  Consider using a shader linter or restricting shader capabilities.
        *   **Fallback to Canvas:** If WebGL is unavailable or deemed risky, provide a fallback rendering mechanism (e.g., using `CanvasRenderer`).

## Threat: [Visual Spoofing/Manipulation](./threats/visual_spoofingmanipulation.md)

*   **Threat:** Visual Spoofing/Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the visual output of the application, potentially to mislead the user.  This is most relevant if user input influences the rendering. The attacker might:
        *   Inject malicious code that alters the properties of `Sprite`, `Text`, or `Graphics` objects.
        *   Modify texture data to display incorrect images.
        *   Change the position, scale, or rotation of objects to obscure or misrepresent information.

    *   **Impact:** Users are presented with false or misleading information, potentially leading to phishing, data breaches, or other security compromises.  The application's integrity is compromised.

    *   **PixiJS Component Affected:**
        *   `Sprite`
        *   `Text`
        *   `Graphics`
        *   `Texture`
        *   `Container` (and its subclasses, for positioning and visibility manipulation)
        *   Any component whose visual properties can be influenced by user input.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the application's purpose and the sensitivity of the displayed information)

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* user input that affects the visual output.  This includes text, colors, positions, sizes, and any other parameters.
        *   **Data Binding (Careful):** If using data binding to connect user input to PixiJS objects, ensure that the binding mechanism itself is secure and cannot be exploited.
        *   **Output Encoding (Context-Specific):** While not directly applicable to PixiJS rendering, ensure that any text displayed using PixiJS's `Text` object is properly encoded to prevent XSS vulnerabilities *if* that text comes from user input. This is a general web security principle, but relevant here.
        *   **Texture Integrity (If Applicable):** If loading textures from external sources, consider using integrity checks (though this is less common for images than for scripts).
        *   **Separation of Concerns:** Keep the core rendering logic separate from user-controlled data as much as possible.
