# Attack Surface Analysis for pixijs/pixi.js

## Attack Surface: [1. WebGL Context Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/1__webgl_context_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits vulnerabilities in the browser's WebGL implementation or underlying graphics drivers through crafted PixiJS content.
*   **How PixiJS Contributes:** PixiJS is the *direct* interface to WebGL, making it the conduit for triggering these vulnerabilities.  The attacker's code interacts *directly* with PixiJS APIs to reach WebGL.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted shader or texture, loaded *via PixiJS*, triggers a known driver bug, leading to a browser crash or potentially worse.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Information Disclosure, *rarely* Arbitrary Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is common, Code Execution is rare but severe).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Sanitize user-provided data influencing rendering (texture dimensions, shader code). Implement WebGL context loss handling.
    *   **Users:** Keep browsers and graphics drivers updated.

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious Texture/Resource Loading](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_textureresource_loading.md)

*   **Description:** Exploits vulnerabilities in image/video decoding libraries by loading maliciously crafted files *through PixiJS*.
*   **How PixiJS Contributes:** PixiJS *directly* handles the loading and processing of these resources; the attack vector is the PixiJS resource loading mechanism itself.
*   **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted PNG image that exploits a vulnerability in the browser's PNG decoder when PixiJS's `Texture.from()` or loader functions are used to load it.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), *rarely* Arbitrary Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (DoS is common, Code Execution is rare but severe).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Validate image/video dimensions and formats *before* loading via PixiJS. Use a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for resource origins.  *Strongly consider* server-side image/video sanitization and resizing.
    *   **Users:** Keep browsers updated.

## Attack Surface: [3. Custom Shader Injection (If Allowed)](./attack_surfaces/3__custom_shader_injection__if_allowed_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application allows user-provided WebGL shaders (GLSL code), this opens a significant vulnerability *directly* through PixiJS.
*   **How PixiJS Contributes:** PixiJS *directly* compiles and executes these user-provided shaders. This is a core functionality of PixiJS being misused.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a shader containing an infinite loop, freezing the GPU and causing a denial of service.  More sophisticated attacks could attempt to exploit driver vulnerabilities, all triggered through PixiJS's shader handling.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Information Disclosure, *rarely* Arbitrary Code Execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if user-provided shaders are allowed).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** *Avoid allowing user-provided shaders if at all possible.* If unavoidable, implement *extremely* strict validation, sandboxing (Web Workers), time limits, and potentially server-side compilation/validation. Use a GLSL validator.
