Business priorities:

- Maintain high performance and efficiency: PixiJS's core value proposition is speed. Any design changes must prioritize performance.
- Broad browser compatibility: Support a wide range of browsers and devices, including older ones, to maximize reach.
- Ease of use and developer experience: Provide a clean, well-documented API that is easy to learn and use.
- Extensibility and modularity: Allow developers to extend and customize the library to meet their specific needs.
- Community engagement and support: Foster a vibrant community and provide adequate support to users.
- Open Source Sustainability: Ensure the long-term viability of the project through contributions, sponsorships, and a healthy community.

Business risks:

- Performance regressions: Changes to the codebase could inadvertently introduce performance bottlenecks, impacting existing users.
- Compatibility issues: New features or changes might break compatibility with certain browsers or devices.
- API instability: Frequent or breaking changes to the API could frustrate developers and hinder adoption.
- Security vulnerabilities: As a library that executes code in the browser, security vulnerabilities could expose users to attacks.
- Lack of maintainers or contributors: The project's long-term health depends on a consistent stream of contributions and active maintenance.
- Competition: Other libraries or frameworks could emerge and challenge PixiJS's dominance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: Input validation: PixiJS partially validates user-provided data, such as texture sources and dimensions, to prevent common errors. Implemented in various modules, such as `Texture` and `Sprite`.
- security control: Code style and reviews: The project uses ESLint and has a code review process to maintain code quality and identify potential issues. Described in contributing guidelines.
- security control: Dependency management: The project uses package managers (like npm) to manage dependencies and keep them updated. Described in `package.json`.
- security control: Regular updates: The project is actively maintained, and updates are released regularly to address bugs and security vulnerabilities.

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): While PixiJS itself doesn't directly handle user input in a way that would typically lead to XSS, it's possible for developers to misuse the library and create XSS vulnerabilities in their applications. This is a common risk with any JavaScript library.
- accepted risk: Denial of Service (DoS): Maliciously crafted content or excessive resource usage could potentially lead to performance degradation or crashes in the browser.
- accepted risk: Third-party dependencies: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies could potentially impact PixiJS.

Recommended security controls:

- security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) integration guidelines: Provide clear guidelines for developers on how to integrate PixiJS with a strong CSP to mitigate XSS risks.
- security control: WebGL context loss handling: Implement robust handling of WebGL context loss events to prevent crashes and improve stability.
- security control: Input sanitization recommendations: Offer specific recommendations for sanitizing user-provided data that is used to create PixiJS objects.
- security control: Security audits: Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase to identify potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Supply Chain Security: Implement SLSA framework to ensure integrity of build and deployment process.

Security requirements:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to PixiJS, as it's a client-side rendering library. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using PixiJS.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable. Authorization is the responsibility of the application using PixiJS.
- Input validation: All user-provided data, such as texture sources, dimensions, and shader parameters, should be validated to prevent errors and potential security vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable, unless PixiJS is used to handle encrypted assets, in which case standard web cryptography practices should be followed.

## DEPLOYMENT

PixiJS, being a JavaScript library, is typically deployed as part of a web application. There are several deployment options:

1.  **Traditional Web Server:** Deploying the HTML, CSS, JavaScript (including PixiJS), and asset files to a web server like Apache, Nginx, or IIS.
2.  **Cloud Storage and CDN:** Using services like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Azure Blob Storage to host the static files and a CDN (Content Delivery Network) like Cloudflare, Akamai, or AWS CloudFront to distribute the content globally.
3.  **Serverless Platforms:** Deploying the application using serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions) and a static site hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel).
4.  **Bundled with Application:** In case PixiJS is used to build desktop application, using Electron or similar framework, PixiJS will be bundled with application.

We'll describe the **Cloud Storage and CDN** approach in detail, as it's a common and efficient deployment method for web applications.

## BUILD

PixiJS uses a build process to create optimized, minified versions of the library for distribution. The build process typically involves:

1.  **Source Code:** Developers write code in modern JavaScript (ES modules).
2.  **Transpilation:** Babel is used to transpile the code to older JavaScript versions for broader browser compatibility.
3.  **Bundling:** Rollup is used to bundle the modules into a single file (or multiple files for different formats like UMD, ESM).
4.  **Minification:** Terser is used to minify the bundled code, reducing file size.
5.  **Linting:** ESLint is used to enforce code style and identify potential errors.
6.  **Testing:** Jest is used for unit testing.
7.  **Documentation Generation:** Typedoc is used to generate API documentation from the source code.
8.  **Publishing:** The built files and documentation are published to npm and CDN.
