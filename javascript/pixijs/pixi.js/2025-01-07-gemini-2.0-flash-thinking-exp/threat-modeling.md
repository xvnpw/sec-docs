# Threat Model Analysis for pixijs/pixi.js

## Threat: [Exploiting Known PixiJS Vulnerabilities](./threats/exploiting_known_pixijs_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker could identify a publicly disclosed security vulnerability in the specific version of PixiJS being used by the application. They might then craft malicious input or interactions that trigger this vulnerability, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or unauthorized actions. This could involve sending specially crafted data that exploits a parsing error or a flaw in a specific PixiJS function.

**Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, the impact could range from denial of service (crashing the client's browser), to cross-site scripting (injecting malicious scripts into the page), or potentially even remote code execution in certain browser environments (though less likely directly through PixiJS).

**Affected PixiJS Component:**  This could affect any module or function within PixiJS, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Common areas might include the core rendering loop, event handling, or asset loading.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the nature and exploitability of the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update PixiJS to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories and changelogs for PixiJS releases.
*   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies.

## Threat: [Malicious Image/Asset Loading Exploits](./threats/malicious_imageasset_loading_exploits.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide a specially crafted image or other asset (e.g., a font file) that exploits a vulnerability in PixiJS's asset loading or processing mechanisms. This could involve embedding malicious code within the asset or crafting it in a way that triggers a buffer overflow or other memory corruption issue when processed by PixiJS or the browser's underlying image decoding libraries. The attacker might trick a user into loading this malicious asset through the application.

**Impact:** Could lead to denial of service (crashing the browser tab), or potentially, in more severe cases, arbitrary code execution if the vulnerability is exploitable enough.

**Affected PixiJS Component:**  `PIXI.Loader` (or the older `PIXI.loaders.Loader`), `PIXI.Texture`, and potentially the underlying browser's image decoding capabilities.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the exploitability and potential impact).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only load assets from trusted sources.
*   Implement server-side validation of uploaded assets before they are used by PixiJS.
*   Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which assets can be loaded.
*   Consider using libraries that perform additional security checks on loaded assets.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized User Input in Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_user_input_in_rendering.md)

**Description:** If the application uses PixiJS to render user-provided text or data without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into this data. When PixiJS renders this unsanitized data (e.g., using `PIXI.Text` or `PIXI.BitmapText`), the injected script could be executed in the user's browser within the context of the application's origin. The attacker might achieve this by manipulating input fields or other data sources that feed into the PixiJS rendering process.

**Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting users to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected PixiJS Component:** `PIXI.Text`, `PIXI.BitmapText`, and any other component that renders user-controlled strings or data.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize any user-provided data before passing it to PixiJS text rendering functions. Use appropriate escaping or sanitization techniques to remove or neutralize potentially malicious HTML or JavaScript.
*   Avoid directly embedding unsanitized HTML within PixiJS text objects.
*   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of any successful XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Exploiting Web Worker Vulnerabilities (if used with PixiJS)](./threats/exploiting_web_worker_vulnerabilities__if_used_with_pixijs_.md)

**Description:** If the application utilizes Web Workers in conjunction with PixiJS for offloading tasks, vulnerabilities in the communication between the main thread and the workers, or within the worker code itself, could be exploited. An attacker might try to intercept or manipulate messages passed between threads or inject malicious code into the worker context.

**Impact:** Could potentially lead to the execution of arbitrary code within the worker context or the manipulation of data processed by the workers.

**Affected PixiJS Component:**  Any parts of the application's code that interact with Web Workers and potentially PixiJS components used within the worker.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the capabilities and security of the worker code).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully sanitize any data passed to and from Web Workers.
*   Ensure worker code is secure and follows best practices.
*   Limit the capabilities of Web Workers if possible.
*   Use secure communication channels between the main thread and workers.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party PixiJS Extensions](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_pixijs_extensions.md)

**Description:** Applications often extend PixiJS functionality using community-developed plugins or extensions. These third-party components might contain security vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers. The attacker would target vulnerabilities within these extensions to compromise the application.

**Impact:**  Similar to exploiting core PixiJS vulnerabilities, this could lead to XSS, arbitrary code execution, or other security issues depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the extension.

**Affected PixiJS Component:**  The specific third-party extension being used.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the popularity and security of the extension).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet any third-party PixiJS extensions before using them.
*   Keep extensions updated to their latest versions.
*   Monitor for security advisories related to the extensions being used.
*   Consider the reputation and trustworthiness of the extension developers.
