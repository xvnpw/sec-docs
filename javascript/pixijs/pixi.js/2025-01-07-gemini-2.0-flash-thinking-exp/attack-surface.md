# Attack Surface Analysis for pixijs/pixi.js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading (Images, Textures, Fonts)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading__images__textures__fonts_.md)

*   **Description:** Loading and processing untrusted image, texture, or font files can exploit vulnerabilities within PixiJS's asset handling or in the underlying browser rendering engine when PixiJS utilizes these assets.
    *   **How PixiJS Contributes:** PixiJS provides core functionalities for loading and utilizing various asset types (images, textures via `PIXI.Texture.from()`, bitmap fonts via `PIXI.BitmapFont.from()`). If these APIs are used to load assets from untrusted sources, it directly introduces this attack surface.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted image file. When `PIXI.Texture.from()` is used to load this image, it triggers a vulnerability in PixiJS's texture processing logic, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Browser crash, memory corruption, potential for remote code execution in older or vulnerable browsers due to flaws in PixiJS's handling of specific asset formats.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate the source and format of all loaded assets *before* passing them to PixiJS loading functions. Restrict allowed file types and sources.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which assets can be loaded, limiting the potential for PixiJS to load malicious external assets.
        *   **Regularly Update PixiJS:** Keep PixiJS updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities in its asset handling code.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Chain Vulnerabilities within PixiJS](./attack_surfaces/dependency_chain_vulnerabilities_within_pixijs.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities directly within the PixiJS library itself can be exploited.
    *   **How PixiJS Contributes:** As the core library being used, any security flaw within PixiJS's code directly creates an attack surface for applications utilizing it.
    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in PixiJS's WebGL renderer that allows for arbitrary code execution. Applications using the vulnerable version of PixiJS are directly at risk.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts, including remote code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability within PixiJS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can be Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly Update PixiJS:**  Immediately update to the latest version of PixiJS when security patches are released.
        *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories specifically related to PixiJS.
        *   **Consider Beta/Nightly Builds (with caution):** For early detection, consider testing with beta or nightly builds in non-production environments to identify potential issues early, but be aware of the inherent instability.

## Attack Surface: [Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Text Rendering (Context Dependent)](./attack_surfaces/potential_for_cross-site_scripting__xss__through_text_rendering__context_dependent_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application renders user-provided text directly using PixiJS without proper sanitization, and this rendered output is used in a context where it could be interpreted as HTML or JavaScript, it could lead to XSS. This risk is present due to PixiJS's text rendering capabilities.
    *   **How PixiJS Contributes:** PixiJS provides functions like `PIXI.Text` for rendering text. If unsanitized user input is directly passed to these functions, and the application subsequently handles this rendered output in a way that exposes it to HTML or script execution, PixiJS contributes to the attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `PIXI.Text` to render user-submitted comments on a canvas. A malicious user submits a comment containing JavaScript code. If the application later uses the rendered canvas output in a way that allows script execution (though less common with canvas compared to DOM), XSS could occur.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting attacks, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize any user-provided text *before* rendering it with PixiJS to remove or escape potentially malicious characters or scripts.
        *   **Context-Aware Encoding:** Ensure that if the rendered text (or the canvas containing it) is used in other contexts (e.g., within the DOM), it is properly encoded to prevent script execution.
        *   **Strict CSP:** A strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of XSS even if it occurs.
