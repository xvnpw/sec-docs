## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Asset Loading Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_asset_loading_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Deliver Malicious Asset (Image, JSON, etc.):** An attacker successfully provides a file intended for use by PixiJS that contains malicious content or is crafted to exploit a vulnerability. This could occur through:
    *   User uploads if the application allows users to upload assets.
    *   Loading assets from external, untrusted URLs.
    *   Data injection where asset data is constructed based on user input.
*   **PixiJS Processes Malicious Asset:** PixiJS attempts to load and interpret the delivered asset. This step opens the door for exploitation.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Asset Content (CRITICAL NODE):**  If PixiJS doesn't properly sanitize or escape the content of the loaded asset (e.g., within an SVG or JSON file), an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the user's browser.
        *   **Inject Malicious Script within Asset (e.g., SVG, JSON):** The attacker crafts the asset file to include `<script>` tags or other JavaScript execution vectors that PixiJS renders or interprets.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Asset Processing Bug (Less Likely, but possible in complex libraries) (CRITICAL NODE):** A vulnerability exists within PixiJS's code that handles the parsing or decoding of the asset format (e.g., image decoding). By providing a specially crafted, malicious asset, the attacker can trigger this vulnerability, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
        *   **Exploit a vulnerability in PixiJS's asset parsing or decoding logic:** This requires a specific, likely undiscovered, flaw in how PixiJS handles asset formats.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: WebGL Context Manipulation for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_webgl_context_manipulation_for_malicious_purposes.md)

*   **Inject Malicious Commands into WebGL Context:** If the application (unlikely in typical usage) allows for direct manipulation of the WebGL context used by PixiJS, an attacker could inject malicious commands. This could potentially lead to:
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Reading data from the rendering context that should not be accessible.
    *   **Client-Side RCE:** In highly specific scenarios, manipulating the WebGL context could potentially be leveraged for code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in PixiJS Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_pixijs_dependencies.md)

*   **PixiJS Relies on Vulnerable Dependency:** PixiJS uses other JavaScript libraries as dependencies. If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, they can be a point of attack.
*   **Vulnerability is Exploitable within PixiJS Context:** The vulnerability in the dependency can be triggered or exploited through PixiJS's usage of that dependency.
    *   **Dependency with Known Security Flaws (CRITICAL NODE):**  A publicly known vulnerability exists in one of PixiJS's direct dependencies. Attackers can identify these vulnerabilities (using tools or databases) and craft exploits that leverage PixiJS's interaction with the vulnerable dependency to compromise the application.
        *   **Leverage Publicly Known Vulnerabilities in PixiJS's Dependencies:**  Attackers use existing exploits or develop new ones based on the publicly available information about the dependency vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via PixiJS](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via_pixijs.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within PixiJS to compromise the application.
