### Key Attack Surface List: Markdown Here (High & Critical)

This list details key attack surfaces *directly* introduced by the Markdown Here extension, focusing on high and critical severity risks.

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown/HTML Injection:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the rendered HTML output by crafting specific Markdown input that bypasses sanitization or is interpreted as executable code.
    *   **How Markdown Here Contributes:** The extension's core function is to convert Markdown to HTML. If the conversion process doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-provided content, especially HTML tags embedded within the Markdown, it can introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A user pastes Markdown containing: `` `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` ``. If not properly sanitized, this could execute JavaScript when the email/page is viewed.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser or email client, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions performed on the user's behalf.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust HTML sanitization of the generated HTML output, ensuring that user-controlled data from the Markdown is properly escaped before being rendered. Utilize well-vetted sanitization libraries.
        *   **Developers:**  Enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for the extension's context to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed.

*   **Insecure Protocol Handling in Links:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can craft Markdown links using dangerous protocols (e.g., `javascript:`, `vbscript:`) that, when rendered and clicked, execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How Markdown Here Contributes:** The extension processes and renders URLs from Markdown. If it doesn't properly validate or sanitize the protocol part of the URL, it can allow execution of non-HTTP/HTTPS protocols.
    *   **Example:** Markdown containing `` `[Click Me](javascript:alert('Executed!'))` ``. Clicking this link in a vulnerable email client or browser could execute the JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the context of the email client or browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Strictly enforce allowed protocols for links (e.g., `http:`, `https:`, `mailto:`). Strip or neutralize any other protocols.
        *   **Developers:**  Consider using a safe link rewriting mechanism that prevents the execution of dangerous protocols.
