### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Markdown Here

This list details high and critical severity security threats that directly originate from the functionality or potential vulnerabilities within the Markdown Here browser extension/library.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts Markdown input containing malicious JavaScript code that is not properly sanitized by Markdown Here during the conversion to HTML. When rendered, this injected script executes in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** HTML Injection for Phishing or UI Redress
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects arbitrary HTML elements through Markdown that, while not necessarily executing JavaScript, can be used to create fake login forms or overlay legitimate UI elements with deceptive content, tricking users.
    *   **Impact:** High. Phishing attacks, credential theft, manipulation of user actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities within the Markdown Here Extension Itself
    *   **Description:**  The Markdown Here extension contains inherent security vulnerabilities (e.g., buffer overflows, logic errors) within its code that could be exploited if an attacker can influence the input or the environment in which the extension operates.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, potentially Critical. Could lead to arbitrary code execution or other severe consequences depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (assuming potential for significant impact)
