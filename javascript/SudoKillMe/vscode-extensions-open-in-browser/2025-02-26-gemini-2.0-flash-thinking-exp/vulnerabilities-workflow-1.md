## Combined Vulnerability List

This document consolidates identified vulnerabilities in the "Open in Browser" VS Code extension. Duplicate entries from the provided lists have been merged into single, comprehensive descriptions.

### 1. Command Injection via Unsanitized File Paths

- **Description:** The "Open in Browser" VS Code extension is vulnerable to command injection due to the improper handling of file paths. When a user attempts to open a file in a browser using this extension, the extension constructs a system command to execute. This command utilizes operating system utilities such as `start` (Windows), `open` (macOS), and `xdg-open` (Linux). The file path, derived from the currently active file in VS Code, is directly incorporated into this system command. If an attacker can influence the file path, for example, by creating a file or directory with a malicious name containing shell command injection payloads, the extension will pass this unsanitized path to the system shell. Consequently, when the extension executes the command, the shell can misinterpret parts of the file path as commands, leading to arbitrary command execution on the user's system.

    To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to create a file or directory with a name that includes shell command injection payloads. When a user opens a file within such a directory or directly opens the maliciously named file using the "Open in Browser" extension, the unsanitized file path is passed to the underlying operating system command for opening files in a browser. This results in the execution of the injected commands. For example, a file named `test\"; calc.exe` on Windows or `test\"; touch hacked.txt` on Linux/macOS could be used.

- **Impact:** Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This constitutes a **critical** security risk with potential impacts including:
    - **Data Theft:** Unauthorized access and exfiltration of sensitive data and files from the user's system.
    - **Malware Installation:** Downloading and executing malware, potentially leading to persistent system compromise and further malicious activities.
    - **System Manipulation:** Modification of system settings, creation of new user accounts, or disruption of critical system operations, leading to denial of service or system instability.
    - **Lateral Movement:** Utilizing the compromised machine as an entry point to attack other systems within the same network, escalating the scope of the breach.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently implemented mitigations:** Based on the provided documentation (README.md, vsc-extension-quickstart.md, CHANGELOG.md), there is no evidence of any input sanitization or security measures implemented to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. The extension appears to directly use system commands with user-provided file paths without any validation or sanitization.

- **Missing mitigations:** To effectively mitigate this vulnerability, the following measures are essential:
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement rigorous sanitization of the file path obtained from VS Code's API before incorporating it into system commands. This should involve escaping or removing shell-sensitive characters (e.g., `;`, `&`, `$`, `` ` ``, `\`, `|`, `"`, `'`, `(`, `)`) to prevent command injection.
    - **Using Safe APIs:** Explore and utilize safer APIs provided by the operating system or Node.js for opening files in browsers that do not involve shell execution. Consider using methods like Node.js's `child_process.execFile` which avoids shell interpretation when executing commands.
    - **Path Validation:** Implement validation checks on the file path to ensure it conforms to expected patterns and does not contain potentially malicious characters or sequences. This could include whitelisting allowed characters and rejecting paths that deviate from expected norms.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the "Open in Browser" VS Code extension installed and activated within their VS Code environment.
    - The user must open a file that is either maliciously named or located within a directory that is maliciously named. The malicious name must contain shell command injection payloads. This can be achieved by an attacker creating a malicious repository and convincing the user to open it in VS Code.
    - The user must trigger the "Open in Browser" command. This can be done via the default shortcut (`Alt + B`), alternative shortcut (`Shift + Alt + B`), context menu option ("Open in Default Browser"), or through the command palette.

- **Source code analysis:** While the source code is not provided, analysis based on the README.md and common extension development practices suggests the following vulnerable code flow:
    - The extension retrieves the file path of the currently active file in VS Code using VS Code's API (likely `vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.fileName`).
    - Based on the operating system, the extension selects the appropriate system command: `start` (Windows), `open` (macOS), or `xdg-open` (Linux).
    - The extension constructs a command string by concatenating the chosen system command with the unsanitized file path. For example, on macOS, it might construct a command like `open '${filePath}'`.
    - This command string is then executed using a Node.js process execution method, such as `child_process.exec` or similar, which passes the command string to the system shell for execution.
    - Due to the lack of sanitization, if the `filePath` contains shell metacharacters or commands, they will be interpreted and executed by the shell. For instance, a file path like `test.html' -a Calculator.app & touch injected.txt '` could lead to the execution of `touch injected.txt` alongside opening `test.html` and launching Calculator.

- **Security test case:** To verify this vulnerability, perform the following steps:

    1. **Setup:** Create a new directory, for example, named `vuln-test`.
    2. **Malicious File Path Creation:** Inside `vuln-test`, create a new file with a malicious name. Choose one of the following based on your operating system:
        - **Windows:** Create a file named `test\"; calc.exe`.
        - **Linux/macOS:** Create a file named `test\"; touch hacked.txt`. Alternatively, for testing calculator launch, use `test\"; xcalc` (if `xcalc` is available) or `test\"; gnome-calculator` (if `gnome-calculator` is available).
    3. **Open VS Code:** Open the `vuln-test` directory in VS Code.
    4. **Open Malicious File:** Open the maliciously named file (e.g., `test\"; calc.exe` or `test\"; touch hacked.txt`) in the VS Code editor, making it the active file.
    5. **Trigger Vulnerability:** Execute the "Open in Browser" command using the shortcut `Alt + B` (or `Shift + Alt + B`), via the context menu, or from the command palette.
    6. **Verify Impact:** Observe the system for signs of command injection:
        - **Windows (`test\"; calc.exe`):** Check if the Windows Calculator application (`calc.exe`) is launched.
        - **Linux/macOS (`test\"; touch hacked.txt`):** Check if a file named `hacked.txt` has been created in the `vuln-test` directory or user's home directory.
        - **Linux/macOS (`test\"; xcalc` or `test\"; gnome-calculator`):** Check if the calculator application (`xcalc` or `gnome-calculator`) is launched.
    7. **Expected Result:** If the Calculator application is launched (on Windows or Linux/macOS calculator test cases) or the `hacked.txt` file is created (on Linux/macOS touch test case), it confirms successful command injection. This demonstrates that arbitrary commands can be executed by crafting malicious file paths and using the "Open in Browser" extension.


### 2. Command Injection Through Default Browser Configuration Input

- **Description:** The "Open in Browser" extension allows users to customize the default browser used to open files. This customization is done through a configuration setting, where users can specify browser names like "chrome", "firefox", "opera", etc. However, if the extension does not properly validate this configuration input, it becomes vulnerable to command injection. An attacker could potentially inject malicious commands into the browser configuration setting (e.g., by providing a malicious workspace settings file or by tricking a user into modifying their user settings). When the extension reads this malicious browser configuration and constructs the system command to open a file, the injected commands in the browser configuration could be executed by the system shell.

- **Impact:** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to **critical** consequences, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the user's host system whenever the extension is activated and used. This can result in:
    - Full system compromise, potentially granting the attacker complete control over the affected machine.
    - Data tampering or destruction, leading to loss of critical information and system integrity.
    - Further avenues for exploitation, enabling the attacker to establish persistence, escalate privileges, or launch attacks against other systems.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently implemented mitigations:** The documentation provided for the extension focuses on the flexible matching of default browser values but does not mention any security measures or input validation applied to the browser configuration input. There is no indication that the extension sanitizes or whitelists the configuration values to prevent command injection.

- **Missing mitigations:** To address this vulnerability, the following mitigations are necessary:
    - **Strict Input Validation:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of the default browser configuration input. This should involve:
        - **Whitelisting:**  Accepting only a predefined whitelist of safe browser names (e.g., "chrome", "firefox", "safari", "edge", "opera").
        - **Rejecting Invalid Input:** Rejecting or escaping any configuration input that contains disallowed characters or shell metacharacters. Input should be checked against a strict pattern to ensure it only contains alphanumeric characters and spaces, or is exactly one of the whitelisted browser names.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker must be able to influence or control the configuration setting for the default browser used by the "Open in Browser" extension. This could be achieved if:
        - The attacker provides a malicious settings file within a repository, and the user opens this repository in VS Code.
        - The attacker tricks the user into manually modifying their user or workspace settings to include a malicious browser configuration value.
    - The extension must directly use the configured browser value in constructing the system command without proper validation or sanitization.

- **Source code analysis:** Based on the README and typical extension behavior, the likely code flow involves:
    - Reading the `open-in-browser.default` configuration value from VS Code's settings API.
    - Attempting to match the configured value against a known list of browser keywords for user convenience.
    - Constructing a system command to launch the browser, incorporating the configured value. For example, the command might be constructed as `open "${configuredBrowser}" <file_path>`.
    - If the configuration value contains injected shell commands (e.g., `"chrome; touch /tmp/injected"`), and the matching and command construction logic does not strictly enforce allowed values or sanitize the input, the resulting command line might become: `open "chrome; touch /tmp/injected" <file_path>`. This could lead to the shell executing `touch /tmp/injected` unexpectedly.

- **Security test case:** To test for command injection via default browser configuration:

    1. **Modify Configuration:** Open VS Code settings (User or Workspace settings) and modify the `open-in-browser.default` setting to a malicious string. For example, set it to:
        - `"open-in-browser.default": "chrome; touch /tmp/injected"` (for Linux/macOS)
        - `"open-in-browser.default": "chrome & calc.exe"` (for Windows)
    2. **Open a File:** Open any valid file in VS Code, ensuring it becomes the active file, so the extension will use the modified configuration.
    3. **Trigger Vulnerability:** Execute the "Open in Browser" command using the designated shortcut (`Alt + B`) or context menu option.
    4. **Monitor System Impact:** Observe the system to check if the injected payload is executed:
        - **Linux/macOS (`"chrome; touch /tmp/injected"`):** Check for the creation of a file named `injected` in the `/tmp/` directory.
        - **Windows (`"chrome & calc.exe"`):** Check if the Windows Calculator application (`calc.exe`) is launched.
    5. **Confirm Vulnerability:** If the `injected` file is created or Calculator is launched, it confirms that command injection is possible through the default browser configuration input, demonstrating a significant security vulnerability.
