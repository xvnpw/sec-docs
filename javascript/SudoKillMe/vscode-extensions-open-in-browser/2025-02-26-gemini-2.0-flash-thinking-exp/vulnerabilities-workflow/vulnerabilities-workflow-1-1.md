### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via File Path
- Description: The "Open in Browser" VS Code extension is potentially vulnerable to command injection. When a user opens a file using the extension, the extension constructs a command to open the file in a browser. Based on the README.md, it uses system commands like `start` (on Windows), `open` (on macOS), and `xdg-open` (on Linux) potentially via the `opn` library mentioned in the "What's new?" section. If the file path, which is derived from the currently opened file in VS Code, is not properly sanitized before being used in these commands, an attacker could craft a malicious file path. When the extension attempts to open a file with this malicious path, it could lead to the execution of arbitrary commands on the user's system due to insufficient input validation.

To trigger this vulnerability, an attacker needs to create a file or directory with a name that includes shell command injection payloads. When a user opens a file within such a directory or directly opens the maliciously named file using the "Open in Browser" extension, the unsanitized file path is passed to the underlying operating system command for opening files in a browser. This can result in the execution of the injected commands.

- Impact: Successful command injection can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This could lead to various malicious outcomes, including but not limited to:
    - Data theft: Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive files and information from the user's system.
    - Malware installation: Downloading and executing malware, potentially leading to persistent compromise.
    - System manipulation: Modifying system settings, creating new user accounts, or disrupting system operations.
    - Lateral movement: Using the compromised machine as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the same network.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: Based on the provided documentation (README.md, vsc-extension-quickstart.md, CHANGELOG.md), there is no mention of input sanitization or any security measures implemented to prevent command injection vulnerabilities. The documentation focuses on features and usage, not security considerations.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Input Sanitization:** The extension must sanitize the file path before passing it to any shell commands or external libraries like `opn`. This should include escaping or removing shell-sensitive characters to prevent command injection.
    - **Using Safe APIs:** Instead of relying on shell commands or libraries that execute shell commands, the extension should consider using safer APIs provided by the operating system or Node.js for opening files in browsers that do not involve shell execution.
    - **Path Validation:** Implement checks to validate the file path and ensure it conforms to expected patterns, reducing the risk of malicious paths being processed.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the "Open in Browser" VS Code extension installed and activated.
    - The user must open a file that is either maliciously named or located within a directory that is maliciously named. The malicious name should contain shell command injection payloads.
    - The user must trigger the "Open in Browser" command, either via the `Alt + B` shortcut, `Shift + Alt + B` shortcut, context menu, or command palette.
- Source code analysis:
    - Unfortunately, the provided files do not include the source code of the extension (`extension.js` is just a template).
    - Based on the README.md description, the extension uses `opn` library, and system commands like `start`, `open`, and `xdg-open`.
    - Assuming the extension directly passes the file path obtained from VS Code's API (likely `vscode.window.activeTextEditor.document.fileName`) to the `opn` library or these system commands without any sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to command injection.
    - If the code constructs commands like `open <filePath>` on macOS, `start <filePath>` on Windows, or `xdg-open <filePath>` on Linux, and the `<filePath>` is not sanitized, then it is vulnerable.
    - For example, on macOS, if the file path is constructed as `open '${filePath}'`, and `filePath` is something like `test.html' -a Calculator.app & touch injected.txt '`, the executed command becomes `open 'test.html' -a Calculator.app & touch injected.txt ''`. This would open `test.html`, launch Calculator, and execute `touch injected.txt`.

- Security test case:
    1. **Setup:** Create a new directory named `vuln-test`.
    2. **Malicious File Path Creation:** Inside `vuln-test`, create another directory named `testfile\` -a Calculator.app \& touch injected.txt \`.  (Note: the backslash `\` is for escaping in markdown, in actual file system, the directory name should be `testfile' -a Calculator.app & touch injected.txt `).
    3. **Open VS Code:** Open the `vuln-test` directory in VS Code.
    4. **Create Test File:** Inside the `testfile\` -a Calculator.app \& touch injected.txt \` directory, create a new empty file named `test.html`.
    5. **Trigger Vulnerability:** Open the `test.html` file in the VS Code editor. Use the shortcut `Alt + B` (or `Shift + Alt + B`, or context menu "Open in Default Browser") to trigger the "Open in Browser" command.
    6. **Verify Impact:** After executing the "Open in Browser" command, check if a file named `injected.txt` has been created in the `vuln-test` directory. Also, check if the Calculator application (or any other unexpected application based on the injected command for your OS) has been launched.
    7. **Expected Result:** If the `injected.txt` file is created and Calculator (or another injected command effect) is observed, it confirms that command injection is successful. This indicates a vulnerability where arbitrary commands can be executed by crafting malicious file paths and using the "Open in Browser" extension.
