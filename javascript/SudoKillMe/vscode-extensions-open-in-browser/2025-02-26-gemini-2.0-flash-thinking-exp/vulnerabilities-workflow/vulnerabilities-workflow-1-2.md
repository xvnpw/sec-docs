- **Vulnerability Name:** Shell Command Injection via Unsanitized File Paths in "Open in Browser" Extension  
  **Description:**  
  - The extension uses system-specific commands (i.e., `start` on Windows, `open` on macOS, and `xdg-open` on Linux) to open the current file.  
  - When a user triggers the command (for example with the `Alt + B` shortcut), the extension retrieves the active file’s path and constructs a system command.  
  - If an attacker manages to influence the file name (for instance, by tricking a user into opening a repository containing a file with a malicious name like `document.txt; rm -rf /`), the unsanitized file path may be injected into the constructed command string.  
  - The system shell can misinterpret parts of the file name as additional commands, leading to arbitrary command execution.  

  **Impact:**  
  - **Critical:** An attacker could execute arbitrary system commands on the victim’s machine. This may result in full system compromise, data loss, or unauthorized control of the host system.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - There is no documentation or evidence in the provided files that the file path is being validated or sanitized before being passed to a system command.

  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Input validation and sanitization of file names before command construction.  
  - Usage of secure APIs such as Node.js’s `child_process.execFile` (which does not run via the shell) instead of methods that build a command string directly.  
  - Implementation of a whitelist filter for allowed characters in file names.

  **Preconditions:**  
  - An attacker must be able to supply or control the file name. This could be accomplished by providing a malicious repository and convincing the victim to open it in VS Code.  
  - The extension must use the active (unsanitized) file path directly when invoking the system command.

  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The README indicates that the extension “opens *any* type of file” using the default system command without a hint of sanitizing the input.  
  - Likely flow in the code (in TypeScript):  
    1. The extension obtains the current file path from the editor context.  
    2. It selects the appropriate system command based on the operating system (e.g., `open` on macOS).  
    3. It concatenates the chosen command with the file path, without escaping shell meta-characters.  
    4. The command is then executed using a Node.js process execution method that passes the command string to the shell.  
  - In this flow, a file name like `safe.txt; malicious_command` would result in a complete command similar to `open safe.txt; malicious_command`, thereby executing `malicious_command` unexpectedly.

  **Security Test Case:**  
  - **Step 1:** In a controlled test environment, create a file with a deliberately malicious name. For example, on Linux/macOS:  
    - File name: `test.html; touch /tmp/injected`  
  - **Step 2:** Open the test project in VS Code where the extension is installed.  
  - **Step 3:** Open the maliciously named file (so that it becomes the active file).  
  - **Step 4:** Trigger the "open in default browser" command using the designated shortcut (`Alt + B`) or right-click menu option.  
  - **Step 5:** Monitor the system (for example, check if a file `/tmp/injected` is created or observe other side effects) to determine if the injected command was executed.  
  - **Step 6:** Conclude that a successful execution of the malicious payload confirms the presence of a shell command injection vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection Through Default Browser Configuration Input  
  **Description:**  
  - The extension allows the user to override the default browser by providing a configuration parameter. The README explains that various terms (e.g., "chrome", "firefox", "opera", etc.) are accepted.  
  - If this configuration input is not strictly validated, an attacker could supply a malicious string (for example, `chrome; malicious_command`) in a settings file.  
  - When the extension reads this configuration and forms the command to open the file using the specified browser, unsanitized input could result in injection of arbitrary commands.  
  - The attack chain would involve an attacker influencing or supplying a customized and malicious workspace or user settings file.

  **Impact:**  
  - **Critical:** Exploiting this vulnerability could let an attacker execute arbitrary commands on the user's host system when the extension is activated. This might compromise system integrity, lead to data tampering, or open further avenues for exploitation.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The documentation only describes flexible matching of default browser values. There is no clear evidence of any strict sanitization or strict whitelisting of configuration inputs to rule out injected commands.

  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Enforce strict whitelist validation or sanitization on the default browser configuration input, accepting only predefined safe strings (e.g., "chrome", "firefox", "safari", etc.).  
  - Reject or escape any configurations containing disallowed characters or shell metacharacters.

  **Preconditions:**  
  - An attacker must somehow be able to influence the configuration setting for the default browser. This may occur if the attacker supplies a malicious settings file in a repository or if the user inadvertently uses an untrusted configuration source.  
  - The extension must directly use the configuration value in constructing the system command without thorough validation.

  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The README outlines that the extension interprets the default browser configuration by matching the input against a set of flexible keywords.  
  - Likely code flow:  
    1. Read the `open-in-browser.default` configuration value from VS Code’s settings.  
    2. Attempt to match the value with a known list of browser values (e.g., "chrome", "firefox").  
    3. Construct a system command that launches the browser using the configured value.  
  - If the configuration value contains injected shell commands (e.g., `firefox; touch /tmp/injected`), and if the matching logic does not strictly enforce the allowed values, the command line might become:  
    `open "firefox; touch /tmp/injected" <file>`  
    which can result in executing `touch /tmp/injected` if the input is not properly sanitized.

  **Security Test Case:**  
  - **Step 1:** Modify the workspace or user settings in VS Code to set the default browser value to a malicious string. For example:  
    - `"open-in-browser.default": "chrome; touch /tmp/injected"`  
  - **Step 2:** Open a valid file in VS Code so that the extension uses the specified configuration.  
  - **Step 3:** Trigger the "open in default browser" command (via the designated shortcut or context menu).  
  - **Step 4:** Monitor the system to see if the payload executes (e.g., check for the creation of `/tmp/injected` or observe any other unexpected side effects).  
  - **Step 5:** Confirm that the execution of injected commands validates the presence of a command injection vulnerability via configuration input.
