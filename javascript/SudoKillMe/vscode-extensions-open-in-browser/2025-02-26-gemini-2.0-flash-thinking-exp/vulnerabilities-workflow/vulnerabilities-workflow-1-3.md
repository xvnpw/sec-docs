### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Malicious File Path
- Description:
    1. An attacker can create a file with a malicious file path. This path is crafted to include shell commands. For example, on Windows, a file named `test\"; calc.exe` could be created. On Linux/macOS, a file named `test\"; touch hacked.txt` could be created.
    2. The user opens this maliciously named file in VS Code.
    3. The user then triggers the "Open in Browser" extension command, either via shortcut (Alt+B or Shift+Alt+B) or context menu.
    4. The "Open in Browser" extension, according to the README.md, uses system commands like `start` (on Windows), `open` (on macOS), or `xdg-open` (on Linux) to open the file in the browser.
    5. If the file path is not properly sanitized before being passed to these system commands, the shell commands embedded in the malicious file path will be executed. For instance, in the example `test\"; calc.exe`, the command `calc.exe` will be executed after the `start` command processes the path up to the semicolon.
- Impact: Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process. This can lead to:
    - Data exfiltration: Attacker can execute commands to steal sensitive files.
    - Malware installation: Attacker can download and execute malware on the user's system.
    - System compromise: Attacker can gain complete control over the user's machine.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: Based on the provided files (README.md, vsc-extension-quickstart.md, CHANGELOG.md), there is no mention of input sanitization or any other mitigation for this vulnerability. It is likely that the file path is directly passed to the system commands without any security checks.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The file path obtained from VS Code API should be sanitized before being passed to the system commands (`start`, `open`, `xdg-open`). This should include escaping or removing shell-sensitive characters like semicolons, backticks, dollar signs, etc.
    - Using safer APIs: Instead of directly executing shell commands, the extension could potentially use safer APIs provided by Node.js or the `opn` library to open files in browsers, ensuring that command injection is not possible.
- Preconditions:
    1. The "Open in Browser" VS Code extension must be installed.
    2. The user must open a file in VS Code that has a maliciously crafted file path containing shell commands.
    3. The user must trigger the "Open in Browser" command.
- Source code analysis:
    - Unfortunately, the source code of the extension (`extension.js` or similar) is not provided in the PROJECT FILES.
    - Based on the description in `README.md` under "How it works?", the extension uses:
        - `start <filepath>` on Windows
        - `open <filepath>` on macOS
        - `xdg-open <filepath>` on other systems
    - These are all shell commands that directly execute the provided filepath.
    - Without input sanitization, if `<filepath>` contains shell command injection characters, they will be interpreted and executed by the shell.
    - The vulnerability arises because the extension takes user-controlled input (the file path of the currently opened file in VS Code) and directly incorporates it into a shell command without proper validation or sanitization.

- Security test case:
    1. **Windows Test Case:**
        - Create a new file named `test\"; calc.exe` (or any other name ending with `\"; calc.exe`).
        - Open this file in VS Code on a Windows machine.
        - Press `Alt + B` (or trigger "Open in Default Browser" command via command palette or context menu).
        - Observe if the Windows Calculator application (`calc.exe`) is launched. If it launches, the vulnerability is confirmed.

    2. **Linux/macOS Test Case:**
        - Create a new file named `test\"; touch hacked.txt` (or any other name ending with `\"; touch hacked.txt`).
        - Open this file in VS Code on a Linux or macOS machine.
        - Press `Alt + B` (or trigger "Open in Default Browser" command via command palette or context menu).
        - Check if a file named `hacked.txt` is created in the current working directory or user's home directory. If `hacked.txt` is created, the vulnerability is confirmed.

    3. **Alternative Linux/macOS Test Case (using calculator if available):**
        - On Linux/macOS with `xcalc` or `gnome-calculator` installed, create a new file named `test\"; xcalc` (or `test\"; gnome-calculator`).
        - Open this file in VS Code.
        - Press `Alt + B` (or trigger "Open in Browser" command).
        - Observe if the calculator application (`xcalc` or `gnome-calculator`) is launched. If it launches, the vulnerability is confirmed.
