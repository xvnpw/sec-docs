### Vulnerability 1: Path Traversal via File Imports

* Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal via File Imports
* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file.
    2. This file contains an `@import` statement with a path that attempts to traverse directories outside of the intended workspace (e.g., using `../` sequences).
    3. When the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension processes this markdown file, it attempts to resolve and include the file specified in the `@import` statement.
    4. If the extension doesn't properly sanitize or validate the file path, it might allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the application has access to. For example, an attacker could try to read sensitive configuration files or source code.
* Impact: Arbitrary file read. Successful exploitation can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, including application source code, configuration files, environment variables, or internal data, depending on the server's file system permissions and the application's access rights.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * None apparent from the provided project files. The files are mostly documentation, test cases, and configuration. There is no source code to analyze for existing mitigations.
* Missing mitigations:
    * Input sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization on the file paths provided in `@import` statements. This should include stripping or escaping directory traversal sequences like `../` and potentially restricting allowed characters in file paths.
    * Path validation: Implement path validation to ensure that the resolved file path after processing `@import` statements remains within the intended workspace or a predefined allowed directory. Prevent access to files outside of this designated area.
    * Principle of least privilege: Ensure the application and the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension run with the minimum necessary file system permissions to reduce the impact of a successful path traversal attack.
* Preconditions:
    * The Markdown Preview Enhanced extension must be installed and enabled in a vulnerable application.
    * The application must allow users to provide or upload markdown files that are processed by the extension.
    * The application must be deployed in an environment where arbitrary file read can lead to sensitive information disclosure.
* Source code analysis:
    * Source code is not provided, so direct code analysis is not possible.
    * Based on the feature description and test files, the `@import` functionality is present.
    * The vulnerability arises from the potential lack of secure handling of file paths within the `@import` implementation in the extension's source code. Without proper validation and sanitization, the extension might directly use user-provided paths to access files.
* Security test case:
    1. Create a markdown file named `test-path-traversal.md` with the following content:
       ```markdown
       @import "../../../../../etc/passwd"
       ```
    2. Deploy an application instance with Markdown Preview Enhanced enabled.
    3. Upload or make `test-path-traversal.md` accessible to the application in a way that triggers the Markdown Preview Enhanced to render it (e.g., open it in a markdown editor using the extension's preview feature).
    4. Examine the rendered preview.
    5. Check if the content of the `/etc/passwd` file is displayed within the preview. If the content of `/etc/passwd` is visible, it confirms a path traversal vulnerability. If the import fails or an error is shown without revealing file contents, the vulnerability might be mitigated or not present in this form. Note that success depends on the server's OS and file permissions; for Windows, you might test with `C:\Windows\win.ini`.
