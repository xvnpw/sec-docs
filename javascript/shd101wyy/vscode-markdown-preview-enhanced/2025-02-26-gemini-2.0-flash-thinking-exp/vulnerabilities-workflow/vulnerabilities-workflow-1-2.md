- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via `@import` Directive  
  **Description:**  
  - The extension supports an `@import "filename"` syntax to include external file contents into the markdown preview.  
  - An attacker can craft a malicious markdown file containing a traversal payload (for example, `@import "../../../etc/passwd"`) so that, when opened, the file‑import logic reads and injects the contents of arbitrary files from the host file system.  
  - Step by step, the attacker would:  
    1. Create a markdown file that contains an `@import` statement with directory traversal sequences (e.g. `@import "../../../etc/passwd"`).  
    2. Get the target to open this malicious markdown file in the Markdown Preview Enhanced instance.  
    3. Once the file is rendered, the extension’s file‑import routine blindly reads the file from disk and includes it in the preview.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive file contents (e.g. system files, configuration files, or any files readable by the extension).  
  - Leakage of confidential information that could further aid an attacker in compromising the host system.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - There is no evidence in the project files (nor in the changelog notes) that file path input is sanitized or that file access is restricted to a safe directory.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Validation or canonicalization of the file paths to detect and block directory traversal patterns.  
  - A whitelist approach to only allow file accesses within designated (safe) directories.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to supply (or trick a user into opening) a malicious markdown file.  
  - The host running the extension must have file‐system access that is not confined by a strict sandbox.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - Inspection of sample file-import test files (e.g. in `test/markdown/file-imports.md`) shows that `@import` is used without any additional parameter validation.  
  - The underlying file‑import handling routine (likely in the markdown transformer within the crossnote library) takes the quoted string and uses it directly to read file contents.  
  - No filtering is evident that would reject “../” sequences or normalize the path before doing a file read.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - **Step 1:** Create a markdown file (e.g., `malicious.md`) with the content:  
    ```
    @import "../../../etc/passwd"
    ```  
  - **Step 2:** Open this file in an instance of Markdown Preview Enhanced running in a publicly available setting.  
  - **Step 3:** Observe that the content from `/etc/passwd` (or another sensitive file) is rendered in the preview, confirming that the file read was performed.  
  - **Step 4:** Optionally, monitor file-access logs or utilize an environment with a safe-to-read sensitive file to verify information disclosure.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS) in Markdown Preview Rendering  
  **Description:**  
  - The extension’s markdown transformer processes inline HTML without strong sanitization, as evidenced by the use of raw HTML in the README (e.g. `<h1 align="center">Markdown Preview Enhanced</h1>`).  
  - An attacker can craft a markdown file that embeds malicious JavaScript—for example, injecting `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into the markdown content.  
  - Step by step, the attacker would:  
    1. Create a markdown file that includes a malicious script element (or other event‑handler attributes) inserted into the content.  
    2. Deliver this markdown file to a victim (for instance, via social engineering or by hosting it on a public instance).  
    3. When the markdown is previewed, the malicious script executes in the user’s browser context.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user’s browser, potentially leading to session theft, defacement, or redirection to phishing sites.  
  - Compromise of sensitive in‑browser data and possible privilege escalation if the attacker gains control over the preview environment.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The extension intentionally allows raw HTML in markdown for formatting purposes. There is no indication that the rendered output is post‑processed by a sanitization library (such as DOMPurify).  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Use of a robust HTML sanitizer on the rendered output to strip out malicious script elements and event‑handlers.  
  - Alternatively, an option to turn off raw HTML rendering when operating in a public context.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The attacker must be able to supply or force the victim to open a malicious markdown document in the preview.  
  - The preview runs with full JavaScript execution privileges in the browser environment.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The README and test markdown files reveal that the markdown transformer passes inline HTML through without filtering.  
  - The transformation pipeline (as described in the changelog) processes markdown to HTML, then calls hooks such as `onDidParseMarkdown(html)` without a sanitization step.  
  - Therefore, any embedded `<script>` elements or malicious attributes remain intact and are rendered by the browser.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - **Step 1:** Create a markdown file (e.g., `xss_test.md`) with the following content:  
    ```markdown
    # Test XSS
    <script>alert('XSS');</script>
    ```  
  - **Step 2:** Open the file in the Markdown Preview Enhanced interface in a publicly available instance or via VSCode for the Web.  
  - **Step 3:** Observe whether the alert box appears or any unintended script execution occurs.  
  - **Step 4:** Confirm that the script tag has not been sanitized or removed from the rendered output.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Code Chunk Execution  
  **Description:**  
  - The extension supports “code chunk” execution via fenced code blocks that include command parameters (e.g. `{cmd=node}`), as shown in the `test/markdown/code-chunks.md` file.  
  - If these command parameters (or the content of the code chunk) are not properly validated or sanitized, an attacker who supplies a maliciously crafted markdown file may inject additional shell commands.  
  - Step by step, the attacker would:  
    1. Write a markdown file with a code chunk that appears to run a simple command (e.g. JavaScript using Node.js) but embeds command‑injection payloads such as extra shell metacharacters or additional commands.  
    2. For example, the attacker might include a payload like:  
       ```js {cmd=node}
       console.log("Normal output"); $(malicious_command)
       ```  
    3. When the victim activates the “run code chunk” command in the preview, the underlying function takes the supplied input and passes it to the host system’s shell without adequate sanitization.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Arbitrary command execution on the victim’s host running the extension, potentially leading to data loss, system compromise, or further privilege escalation.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The provided test files show consistent use of command chunk annotations (such as `{cmd=node}`, `{cmd=true}`) but do not demonstrate any sanitation or whitelisting of the command content.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Strict sanitization and validation of any command-line arguments or embedded code that is to be executed.  
  - Running code chunks in a restricted, sandboxed environment where dangerous shell metacharacters are rejected or escaped.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The victim must trigger the execution of code chunks (this may be done manually by clicking “Run Code Chunk” or via an automated process in a publicly available preview session).  
  - The attacker must be able to supply a malicious markdown file that will be rendered and executed by the extension.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - Analysis of the `test/markdown/code-chunks.md` file reveals that code chunks are marked up with parameters that are later interpreted by the extension’s command execution logic.  
  - Although the comments and changelog entries discuss improvements, there is no explicit evidence of input validation or safe execution (for example, no use of parameterized shell execution or sandboxing).  
  - As a result, any injected command-line payload inside a code chunk might be passed directly to the underlying shell interpreter.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - **Step 1:** Create a markdown file (e.g., `cmd_inject_test.md`) with a code chunk such as:  
    ```markdown
    ```js {cmd=node}
    console.log("This is a safe command"); $(echo "Injected!")
    ```
    ```  
  - **Step 2:** Open the file using Markdown Preview Enhanced and trigger the code chunk execution manually.  
  - **Step 3:** Monitor the output or system logs to see if the injected command (`echo "Injected!"` in this example) is executed.  
  - **Step 4:** Confirm that the system behavior deviates from the intended safe execution of the provided code chunk.
