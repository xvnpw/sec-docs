## Combined Vulnerability List for Markdown Preview Enhanced

This document outlines identified security vulnerabilities in the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension, combining and deduplicating information from the provided vulnerability lists.

### 1. Path Traversal via File Imports

* **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal via File Imports
* **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file.
    2. This file contains an `@import` statement with a path that attempts to traverse directories outside of the intended workspace (e.g., using `../` sequences) or even specify absolute paths. The `@import "filename"` syntax is used to include external file contents into the markdown preview.
    3. When the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension processes this markdown file, it attempts to resolve and include the file specified in the `@import` statement.
    4. If the extension doesn't properly sanitize or validate the file path, it might allow the attacker to read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem that the application has access to. For example, an attacker could try to read sensitive configuration files like `/etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\win.ini`, or application source code.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary file read. Successful exploitation can lead to the unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, including system files, configuration files, application source code, environment variables, or internal data, depending on the server's file system permissions and the application's access rights. This leakage of confidential information could further aid an attacker in compromising the host system.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** High
* **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    * None apparent from the provided project files and changelog notes. There is no evidence that file path input is sanitized or that file access is restricted to a safe directory. Inspection of sample file-import test files shows that `@import` is used without any additional parameter validation.
* **Missing mitigations:**
    * **Input sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization on the file paths provided in `@import` statements. This should include stripping or escaping directory traversal sequences like `../` and potentially restricting allowed characters in file paths.
    * **Path validation:** Implement path validation and canonicalization to detect and block directory traversal patterns. Ensure that the resolved file path after processing `@import` statements remains within the intended workspace or a predefined allowed directory. Prevent access to files outside of this designated area. A whitelist approach to only allow file accesses within designated (safe) directories should be considered.
    * **Principle of least privilege:** Ensure the application and the Markdown Preview Enhanced extension run with the minimum necessary file system permissions to reduce the impact of a successful path traversal attack.
* **Preconditions:**
    * The Markdown Preview Enhanced extension must be installed and enabled in a vulnerable application like VS Code or VS Code for the Web.
    * The application must allow users to provide or upload markdown files that are processed by the extension, or the attacker must be able to trick a user into opening a malicious markdown file.
    * The host running the extension must have file‑system access that is not confined by a strict sandbox.
    * The application must be deployed in an environment where arbitrary file read can lead to sensitive information disclosure.
* **Source code analysis:**
    * Source code is not provided, so direct code analysis is not possible.
    * Based on the feature description and test files (e.g., `test/markdown/file-imports.md`), the `@import` functionality is present.
    * The underlying file‑import handling routine (likely in the markdown transformer within the crossnote library) takes the quoted string from the `@import` statement and uses it directly to read file contents.
    * No filtering is evident that would reject “../” sequences or normalize the path before doing a file read. The transformation pipeline processes markdown to HTML, then calls hooks such as `onDidParseMarkdown(html)` without a sanitization step for file paths.
* **Security test case:**
    1. Create a markdown file named `test-path-traversal.md` (or `malicious.md`) with the following content:
       ```markdown
       @import "../../../../../etc/passwd"
       ```
    2. Deploy an application instance with Markdown Preview Enhanced enabled, or use VSCode with the extension installed in a publicly available setting (like VSCode for the Web).
    3. Upload or make `test-path-traversal.md` accessible to the application in a way that triggers the Markdown Preview Enhanced to render it (e.g., open it in a markdown editor using the extension's preview feature).
    4. Examine the rendered preview.
    5. Check if the content of the `/etc/passwd` file is displayed within the preview. If the content of `/etc/passwd` is visible, it confirms a path traversal vulnerability. If the import fails or an error is shown without revealing file contents, the vulnerability might be mitigated or not present in this form. Note that success depends on the server's OS and file permissions; for Windows, you might test with `C:\Windows\win.ini`. Optionally, monitor file-access logs or utilize an environment with a safe-to-read sensitive file to verify information disclosure.

### 2. Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS) in Markdown Preview Rendering

* **Vulnerability Name:** Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS) in Markdown Preview Rendering
* **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file.
    2. This file embeds malicious JavaScript, for example, by injecting `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` or using event-handler attributes within inline HTML in the markdown content.
    3. The extension’s markdown transformer processes inline HTML without strong sanitization, as evidenced by the intentional allowance of raw HTML for formatting purposes.
    4. When the markdown is previewed, the malicious script executes in the user’s browser context because the rendered output is not post‑processed by a sanitization library.
* **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user’s browser. This can potentially lead to session theft, defacement, redirection to phishing sites, or compromise of sensitive in‑browser data. If the attacker gains control over the preview environment, privilege escalation might be possible.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
* **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    * The extension intentionally allows raw HTML in markdown for formatting purposes. There is no indication that the rendered output is post‑processed by a sanitization library (such as DOMPurify).
* **Missing mitigations:**
    * **HTML Sanitization:** Use of a robust HTML sanitizer (like DOMPurify) on the rendered output to strip out malicious script elements and event‑handler attributes. This should be implemented to ensure that any embedded `<script>` elements or malicious attributes are removed or neutralized before rendering in the preview.
    * **Option to Disable Raw HTML:** Alternatively, provide an option to turn off raw HTML rendering, especially when operating in a public or untrusted context, allowing users to choose a safer rendering mode.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy for the preview window to restrict the capabilities of the rendered content and prevent the execution of inline scripts.
* **Preconditions:**
    * The attacker must be able to supply or force the victim to open a malicious markdown document in the preview. This could be achieved via social engineering or by hosting the malicious file on a public instance.
    * The preview environment runs with full JavaScript execution privileges in the browser environment.
* **Source code analysis:**
    * The README and test markdown files reveal that the markdown transformer passes inline HTML through without filtering. For example, the README uses `<h1 align="center">Markdown Preview Enhanced</h1>`.
    * The transformation pipeline processes markdown to HTML, then calls hooks such as `onDidParseMarkdown(html)` without a sanitization step.
    * Therefore, any embedded `<script>` elements or malicious attributes remain intact and are rendered directly by the browser.
* **Security test case:**
    1. Create a markdown file (e.g., `xss_test.md`) with the following content:
       ```markdown
       # Test XSS
       <script>alert('XSS');</script>
       ```
    2. Open the file in the Markdown Preview Enhanced interface in a publicly available instance or via VSCode for the Web.
    3. Observe whether the alert box appears or any unintended script execution occurs.
    4. Confirm that the script tag has not been sanitized or removed from the rendered output by inspecting the rendered HTML source.

### 3. Command Injection in Code Chunk Execution

* **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection in Code Chunk Execution
* **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious markdown file.
    2. This file contains a code chunk with command parameters (e.g. `{cmd=node}`) or code chunk content that embeds command‑injection payloads such as extra shell metacharacters or additional commands. For example, a seemingly harmless JavaScript code chunk might be crafted like:
       ```js {cmd=node}
       console.log("Normal output"); $(malicious_command)
       ```
    3. When the victim activates the “run code chunk” command in the preview (manually or potentially automatically in certain configurations), the underlying function takes the supplied input (command parameters and code content) and passes it to the host system’s shell without adequate sanitization or validation.
* **Impact:** Arbitrary command execution on the victim’s host running the extension. This can potentially lead to data loss, system compromise, or further privilege escalation, as the attacker can execute any command with the privileges of the user running the extension/application.
* **Vulnerability Rank:** High
* **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    * The provided test files (e.g., `test/markdown/code-chunks.md`) show consistent use of command chunk annotations (such as `{cmd=node}`, `{cmd=true}`) but do not demonstrate any sanitation or whitelisting of the command content or parameters. There is no evidence of input validation or safe execution mechanisms.
* **Missing mitigations:**
    * **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement strict sanitization and validation of any command-line arguments and the code within code chunks that is intended to be executed. This should include escaping shell metacharacters and validating command names and parameters against a whitelist of allowed commands and arguments.
    * **Sandboxed Execution Environment:** Run code chunks in a restricted, sandboxed environment where dangerous shell metacharacters are rejected or escaped. Consider using secure execution environments that limit the privileges and system access available to the executed code.
    * **User Confirmation and Warnings:** Implement user confirmation or warnings before executing code chunks, especially for code chunks from untrusted sources or when potentially dangerous commands are detected.
    * **Disable Code Chunk Execution by Default:** Consider disabling code chunk execution by default and requiring explicit user opt-in to enable this feature, especially in environments where security is paramount.
* **Preconditions:**
    * The victim must trigger the execution of code chunks. This may be done manually by clicking “Run Code Chunk” in the preview, or potentially via an automated process in a publicly available preview session if auto-execution features are enabled.
    * The attacker must be able to supply a malicious markdown file that will be rendered and executed by the extension.
* **Source code analysis:**
    * Analysis of the `test/markdown/code-chunks.md` file reveals that code chunks are marked up with parameters that are later interpreted by the extension’s command execution logic.
    * Although changelog entries and comments might discuss improvements or features related to code chunks, there is no explicit evidence of input validation or safe execution (for example, no use of parameterized shell execution or sandboxing).
    * As a result, any injected command-line payload inside a code chunk might be passed directly to the underlying shell interpreter.
* **Security test case:**
    1. Create a markdown file (e.g., `cmd_inject_test.md`) with a code chunk such as:
       ```markdown
       ```js {cmd=node}
       console.log("This is a safe command"); $(echo "Injected!")
       ```
       or for more direct command injection:
       ```js {cmd=node;$(touch /tmp/pwned)}
       console.log("This is a command injection test");
       ```
    2. Open the file using Markdown Preview Enhanced and trigger the code chunk execution manually by clicking "Run Code Chunk" in the preview.
    3. Monitor the output or system logs to see if the injected command (`echo "Injected!"` or `touch /tmp/pwned` in these examples) is executed. For the first example, observe if "Injected!" is printed in addition to "This is a safe command". For the second example, check if a file named `pwned` is created in the `/tmp/` directory.
    4. Confirm that the system behavior deviates from the intended safe execution of the provided code chunk, indicating successful command injection.

**Note on "Code Injection via File Imports and Code Chunks":**

The vulnerability described as "Code Injection via File Imports and Code Chunks" is effectively a scenario that combines the "Path Traversal via File Imports" and "Command Injection in Code Chunk Execution" vulnerabilities. An attacker can use the `@import` directive (potentially exploiting path traversal or simply importing a file from a known location) to include a malicious markdown file containing a command-injected code chunk. When a user previews a legitimate markdown file that imports the malicious file, the code chunk within the imported file gets executed, leading to Remote Code Execution. This highlights the severity of the Command Injection vulnerability, especially when combined with features like `@import` that can be abused to deliver malicious content remotely or indirectly. The security test case for "Code Injection via File Imports and Code Chunks" effectively demonstrates the exploitability of Command Injection via a file import mechanism.
