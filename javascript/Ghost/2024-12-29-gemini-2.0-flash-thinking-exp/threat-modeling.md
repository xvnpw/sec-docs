### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Ghost

This list details high and critical security threats directly related to the Ghost platform.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Themes
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a Ghost theme file. When a user visits a page with the compromised theme, the malicious script executes in their browser. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, hijack sessions, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the website. This directly involves the Ghost theme engine.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Theme engine, Handlebars templates.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Developers should rigorously sanitize and escape all user-generated content displayed by the theme.
        *   Utilize secure templating practices in Handlebars, ensuring proper escaping of variables.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Regularly review and audit theme code for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) through Theme Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in themes to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Ghost application. This could be achieved through insecure file uploads *within the theme installation process* or flaws in how Ghost processes theme files.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, malware installation, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Theme engine, potentially Node.js runtime if vulnerabilities exist in how Ghost handles theme files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit themes for security vulnerabilities before installation.
        *   Keep Ghost core updated to patch any vulnerabilities in the theme installation process.
        *   Implement strict file upload validation and sanitization within the Ghost core for theme uploads.
        *   Avoid using untrusted or poorly maintained themes.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization in Ghost Internals
    *   **Description:** If Ghost uses serialization to store or transmit data internally, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process could allow an attacker to inject malicious code that gets executed when the data is unserialized. This is a vulnerability within the Ghost core itself.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially core Ghost modules handling data persistence or communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using serialization for sensitive data if possible within the Ghost core.
        *   If serialization is necessary, use secure serialization libraries and ensure proper validation of serialized data within the Ghost core.
        *   Keep Ghost core updated to patch known deserialization vulnerabilities.
