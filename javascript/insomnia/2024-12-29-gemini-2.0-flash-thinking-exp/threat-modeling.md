Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving Insomnia:

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Stored Credentials and API Keys
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine or Insomnia's configuration files. They then extract stored credentials such as API keys, OAuth tokens, or Basic Auth credentials from Insomnia's environment variables, workspace files, or local storage.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend systems and APIs, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or service disruption. The attacker could impersonate legitimate users or services.
    *   **Affected Insomnia Component:** Environment Variables, Workspace Files (.insomnia directory), Local Storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive credentials directly within Insomnia's environment variables.
        *   Utilize secure credential management tools or vault solutions and reference them within Insomnia.
        *   Encrypt sensitive data within Insomnia's environment variables if direct storage is unavoidable.
        *   Implement strong access controls on developer machines.
        *   Educate developers on the risks of storing credentials insecurely.
        *   Regularly review and remove unused or outdated credentials from Insomnia.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Request/Response History
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to a developer's machine or Insomnia's configuration files. They then access Insomnia's request and response history, which may contain sensitive information like PII, financial data, or internal system details exchanged during API interactions.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, and potential compliance issues due to the exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Insomnia Component:** Request History, Response History, Workspace Files (.insomnia directory).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid sending or receiving sensitive data in API requests and responses during development and testing whenever possible. Use anonymized or masked data.
        *   Regularly clear Insomnia's request and response history.
        *   Configure Insomnia to not store request/response bodies for sensitive endpoints.
        *   Implement strong access controls on developer machines.
        *   Educate developers on the risks of exposing sensitive data in API interactions.

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Insomnia Application
    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a security vulnerability within the Insomnia application itself (e.g., Remote Code Execution, Cross-Site Scripting). This could be achieved through malicious crafted API responses processed by Insomnia or by exploiting flaws in Insomnia's UI or core functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the developer's machine, access to stored credentials and sensitive data within Insomnia, or the ability to manipulate API requests.
    *   **Affected Insomnia Component:** Core Application, UI Components, Request Processing Engine.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure all developers are using the latest stable version of Insomnia to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor Insomnia's release notes and security advisories for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement endpoint security solutions on developer machines to detect and prevent exploitation attempts.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Insomnia Plugins
    *   **Description:** A developer installs a malicious or compromised Insomnia plugin. This plugin could be designed to steal credentials, exfiltrate data from Insomnia, or execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the developer's machine, theft of sensitive data stored in Insomnia, or the introduction of malware into the development environment.
    *   **Affected Insomnia Component:** Plugin System, Installed Plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install Insomnia plugins from trusted and verified sources.
        *   Review the permissions requested by plugins before installation.
        *   Regularly audit installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or from untrusted sources.
        *   Consider using a plugin vetting process within the development team.
