# Threat Model Analysis for eggjs/egg

## Threat: [Unpatched Vulnerability in Egg.js Core (e.g., `egg-security`)](./threats/unpatched_vulnerability_in_egg_js_core__e_g____egg-security__.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known but unpatched vulnerability in the core Egg.js framework or a core plugin like `egg-security`. The attacker might craft a malicious request that triggers the vulnerability, leading to remote code execution (RCE) or other exploits. For example, a flaw in how `egg-security` handles CSRF tokens could allow an attacker to bypass CSRF protection.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, denial of service.
    *   **Egg Component Affected:** Core framework modules (e.g., `egg`, `egg-core`), core plugins (e.g., `egg-security`, `egg-view`), potentially any component relying on the vulnerable code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediate Patching:** Apply security updates from the Egg.js project *immediately* upon release. Prioritize security updates.
        *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF to help mitigate known exploits (temporary measure).
        *   **Monitoring:** Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious plugin to the npm registry (typosquatting or compromised legitimate plugin). A developer unknowingly installs it. The plugin could contain a backdoor, steal credentials, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution on the server, data exfiltration, lateral movement, potential compromise of other systems.
    *   **Egg Component Affected:** `Plugin` system, any application code interacting with the malicious plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Verification:** Carefully verify the plugin's author, source, and download statistics before installation.
        *   **Code Review (Plugins):** If feasible, review the plugin's source code before installation.
        *   **Dependency Locking:** Use a package-lock.json or yarn.lock file.
        *   **Limited Plugin Use:** Minimize the number of third-party plugins.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in a Third-Party Plugin](./threats/vulnerability_in_a_third-party_plugin.md)

*   **Description:** A legitimate, but vulnerable, third-party Egg.js plugin is used. The attacker exploits a vulnerability in the plugin.
    *   **Impact:** Varies, but could range from data leakage to complete system compromise.
    *   **Egg Component Affected:** `Plugin` system, the specific vulnerable plugin, and any application code interacting with it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all plugins updated.
        *   **Dependency Auditing:** Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   **Plugin Selection:** Choose well-maintained plugins from reputable sources.
        *   **Monitoring Plugin Activity:** Monitor plugins for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Misconfigured CSRF Protection (`egg-security`)](./threats/misconfigured_csrf_protection___egg-security__.md)

*   **Description:** The `egg-security` plugin's CSRF protection is disabled, misconfigured (incorrect token secret, weak generation), or bypassed. An attacker can forge requests on behalf of users.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of users (changing passwords, making purchases, deleting data).
    *   **Egg Component Affected:** `egg-security` plugin, specifically the CSRF protection middleware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enable and Test CSRF:** Ensure CSRF protection is enabled and properly configured.
        *   **Regular Testing:** Regularly test the CSRF protection mechanism.
        *   **Token Secret Management:** Store the CSRF token secret securely (e.g., in environment variables).

## Threat: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) via `ctx.params`](./threats/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__via__ctx_params_.md)

*   **Description:**  The application uses values from `ctx.params` (e.g., user IDs, resource IDs) directly in database queries or other operations without proper authorization checks.  An attacker can modify these parameters to access resources they should not have access to.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to data, potential for data modification or deletion.
    *   **Egg Component Affected:** `Context` (`ctx`), `Router` (how parameters are extracted), `Controller` (how parameters are used), potentially `Service` layer (if interacting with data).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authorization Checks:**  Implement robust authorization checks *before* accessing any resource based on user-provided parameters.
        *   **Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize all input from `ctx.params`.
        *   **Object-Level Permissions:**  Implement object-level permissions.
