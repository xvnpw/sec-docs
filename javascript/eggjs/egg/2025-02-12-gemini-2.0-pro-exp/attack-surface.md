# Attack Surface Analysis for eggjs/egg

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within installed Egg.js plugins (including their dependencies).
    *   **How Egg.js Contributes:** Egg.js's plugin architecture is a core feature. The framework's functionality is heavily reliant on plugins.
    *   **Example:** A plugin used for authentication has a known vulnerability allowing for authentication bypass, granting unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), Data Breach, Privilege Escalation, Authentication Bypass.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the plugin and vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Auditing:** Use tools like `npm audit`, `snyk`, or OWASP Dependency-Check. Automate this.
        *   **Plugin Selection:** Carefully vet third-party plugins. Prioritize well-maintained plugins.
        *   **Update Regularly:** Keep all plugins and dependencies updated.
        *   **Forking (if necessary):** For critical, unmaintained plugins, consider forking and maintaining internally.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Configure plugins with minimum necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/plugin_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or overly permissive configuration of Egg.js plugins.
    *   **How Egg.js Contributes:** Plugins have many configuration options; misconfiguration can directly expose vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Disabling CSRF protection in the `egg-security` plugin.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), Authentication/Authorization Bypass, Data Modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the misconfiguration).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure by Default:** Start with the most restrictive configurations.
        *   **Documentation Review:** Thoroughly review plugin documentation.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only enable necessary features.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement validation checks for configuration values.

## Attack Surface: [Context (`ctx`) Object Manipulation (Prototype Pollution)](./attack_surfaces/context___ctx___object_manipulation__prototype_pollution_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulating the `ctx` object, via prototype pollution, to alter application behavior.
    *   **How Egg.js Contributes:** The `ctx` object is central to request handling in Egg.js and is widely accessible.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sending a JSON payload with a `__proto__` property that, if improperly handled, could lead to DoS or potentially RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE), Unexpected Application Behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on how polluted properties are used).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Strictly sanitize and validate all user-supplied data.
        *   **Avoid Direct Assignment:** Do not directly assign user data to `ctx` properties. Use helper functions.
        *   **Object.freeze/Object.seal:** Consider using `Object.freeze()` or `Object.seal()` on critical parts of the `ctx` object.
        *   **Use Map instead of Object:** If possible, use `Map` objects.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Ordering and Bypass](./attack_surfaces/middleware_ordering_and_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect middleware ordering, or vulnerabilities within middleware, allowing bypass of security checks.
    *   **How Egg.js Contributes:** Egg.js relies heavily on middleware, and execution order is crucial.
    *   **Example:** Placing authentication middleware *after* middleware that processes user input.
    *   **Impact:** Authentication Bypass, Authorization Bypass, Data Leakage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on bypassed checks).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Correct Ordering:** Security middleware *before* input processing middleware.
        *   **Middleware Auditing:** Regularly audit all middleware.
        *   **Fail-Safe Design:** Middleware should fail securely.
        *   **Centralized Security Logic:** Consolidate security logic.

## Attack Surface: [Service Layer Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/service_layer_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within Egg.js services, often due to insecure handling of user input.
    *   **How Egg.js Contributes:** Services are a core part of the Egg.js architecture, encapsulating business logic.
    *   **Example:** A service using user-supplied data in a database query without sanitization (SQL injection).
    *   **Impact:** SQL Injection, Data Breach, Data Modification, Privilege Escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the service).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate *all* input to services, even from `ctx`.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Use parameterized queries, avoid dynamic code execution.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Services should have minimal permissions.
        *   **Service Isolation:** Consider isolating services.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration Storage](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_storage.md)

* **Description:** Storing sensitive configuration data directly in Egg.js configuration files.
    * **How Egg.js Contributes:** Egg.js uses configuration files to manage application settings.
    * **Example:** Placing a database password directly within `config.prod.js`.
    * **Impact:** Information Disclosure, Credential Theft, Unauthorized Access.
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive data in environment variables.
        * **Secret Management Solutions:** Use dedicated secret management solutions.
        * **Configuration Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive values.
        * **.gitignore:** Ensure config files with sensitive data are in `.gitignore`.
