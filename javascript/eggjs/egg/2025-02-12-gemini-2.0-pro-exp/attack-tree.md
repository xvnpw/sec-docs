## Attack Tree Path: [2. Leverage Plugin/Middleware Vulnerabilities [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2__leverage_pluginmiddleware_vulnerabilities__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within plugins or middleware used by the Egg.js application.  Egg.js's modular architecture relies heavily on plugins, making this a significant attack surface.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (RCE, depending on plugin functionality)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits may be publicly available)
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (IDS/IPS, WAF can detect known exploit signatures)

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Vulnerable Plugin Selection [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_vulnerable_plugin_selection__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker chooses to target a plugin known to have vulnerabilities or one that is poorly maintained and likely to have unpatched issues.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Popular Plugin with Known Vulnerability [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_popular_plugin_with_known_vulnerability__hr_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker specifically targets a widely used Egg.js plugin that has a publicly disclosed vulnerability (e.g., a CVE).  Exploits for these vulnerabilities are often readily available.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (RCE)
*   **Effort:** Low (Public exploits available)
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Beginner
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (IDS/IPS, WAF can detect known exploit signatures)

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Misconfigurations [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_misconfigurations__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves exploiting common misconfigurations in the Egg.js application or its environment.  These are often low-hanging fruit for attackers.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
*   **Impact:** Varies, but can be Very High (especially with credential issues)
*   **Effort:** Generally Low
*   **Skill Level:** Often Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Varies, from Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Weak/Default Credentials [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_weakdefault_credentials__hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:**  The attacker leverages weak, default, or easily guessable credentials to gain access to the application, its database, or other connected services. This is a critical node because it often provides a direct path to compromise.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Unfortunately common)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If exposed) to Hard (If brute-forcing is required)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.1 Admin/Dev Credentials Hardcoded in Source Code [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_1_admindev_credentials_hardcoded_in_source_code__hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:**  Developer or administrator credentials are mistakenly left hardcoded within the application's source code.  If an attacker gains access to the source code (e.g., through a repository leak or another vulnerability), they can easily obtain these credentials.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Should be very rare with good practices)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete compromise)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If source code is accessible)

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2.2 Default Database Credentials [HR] [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_2_default_database_credentials__hr___cn_.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses the default credentials for its database connection.  These credentials are often well-known and easily found online.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete database compromise, potential for RCE)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
