Okay, let's create a design document for the Egg.js framework based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Egg.js is a Node.js framework designed to help developers build enterprise-level web applications and APIs. It emphasizes convention over configuration, extensibility, and stability.  The business priorities appear to be:

*   Provide a stable and reliable framework for building enterprise applications.
*   Reduce development time and effort through conventions and built-in features.
*   Enable easy extension and customization to meet specific project needs.
*   Foster a strong community and ecosystem around the framework.
*   Maintain backward compatibility and minimize breaking changes.

Business Goals:

*   Become a leading choice for Node.js enterprise development.
*   Attract and retain a large and active user base.
*   Maintain a high level of developer satisfaction.
*   Ensure the long-term sustainability of the project.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the framework or its dependencies could expose user data or disrupt applications.
*   Lack of adoption or a decline in community engagement could lead to the framework becoming obsolete.
*   Performance bottlenecks or scalability issues could limit the use of the framework for high-traffic applications.
*   Failure to keep up with the evolving Node.js ecosystem could make the framework less attractive to developers.
*   Inadequate documentation or support could hinder developer adoption and satisfaction.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Egg.js has a dedicated security plugin (`egg-security`) that provides protection against common web vulnerabilities like XSS, CSRF, clickjacking, and others. (Described in the documentation and implemented as a plugin).
*   security control: The framework encourages the use of secure coding practices through its conventions and documentation. (Described in documentation).
*   security control: Dependency management is handled through npm, allowing for regular updates to address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Implicit in the Node.js ecosystem).
*   security control: The framework provides built-in support for common security features like HTTPS and secure cookies. (Described in the documentation).
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing are likely conducted, although this is not explicitly stated in the repository. (Assumption based on best practices).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The framework relies on the security of its underlying dependencies, and vulnerabilities in those dependencies could impact the security of applications built with Egg.js.
*   accepted risk: Developers are ultimately responsible for implementing secure coding practices within their applications, and the framework cannot guarantee the absence of all vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: The framework's security plugin may not cover all possible attack vectors, and developers may need to implement additional security measures.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
*   Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the development workflow to identify potential vulnerabilities early on.
*   Implement dynamic application security testing (DAST) to scan running applications for vulnerabilities.
*   Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   Provide more detailed security guidance and best practices in the documentation.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The framework should provide mechanisms for implementing secure user authentication, including support for various authentication methods (e.g., password-based, OAuth, JWT).
    *   Session management should be secure, protecting against session hijacking and fixation attacks.
*   Authorization:
    *   The framework should support role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization mechanisms to restrict access to sensitive resources.
    *   Authorization checks should be enforced consistently throughout the application.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input should be validated rigorously to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection).
    *   The framework should provide built-in validation mechanisms or integrate with popular validation libraries.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Sensitive data should be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS) and at rest (using appropriate encryption algorithms).
    *   The framework should provide secure mechanisms for managing cryptographic keys.
    *   Password should be hashed using strong, one-way hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).

    *   SAST Scanning: Performs static application security testing to identify vulnerabilities in the code.
    *   Unit/Integration Tests: Executes automated tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
    *   Build Application: Compiles the application code (if necessary) and packages it for deployment.
    *   Docker Build: Creates a Docker image containing the application and its dependencies.
    *   Docker Registry: Pushes the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR, Google Container Registry).

Security Controls:

*   security control: Code linting helps enforce coding standards and prevent common errors.
*   security control: SAST scanning identifies vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle.
*   security control: Automated tests ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Docker images provide a consistent and isolated environment for the application.
*   security control: Container registries provide a secure way to store and manage Docker images.
*   security control: Using signed commits and verifying them in CI.
*   security control: Using signed docker images.

# RISK ASSESSMENT
