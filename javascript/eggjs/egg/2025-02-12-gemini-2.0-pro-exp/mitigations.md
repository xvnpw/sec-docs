# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for eggjs/egg

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Middleware Ordering and Validation (Egg.js Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_middleware_ordering_and_validation__egg_js_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`app.middleware` Array:** Utilize Egg.js's `app.middleware` array within `config/config.default.js` (and environment-specific configuration files) to *explicitly* define the order of all middleware. This is a core Egg.js mechanism for controlling request processing flow.
    2.  **Egg.js Plugin Middleware:** Understand how Egg.js plugins register their middleware and ensure their placement aligns with your security requirements. Some plugins might automatically add middleware; be aware of this.
    3.  **Prioritize Security Middleware:** Place Egg.js's built-in security middleware (and any security-related plugin middleware) early in the chain, *before* middleware that processes user input (like `egg-bodyParser`) or interacts with databases. This is crucial for Egg.js's security model.
    4.  **`config.middleware`:** Use the `config.middleware` array in your configuration to enable/disable specific middleware globally or for specific environments. This is an Egg.js-specific configuration option.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Bypassing Security Checks (Critical):** Incorrect order can bypass Egg.js's built-in security checks or those provided by security-focused plugins.
    *   **CSRF Attacks (High):** If Egg.js's CSRF protection middleware (or a plugin's) is misplaced, it might be ineffective.
    *   **XSS Attacks (High):** If input sanitization middleware (provided by Egg.js or a plugin) is in the wrong order, XSS vulnerabilities might be exploitable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Bypassing Security Checks:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Negligible).
    *   **CSRF Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **XSS Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible, *in conjunction with other XSS mitigations*).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `config/config.default.js`:  `app.middleware` array exists but isn't fully optimized for security.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit ordering of *all* middleware, including those from plugins, with a focus on security.
    *   Environment-specific middleware configurations (e.g., stricter order in `config.prod.js`).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `config.security` Configuration (Egg.js Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure__config_security__configuration__egg_js_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`config.security` Object:**  Leverage Egg.js's `config.security` object in your configuration files (`config/config.default.js`, `config.prod.js`, etc.) to control built-in security features. This is the primary mechanism for configuring Egg.js's security protections.
    2.  **CSRF Protection:**  Enable and *correctly configure* Egg.js's CSRF protection within `config.security`.  Understand the options (e.g., `csrf.enable`, `csrf.ignoreJSON`, `csrf.useSession`, `csrf.getToken`, `csrf.cookieName`, `csrf.headerName`). Choose the appropriate settings for your application's needs.
    3.  **XSS Protection:**  Utilize Egg.js's built-in XSS protection features within `config.security`.  Understand options like `xframe`, `hsts`, `noopen`, `nosniff`, `xssProtection`.
    4.  **`ctx.safeStringify`:** Use `ctx.safeStringify` *judiciously* and *in conjunction with input validation* when serializing data to JSON.  This is an Egg.js-specific helper function.  Do *not* rely on it as the sole XSS prevention mechanism.
    5.  **`ctx.helper.escape`:** Use `ctx.helper.escape` for HTML escaping when rendering user-provided data in templates. This is an Egg.js-provided helper. Again, this should be *in addition to* input validation.
    6.  **Security Headers:** Configure appropriate security headers within `config.security` (e.g., `hsts`, `xframe`, `csp`). Egg.js provides convenient options for setting these headers.
    7. **Environment-Specific Settings:** Use environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `config.prod.js`) to enable stricter security settings in production. This is a core Egg.js best practice.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **CSRF Attacks (High):**  Directly addresses CSRF vulnerabilities through Egg.js's built-in protection.
    *   **XSS Attacks (High):**  Mitigates XSS through built-in filtering and helper functions, and security headers.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium):**  Addresses clickjacking via the `xframe` option in `config.security`.
    *   **MITM Attacks (High):**  Mitigates MITM attacks (when HTTPS is used) via the `hsts` option.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **XSS Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible, *in conjunction with other XSS mitigations*).
    *   **Clickjacking:** Risk reduced significantly (from Medium to Low/Negligible).
    *   **MITM Attacks:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible, *with proper HTTPS setup*).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic `config.security` settings are present, but not fully optimized or reviewed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough review and optimization of all `config.security` options.
    *   Environment-specific configurations (especially for production).
    *   Proper configuration of CSRF protection (understanding the different options).
    *   Consistent use of `ctx.safeStringify` and `ctx.helper.escape`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Egg.js Plugin Security and Management](./mitigation_strategies/egg_js_plugin_security_and_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Official Plugins:** Prioritize using plugins from the official Egg.js organization (`eggjs` on npm) or well-known, reputable community contributors. This leverages the Egg.js ecosystem's quality control.
    2.  **Plugin Configuration:** Carefully review and configure *all* settings for each Egg.js plugin, especially those related to security.  Plugins often have their own configuration options within your Egg.js configuration files.
    3.  **`egg-security` Plugin:** Understand the features and configuration options of the `egg-security` plugin, as it provides many of the core security features. This is a *fundamental* part of securing an Egg.js application.
    4.  **Update Plugins via `npm`:** Keep all Egg.js plugins updated to their latest versions using `npm update`. This ensures you receive security patches provided by the plugin maintainers. This is how Egg.js manages plugin updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Plugin Vulnerabilities (Critical/High):**  Vulnerable Egg.js plugins can be exploited.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High):**  Compromised plugins can introduce malicious code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical/High to Low/Medium).
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk reduced (from High to Medium).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Some plugins are used, but their configurations haven't been thoroughly reviewed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal process for selecting and vetting Egg.js plugins.
    *   Regular review of plugin configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure File Uploads with `egg-multipart` (Egg.js Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_file_uploads_with__egg-multipart___egg_js_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`egg-multipart` Configuration:** If using `egg-multipart` (the standard Egg.js plugin for file uploads), carefully configure its options in your Egg.js configuration files. This is the *primary* way to control file upload security in Egg.js.
    2.  **`fileSize` Limit:**  Set a strict `fileSize` limit within the `egg-multipart` configuration to prevent excessively large file uploads.
    3.  **`whitelist` (File Extensions):** Use the `whitelist` option in `egg-multipart` to define a list of allowed file extensions.  *However*, do *not* rely solely on this; also validate MIME types and file signatures (this part is not Egg.js specific).
    4.  **`mode`:** Understand the different modes of `egg-multipart` (`file` and `stream`) and choose the appropriate one for your needs.
    5. **`tmpdir`:** Configure a secure temporary directory (`tmpdir`) for `egg-multipart` to store files during upload. Ensure this directory has appropriate permissions.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload (Critical):**  Misconfigured `egg-multipart` can allow attackers to upload malicious files.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):**  Large file uploads can exhaust server resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Risk reduced significantly (from Critical to Low/Medium, *in conjunction with other file upload security measures*).
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `egg-multipart` is used with basic configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Thorough review and optimization of all `egg-multipart` configuration options.
    *   Strict `fileSize` limits.
    *   Proper use of `whitelist` (in conjunction with other validation).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure use of Egg.js Context (`ctx`)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_use_of_egg_js_context___ctx__.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **`ctx.state`:** Use `ctx.state` to store user-specific data *securely* within the request context. Avoid storing sensitive data directly in `ctx`. This is an Egg.js-specific mechanism for managing request-scoped data.
    2.  **`ctx.cookies`:** Use `ctx.cookies.set()` with the `httpOnly`, `secure`, and `signed` options to securely manage cookies. This is Egg.js's built-in cookie handling.
    3.  **`ctx.session`:** If using sessions (via `egg-session`), ensure it's configured securely (e.g., using a secure store, setting appropriate cookie options). This relies on Egg.js's session management.
    4. **Avoid `ctx.unsafeXXX` methods:** Be extremely cautious when using any methods on the `ctx` object that are marked as "unsafe" (e.g., avoid if possible). These bypass built-in security protections.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Session Hijacking (High):** Insecure cookie or session management can lead to session hijacking.
    *   **Data Leakage (Medium):** Improper use of `ctx` can expose sensitive data.
    *   **XSS (High):** If data from `ctx` is rendered without proper escaping.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Risk reduced significantly (from High to Low/Negligible).
    *   **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low).
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced (in conjunction with other mitigations).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `ctx` is used, but not always with a focus on security best practices.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of secure cookie options (`httpOnly`, `secure`, `signed`).
    *   Review of session management configuration (if `egg-session` is used).
    *   Avoidance of `ctx.unsafeXXX` methods.
