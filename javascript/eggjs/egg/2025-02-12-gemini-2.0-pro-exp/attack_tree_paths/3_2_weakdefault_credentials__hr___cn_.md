Okay, here's a deep analysis of the "Weak/Default Credentials" attack tree path, tailored for an Egg.js application, presented in Markdown format:

# Deep Analysis: Weak/Default Credentials Attack Path (Egg.js Application)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Weak/Default Credentials" attack path (node 3.2 in the provided attack tree) within the context of an Egg.js application.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, potential consequences, and effective mitigation strategies related to this attack vector.  This analysis will inform development and security practices to minimize the risk of credential-based attacks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following aspects of the "Weak/Default Credentials" attack path:

*   **Egg.js Framework Specifics:** How Egg.js's built-in features, configurations, and common usage patterns might contribute to or mitigate this vulnerability.  This includes examining default configurations, authentication plugins, and best practices.
*   **Application-Level Concerns:**  How the specific application built *using* Egg.js might introduce vulnerabilities related to weak or default credentials. This includes custom authentication logic, user management features, and integration with external services.
*   **Database and Connected Services:**  The potential for weak or default credentials to compromise not only the Egg.js application itself but also any connected databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB), caching systems (e.g., Redis), message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ), or other backend services.
*   **Deployment Environment:**  How the deployment environment (e.g., cloud provider, containerization, server configuration) might expose or exacerbate credential-related vulnerabilities.

This analysis *excludes* broader phishing or social engineering attacks that might trick users into revealing their credentials.  It focuses specifically on the technical aspects of weak or default credentials existing within the system.

## 3. Methodology

This deep analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**
    *   Examine the Egg.js application's codebase for:
        *   Hardcoded credentials (in configuration files, source code, or environment variables).
        *   Custom authentication logic that might be flawed (e.g., weak password validation, improper session management).
        *   Use of default credentials in configuration files or database setup scripts.
        *   Lack of proper error handling that might leak credential information.
    *   Review the usage of Egg.js authentication plugins (e.g., `egg-passport`, `egg-jwt`) to ensure they are configured securely and follow best practices.
    *   Analyze the application's dependency tree for any known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries related to authentication or credential management.

2.  **Configuration Review:**
    *   Inspect all configuration files (e.g., `config/config.default.js`, `config/config.prod.js`, `.env` files) for default or weak credentials.
    *   Examine the configuration of any connected services (databases, caches, etc.) for default or weak credentials.
    *   Review the deployment environment's configuration (e.g., cloud provider settings, container orchestration) for exposed credentials or insecure defaults.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**
    *   Attempt to access the application and connected services using common default credentials (e.g., "admin/admin", "root/password", "test/test").
    *   Perform penetration testing to simulate brute-force and dictionary attacks against the application's authentication endpoints.
    *   Test password reset and recovery mechanisms for vulnerabilities that could allow attackers to bypass authentication.
    *   Use automated vulnerability scanners to identify potential credential-related weaknesses.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**
    *   Identify potential attack scenarios involving weak or default credentials.
    *   Assess the likelihood and impact of each scenario.
    *   Develop mitigation strategies for each identified threat.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3.2 Weak/Default Credentials

**4.1.  Egg.js Framework Specific Considerations:**

*   **`egg-security` Plugin:** Egg.js has a built-in `egg-security` plugin that provides several security features, *but it doesn't directly handle authentication or credential management*.  It's crucial to understand that `egg-security` focuses on things like CSRF protection, XSS prevention, and safe redirects.  It *won't* prevent the use of weak passwords or default credentials.
*   **Authentication Plugins:**  Egg.js relies on plugins for authentication.  Common choices include:
    *   **`egg-passport`:**  A wrapper around the popular Passport.js library.  The security of `egg-passport` depends entirely on the chosen Passport strategy (e.g., local, OAuth, JWT) and its configuration.  Misconfiguration or the use of a weak strategy (e.g., a poorly implemented local strategy with insufficient password hashing) is a major risk.
    *   **`egg-jwt`:**  For JSON Web Token-based authentication.  The security here depends on the strength of the secret key used to sign the tokens, the token expiration policy, and the proper validation of tokens on the server-side.  A weak secret key is a critical vulnerability.
    *   **Custom Authentication:**  Developers might implement their own authentication logic.  This is the *highest risk* area, as custom code is more prone to errors and vulnerabilities than well-vetted libraries.
*   **Configuration Files:**  Egg.js uses a hierarchical configuration system.  It's *critical* to ensure that production configuration files (`config.prod.js`) *override* any default credentials set in `config.default.js`.  A common mistake is to leave default credentials in the default configuration and forget to override them in the production environment.
*   **Database Connections:**  Egg.js applications often connect to databases.  The database connection credentials (username, password, host, port) are typically stored in configuration files.  These credentials *must* be strong and unique.  Using default database credentials (e.g., the default MySQL root password) is a catastrophic vulnerability.
* **ORM:** If ORM is used, like `egg-sequelize`, it is important to check how connection to database is configured and if default credentials are not used.

**4.2. Application-Level Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:**  The most egregious error is hardcoding credentials directly into the application's source code.  This is easily discoverable through code review or if the source code is ever leaked.
*   **Weak Password Policies:**  If the application implements its own user management, it *must* enforce strong password policies.  This includes:
    *   Minimum password length (at least 12 characters, preferably more).
    *   Complexity requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
    *   Password history (preventing reuse of old passwords).
    *   Rate limiting on login attempts (to prevent brute-force attacks).
    *   Account lockout after a certain number of failed login attempts.
*   **Insecure Password Storage:**  Passwords *must never* be stored in plain text.  They must be hashed using a strong, one-way hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt) with a unique, randomly generated salt for each password.  Using weak hashing algorithms (e.g., MD5, SHA1) or failing to use a salt makes the passwords vulnerable to cracking.
*   **Default Admin Accounts:**  The application might create default administrator accounts during setup.  These accounts *must* be disabled or have their passwords changed immediately after installation.
*   **Vulnerable Password Reset Mechanisms:**  Password reset functionality can be a weak point.  Attackers might exploit vulnerabilities in the reset process to gain access to accounts.  Common vulnerabilities include:
    *   Predictable reset tokens.
    *   Lack of email verification.
    *   Insufficient rate limiting on reset requests.
*   **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  MFA adds a significant layer of security by requiring users to provide a second factor of authentication (e.g., a one-time code from an authenticator app or a security key).  The absence of MFA makes the application more vulnerable to credential-based attacks.

**4.3. Database and Connected Services Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Default Database Credentials:**  As mentioned earlier, using default credentials for the database is a critical vulnerability.  Attackers can easily find default credentials for common database systems online.
*   **Weak Database User Permissions:**  The application's database user should have the *minimum necessary privileges*.  Granting excessive privileges (e.g., allowing the application user to create or drop databases) increases the impact of a successful attack.
*   **Other Services:**  Any other services connected to the Egg.js application (e.g., Redis, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch) should also be secured with strong, unique credentials.  Default credentials for these services are often overlooked.

**4.4. Deployment Environment Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Exposed Environment Variables:**  Environment variables are often used to store sensitive information, including credentials.  If the deployment environment is misconfigured, these environment variables might be exposed to unauthorized users.
*   **Insecure Container Images:**  If the application is deployed using containers (e.g., Docker), the container image itself might contain default credentials or sensitive information.  It's crucial to build secure container images and avoid including unnecessary files or credentials.
*   **Cloud Provider Misconfigurations:**  Cloud providers offer a wide range of security features, but they must be configured correctly.  Misconfigurations (e.g., publicly accessible storage buckets, overly permissive IAM roles) can expose credentials or allow attackers to gain access to the application's infrastructure.

**4.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strong Password Policies:** Enforce strong password policies as described above.
*   **Secure Password Storage:** Use strong, one-way hashing algorithms (bcrypt, Argon2, scrypt) with unique salts.
*   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA for all user accounts, especially administrative accounts.
*   **Rate Limiting and Account Lockout:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts and account lockout after a certain number of failed attempts.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Management:** Keep all dependencies (including Egg.js itself and any plugins) up to date to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Secure Configuration Management:** Use a secure configuration management system to store and manage sensitive information, including credentials. Avoid hardcoding credentials.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the minimum necessary privileges to all users and services.
*   **Secure Deployment Practices:** Follow secure deployment practices, including building secure container images, configuring cloud provider security settings correctly, and protecting environment variables.
*   **Education and Training:** Train developers and system administrators on secure coding practices and secure configuration management.
*   **Use of Secret Management Tools:** Utilize secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, or Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage credentials.
*   **Monitor Logs:** Actively monitor application and server logs for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts or unusual access patterns.
