### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3.2.2 Default Database Credentials

**4.1 Vulnerability Research (Egg.js Specifics)**

Egg.js, like many frameworks, relies on configuration files to manage database connections.  The key files are:

*   `config/config.default.js`:  This file contains the default configuration settings.  It *should not* contain production credentials.  It often includes placeholder values or examples.
*   `config/config.local.js`:  This file is intended for local development and *should not* be deployed to production.  It can override settings in `config.default.js`.
*   `config/config.prod.js`:  This file is specifically for the production environment and *must* contain secure, unique credentials.  It overrides settings in both `config.default.js` and `config.local.js`.
*   `config/config.{env}.js`: This file is for specific environment.

The core vulnerability arises when:

*   `config.prod.js` (or the appropriate environment-specific configuration file) is missing, incomplete, or incorrectly configured.  In this case, Egg.js might fall back to the default credentials defined in `config.default.js`.
*   Developers mistakenly commit `config.local.js` (containing default or easily guessable credentials) to the version control system, and this file is accidentally deployed to production.
*   Environment variables intended to override configuration settings are not properly set in the production environment.  Egg.js often allows configuration via environment variables (e.g., `MYSQL_PASSWORD`), which is a good practice, but if these variables are missing, the application might fall back to default values.
* Plugin configuration. Some plugins may have own configuration files.

**4.2 Attack Vector Analysis**

An attacker exploiting this vulnerability would likely follow these steps:

1.  **Reconnaissance:** The attacker identifies the target application as potentially using Egg.js (e.g., by examining HTTP headers, error messages, or known framework-specific URLs).
2.  **Credential Guessing:** The attacker attempts to connect to the application's database using common default credentials for the suspected database type (e.g., `root`/`root`, `admin`/`password`, `test`/`test`).  They might use tools like `mysql` (for MySQL), `psql` (for PostgreSQL), or database-specific clients.
3.  **Access Granted:** If the application is using default credentials, the attacker gains access to the database.
4.  **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** The attacker can now:
    *   Dump the entire database contents (e.g., user data, financial information, sensitive configuration).
    *   Modify data (e.g., change user roles, create new administrator accounts, inject malicious data).
    *   Delete data, causing a denial-of-service (DoS).
5.  **Potential RCE (Remote Code Execution):**  Depending on the database type and configuration, the attacker might be able to achieve RCE.  For example:
    *   **MySQL:**  The attacker might be able to use the `INTO OUTFILE` or `LOAD DATA INFILE` statements to write files to the server's filesystem or read arbitrary files.  If they can write a PHP file to a web-accessible directory, they can achieve RCE.  They might also be able to exploit vulnerabilities in user-defined functions (UDFs).
    *   **PostgreSQL:**  The attacker might be able to use the `COPY` command to read or write files.  They might also be able to exploit vulnerabilities in extensions or procedural languages.
    *   **MongoDB:** While RCE is less direct, an attacker with full database access could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code that gets executed by the application.

**4.3 Impact Assessment**

The impact is **Very High**:

*   **Data Breach:**  Complete compromise of all data stored in the database.  This could include personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, intellectual property, and other sensitive information.  This can lead to legal and financial repercussions, reputational damage, and loss of customer trust.
*   **Data Modification:**  The attacker can alter data, leading to incorrect application behavior, financial fraud, or the spread of misinformation.
*   **Denial of Service:**  The attacker can delete data or disrupt database operations, making the application unavailable to users.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  In some cases, the attacker can gain full control of the server, allowing them to install malware, steal other data, or use the server for further attacks.

**4.4 Likelihood Assessment**

The likelihood is **Medium**:

*   **Ease of Exploitation:**  Exploiting default credentials is very easy, requiring minimal technical skill.  Numerous tools and scripts are available to automate this process.
*   **Prevalence of Vulnerability:**  While awareness of this issue is growing, default credentials are still a common problem, especially in smaller or less experienced development teams.  Misconfigurations and accidental deployments of development configurations happen.
*   **Attacker Motivation:**  Databases are high-value targets for attackers, as they often contain valuable data that can be sold or used for malicious purposes.

**4.5 Mitigation Strategies**

1.  **Never Use Default Credentials in Production:** This is the most crucial step.  Always generate strong, unique passwords for all database users in the production environment.
2.  **Use Environment Variables:** Store database credentials (and other sensitive configuration) in environment variables, *not* directly in configuration files.  This makes it easier to manage credentials securely and prevents them from being accidentally committed to version control.  Egg.js supports this approach.
3.  **Proper Configuration File Management:**
    *   Ensure that `config.prod.js` (or the appropriate environment-specific file) exists and contains the correct, secure credentials.
    *   *Never* commit `config.local.js` or any file containing development credentials to the production environment.  Use `.gitignore` to prevent this.
    *   Verify that the correct configuration file is being loaded in the production environment.
4.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Create database users with the minimum necessary privileges.  Don't use the `root` or `admin` user for the application's database connection.  Grant only the specific permissions (e.g., `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) that the application needs.
5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including default credentials.
6.  **Automated Configuration Management:** Use tools like Ansible, Chef, Puppet, or Docker to automate the deployment and configuration of the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistent and secure configurations.
7.  **Database-Specific Security Measures:**
    *   **MySQL:** Disable remote access to the `root` user.  Consider using the `mysql_secure_installation` script.
    *   **PostgreSQL:** Configure `pg_hba.conf` to restrict database access based on IP address and authentication method.
    *   **MongoDB:** Enable authentication and authorization.  Use strong passwords and consider using client certificate authentication.
8. **Plugin configuration:** Check all used plugins and their configuration.

**4.6 Detection Methods**

1.  **Configuration Review:** Manually inspect the Egg.js configuration files (especially `config.prod.js` and any environment-specific files) to ensure that no default credentials are being used.
2.  **Automated Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners (e.g., Nessus, OpenVAS, OWASP ZAP) to scan the application and its infrastructure for default credentials.
3.  **Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration tests to simulate real-world attacks and identify vulnerabilities, including default credentials.
4.  **Database Auditing:** Enable database auditing to log all database connections and queries.  This can help detect unauthorized access attempts.
5.  **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Deploy an IDS to monitor network traffic and detect suspicious activity, such as attempts to connect to the database using common default credentials.
6.  **Log Monitoring:** Monitor application and database logs for suspicious activity, such as failed login attempts or unusual queries.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

Using default database credentials is a critical security vulnerability that can lead to complete compromise of an Egg.js application and its data.  The mitigation strategies outlined above are essential for protecting the application.  The development team should prioritize:

*   **Immediate Action:**  Verify that no default credentials are being used in the production environment.  If found, change them immediately.
*   **Configuration Management:** Implement a robust configuration management system using environment variables and secure deployment practices.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Incorporate security audits and penetration testing into the development lifecycle.
*   **Training:**  Educate the development team about secure coding practices and the risks of default credentials.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this vulnerability and protect the application and its users from potential attacks.
