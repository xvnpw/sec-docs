## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Plugin Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_plugin_vulnerability.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers target vulnerabilities within third-party plugins used by the Egg.js application.
- Critical Node: Malicious Plugin
    - Description: An attacker tricks developers into installing a plugin that is intentionally designed to be malicious, providing direct access or backdoors into the application.
- Critical Node: Send Malicious Input to Plugin Endpoint/Function (potential RCE)
    - Description: Once a vulnerable plugin is identified (either outdated or malicious), the attacker crafts and sends specific malicious input to trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the Egg.js application handles configuration data.
- Critical Node: Configuration Injection (potential RCE)
    - Description: Attackers inject malicious values into configuration settings (e.g., via environment variables) that are then used in a way that allows code execution, such as using a configuration value in a `require()` statement.
- Critical Node: Sensitive Information Exposure in Configuration
    - Description: Attackers gain access to configuration files or data that contain sensitive information.
    - Critical Node: Extract Sensitive Data (API Keys, Database Credentials)
        - Description: Successful access to configuration allows attackers to extract critical secrets like API keys and database credentials, which can be used for further attacks on other systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Extend Mechanism Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_extend_mechanism_vulnerabilities.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers abuse the Egg.js extension mechanism to inject malicious code or overwrite core functionalities.
- Critical Node: Inject Malicious Code via `app.extend` (potential RCE)
    - Description: Attackers find a way to influence the arguments passed to `app.extend`, injecting malicious code that gets executed within the application's context, leading to potential RCE.
- Critical Node: Overwrite Core Functionality with Malicious Extensions
    - Description: Attackers define extensions with the same names as core Egg.js functions, causing the application to use the malicious versions, allowing them to control critical parts of the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Unhandled Promise Rejections Leading to Denial of Service](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_unhandled_promise_rejections_leading_to_denial_of_service.md)

- Attack Vector: Attackers trigger operations that result in unhandled promise rejections, causing the Egg.js application to crash or become unresponsive.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Egg.js Application](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_egg_js_application.md)

- Description: This is the root goal, representing the successful breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Access and Modify Context Properties](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_access_and_modify_context_properties.md)

- Description: Attackers find a way to access and modify the `ctx` object outside of its intended scope, allowing them to manipulate sensitive request or session data, potentially leading to privilege escalation or session hijacking.
- Critical Node: Modify sensitive properties (e.g., user information, session data)
    - Description: Successful access to the `ctx` object allows attackers to directly alter critical information like user roles or session identifiers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise the Agent Process](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_the_agent_process.md)

- Description: Attackers target the separate agent process used by Egg.js for background tasks.
- Critical Node: Inject malicious commands or data to the agent
    - Description: By exploiting vulnerabilities in the communication with the agent process, attackers can inject malicious commands or data, potentially disrupting application functionality or gaining further access.
