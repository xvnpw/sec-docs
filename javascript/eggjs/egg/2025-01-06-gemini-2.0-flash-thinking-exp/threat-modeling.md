# Threat Model Analysis for eggjs/egg

## Threat: [Route Hijacking or Manipulation through Malicious Middleware](./threats/route_hijacking_or_manipulation_through_malicious_middleware.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains the ability to inject or modify middleware could intercept requests before they reach the intended controller. They could then alter the request path, parameters, headers, or even the response, potentially bypassing authentication or authorization checks or injecting malicious content.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of application logic, unauthorized access, data manipulation, injection of malicious scripts.

**Which `egg` component is affected:** `egg-core`'s Middleware loading and execution pipeline.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly control access to the application's codebase and deployment pipeline to prevent unauthorized middleware injection.
*   Carefully review and vet all custom middleware for potential vulnerabilities.
*   Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of middleware files.
*   Utilize Egg.js's built-in middleware ordering and configuration to ensure critical security middleware runs correctly.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker could gain access to configuration files (`config/config.*.js`) which might contain sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, or internal service URLs. This could occur due to misconfigured file permissions, insecure storage, or accidental exposure through version control.

**Impact:** Full compromise of backend systems, unauthorized access to databases or external services, ability to impersonate the application.

**Which `egg` component is affected:** `egg-core`'s Configuration loading mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store sensitive configuration data securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
*   Ensure proper file permissions on configuration files, restricting access to authorized users only.
*   Avoid committing sensitive configuration data directly into version control.
*   Utilize Egg.js's configuration merging and environment-specific configuration to manage secrets effectively.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection or Manipulation via Environment Variables](./threats/configuration_injection_or_manipulation_via_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on environment variables for configuration without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker who can control the environment (e.g., in a compromised container or server) could inject malicious configuration values, altering application behavior or compromising security.

**Impact:**  Code execution, privilege escalation, denial of service, or other malicious actions depending on the configurable parameters.

**Which `egg` component is affected:** `egg-core`'s Configuration loading mechanism, specifically how it handles environment variables.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any environment variables used for configuration.
*   Restrict the ability to modify environment variables in production environments.
*   Use a dedicated configuration management system that provides better control and security.

## Threat: [Malicious or Backdoored Middleware or Plugins](./threats/malicious_or_backdoored_middleware_or_plugins.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trick developers into installing malicious or backdoored middleware or plugins. These components could contain code designed to steal data, create backdoors, or perform other malicious activities.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying infrastructure.

**Which `egg` component is affected:** `egg-core`'s Plugin and Middleware loading mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only install middleware and plugins from trusted sources.
*   Verify the integrity and authenticity of downloaded packages.
*   Be cautious when using community-developed or less well-known plugins.
*   Implement code review processes for any added middleware or plugins.
