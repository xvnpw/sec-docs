# Attack Surface Analysis for eggjs/egg

## Attack Surface: [Unintended Route Exposure](./attack_surfaces/unintended_route_exposure.md)

**Description:** Internal application endpoints or functionalities, not intended for public access, are reachable due to misconfigured routing.

**How Egg Contributes:** Egg.js's flexible routing system, if not carefully configured in `router.js` or through plugins, can lead to unintentional exposure of sensitive endpoints. Complex or dynamic route definitions without proper access controls exacerbate this.

**Example:** An administrative API endpoint `/admin/users/delete` is defined in `router.js` without any authentication middleware, making it accessible to anyone.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, administrative functions, or internal application logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only define routes necessary for public access in `router.js`.
*   **Explicit Route Definitions:** Avoid overly broad or wildcard routes.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Middleware:**  Utilize Egg.js's middleware capabilities to implement authentication and authorization checks for sensitive routes.
*   **Regular Route Review:** Periodically review `router.js` and plugin route configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within custom or third-party middleware used in the Egg.js application's request pipeline.

**How Egg Contributes:** Egg.js's middleware architecture allows developers to extend the framework's functionality. Vulnerabilities in these middleware components directly impact the application's security context within the Egg.js request lifecycle.

**Example:** A custom authentication middleware has a flaw that allows bypassing authentication checks by manipulating request headers.

**Impact:**  A wide range of vulnerabilities depending on the middleware's function, including code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Thoroughly Vet Third-Party Middleware:** Carefully evaluate the security of third-party middleware before use.
*   **Secure Coding Practices for Custom Middleware:** Implement robust input validation, output encoding, and error handling in custom middleware.
*   **Middleware Audits:** Regularly audit custom middleware code for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Exposure](./attack_surfaces/configuration_exposure.md)

**Description:** Sensitive configuration information, such as database credentials or API keys, is inadvertently exposed.

**How Egg Contributes:** Egg.js uses configuration files (`config/config.default.js`, environment-specific files) and the `app.config` object. Misconfigurations in static file serving (handled by Egg.js's underlying Koa) or inadequate access controls can lead to exposure.

**Example:** The `.env` file containing database credentials is accidentally placed in the `public` directory, making it accessible via a direct URL served by Egg.js's static file handling.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and its associated resources.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Configuration Storage:** Store sensitive configuration information securely, preferably using environment variables or dedicated secret management tools, not directly in configuration files.
*   **Restrict Access to Configuration Files:** Ensure configuration files are not accessible through static file serving.
*   **Utilize Environment-Specific Configurations:** Leverage Egg.js's environment-specific configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities exist within third-party plugins used by the Egg.js application.

**How Egg Contributes:** Egg.js's plugin system inherently introduces dependencies on external codebases. Vulnerabilities within these plugins directly impact the security of the Egg.js application.

**Example:** A popular authentication plugin used in the Egg.js application has a known vulnerability allowing authentication bypass.

**Impact:** Depends on the vulnerability within the plugin, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or other security issues.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Careful Plugin Selection:** Choose plugins from reputable sources with active maintenance and a good security track record.
*   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Audits of Plugins:** Consider security audits for critical or less common plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient CSRF Protection](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_csrf_protection.md)

**Description:** The application is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks due to disabled or misconfigured CSRF protection.

**How Egg Contributes:** Egg.js provides built-in CSRF protection via middleware. Disabling this middleware or improperly configuring it leaves the application vulnerable to CSRF attacks.

**Example:**  The `csrf` middleware is not enabled globally or for specific routes handling sensitive form submissions, allowing attackers to forge requests.

**Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of legitimate users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Enable and Configure CSRF Protection:** Ensure Egg.js's CSRF protection middleware is enabled and correctly configured.
*   **Utilize `ctx.csrf` Token:**  Properly integrate the CSRF token into forms and AJAX requests as recommended by Egg.js.
*   **Avoid GET Requests for State-Changing Operations:** Use POST, PUT, or DELETE requests for actions that modify data.
