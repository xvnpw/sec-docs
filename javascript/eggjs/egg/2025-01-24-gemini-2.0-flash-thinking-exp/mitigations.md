## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Configuration Management with Egg.js Configuration Structure](./mitigation_strategies/secure_configuration_management_with_egg_js_configuration_structure.md)

### Mitigation Strategy: Secure Configuration Management with Egg.js Configuration Structure

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage Egg.js Configuration Files:** Utilize Egg.js's configuration file structure (`config/config.default.js`, `config/config.prod.js`, etc.) to manage application settings.
    2.  **Environment Variables for Sensitive Data:**  Store sensitive configuration parameters (like database credentials, API keys) as environment variables and access them via `app.config` in your Egg.js application. This prevents hardcoding secrets in configuration files.
    3.  **Environment-Specific Configuration:**  Use environment-specific configuration files (e.g., `config/config.prod.js` for production) to tailor settings for different deployment environments without modifying core configuration.
    4.  **Configuration Validation (Custom):** Implement custom validation logic within your Egg.js configuration files or application startup to ensure required configuration parameters are present and valid.
    5.  **Restrict Access to Configuration Files:** Ensure configuration files are not publicly accessible and are protected with appropriate file system permissions on the server.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Credentials:** [High Severity] - Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive credentials if configuration files are compromised, leaked, or accidentally committed to version control by using environment variables.
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities:** [Medium Severity] - Reduces the risk of application errors and potential security issues arising from missing or invalid configuration parameters through validation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Sensitive Credentials:** [High Reduction] - Significantly reduces the risk of credential exposure by separating them from code and configuration files using environment variables accessed via `app.config`.
    *   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities:** [Medium Reduction] - Reduces the likelihood of misconfigurations leading to vulnerabilities through validation and structured configuration management.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Database credentials are managed via environment variables, but some API keys are still in configuration files. Configuration validation is not formally implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Migrate all API keys and other secrets from configuration files to environment variables, leveraging `app.config` for access.
    *   Implement configuration validation within `config/config.default.js` or application startup to check for required parameters.
    *   Review file system permissions for configuration files on the server to ensure restricted access.
