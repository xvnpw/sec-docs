# Threat Model Analysis for eggjs/egg

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

**Description:** An attacker convinces a developer to install a seemingly benign but actually malicious Egg.js plugin. This plugin could contain code to steal sensitive data (e.g., environment variables, database credentials), inject backdoors for persistent access, or manipulate application logic *by leveraging Egg.js's plugin loading mechanism*. The attacker might achieve this through social engineering, compromised plugin repositories, or by creating a plugin with a similar name to a popular one.

**Impact:** Full application compromise, data breach, unauthorized access to resources, potential for further attacks on connected systems.

**Affected Component:** `egg-core` (plugin loading mechanism).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party plugins before installation.
*   Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
*   Implement a process for reviewing plugin code and dependencies.
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in plugin dependencies.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Configuration Data](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

**Description:** Egg.js configuration files (e.g., `config/config.default.js`, environment-specific files) contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or secret tokens. If *Egg.js's configuration loading mechanism* doesn't prevent these files from being accessible through the web server or if developers incorrectly commit them to public repositories, attackers can gain access to this information.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to databases, external services, and potential full system compromise depending on the exposed credentials.

**Affected Component:** `egg-core` (configuration loading mechanism).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store sensitive configuration data in environment variables or secure vault solutions instead of directly in configuration files.
*   Ensure configuration files are not accessible through the web server (e.g., through proper `.gitignore` and web server configuration).
*   Implement proper access controls on configuration files on the server.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/configuration_injection_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

**Description:** If *Egg.js's configuration loading process* allows external input to influence it in an unsafe manner, an attacker might be able to inject malicious configuration values that lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server. This could involve manipulating how modules are loaded or how certain configuration options are interpreted *by Egg.js*.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, ability to execute arbitrary commands, install malware, and steal data.

**Affected Component:** `egg-core` (configuration loading mechanism).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid allowing external input to directly influence the configuration loading process.
*   Sanitize and validate any external input that might indirectly affect configuration.
*   Implement strict access controls on configuration files and directories.

## Threat: [Middleware Execution Order Vulnerability](./threats/middleware_execution_order_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** The order in which middleware is executed in Egg.js is crucial. If *Egg.js's middleware pipeline* is not configured correctly, attackers might be able to bypass security checks. For example, authentication middleware might be executed after a middleware that handles requests, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data and functionality, potentially leading to further exploitation.

**Affected Component:** `egg-core` (middleware pipeline).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully plan and define the order of middleware execution.
*   Thoroughly test the middleware pipeline to ensure the correct execution order and that security checks are performed before sensitive operations.
*   Document the intended middleware execution order.

## Threat: [Insecure Communication Between Agent and Application Processes](./threats/insecure_communication_between_agent_and_application_processes.md)

**Description:** Egg.js separates the application and agent processes. If *Egg.js's internal communication channel* between these processes is not secured, attackers might be able to intercept or manipulate messages exchanged between them. This could potentially allow them to control the application or gain access to sensitive information.

**Impact:** Application compromise, data manipulation, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `egg` framework's internal communication mechanisms between agent and application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure secure communication channels between the agent and application processes (e.g., using secure sockets or other encrypted communication methods).
*   Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms for communication between these processes.
*   Avoid transmitting sensitive information over unencrypted channels.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Built-in Egg.js Services or Helpers](./threats/vulnerability_in_built-in_egg_js_services_or_helpers.md)

**Description:**  A security vulnerability is discovered in a core Egg.js service or helper function. Attackers can exploit this vulnerability in applications that utilize the affected functionality *provided by Egg.js*. This could be a bug in a utility function, a security flaw in a built-in service, or an oversight in how certain features are implemented within the framework.

**Impact:** Widespread impact across applications using the vulnerable feature, potentially leading to various security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable built-in service or helper function within `egg`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the nature and impact of the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Stay updated with the latest Egg.js releases and security patches.
*   Monitor for reported vulnerabilities in the Egg.js framework itself through official channels and security advisories.
*   Contribute to the Egg.js community by reporting any potential vulnerabilities found.
