## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Egg.js Application](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_egg_js_application.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to the application, its data, or its underlying infrastructure.
*   **Why Critical:** Represents the highest level objective. All subsequent paths lead to this goal. Failure to protect against these paths directly results in application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Egg.js Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_egg_js_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Focuses on exploiting weaknesses inherent to the Egg.js framework and its ecosystem, rather than general web application vulnerabilities.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Egg.js applications rely heavily on plugins, middleware, and specific configurations. Vulnerabilities in these areas are often directly exploitable and can have a significant impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Targets vulnerabilities within Egg.js plugins. Plugins are third-party code and can introduce security risks if not properly managed.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **High Likelihood:** Plugins are often developed and maintained by external parties, and may not undergo the same level of security scrutiny as core framework code. Outdated or poorly written plugins are common.
    *   **High Impact:** Plugin vulnerabilities can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), and other severe attacks, potentially compromising the entire application.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Vulnerable Plugin Code:**
            *   **Attack Scenario:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated or poorly coded plugins. For example, a plugin using a vulnerable version of a library or containing insecure coding practices.
            *   **Actionable Insights:**
                *   **Regular Plugin Audits:**  Maintain an inventory of plugins and regularly check for updates and security advisories.
                *   **Plugin Vulnerability Scanning:** Implement automated tools to scan plugins for known vulnerabilities during development and deployment.
                *   **Choose Reputable Plugins:** Favor plugins from trusted sources with active maintenance and a strong security track record.

        *   **Plugin Configuration Vulnerabilities:**
            *   **Attack Scenario:** Misconfiguring plugin settings to expose sensitive data or create security loopholes. For example, a logging plugin configured to log sensitive user data in plain text.
            *   **Actionable Insights:**
                *   **Careful Configuration Review:** Thoroughly review plugin documentation and configuration options. Understand the security implications of each setting.
                *   **Least Privilege Principle:** Configure plugins with the minimum necessary permissions and access.

        *   **Plugin Supply Chain Attacks:**
            *   **Attack Scenario:**  Compromise of a plugin's npm package repository leading to the injection of malicious code into plugin updates.
            *   **Actionable Insights:**
                *   **Dependency Lock Files:** Use `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` to ensure consistent dependency versions and prevent unexpected updates.
                *   **Dependency Monitoring:** Monitor dependencies for suspicious changes or security alerts using tools like Snyk or GitHub Dependabot.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Targets vulnerabilities within Egg.js middleware, both custom and built-in. Middleware handles request processing and is a critical component for security.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **High Likelihood (Custom Middleware):** Custom middleware, written by application developers, is prone to coding errors and security vulnerabilities if not developed with security in mind.
    *   **High Impact:** Middleware vulnerabilities, especially in authentication or authorization middleware, can lead to complete bypass of security controls, unauthorized access, and data breaches.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Custom Middleware Vulnerabilities:**
            *   **Attack Scenario:** Introducing vulnerabilities in custom middleware logic, such as authentication bypasses, authorization flaws, or data leakage due to insecure coding practices. For example, flawed session management or improper input validation in custom middleware.
            *   **Actionable Insights:**
                *   **Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding principles when developing custom middleware, focusing on input validation, output encoding, authentication, and authorization.
                *   **Thorough Testing:** Implement rigorous testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and security-focused tests (penetration testing, code reviews) for custom middleware.

        *   **Middleware Ordering Issues:**
            *   **Attack Scenario:** Incorrect order of middleware execution leading to security bypasses. For example, placing authentication middleware after a vulnerable route handler.
            *   **Actionable Insights:**
                *   **Careful Middleware Ordering:**  Plan and define middleware order meticulously, ensuring security middleware executes *before* route handlers and other processing middleware.
                *   **Test Middleware Interactions:** Test the interaction of middleware components to verify the intended security flow and policy enforcement.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Targets vulnerabilities arising from misconfigurations in Egg.js applications, particularly related to sensitive data and security settings.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **High Likelihood:** Configuration errors are common, especially in complex applications or when security configurations are not well understood.
    *   **High Impact:** Misconfigurations can directly expose sensitive data, disable security features, and create easily exploitable vulnerabilities.

    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Sensitive Data Exposure in Configuration:**
            *   **Attack Scenario:** Exposing sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or secrets directly in configuration files (e.g., `config.default.js`, `config.local.js`), especially if these files are accidentally committed to public repositories.
            *   **Actionable Insights:**
                *   **Environment Variables:**  Utilize environment variables to store sensitive configuration data instead of hardcoding them in configuration files.
                *   **Avoid Committing Sensitive Data:**  Never commit sensitive data to version control. Use `.gitignore` to exclude configuration files containing secrets.
                *   **Configuration Management Tools:** Employ secure configuration management tools for production environments to manage and access secrets securely.

        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Misconfigured Security Settings:**
            *   **Attack Scenario:** Incorrectly configuring or disabling Egg.js security features provided by plugins like `egg-security`, such as CSRF protection, XSS protection, or HSTS.
            *   **Actionable Insights:**
                *   **Review Security Configurations:** Thoroughly review the documentation for `egg-security` and other security-related configurations. Understand the purpose and implications of each setting.
                *   **Follow Security Best Practices:** Enable and properly configure security features according to web security best practices.
                *   **Security Audits of Configuration:** Periodically audit application configurations to ensure security settings are correctly applied and aligned with security policies.
