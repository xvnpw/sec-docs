# IDENTITY and PURPOSE

You are an expert in software, cloud and cybersecurity architecture. You specialize in creating clear, well written design documents of systems, projects and components.

# GOAL

Given a GITHUB REPOSITORY, provide a well written, detailed project design document that will be use later for threat modelling.

# STEPS

- Think deeply about the input and what they are concerned with.

- Using your expertise, think about what they should be concerned with, even if they haven't mentioned it.

- Appreciate the fact that each company is different. Fresh startup can have bigger risk appetite then already established Fortune 500 company.

- Take the input provided and create a section called BUSINESS POSTURE, determine what are business priorities and goals that idea or project is trying to solve. Give most important business risks that need to be addressed based on priorities and goals.

- Under that, create a section called SECURITY POSTURE, identify and list all existing security controls, and accepted risks for project. Focus on secure software development lifecycle and deployment model. Prefix security controls with 'security control', accepted risk with 'accepted risk'. Withing this section provide list of recommended security controls, that you think are high priority to implement and wasn't mention in input. Under that but still in SECURITY POSTURE section provide list of security requirements that are important for idea or project in question. Include topics: authentication, authorization, input validation, cryptography. For each existing security control point out, where it's implemented or described.

- Under that, create a section called DESIGN. Use that section to provide well written, detailed design document including diagram.

- In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTEXT and provide mermaid graph that will represent a project context diagram showing project as a box in the centre, surrounded by its users and the other systems/projects that it interacts with.

- Under that, in C4 CONTEXT subsection, create list that will describe elements of context diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called C4 CONTAINER and provide mermaid graph that will represent a container diagram. In case project is very simple - containers diagram might be only extension of C4 CONTEXT diagram. In case project is more complex it should show the high-level shape of the architecture and how responsibilities are distributed across it. It also shows the major technology choices and how the containers communicate with one another.

- Under that, in C4 CONTAINER subsection, create list that will describe elements of container diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called DEPLOYMENT and provide information how project is deployed into target environment. Project might be deployed into multiply different deployment architectures. First list all possible solutions and pick one to descried in details. Include mermaid graph to visualize deployment. A deployment diagram allows to illustrate how instances of software systems and/or containers in the static model are deployed on to the infrastructure within a given deployment environment.

- Under that, in DEPLOYMENT subsection, create list that will describe elements of deployment diagram. For each element include sublist with: 1. Name - name of element; 2. Type - type of element; 3. Description - description of element; 4. Responsibilities - responsibilities of element; 5. Security controls - security controls that will be implemented by element.

- Under that, In DESIGN section, create subsection called BUILD and provide information how project is build and publish. Focus on security controls of build process, e.g. supply chain security, build automation, security checks during build, e.g. SAST scanners, linters, etc. Project can be vary, some might not have any automated build system and some can use CI environments like GitHub Workflows, Jankins, and others. Include diagram that will illustrate build process, starting with developer and ending in build artifacts.

- Under that, create a section called RISK ASSESSMENT, and answer following questions: What are critical business process we are trying to protect? What data we are trying to protect and what is their sensitivity?

- Under that, create a section called QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS, list questions that you have and the default assumptions regarding BUSINESS POSTURE, SECURITY POSTURE and DESIGN.

# INPUT:

GITHUB REPOSITORY: https://github.com/eggjs/egg

# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Egg.js aims to provide a robust and scalable Node.js framework for building enterprise-grade web applications and APIs.
 - It prioritizes developer productivity through convention over configuration and a plugin-based architecture.
 - It targets enterprise environments requiring stability, maintainability, and extensibility.
 - A key goal is to enable rapid development and deployment of web applications while adhering to best practices.

- Business Risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to widespread application security issues, impacting user trust and business operations.
 - Performance bottlenecks in the framework could negatively affect application responsiveness and user experience.
 - Lack of maintainability or backward compatibility could increase development and maintenance costs for applications built on Egg.js.
 - Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies could compromise applications using Egg.js.
 - Open-source licensing and community support risks need to be considered for long-term project viability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning is likely performed as part of the development process, although not explicitly documented in the provided repository. (Location: assumed in standard Node.js development practices)
 - security control: Regular updates to dependencies are likely practiced to address known vulnerabilities. (Location: assumed in standard Node.js development practices)
 - security control: Code review processes are likely in place for contributions to the framework. (Location: assumed in standard open-source project practices)
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security patches and vulnerability disclosures introduces a potential delay in response time compared to commercial frameworks with dedicated security teams.
 - accepted risk: Open-source nature implies public disclosure of vulnerabilities, potentially increasing the window of opportunity for exploitation before patches are widely adopted.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities in the framework code.
 - security control: Introduce Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) for integration tests to assess runtime security aspects of applications built with Egg.js.
 - security control: Establish a clear security vulnerability reporting and disclosure policy to facilitate responsible disclosure from the community.
 - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing or security audits of the framework by external security experts.
 - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for developers using Egg.js to build secure applications.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Applications built with Egg.js should be able to implement various authentication mechanisms (e.g., session-based, token-based, OAuth).
  - The framework should provide utilities or middleware to simplify authentication implementation.
  - Secure handling of authentication credentials (e.g., passwords, API keys) is crucial.
 - Authorization:
  - Applications should be able to implement fine-grained authorization controls to manage user access to resources and functionalities.
  - The framework should offer mechanisms for defining and enforcing authorization policies.
  - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) should be considered.
 - Input Validation:
  - The framework should encourage or enforce input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection.
  - Input validation should be applied to all data sources, including user inputs, API requests, and external data.
  - Sanitization and encoding of outputs should be implemented to mitigate output-based vulnerabilities.
 - Cryptography:
  - The framework should support secure cryptographic operations for data protection and secure communication.
  - Usage of well-vetted cryptographic libraries and algorithms is essential.
  - Proper key management practices should be followed for encryption keys.
  - Secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS) should be enforced by default or easily configurable.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - For Egg.js framework itself: Maintaining the integrity and availability of the framework to enable developers to build and run applications.
 - For applications built with Egg.js: The critical business processes depend on the specific application. Examples include e-commerce transactions, user authentication, data processing, and API services. The framework's security directly impacts the security of these processes.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - For Egg.js framework itself: Source code, build artifacts, and developer credentials. Sensitivity: High (source code confidentiality and integrity are crucial).
 - For applications built with Egg.js: Data sensitivity depends on the application. It can range from publicly accessible data to highly sensitive personal data, financial data, or intellectual property. The framework should facilitate secure handling of sensitive data.
