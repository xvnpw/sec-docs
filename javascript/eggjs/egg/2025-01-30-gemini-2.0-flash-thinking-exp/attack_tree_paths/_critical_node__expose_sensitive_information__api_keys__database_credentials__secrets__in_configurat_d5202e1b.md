#### 4.7. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate the risk of exposing sensitive information in Egg.js configuration files, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Never Commit Sensitive Data to Version Control:**
    *   **Utilize `.gitignore`:**  Ensure that configuration files containing secrets (e.g., `config.local.js`, environment-specific files) are added to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being committed to version control.
    *   **Code Reviews:** Implement mandatory code reviews to catch accidental inclusion of sensitive data in commits.
    *   **Developer Training:** Educate developers on secure coding practices and the importance of not committing secrets to version control.
*   **Use Environment Variables for Secrets:**
    *   **Egg.js Environment Configuration:** Leverage Egg.js's support for environment variables to configure sensitive settings. Access environment variables using `process.env` within configuration files or application code.
    *   **Containerization and Orchestration:** In containerized environments (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), utilize container orchestration features to inject secrets as environment variables at runtime.
*   **Implement Secure Secret Management Solutions:**
    *   **Dedicated Secret Vaults:** Integrate with dedicated secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager, or Doppler to securely store, access, and rotate secrets.
    *   **Configuration Management Tools:** Utilize configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage configurations and secrets securely across environments.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    *   **Restrict File System Access:**  Implement strict file system permissions to limit access to configuration files to only necessary processes and users.
