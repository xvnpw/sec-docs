# Attack Surface Analysis for chartjs/chart.js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_injection.md)

**Description:** The application renders charts using data sourced from potentially untrusted origins. If this data is not properly sanitized, it can be interpreted by the browser in unintended ways when rendered by Chart.js.

**How Chart.js Contributes:** Chart.js takes the provided data and renders it within the HTML canvas. If that data contains malicious scripts or HTML, the browser might execute it.

**Example:** An attacker provides a malicious label like `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`. When Chart.js renders this label, the browser executes the JavaScript, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.

**Impact:** Potentially leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the website.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Server-Side Sanitization:** Sanitize all data received from untrusted sources before passing it to Chart.js, including HTML encoding or escaping special characters.
* **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Ensure data is encoded appropriately for the context in which it's being used within Chart.js (e.g., HTML escaping for labels).
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Injection](./attack_surfaces/configuration_injection.md)

**Description:** Chart.js options and configuration settings are dynamically generated or influenced by user input or other potentially attacker-controlled data without proper validation.

**How Chart.js Contributes:** Chart.js allows extensive customization through its configuration object. If parts of this object are built using unsanitized input, attackers can inject malicious configurations.

**Example:** The application allows users to customize tooltip content. An attacker injects JavaScript code within the tooltip format string. When the tooltip is displayed, this injected JavaScript is executed.

**Impact:** Can lead to XSS if malicious JavaScript is injected into formatters within the configuration.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Validate and Sanitize Configuration Input:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user input or external data that influences Chart.js configuration options.
* **Use Whitelisting for Configuration Options:** If possible, use a whitelist approach to define allowed configuration values and reject anything outside of that list.
* **Avoid Dynamic Generation of Sensitive Configuration:** Minimize the dynamic generation of sensitive configuration parts like custom formatters based on user input.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Using an outdated version of Chart.js can expose the application to known security vulnerabilities.

**How Chart.js Contributes:** By including the vulnerable library in the application, the application inherits any security flaws present in that version of Chart.js.

**Example:** A known XSS vulnerability exists in an older version of Chart.js. By using this version, the application becomes vulnerable to this specific type of attack.

**Impact:** Can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on the specific flaw in the outdated library, including XSS or other client-side code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Regularly Update Chart.js:** Keep Chart.js updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
* **Monitor for Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security vulnerabilities reported for Chart.js.
* **Use Dependency Management Tools:** Utilize tools that help manage and track dependencies and identify potential vulnerabilities.
