## Deep Analysis: Leverage Callback Functions [CRITICAL] - Chart.js

**Context:** This analysis focuses on a critical vulnerability path identified within an attack tree analysis for an application utilizing the Chart.js library (specifically from the `https://github.com/chartjs/chart.js` repository). The identified path involves the exploitation of callback functions within Chart.js to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code.

**Severity:** **CRITICAL**

**Risk:** **HIGH**

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Vector:**

Chart.js provides a high degree of customization through its configuration options. A key aspect of this customization lies in the ability to define callback functions for various events and functionalities. These callbacks allow developers to dynamically alter chart behavior based on user interactions or data changes. However, this flexibility introduces a significant security risk if not handled carefully.

**The Vulnerability:**

The core of the vulnerability lies in the potential for **unsanitized user input or attacker-controlled data to be passed directly into these callback functions**. If an application constructs Chart.js configuration objects using data originating from untrusted sources (e.g., URL parameters, form fields, database records without proper sanitization), an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within the string values intended for these callbacks.

**How it Works:**

1. **Attacker Identification:** The attacker identifies areas in the application where Chart.js is used and where user input or external data influences the chart configuration. They specifically look for configuration options that accept function definitions as strings.

2. **Malicious Payload Crafting:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload. This payload can range from simple `alert()` calls to more sophisticated scripts designed to:
    * **Steal sensitive data:** Access and exfiltrate cookies, local storage, or other application data.
    * **Perform actions on behalf of the user:** Submit forms, make API calls, or modify user settings.
    * **Redirect the user to a malicious site:** Initiate phishing attacks or distribute malware.
    * **Deface the application:** Alter the visual appearance or functionality of the chart or surrounding page.
    * **Launch cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks:** Inject further malicious scripts into the DOM, potentially affecting other users.

3. **Injection:** The attacker injects this malicious payload into the application's data flow, targeting the Chart.js configuration. This could happen through:
    * **Manipulating URL parameters:**  If the chart configuration is influenced by query parameters.
    * **Submitting malicious form data:** If user input is directly used in the chart configuration.
    * **Compromising a data source:** If the application fetches chart data from a compromised database or API.

4. **Execution:** When Chart.js renders the chart and processes the configuration, it interprets the string containing the malicious JavaScript as a function definition. When the event associated with that callback is triggered (e.g., a tooltip is shown, a bar is clicked, an animation completes), the injected JavaScript code is executed within the user's browser context.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a scenario where an application displays a bar chart showing user activity. The tooltip content for each bar is dynamically generated based on user input.

```javascript
// Potentially vulnerable code
const chartConfig = {
  type: 'bar',
  data: {
    labels: ['User A', 'User B', 'User C'],
    datasets: [{
      label: 'Activity Count',
      data: [10, 5, 12]
    }]
  },
  options: {
    tooltips: {
      callbacks: {
        label: function(context) {
          // Vulnerable: Assuming user input influences tooltip content
          const userName = getUserInputForLabel(context.label); // Could be attacker-controlled
          return `${userName}: ${context.dataset.data[context.index]}`;
        }
      }
    }
  }
};
```

If `getUserInputForLabel` retrieves data directly from a URL parameter like `?label=User%20A<img%20src=x%20onerror=alert('XSS')>`, the `label` callback will execute the injected JavaScript (`alert('XSS')`) when the tooltip for 'User A' is displayed.

**Impact Assessment:**

* **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** This is the most severe consequence. Attackers gain the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, leading to a wide range of malicious activities.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  This vulnerability is a prime example of a client-side XSS vulnerability.
* **Data Breach:** Attackers can steal sensitive information accessible by the user's browser, including cookies, session tokens, and data from the application's DOM.
* **Account Takeover:** By stealing session tokens or credentials, attackers can gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
* **Defacement:** Attackers can modify the visual appearance of the application, potentially damaging the application's reputation.
* **Malware Distribution:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites that attempt to install malware.
* **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can intercept and control the user's session with the application.

**Technical Details and Chart.js Specifics:**

The vulnerability primarily stems from the way Chart.js handles string-based function definitions within its configuration. While Chart.js itself doesn't inherently sanitize these strings, it's the responsibility of the application developer to ensure that any user-provided data used in these callbacks is properly sanitized.

**Affected Configuration Options (Examples):**

While not an exhaustive list, these are some common areas where callback functions are used in Chart.js and could be vulnerable:

* **`tooltips.callbacks.label`:**  Customizing the content of tooltips.
* **`tooltips.callbacks.beforeLabel` / `tooltips.callbacks.afterLabel`:** Adding content before or after the main tooltip label.
* **`scales.xAxes[].ticks.callback` / `scales.yAxes[].ticks.callback`:** Formatting axis tick labels.
* **`plugins[].beforeDraw` / `plugins[].afterDraw`:**  Customizing chart drawing behavior.
* **`onClick` event handler:**  Handling click events on chart elements.

**Detection Strategies:**

* **Static Code Analysis:** Tools can be used to scan the application's codebase for instances where user input is used to construct Chart.js configuration objects, particularly within callback function definitions. Look for patterns where string concatenation or template literals are used to embed user-provided data directly into callback strings.
* **Dynamic Analysis (Penetration Testing):**  Security testers can attempt to inject malicious JavaScript payloads into various input fields and URL parameters that influence the chart configuration. Observe if the injected code is executed when the corresponding chart events are triggered.
* **Code Reviews:** Manual review of the code by security experts can identify potential vulnerabilities in how Chart.js configurations are built and how user input is handled. Pay close attention to data flow and sanitization practices.
* **Security Audits of Dependencies:** While the vulnerability lies in the application's usage of Chart.js, it's important to keep Chart.js itself updated to the latest version to benefit from any security patches.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Input Sanitization:**  **This is the most crucial mitigation.**  All user-provided data that is used to construct Chart.js configuration objects, especially within callback functions, **must be thoroughly sanitized**. This involves escaping or removing potentially harmful characters that could be interpreted as executable JavaScript. Libraries like DOMPurify can be used for robust HTML sanitization.
* **Avoid String-Based Function Definitions:**  Whenever possible, define callback functions as actual JavaScript functions instead of strings. This eliminates the possibility of injecting malicious code within the string.

   **Instead of:**
   ```javascript
   tooltips: {
     callbacks: {
       label: "function(context) { return 'Custom Label'; }"
     }
   }
   ```

   **Use:**
   ```javascript
   tooltips: {
     callbacks: {
       label: function(context) { return 'Custom Label'; }
     }
   }
   ```

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP that restricts the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts. This can help mitigate the impact of a successful XSS attack by preventing the execution of externally hosted malicious scripts.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges. This can limit the damage an attacker can cause even if they successfully execute malicious code.
* **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.
* **Educate Developers:**  Train developers on secure coding practices, specifically emphasizing the risks associated with using user input in dynamic code generation and the importance of input sanitization.

**Guidance for the Development Team:**

* **Treat all user input as potentially malicious.**  Never trust data coming from external sources.
* **Prioritize using function references over string-based function definitions in Chart.js configurations.**
* **Implement robust input sanitization for any user-provided data used in Chart.js callbacks.** Use established sanitization libraries and techniques.
* **Review all existing code that constructs Chart.js configurations to identify potential vulnerabilities.**
* **Integrate security testing into the development lifecycle.**
* **Stay updated with the latest security best practices and Chart.js updates.**

**Conclusion:**

The ability to leverage callback functions in Chart.js offers significant flexibility but introduces a critical security risk if not handled with extreme care. The potential for arbitrary JavaScript execution through unsanitized user input within these callbacks makes this a **HIGH RISK** vulnerability that requires immediate attention. By understanding the attack vector, implementing robust mitigation strategies, and fostering a security-conscious development culture, the team can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation and protect the application and its users. This analysis provides a foundation for addressing this vulnerability and ensuring the secure use of the Chart.js library.
