## Deep Analysis: Inject Malicious JavaScript via Data Labels in Chart.js

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the attack tree path "Inject Malicious JavaScript via Data Labels" within an application utilizing the Chart.js library. This path is classified as **CRITICAL** and carries a **HIGH RISK** due to the potential for significant impact and relatively straightforward exploitation.

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

The core issue lies in the way Chart.js renders data labels on charts. If the data used to generate these labels originates from an untrusted source and is not properly sanitized before being passed to Chart.js, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code within the label text. When Chart.js renders this label, the injected script will be executed within the user's browser, in the context of the application's origin. This is a classic Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Detailed Attack Breakdown:**

1. **Attack Vector Identification:** The attacker identifies that the application uses Chart.js and that data labels are displayed on the charts. They then investigate how the data for these labels is generated and sourced. Potential sources include:
    * **User Input:**  Directly entered by users through forms, search bars, or other interactive elements.
    * **Database Records:** Data retrieved from a database, potentially influenced by previous user input or compromised accounts.
    * **API Responses:** Data fetched from external APIs, which might be vulnerable themselves or return attacker-controlled data.
    * **Configuration Files:** Less likely for direct injection, but misconfigurations could lead to vulnerable data.

2. **Payload Crafting:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload designed to execute their desired actions. Examples include:
    * **Stealing Session Cookies:** `"<img src='x' onerror='fetch(\`/steal_cookie?cookie=\` + document.cookie)'>" `
    * **Redirecting Users:** `"<img src='x' onerror='window.location.href=\"https://attacker.com/malicious_page\"'>" `
    * **Keylogging:** Injecting a script that captures user keystrokes.
    * **Defacing the Application:** Manipulating the DOM to alter the application's appearance.
    * **Performing Actions on Behalf of the User:** Making API calls or submitting forms using the user's session.

3. **Injection Point Exploitation:** The attacker targets the specific data source that feeds the chart's data labels. This could involve:
    * **Submitting Malicious Input:** If the data label is derived from user input, the attacker can directly inject the payload. For example, in a form field that contributes to the chart data.
    * **Manipulating Database Records:** If the data comes from a database, a compromised account or SQL injection vulnerability could allow the attacker to modify the relevant data.
    * **Poisoning API Responses:** If the data is fetched from an API, the attacker might try to compromise the API or manipulate the data returned (e.g., through a Man-in-the-Middle attack or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the API itself).

4. **Payload Delivery and Execution:** Once the malicious data is incorporated into the chart data, Chart.js will render the label. Since the injected payload is embedded within the label text (likely within HTML attributes like `title` or directly within the text content depending on Chart.js configuration), the browser will interpret and execute the JavaScript code.

5. **Impact and Post-Exploitation:**  The successful execution of the malicious JavaScript can have severe consequences:
    * **Account Takeover:** Stealing session cookies allows the attacker to impersonate the user.
    * **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or through further API calls.
    * **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites can lead to malware infections.
    * **Reputational Damage:** The application's reputation can be severely damaged by successful XSS attacks.
    * **Financial Loss:** Depending on the application's purpose, attacks can lead to financial losses for users or the organization.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

* **Chart.js Label Rendering:** Chart.js offers various ways to configure data labels. Depending on the configuration, the vulnerability might manifest differently. For example:
    * **`data.datasets[].label`:**  If this directly uses unsanitized user input, it's a prime target.
    * **`options.plugins.datalabels.formatter`:** If a custom formatter function is used and it doesn't sanitize the input, it's vulnerable.
    * **`options.tooltips.callbacks.label`:** Similar to the formatter, unsanitized data here can lead to XSS when hovering over data points.

* **HTML Context:** The context in which the malicious JavaScript is injected is crucial. Injecting within HTML attributes (like `title` in `<span title="...">`) often requires event handlers like `onerror` or `onload` to trigger the script. Injecting directly within the text content of an HTML element might be executed if the content is not properly escaped.

* **Browser Interpretation:** Modern browsers have some built-in XSS protection mechanisms, but they are not foolproof. Carefully crafted payloads can bypass these protections.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Likelihood:**  **High**. If the application directly uses user-provided data for chart labels without proper sanitization, the vulnerability is easily exploitable. Attackers frequently target such common vulnerabilities.
* **Impact:** **Critical**. Successful XSS can lead to complete compromise of user accounts and significant damage to the application and its users.
* **Overall Risk:** **High**. The combination of high likelihood and critical impact makes this a significant security concern.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

The development team must implement robust security measures to prevent this type of attack. Key strategies include:

1. **Input Sanitization:**
    * **Server-Side Sanitization:**  Sanitize all user-provided data on the server-side *before* it is stored or used to generate chart data. Use established libraries and functions for this purpose (e.g., OWASP Java Encoder, DOMPurify for JavaScript on the backend).
    * **Contextual Output Encoding:** Encode data based on the context in which it will be displayed. For HTML content, use HTML entity encoding. For JavaScript strings, use JavaScript escaping. Chart.js often handles some basic escaping, but relying solely on this is insufficient.

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, etc.). This can significantly limit the impact of injected malicious scripts.

3. **Regular Updates:** Keep Chart.js and all other dependencies up-to-date. Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched in library updates.

4. **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities, including XSS flaws related to chart data.

5. **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that user accounts and processes have only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks. This can limit the damage an attacker can cause even if they gain access.

6. **Educate Developers:** Train developers on secure coding practices, including how to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. Emphasize the importance of input validation and output encoding.

7. **Consider Alternatives (If Applicable):** If the complexity of sanitizing user-provided data for labels is too high or error-prone, explore alternative ways to display information or generate labels that don't directly incorporate untrusted input.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

* **Immediately review the code responsible for generating chart data labels.** Identify all sources of data that contribute to the labels.
* **Implement robust server-side sanitization for all data used in chart labels.**
* **Enforce contextual output encoding when rendering chart labels.**
* **Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP).**
* **Prioritize patching and updating Chart.js to the latest stable version.**
* **Integrate security testing into the development lifecycle.**

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious JavaScript via Data Labels" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications using Chart.js. By understanding the attack vector, potential impact, and implementing appropriate mitigation strategies, the development team can effectively protect their application and users from this critical vulnerability. A proactive and layered security approach is essential to defend against XSS attacks and maintain the integrity and security of the application. This requires a collaborative effort between the cybersecurity expert and the development team.
