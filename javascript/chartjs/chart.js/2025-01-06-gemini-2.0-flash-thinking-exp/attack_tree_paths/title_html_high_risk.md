## Deep Analysis of HTML Injection Vulnerability in Chart.js Title

**Subject:** Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Title HTML **HIGH RISK**

**Introduction:**

This document provides a detailed analysis of the identified attack tree path concerning HTML injection within the `title.text` configuration option of the Chart.js library. While Chart.js itself is generally considered a secure library, vulnerabilities can arise from how it's implemented and configured within a larger application. This specific attack vector highlights a critical point where insufficient input handling can lead to significant security risks.

**Vulnerability Breakdown:**

* **Component:** Chart.js Library
* **Configuration Option:** `title.text`
* **Attack Vector:** HTML Injection
* **Prerequisite:** Application allows HTML rendering in the chart title AND does not sanitize user-provided input for the `title.text` option.
* **Impact:** Direct execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser, leading to various security compromises.
* **Risk Level:** **HIGH**

**Detailed Analysis:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in the potential for an attacker to inject malicious HTML code into the `title.text` configuration. If the application using Chart.js directly renders this text as HTML without proper sanitization, the injected code will be interpreted and executed by the user's browser.

**Scenario:**

Imagine an application that allows users to customize the title of a chart. This title is then passed directly to the `title.text` option of a Chart.js instance. If the application doesn't sanitize the user's input, an attacker could provide a malicious string like:

```javascript
chartConfig.options.title.text = '<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'You have been hacked!\');">';
```

When the chart is rendered, the browser will attempt to load the non-existent image "x". This will trigger the `onerror` event, executing the embedded JavaScript code (`alert('You have been hacked!')`). This is a simple example, but the potential for harm is much greater.

**Potential Impacts:**

The successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences, including but not limited to:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the primary impact. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the vulnerable application's domain. This allows them to:
    * **Steal sensitive information:** Access cookies, session tokens, and other data stored in the user's browser.
    * **Perform actions on behalf of the user:**  Submit forms, make API calls, change user settings without the user's knowledge or consent.
    * **Redirect the user to malicious websites:**  Trick users into visiting phishing sites or downloading malware.
    * **Deface the application:**  Alter the appearance and functionality of the chart or the surrounding page.
    * **Keylogging:** Capture user keystrokes and steal credentials.
    * **Session Hijacking:**  Gain control of the user's active session.
* **Data Exfiltration:**  Malicious scripts can send user data to attacker-controlled servers.
* **Malware Distribution:**  The injected script could redirect the user to websites hosting malware.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  While less likely in this specific scenario, a carefully crafted script could potentially overload the user's browser.

**Why is this High Risk?**

This vulnerability is classified as high risk due to several factors:

* **Direct Code Execution:** The injected HTML can directly execute JavaScript, providing the attacker with significant control.
* **Wide Range of Potential Impacts:** As outlined above, the consequences of successful exploitation can be severe and far-reaching.
* **Ease of Exploitation (if input is not sanitized):**  Injecting malicious HTML is relatively straightforward for an attacker.
* **User Interaction May Not Be Required:**  The malicious script executes automatically when the chart is rendered.
* **Potential for Widespread Impact:** If the vulnerable application is widely used, a successful attack could affect a large number of users.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To prevent this vulnerability, the development team must implement robust input validation and sanitization measures. Here are the key strategies:

1. **Input Sanitization:**
    * **Server-Side Sanitization:**  The most reliable approach is to sanitize the user-provided input on the server-side *before* it is used to configure the chart. This involves removing or escaping any potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes. Libraries like DOMPurify (for JavaScript) or similar libraries in other backend languages can be used for this purpose.
    * **Client-Side Sanitization (as a secondary measure):** While server-side sanitization is crucial, client-side sanitization can provide an additional layer of defense. However, it should not be relied upon as the primary security measure, as it can be bypassed.

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * Implement a strong CSP header to control the resources the browser is allowed to load. This can help mitigate the impact of injected scripts by restricting their capabilities (e.g., preventing inline scripts or restricting the domains from which scripts can be loaded).

3. **Disable HTML Rendering in Title (if feasible):**
    * If the application's requirements allow, consider disabling HTML rendering within the chart title altogether. This eliminates the attack vector entirely. Chart.js might have options to control HTML rendering in titles.

4. **Regular Updates:**
    * Ensure that the Chart.js library and all other dependencies are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches. While this specific vulnerability is likely an application-level issue, staying updated mitigates other potential risks.

5. **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * Avoid granting unnecessary privileges to the code that handles user input and configures the charts.

**Code Examples (Illustrative):**

**Server-Side Sanitization (using a hypothetical backend language):**

```python
# Example using a Python library for HTML sanitization (e.g., bleach)
import bleach

def sanitize_chart_title(title):
  allowed_tags = [] # Define allowed HTML tags if necessary
  allowed_attributes = {} # Define allowed HTML attributes if necessary
  return bleach.clean(title, tags=allowed_tags, attributes=allowed_attributes)

user_provided_title = request.get_parameter("chartTitle")
sanitized_title = sanitize_chart_title(user_provided_title)

chart_config = {
  "type": "bar",
  "data": {...},
  "options": {
    "title": {
      "display": True,
      "text": sanitized_title  # Use the sanitized title
    }
  }
}
```

**Client-Side Sanitization (using DOMPurify in JavaScript):**

```javascript
import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

const userProvidedTitle = getUserInput(); // Get user input

const sanitizedTitle = DOMPurify.sanitize(userProvidedTitle);

const chartConfig = {
  type: 'bar',
  data: { ... },
  options: {
    title: {
      display: true,
      text: sanitizedTitle
    }
  }
};

const myChart = new Chart(ctx, chartConfig);
```

**Testing and Verification:**

After implementing mitigation strategies, thorough testing is crucial:

* **Manual Testing:**  Attempt to inject various malicious HTML payloads into the `title.text` field to verify that they are properly sanitized and do not execute. Test different types of XSS payloads, including those using script tags, event handlers, and data URIs.
* **Automated Testing:**  Integrate security testing into the development pipeline. Use tools that can automatically scan for XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Code Review:**  Have another developer review the code changes to ensure the sanitization logic is implemented correctly.

**Developer Considerations:**

* **Security Awareness:**  Educate developers about common web security vulnerabilities, including XSS and HTML injection.
* **Secure Coding Practices:**  Emphasize the importance of secure coding practices, such as input validation and output encoding.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Only allow the necessary HTML elements and attributes if HTML rendering in the title is absolutely required.

**Conclusion:**

The HTML injection vulnerability in the Chart.js title, while seemingly simple, poses a significant security risk. By allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript, it can lead to various malicious activities, compromising user data and the integrity of the application. Implementing robust input sanitization on the server-side, along with other security measures like CSP, is crucial to mitigate this risk effectively. The development team must prioritize addressing this vulnerability to ensure the security and trust of their application and its users. This analysis provides a clear understanding of the threat and actionable steps to remediate it.
