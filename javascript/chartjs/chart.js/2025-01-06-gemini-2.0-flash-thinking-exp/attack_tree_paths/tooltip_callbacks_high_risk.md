## Deep Dive Analysis: Chart.js Tooltip Callback Injection Vulnerability

**Subject:** Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Tooltip Callbacks - Potential for Client-Side Script Injection

**Risk Level:** HIGH

**Introduction:**

This document provides a deep analysis of a high-risk attack path identified in the attack tree for applications utilizing the Chart.js library. Specifically, we will examine the vulnerability associated with manipulating tooltip callback functions to inject and execute malicious client-side scripts. This analysis aims to provide the development team with a comprehensive understanding of the attack vector, its potential impact, and actionable mitigation strategies.

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

Chart.js offers a high degree of customization, including the ability to define custom content and behavior for tooltips displayed when users interact with chart elements. This customization is often achieved through callback functions provided within the `tooltip` configuration options. Key callbacks relevant to this vulnerability include, but are not limited to:

* **`tooltip.callbacks.label`:**  Used to format the text displayed for each data point in the tooltip.
* **`tooltip.callbacks.title`:** Used to format the title of the tooltip.
* **`tooltip.callbacks.beforeBody`, `tooltip.callbacks.afterBody`, `tooltip.callbacks.beforeFooter`, `tooltip.callbacks.afterFooter`:**  Allow injecting custom content before and after various sections of the tooltip.

The vulnerability arises when the application dynamically generates the data passed to these callback functions, particularly if this data originates from untrusted sources (e.g., user input, external APIs) and is not properly sanitized before being used within the callback.

**Attack Vector Breakdown:**

1. **Attacker Identifies a Potential Injection Point:** The attacker analyzes the application's JavaScript code or observes network requests to identify how data is being fed into the Chart.js tooltip callbacks. They look for scenarios where user-controlled or external data is used to generate tooltip content.

2. **Crafting the Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload, typically involving `<script>` tags containing JavaScript code. This payload is designed to be injected into the data used by the tooltip callback.

3. **Injecting the Payload:** The attacker manipulates the data source to include their malicious payload. This could involve:
    * **Direct User Input:** If the application allows users to directly influence the data displayed on the chart (e.g., through form submissions, URL parameters).
    * **Compromised External Data Source:** If the application fetches data from an external API that has been compromised by the attacker.
    * **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the application is vulnerable to stored XSS elsewhere, the attacker could inject the payload into the database, which is then used to generate chart data.

4. **Triggering the Tooltip:** The attacker interacts with the chart element that triggers the tooltip.

5. **Payload Execution:** When the tooltip is rendered, the Chart.js library executes the provided callback function. If the data within the callback contains the malicious `<script>` tags, the browser will interpret and execute the embedded JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser.

**Illustrative Example (Vulnerable Code):**

```javascript
const chartData = {
  labels: ['January', 'February', 'March'],
  datasets: [{
    label: 'Sales',
    data: [10, 20, 15],
    tooltip: {
      callbacks: {
        label: function(context) {
          // Vulnerable: Directly using unsanitized data
          return context.dataset.label + ": " + context.parsed.y + " <script>alert('XSS!')</script>";
        }
      }
    }
  }]
};

const myChart = new Chart(document.getElementById('myChart'), {
  type: 'bar',
  data: chartData,
});
```

In this example, if the `context.dataset.label` or `context.parsed.y` values were derived from user input without sanitization, an attacker could inject the `<script>` tag, leading to the execution of the `alert('XSS!')` when the tooltip is displayed.

**Potential Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

A successful injection through tooltip callbacks can have severe consequences, including:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the primary risk. The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the vulnerable application's domain. This allows them to:
    * **Steal Sensitive Information:** Access cookies, session tokens, and other local storage data, potentially leading to account hijacking.
    * **Perform Actions on Behalf of the User:** Make unauthorized requests to the server, modify user data, or perform actions the user is authorized to do.
    * **Redirect the User:** Redirect the user to a malicious website.
    * **Deface the Application:** Modify the visual appearance of the page.
    * **Install Malware:** In some scenarios, the attacker might be able to leverage other vulnerabilities to install malware on the user's machine.
    * **Keylogging:** Capture user keystrokes.

* **Data Integrity Compromise:** If the injected script can manipulate the chart data or the way it's displayed, it can lead to misleading information and compromise the integrity of the application's data visualization.

* **Denial of Service (DoS):** While less likely, a carefully crafted malicious script could potentially cause the user's browser to freeze or crash, leading to a temporary denial of service.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively mitigate this vulnerability, the development team should implement the following strategies:

1. **Strict Input Sanitization:**
    * **Identify all sources of data used in tooltip callbacks:** This includes user input, data from external APIs, and any other dynamically generated content.
    * **Implement robust sanitization techniques:**  Encode or escape HTML entities within the data before using it in the callback functions. Use appropriate escaping functions provided by your framework or library (e.g., `DOMPurify`, framework-specific escaping functions).
    * **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Ensure that the encoding applied is appropriate for the context in which the data is being used (e.g., HTML encoding for rendering in the DOM).

2. **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Implement a strong CSP:** This HTTP header allows you to control the resources the browser is allowed to load for a given page. By restricting the sources of JavaScript execution, you can significantly reduce the impact of injected scripts.
    * **Avoid `unsafe-inline`:**  Do not use `'unsafe-inline'` for `script-src` or `style-src` directives, as this weakens the effectiveness of CSP.

3. **Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Avoid directly injecting HTML strings into the tooltip callbacks. If possible, use Chart.js's built-in formatting options or create elements programmatically and append them.
    * **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews and security audits to identify potential injection points and ensure proper sanitization is implemented.

4. **Chart.js Version Updates:**
    * **Keep Chart.js updated:** Ensure you are using the latest stable version of Chart.js, as it may contain security fixes for known vulnerabilities. Review the release notes for any security-related updates.

5. **User Education (Indirect Mitigation):**
    * While not a direct technical mitigation, educating users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links or interacting with untrusted content can help reduce the likelihood of exploitation.

**Developer Guidance and Actionable Steps:**

* **Identify all instances where tooltip callbacks are used in the application.**
* **Trace the origin of the data used within these callbacks.**
* **Implement rigorous input sanitization for all data originating from untrusted sources before it's used in tooltip callbacks.**
* **Review and strengthen the application's Content Security Policy (CSP).**
* **Conduct thorough security testing, specifically targeting potential XSS vulnerabilities in tooltip callbacks.**
* **Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities.**
* **Educate the development team on the risks of client-side injection and secure coding practices.**

**Conclusion:**

The vulnerability associated with manipulating Chart.js tooltip callbacks presents a significant security risk due to the potential for client-side script injection. By understanding the attack vector and implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the likelihood of successful exploitation and protect users from potential harm. Prioritizing input sanitization, implementing a strong CSP, and adhering to secure coding practices are crucial steps in addressing this high-risk vulnerability. Regular security assessments and ongoing vigilance are essential to maintaining a secure application.
