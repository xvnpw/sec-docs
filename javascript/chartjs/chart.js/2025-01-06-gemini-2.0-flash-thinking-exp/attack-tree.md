## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Chart.js Exploitation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_chart_js_exploitation__critical_.md)

This is the root goal and therefore the most critical node. Success at any of the child nodes leads to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Exploitation [CRITICAL] **HIGH RISK**](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_exploitation__critical__high_risk.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to manipulate Chart.js configuration options to inject malicious code. This is a high-risk area because Chart.js offers various configuration settings that, if not handled carefully, can be exploited for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JavaScript via Configuration Options [CRITICAL] **HIGH RISK**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript_via_configuration_options__critical__high_risk.md)

**Attack Vector:** This involves specifically targeting configuration options that can interpret or execute JavaScript code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Callback Functions [CRITICAL] **HIGH RISK**](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_callback_functions__critical__high_risk.md)

**Attack Vector:** Chart.js allows developers to define callback functions for various events and functionalities. If the application uses unsanitized user input or attacker-controlled data within these callbacks, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript that will be executed when the callback is triggered.

## Attack Tree Path: [Tooltip Callbacks **HIGH RISK**](./attack_tree_paths/tooltip_callbacks_high_risk.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Manipulating callback functions associated with tooltips (e.g., `tooltip.callbacks.label`). If the application dynamically generates tooltip content using unsanitized data, an attacker can inject `<script>` tags or JavaScript code within the data, which will then be executed when the tooltip is displayed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse HTML String Configuration **HIGH RISK**](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_html_string_configuration_high_risk.md)

**Attack Vector:** Some Chart.js configuration options allow the use of HTML strings. If the application uses unsanitized data within these options, attackers can inject malicious HTML, including `<script>` tags, leading to XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Title HTML **HIGH RISK**](./attack_tree_paths/title_html_high_risk.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious HTML code into the `title.text` configuration option, if the application allows HTML in the chart title and does not sanitize the input. This can directly execute JavaScript when the chart is rendered.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Default Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_default_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:**  This involves leveraging inherent vulnerabilities present in specific versions of Chart.js due to its default configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Chart.js Versions **HIGH RISK**](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_specific_chart_js_versions_high_risk.md)

**Attack Vector:** Older versions of Chart.js might have known XSS vulnerabilities in their default configurations or how they handle certain data or options. Attackers can exploit these publicly known vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated version of the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Injection Exploitation [CRITICAL] **HIGH RISK**](./attack_tree_paths/data_injection_exploitation__critical__high_risk.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to inject malicious code directly into the data provided to Chart.js. If this data is later interpreted as HTML or used in a way that allows for code execution, it can lead to vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious JavaScript via Data Labels [CRITICAL] **HIGH RISK**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript_via_data_labels__critical__high_risk.md)

**Attack Vector:** This specifically targets the data labels displayed on the chart. If these labels are generated using unsanitized data, it can be a vector for XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse String Data Values **HIGH RISK**](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_string_data_values_high_risk.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code within string data values that are used to generate data labels. If the application does not properly encode or sanitize these strings before they are rendered on the chart, the injected script will be executed in the user's browser.
