# Threat Model Analysis for chartjs/chart.js

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/malicious_data_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data fields (e.g., labels, dataset values) that are then rendered by Chart.js without proper sanitization. The attacker might craft data containing `<script>` tags or event handlers.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the application.
*   **Affected Component:**  `Chart` object, specifically the rendering of labels, tooltips, and potentially custom HTML annotations if used.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict server-side input validation and sanitization for all data that will be displayed by Chart.js.
    *   Use browser-provided encoding functions (e.g., escaping HTML entities) before passing data to Chart.js.
    *   Avoid rendering user-provided data directly within HTML elements used by Chart.js without proper escaping.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Chart.js](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_chart_js.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages publicly known security vulnerabilities present in specific versions of the Chart.js library.
*   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from XSS to other client-side exploits or unexpected behavior.
*   **Affected Component:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability. Could affect any part of the library's codebase.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability. (Including here as it *can* be critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Chart.js to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor the Chart.js release notes and security advisories for updates and vulnerability disclosures.
    *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage the version of Chart.js being used.
