# Threat Model Analysis for chartjs/chart.js

## Threat: [Client-Side Script Injection (XSS) via Data](./threats/client-side_script_injection__xss__via_data.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data fields intended for display in the chart (e.g., labels, data point values, tooltip content). This malicious data is then passed directly to Chart.js.
*   **How:** When Chart.js renders the chart, it processes this malicious data. If the application hasn't properly sanitized the input *before* providing it to Chart.js, the library might render the injected script, causing it to execute in the user's browser.
**Impact:**
*   The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the application. This can lead to session hijacking (stealing session cookies), redirecting the user to malicious websites, defacing the application, or stealing sensitive information.
**Affected Component:**
*   `options.data.labels` (Chart.js processes these strings for display)
*   `options.data.datasets[].data` (Chart.js uses these values and potentially associated labels in tooltips)
*   `options.tooltips.callbacks` (Chart.js executes these functions, which can contain malicious code if not properly handled)
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Input Sanitization:** Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided data on the server-side *before* passing it to the client-side application and Chart.js. Use appropriate encoding techniques to neutralize potentially harmful characters.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load and execute, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
*   **Templating Engine Escaping:** Utilize a templating engine that automatically escapes HTML entities by default when rendering data within the application's HTML, although this is a mitigation *before* data reaches Chart.js.

## Threat: [Client-Side Script Injection (XSS) via Configuration](./threats/client-side_script_injection__xss__via_configuration.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker manipulates Chart.js configuration options, particularly those involving callbacks or custom plugins, to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code *within the Chart.js context*.
*   **How:** If the application allows users to influence Chart.js configuration directly (e.g., through URL parameters, stored preferences, or API endpoints), an attacker can inject malicious code within these configuration settings. When Chart.js initializes or updates the chart with this manipulated configuration, the injected script is executed *by Chart.js*.
**Impact:**
*   Similar to data-based XSS, this allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, redirection, data theft, or other malicious activities.
**Affected Component:**
*   `options.plugins` (Chart.js loads and executes plugin code)
*   Callback functions within `options` (e.g., `onClick`, `onHover`, animation callbacks that Chart.js calls)
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Restrict Configuration Control:** Avoid allowing direct user control over complex or sensitive Chart.js configuration options, especially those involving callbacks or custom plugins.
*   **Configuration Validation:** If user configuration is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize the input to ensure it conforms to expected types and values. Do not allow arbitrary code execution through configuration.
*   **Secure Defaults:** Use secure default configurations for Chart.js and avoid exposing unnecessary configuration options to user manipulation.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_via_compromised_dependencies.md)

**Description:**
*   **Attacker Action:** An attacker compromises a dependency of Chart.js, injecting malicious code into it.
*   **How:** When developers include Chart.js in their projects, they also indirectly include its dependencies. If a dependency is compromised, the malicious code is incorporated into the application's build process and subsequently used by Chart.js.
**Impact:**
*   The impact can be severe, potentially leading to any of the consequences of XSS, data breaches, or other malicious activities, depending on the nature of the injected code *executed within the Chart.js context or by code it relies on*.
**Affected Component:**
*   Chart.js's dependencies (e.g., libraries listed in `package.json`).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regular Updates:** Keep Chart.js and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency management tools and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   **Verify Integrity:** Utilize checksums or other integrity verification mechanisms to ensure the downloaded dependencies haven't been tampered with.
