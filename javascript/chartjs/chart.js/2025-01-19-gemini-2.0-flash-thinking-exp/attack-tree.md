## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Malicious Data Injection -> Inject Malicious Strings into Data Labels/Datasets **(CRITICAL NODE)** -> Application Renders Chart Without Proper Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_malicious_data_injection_-_inject_malicious_strings_into_data_labelsdatasets_36372537.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious strings containing JavaScript code into the data labels or dataset values that are used by Chart.js. If the application then renders the chart without properly sanitizing these strings (e.g., by escaping HTML entities), the browser will interpret the injected JavaScript as code and execute it. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    * **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Strings into Data Labels/Datasets:** This is the specific action of inserting the malicious payload into the chart data.
    * **Critical Node: Application Renders Chart Without Proper Sanitization:** This is the application's failure to prevent the execution of the injected script, making the XSS attack successful.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Malicious Data Injection -> Application Renders Chart Without Proper Sanitization **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_malicious_data_injection_-_application_renders_chart_without_proper_sanitiza_4cf8acf2.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to the previous path, but focuses on the broader issue of the application failing to sanitize any data passed to Chart.js. Any user-controlled data used in the chart configuration becomes a potential XSS vector if not properly handled.
    * **Critical Node: Application Renders Chart Without Proper Sanitization:**  The core vulnerability lies in the lack of output encoding or sanitization by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Malicious Configuration Injection -> Inject Malicious JavaScript in Callbacks (e.g., `onClick`, `onHover`) **(CRITICAL NODE)** -> Application Applies User-Controlled Configuration Directly **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_malicious_configuration_injection_-_inject_malicious_javascript_in_callbacks_95a1d8a4.md)

**Attack Vector:** Chart.js allows defining callback functions for various events like clicks or mouse hovers. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into these callback function definitions within the chart's configuration. If the application directly applies user-provided configuration without validation, this malicious JavaScript will be executed when the corresponding event occurs on the chart.
    * **Critical Node: Inject Malicious JavaScript in Callbacks (e.g., `onClick`, `onHover`):** This is the specific action of injecting the malicious script into the event handler configuration.
    * **Critical Node: Application Applies User-Controlled Configuration Directly:** The application's failure to validate or sanitize the configuration allows the malicious callbacks to be registered.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Malicious Configuration Injection -> Application Applies User-Controlled Configuration Directly **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_malicious_configuration_injection_-_application_applies_user-controlled_conf_970ffc8b.md)

**Attack Vector:** This highlights the risk of directly using user-provided input to configure the Chart.js instance. If the application doesn't validate or sanitize this configuration, an attacker can inject various malicious settings, including those leading to XSS through callbacks or other configuration options.
    * **Critical Node: Application Applies User-Controlled Configuration Directly:** The fundamental weakness is the lack of secure configuration management.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Chart Configuration **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_chart_configuration__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a general entry point for various attacks involving manipulating the data used by Chart.js. Malicious data can lead to XSS if not sanitized, or potentially to other vulnerabilities through unexpected data structures or values.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Configuration Options **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration_options__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a broad category of attacks where the attacker manipulates the `options` object of the Chart.js configuration. This can include injecting malicious JavaScript into callbacks, manipulating plugin settings, or causing resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Chart.js Version **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/identify_known_vulnerabilities_in_specific_chart_js_version__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application uses an outdated version of Chart.js, attackers can leverage publicly known vulnerabilities for that specific version. This often involves crafting specific data or configuration inputs to trigger the vulnerability, potentially leading to XSS or other exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Configuration or Data **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration_or_data__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** By injecting carefully crafted configuration options or data, an attacker can manipulate the JavaScript prototype chain. This can be achieved by exploiting how Chart.js handles object merging or property assignment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Code Relies on Unsanitized Prototype Properties **(CRITICAL NODE)**](./attack_tree_paths/application_code_relies_on_unsanitized_prototype_properties__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application's JavaScript code accesses properties from objects without checking if those properties are directly owned by the object (using `hasOwnProperty`), an attacker who has polluted the prototype can influence the application's behavior by injecting malicious properties into the prototype. This can lead to various unexpected and potentially harmful outcomes.
