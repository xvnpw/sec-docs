# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for chartjs/chart.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Chart.js](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_chart_js.md)

### Description:
1.  **Monitor Chart.js Releases:** Subscribe to the Chart.js GitHub repository's release notifications or check the npm/yarn package page regularly for new versions.
2.  **Review Release Notes:** When a new version is released, carefully review the release notes, paying close attention to security fixes and vulnerability patches specifically mentioned for Chart.js.
3.  **Update Dependency:** Use your package manager (npm, yarn) to update the Chart.js dependency in your project to the latest stable version. For example, using npm: `npm update chart.js`.
4.  **Test Chart Functionality:** After updating, thoroughly test your application's charts to ensure the update hasn't introduced any regressions or broken Chart.js functionality.
5.  **Repeat Regularly:** Establish a schedule for regularly checking and updating Chart.js as part of your dependency maintenance process.
### Threats Mitigated:
*   **Exploitation of Known Chart.js Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated versions of Chart.js may contain known security vulnerabilities within the library itself that attackers can exploit. Updating mitigates these Chart.js specific risks.
### Impact:
*   **Exploitation of Known Chart.js Vulnerabilities:** High Risk Reduction. Directly addresses and eliminates known vulnerabilities patched in newer Chart.js versions.
### Currently Implemented:
Yes, we have a process to check for library updates monthly. Currently, we are using Chart.js version 3.9.1.
### Missing Implementation:
We need to automate the Chart.js dependency update checks and integrate vulnerability scanning specifically targeting Chart.js dependencies into our CI/CD pipeline to ensure timely updates and vulnerability detection.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Provided Data for Chart.js Configuration and Data](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-provided_data_for_chart_js_configuration_and_data.md)

### Description:
1.  **Identify User Input Points for Charts:** Identify all points in your application where user-provided data is used *specifically* to generate Chart.js charts (e.g., data for chart datasets, labels, tooltip content, legend labels, configuration options).
2.  **Context-Aware Sanitization for Chart.js:** Implement context-aware sanitization for all user-provided data *before* it's used in Chart.js configurations, especially within: `data.datasets[].data`, `data.labels`, and callback functions in `options.plugins.tooltip` and `options.plugins.legend`. Focus sanitization on areas where Chart.js renders user-provided strings.
3.  **HTML Entity Encoding for Chart.js Displayed Strings:**  For string data that will be displayed by Chart.js in labels or tooltips, use HTML entity encoding to escape potentially malicious HTML characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `
