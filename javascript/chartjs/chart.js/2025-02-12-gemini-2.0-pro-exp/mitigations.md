# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for chartjs/chart.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Data Sanitization and Validation (Enhanced for Chart.js)](./mitigation_strategies/data_sanitization_and_validation__enhanced_for_chart_js_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Chart.js Data Points:** Determine all data points passed *directly* to Chart.js (labels, datasets, values, colors, options that accept data, etc.).
2.  **Define Data Types:** For *each* Chart.js data point, define the expected data type (number, string, boolean, etc., as per Chart.js documentation).
3.  **Implement Type Checking:**
    *   **Before Chart.js Interaction:** *Immediately before* passing data to Chart.js functions (e.g., `new Chart()`, `chart.update()`), use JavaScript's `typeof` or TypeScript to ensure data matches the expected types.  Reject or sanitize.
4.  **Whitelist Characters (for Strings in Chart.js):**
    *   For string data passed to Chart.js (labels, tooltips, etc.), create a whitelist of allowed characters.
    *   Implement a function that checks if a string contains *only* whitelisted characters *before* passing it to Chart.js.
5.  **Use a Sanitization Library (for Chart.js Data):**
    *   Use a library like DOMPurify.
    *   Call `DOMPurify.sanitize()` on *all* user-provided data *immediately before* it's used in Chart.js. This is the most critical step for preventing XSS through Chart.js.
6.  **Context-Specific Encoding (Chart.js Contexts):** If data is used in specific Chart.js contexts (e.g., tooltips, custom HTML labels), ensure it's encoded appropriately *for that specific Chart.js feature*.  Basic HTML encoding might not be sufficient if Chart.js further processes the data. Consult Chart.js documentation for the specific context.
7.  **Regular Expression Validation (Chart.js Input):** If using regular expressions, ensure they are strict, tested, and used *in conjunction with* other validation methods, specifically targeting the data passed to Chart.js.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Chart.js:** (Severity: High) - Prevents injection of malicious JavaScript into chart data rendered by Chart.js.
*   **Chart.js Data Corruption:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents invalid data from causing errors or unexpected behavior *within Chart.js*.
*   **Indirect Code Injection (through Chart.js):** (Severity: High) - Reduces the risk of code injection through Chart.js plugins or custom code that interacts with unsanitized Chart.js data.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination with correct implementation).
*   **Chart.js Data Corruption:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Indirect Code Injection:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Describe where this is implemented, specifically focusing on code that *directly interacts* with Chart.js (e.g., "Implemented in the `renderChart()` function before calling `new Chart()`. Uses DOMPurify and type checking for all data passed to Chart.js.").

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Describe where this is missing, again focusing on direct Chart.js interactions (e.g., "Missing character whitelisting for labels passed to Chart.js. Missing context-specific encoding for tooltip data.").

## Mitigation Strategy: [Chart Configuration Option Whitelisting (Direct Chart.js Control)](./mitigation_strategies/chart_configuration_option_whitelisting__direct_chart_js_control_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify User-Controllable Chart.js Options:** List all Chart.js configuration options that users can *directly or indirectly* influence (e.g., through form inputs, URL parameters).
2.  **Create a Chart.js Option Whitelist:** Define a whitelist of allowed Chart.js options and their allowed values.  This should be as restrictive as possible, based on the *required* Chart.js functionality. Use the example structure from the previous response, but ensure it's tailored to *your* application's needs.
3.  **Implement Validation (Before Chart.js Initialization/Update):**
    *   **Before `new Chart()` or `chart.update()`:** *Immediately before* initializing or updating a Chart.js instance, validate any user-influenced configuration options against the whitelist.
    *   **Reject Invalid Options/Values:** If an option or value is not in the whitelist, reject it or use a safe default value.  Do *not* pass it to Chart.js.
4.  **Server-Side Chart.js Configuration (as Default):** Define default Chart.js configurations on the server.  Only allow the client to override specific, whitelisted options, and validate those overrides *before* passing them to Chart.js.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **XSS via Chart.js Configuration:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from manipulating Chart.js options to inject malicious code (e.g., through custom plugins or event handlers that are part of the Chart.js configuration).
*   **DoS via Chart.js Configuration:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents setting Chart.js options that could lead to excessive resource consumption (e.g., overly complex animations, configurations that trigger excessive rendering).
*   **Unexpected Chart.js Behavior:** (Severity: Low) - Prevents users from setting configurations that break the chart or lead to unexpected Chart.js rendering.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Unexpected Behavior:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Describe where this is implemented, focusing on code that directly sets Chart.js options (e.g., "Implemented in the `createChartConfig()` function, which is called before `new Chart()`. Uses a whitelist defined in `chartConfigWhitelist.js`.").

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Describe where this is missing (e.g., "Missing validation for options passed to `chart.update()`.  Currently, only the initial configuration is validated.").

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Management (Direct Chart.js Plugin Interaction)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_management__direct_chart_js_plugin_interaction_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Inventory Chart.js Plugins:** Create a list of all Chart.js plugins used in the project.
2.  **Vetting Process (for new Chart.js plugins):**
    *   **Necessity:** Determine if the plugin is truly necessary for Chart.js functionality.
    *   **Source Code Review (Focus on Chart.js Interaction):** Examine how the plugin interacts with Chart.js. Look for:
        *   How it handles data passed to it.
        *   Whether it uses `eval()` or similar functions in its interaction with Chart.js.
        *   Whether it modifies Chart.js's default behavior in potentially unsafe ways.
    *   **Maintainer Reputation:** Research the plugin's maintainer.
    *   **Security History:** Search for known vulnerabilities.
3.  **Update Process (Chart.js Plugins):**
    *   **Automated Checks:** Use tools to check for updates and vulnerabilities in Chart.js plugins.
    *   **Prompt Updates:** Apply security updates for Chart.js plugins promptly.
4. **Review Plugin's Interaction with Chart.js:**
     * Examine how data is passed between your application and the plugin, and then to Chart.js.
     * Ensure that the plugin itself is following the same data sanitization and validation principles before interacting with Chart.js.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **XSS via Chart.js Plugins:** (Severity: High) - Vulnerabilities in plugins can be exploited to inject malicious code through Chart.js.
*   **Other Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities (affecting Chart.js):** (Severity: Variable) - Plugins can introduce vulnerabilities that affect Chart.js's rendering or behavior.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks (targeting Chart.js plugins):** (Severity: High)

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Risk reduced.
*   **Other Plugin-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Risk reduced.
*   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Describe the current process, specifically mentioning Chart.js plugins (e.g., "We use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities in Chart.js plugins.  Plugins are manually reviewed before initial use, focusing on their interaction with Chart.js data and options.").

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Describe gaps (e.g., "No formal process for reviewing how plugins interact with Chart.js. Updates are not always applied promptly.").
