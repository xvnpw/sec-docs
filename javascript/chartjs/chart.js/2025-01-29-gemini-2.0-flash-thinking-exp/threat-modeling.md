# Threat Model Analysis for chartjs/chart.js

## Threat: [Indirect XSS via Unsanitized Labels/Tooltips/Titles](./threats/indirect_xss_via_unsanitized_labelstooltipstitles.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within data intended for chart labels, tooltips, or titles. If the application fails to sanitize this user-provided data *before* passing it to Chart.js, and if Chart.js (especially in older versions or specific configurations) renders these text elements without proper escaping, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The attacker could then execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or malicious redirects. While the root cause is application-side data handling, Chart.js is the rendering component that *could* facilitate the XSS if not used securely by the application.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - potential for complete compromise of the user's session and account, data theft, malware injection, and website defacement.
*   **Chart.js Component Affected:** Rendering of text elements within charts: labels, tooltips, titles, axis labels, legend labels. Specifically, the text rendering functions within Chart.js that handle these elements.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Critically important: Sanitize ALL user-provided data used for chart labels, tooltips, and titles *before* passing it to Chart.js.** Use robust HTML escaping or a similar sanitization method to prevent the interpretation of malicious code as HTML or JavaScript.
    *   Always use the latest stable version of Chart.js, as security patches for XSS vulnerabilities are regularly released.
    *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts, even if XSS is somehow injected.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability - Critical Chart.js Library Vulnerability](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_-_critical_chart_js_library_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** A critical security vulnerability is discovered within the Chart.js library code itself. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses a vulnerable version of Chart.js. The exploitation method and impact would be highly specific to the nature of the vulnerability. A critical vulnerability could potentially allow for Remote Code Execution (RCE), significant Denial of Service (DoS), or complete bypass of security controls within the client-side application.
*   **Impact:** Potentially Critical - Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the client-side, complete Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS), or significant security bypass depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Chart.js Component Affected:**  Unpredictable - could affect any module or function within Chart.js depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediately update Chart.js to the latest patched version as soon as a security advisory is released.** This is the most crucial step.
    *   Proactively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, GitHub security advisories for Chart.js) for any reported vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a rapid patch management process to quickly deploy updates for Chart.js and other dependencies when security vulnerabilities are discovered.
    *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in Chart.js and other client-side libraries used in your application.
