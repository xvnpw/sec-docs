# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a flexible and feature-rich JavaScript charting library for web developers.
  - Ensure ease of use and integration into various web projects.
  - Maintain broad browser compatibility and performance.
  - Foster a strong and active open-source community around the library.
  - Provide stable and reliable releases.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited in applications using it, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
  - Poor performance or lack of browser compatibility could limit adoption and user satisfaction.
  - Lack of community support or maintainability could lead to stagnation and eventual obsolescence of the library.
  - Breaking changes in new releases could disrupt existing applications and developer workflows.
  - Dependency on external services (like CDNs) could introduce availability risks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process via GitHub pull requests (implemented in GitHub repository contribution workflow).
  - security control: Automated testing (unit and integration tests) (implemented in GitHub Actions workflows).
  - security control: Use of linters and code formatters (likely implemented in development and CI processes, details in repository configuration).
  - security control: Dependency management using npm (package-lock.json for dependency version pinning, described in repository documentation).
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the library code due to complexity and open-source nature.
  - accepted risk: Risk of vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions, which may introduce security issues if not properly vetted.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
  - security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process for security issues discovered by the community or security researchers.
  - security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Consider code signing releases to ensure integrity and authenticity of distributed packages.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a client-side JavaScript library. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using the library.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a client-side JavaScript library. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using the library.
  - Input Validation: The library should handle potentially malicious or unexpected input data (chart data, configuration options) gracefully and prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting - XSS). Input validation should be implemented in the library's data processing and rendering logic (implementation details in the library's source code).
  - Cryptography: Not a primary requirement for a charting library itself. Cryptographic operations are the responsibility of the applications using the library if they need to handle sensitive data. However, the library should avoid introducing vulnerabilities that could be exploited by malicious scripts to access or manipulate cryptographic keys or operations performed by the application.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a reliable and secure JavaScript charting library to the open-source community and web developers.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Chart.js library and its distribution channels (npm, CDN).
  - Ensuring the continued development and maintenance of the library.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Chart.js source code: High sensitivity - compromise could lead to malicious modifications and widespread impact on applications using the library.
  - Build artifacts (npm packages, CDN files): High sensitivity - integrity is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks.
  - Project infrastructure (GitHub repository, CI/CD pipelines): Medium sensitivity - compromise could disrupt development and release processes.
  - User data processed by Chart.js: Low sensitivity for the library itself, as it primarily renders data provided by the application. However, the applications using Chart.js might handle sensitive data, and vulnerabilities in Chart.js could potentially be exploited to access or manipulate this data in the context of those applications. Sensitivity depends on the application's context.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports for Chart.js?
  - Are there any existing SAST or SCA tools integrated into the Chart.js build process?
  - Is there a formal security testing process beyond unit and integration tests?
  - What is the policy for updating dependencies and patching vulnerabilities in dependencies?
  - Are releases code-signed to ensure integrity?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a widely used, reliable, and feature-rich open-source charting library. Stability and ease of use are key priorities.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Current security controls are focused on standard open-source development practices (code review, testing). There is an accepted risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities. Recommended security controls (SAST, SCA, vulnerability response process) are not yet implemented but are considered high priority for improvement. Security requirements focus on input validation to prevent XSS and other client-side vulnerabilities.
  - DESIGN: The library is primarily deployed via CDN or npm and used in client-side web applications. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions.
