- **Vulnerability Name:** Unpinned GitHub Actions Versions in CI/CD Workflows

  - **Description:**
    The project’s GitHub workflows (in both `/code/.github/workflows/main.yml` and `/code/.github/workflows/publish.yml`) reference GitHub Actions by using version aliases (for example, `actions/checkout@v2`, `actions/setup-node@v2.5.0`, and similar for other actions) rather than pinning them to specific commit SHAs. An attacker who is able to compromise one of these upstream GitHub Action repositories can update the code for the entire major version. When a workflow is triggered (e.g., via a push, pull request, or release event), the runner will fetch the latest code matching that alias. This means that if an attacker introduces malicious code into one of these actions, the CI/CD process will unknowingly execute it.

    *Step-by-step triggering scenario:*
    1. An attacker identifies one of the actions referenced via a floating version (e.g., `actions/checkout@v2`).
    2. The attacker compromises the upstream GitHub Action so that a malicious commit is added to the branch corresponding to the alias (e.g., the latest commit in the `v2` branch).
    3. The next time any workflow is triggered (by a push, pull request, or manually via workflow dispatch), the compromised version of the action is automatically used.
    4. The malicious action code executes on the CI/CD runner, performing unintended operations (such as leaking secrets or altering build artifacts).

  - **Impact:**
    - **Confidentiality:** The attacker could extract sensitive data (for example, secrets like `VSCE_PAT`, `OVSX_PAT`, or `GITHUB_TOKEN`) from the CI/CD runtime.
    - **Integrity:** Malicious code injected into the build process may alter the produced VS Code extension (or other build artifacts), potentially embedding backdoors or other harmful modifications.
    - **Trust:** Users who install the extension from the marketplace may unwittingly run compromised code that affects their local environments.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The workflows do specify version tags (e.g., `@v2`, `@v2.5.0`), which provides a basic level of version restriction.
    - Repository secrets are managed via GitHub’s secrets storage and are not directly printed in logs.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The project does not pin GitHub Action dependencies to explicit commit SHAs, which would ensure the exact version of the action is used every time the workflow runs.
    - No additional verification (for example, using checksums or third‑party audits for the actions) is in place to detect if an upstream action has been modified unexpectedly.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The repository is public and triggers workflows on events including pushes, pull requests, or releases.
    - An attacker must be able to influence one of the referenced GitHub Actions repositories (for example, by compromising the upstream project or exploiting their update process).
    - The floating version alias (e.g., `@v2`) must resolve to a commit updated with malicious changes prior to the next workflow run.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/.github/workflows/main.yml`:
      - **Step “Checkout”:** Uses `actions/checkout@v2` without a commit SHA pinning, meaning the latest commit matching `v2` will be used.
      - **Step “Install Node.js”:** Uses `actions/setup-node@v2.5.0`, similarly relying on a floating version.
      - **Test Execution:** Runs `npm test` without further restrictions on actions versions.
    - In `/code/.github/workflows/publish.yml`:
      - **Checkout and Setup:** Also uses `actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/setup-node@v2` (in different steps) without commit-specific locking.
      - **Other Actions:** Steps such as `tvdias/github-tagger@v0.0.2` and `actions/upload-artifact@v2` are referenced by their version tags.
    - **Visualization:**
      - Imagine each workflow file as a series of steps that dynamically fetch code based on version aliases. Without commit-specific pins, every workflow trigger is like “pulling the latest update” from these actions’ repositories, potentially including malicious changes if an attacker has compromised one of them.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:**
       - Create a test fork of the repository and modify one of the workflow YAML files to reference a “controlled” version of one of the actions (simulate the scenario by pointing to a malicious variant hosted in a test environment).
       - Alternatively, use a mocked GitHub Action repository that behaves maliciously when triggered.
    2. **Trigger the Workflow:**
       - Push a commit to the `master` branch (or trigger a pull request event) so that the workflow defined in `main.yml` is executed.
    3. **Monitor Execution:**
       - Observe the workflow logs to see if the malicious code injected in the controlled GitHub Action is executed (for example, verify if unexpected commands run or if any secret is exposed in the logs).
       - Confirm that the build artifact (the VS Code extension package) is manipulated compared to a baseline run.
    4. **Mitigation Verification:**
       - Modify the workflow files to pin the actions to specific commit SHAs.
       - Re-run the workflow and confirm that the malicious behavior is no longer observed, ensuring that the pinning is effective in preventing this attack vector.

This vulnerability represents a real‑world supply chain risk in CI/CD pipelines that must be addressed to safeguard the build process and protect users from potentially compromised artifacts.
