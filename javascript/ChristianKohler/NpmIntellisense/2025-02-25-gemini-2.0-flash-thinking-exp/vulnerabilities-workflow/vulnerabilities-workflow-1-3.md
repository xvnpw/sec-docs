## Vulnerability List

There are no identified vulnerabilities with a rank of high or critical that meet the specified criteria in the provided project files.

**Explanation:**

After reviewing the provided files, which consist of documentation and CI/CD configuration for the "Npm Intellisense" VS Code extension, no vulnerabilities were found that are:

*   Valid and not already mitigated.
*   Ranked at least high.
*   Triggerable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance, and not excluded due to being:
    *   Caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns from the project files.
    *   Only missing documentation for mitigation.
    *   Denial of Service vulnerabilities.

The files analyzed include:

*   `/code/README.md`
*   `/code/CHANGELOG.md`
*   `/code/.github/workflows/main.yml`
*   `/code/.github/workflows/publish.yml`

These files primarily relate to documentation and CI/CD configuration and do not contain executable application code where high or critical vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers would typically reside.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided project files and the specified criteria, there are no vulnerabilities to list. A comprehensive security assessment would require access to the source code of the "Npm Intellisense" VS Code extension.
