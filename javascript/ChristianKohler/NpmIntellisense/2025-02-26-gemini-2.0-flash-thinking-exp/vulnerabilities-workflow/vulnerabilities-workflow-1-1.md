### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Path Traversal in Package Subfolder Intellisense

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can exploit the "Package Subfolder Intellisense" feature to perform path traversal.
    2. This feature, when enabled, allows browsing subfolders of npm modules for import autocompletion.
    3. The extension constructs a file path by joining the workspace root, 'node_modules', and user-provided input from the import statement.
    4. By crafting a malicious import path containing path traversal sequences like `../`, an attacker can force the extension to read directory listings from outside the intended `node_modules` directory.
    5. This can lead to information disclosure by exposing directory structures and file names from sensitive locations on the file system.

- **Impact:**
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker can list directories and files outside of the project's `node_modules` directory, potentially gaining access to sensitive information about the file system structure and file names. This information could be used to further plan attacks or gain unauthorized access.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly uses user-provided input to construct file paths without any sanitization or validation against path traversal sequences.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input Sanitization: The extension needs to sanitize the user-provided module path (`pkgFragmentSplit`) to remove or neutralize path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`).
    - Path Validation: Before reading directory contents, the extension should validate that the constructed path is still within the intended `node_modules` directory or a safe subdirectory.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The `npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense` setting must be enabled in the VS Code settings. This setting is disabled by default.
    - The user must be editing a JavaScript or TypeScript file within a VS Code workspace.
    - The user must trigger autocompletion within an import statement that includes a module name and attempts to browse subfolders (e.g., `import {} from 'module-name/'`).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability exists in the `readModuleSubFolders` function in `/code/src/provide.ts`.

    ```typescript
    function readModuleSubFolders(dependencies: string[], state: State, fsf: FsFunctions) {
        const fragments: Array<string> = state.textCurrentLine.split('from '); // Line 1
        const pkgFragment: string = fragments[fragments.length - 1].split(/['"]/)[1]; // Line 2
        const pkgFragmentSplit = pkgFragment.split('/'); // Line 3
        const packageName: string = pkgFragmentSplit[0]; // Line 4

        if (dependencies.filter(dep => dep === packageName).length) { // Line 5
            const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit); // Line 6
            // Todo: make the replace function work with other filetypes as well
            return fsf.readDir(path) // Line 7
                .then(files => files.map(file => pkgFragment + file.replace(/\.js$/, '')))
                .catch(err => ['']);
        }

        return Promise.resolve(dependencies);
    }
    ```

    - **Line 1-4:** The code extracts the module path (`pkgFragment`) from the current line of text in the editor (`state.textCurrentLine`), which is user-controlled input. It then splits this path into segments (`pkgFragmentSplit`).
    - **Line 6:** The code constructs a file path by joining `state.rootPath`, 'node_modules', and the segments from `pkgFragmentSplit` using `path.join`.  `path.join` itself does not prevent path traversal if `pkgFragmentSplit` contains `../`.
    - **Line 7:** `fsf.readDir(path)` attempts to read the directory listing at the constructed path. If `pkgFragmentSplit` contains path traversal sequences, `path` can point to a directory outside of `node_modules`, leading to the vulnerability.
    - **Line 5:** The check `dependencies.filter(dep => dep === packageName).length` is a weak mitigation. An attacker can still exploit the vulnerability by using a valid package name as the first segment and then injecting path traversal in subsequent segments.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open VS Code and create or open any Javascript or Typescript project.
    2. Enable the "Package Subfolder Intellisense" feature by setting `npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense` to `true` in VS Code settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings, then search for "npm-intellisense" and find "Package Subfolders Intellisense").
    3. Open any `.js` or `.ts` file in the project.
    4. In the editor, type the following line, replacing `'your-package-name'` with any package name that is listed in your project's `package.json` dependencies or devDependencies (or even a dummy name if you just want to test path traversal outside of node_modules):
       ```typescript
       import {} from 'your-package-name/../'
       ```
    5. Place the cursor at the end of the line (after `/../`) and trigger autocompletion. This is usually done by typing `/` or triggering suggestions manually (e.g., Ctrl+Space or Cmd+Space).
    6. Observe the autocompletion suggestions. If the vulnerability exists, you will see file and directory names from outside the `node_modules` directory, potentially starting from your workspace root or even higher, depending on how many `../` sequences you used. For example, you might see files and directories like `.git`, `src`, `package.json`, etc., in the suggestion list.
