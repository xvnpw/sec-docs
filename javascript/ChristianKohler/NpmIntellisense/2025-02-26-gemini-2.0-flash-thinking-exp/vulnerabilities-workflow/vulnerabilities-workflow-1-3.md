### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal in Package Subfolder Intellisense
- Description:
    1. An attacker can exploit the "Package Subfolder Intellisense" feature when it is enabled.
    2. When a user types an import statement like `import something from 'package-name/subfolder'`, the extension attempts to list subfolders within the `node_modules/package-name/subfolder` directory to provide autocompletion.
    3. If an attacker crafts a malicious import path such as `import something from 'package-name/../'`, the extension might attempt to read directories outside the intended `node_modules/package-name` directory due to path traversal.
    4. Although `path.join` is used, if the base path (`node_modules/package-name`) contains symbolic links or other path manipulation techniques within the installed package, it might be possible to traverse out of the intended directory.
    5. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to list the contents of directories outside the project's `node_modules` folder, potentially leading to information disclosure of sensitive files on the developer's machine if the workspace root is located in a sensitive area.
- Impact: Information Disclosure. An attacker could potentially list files and directories outside of the intended `node_modules` path, leading to exposure of directory structure and filenames. Depending on the workspace location, this could expose sensitive information.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The code uses `path.join` but doesn't explicitly sanitize or validate the `pkgFragmentSplit` to prevent path traversal.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization of the `pkgFragmentSplit` in the `readModuleSubFolders` function to prevent path traversal attempts.
    - Restrict directory listing to within the intended module's directory and prevent traversal to parent directories.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the "Package Subfolder Intellisense" feature enabled in their VS Code settings (`"npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense": true`). This feature is experimental and disabled by default, but a user might enable it.
    - The user must be working on a Javascript or Typescript project opened in VS Code with `node_modules` directory.
    - The attacker needs to induce the user to type a crafted import statement that includes path traversal sequences like `../`.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File:** `/code/src/provide.ts`
    2. **Function:** `readModuleSubFolders(dependencies: string[], state: State, fsf: FsFunctions)`
    3. **Line:**
    ```typescript
    const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit);
    ```
    - `pkgFragmentSplit` is derived from user input (`state.textCurrentLine`) and split by `/`.
    - If `pkgFragmentSplit` contains path traversal elements like `..`, `path.join` will resolve them.
    - For example, if `pkgFragmentSplit` is `['lodash', '..', '..', 'sensitive-dir']` and `state.rootPath` is `/home/user/project`, then `path` will become `/home/user/sensitive-dir`.
    - **Line:**
    ```typescript
    return fsf.readDir(path)
    ```
    - `fsf.readDir(path)` attempts to read the directory content at the potentially traversed path.
    - If successful, the extension will list files from the potentially traversed directory.
    - If `fsf.readDir` is allowed to read arbitrary directories due to path traversal, it leads to information disclosure.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
        A[User types import statement with crafted path] --> B{readModuleSubFolders function};
        B --> C{Extract pkgFragmentSplit from user input};
        C --> D{Construct path using path.join with pkgFragmentSplit};
        D --> E{fsf.readDir(path)};
        E -- Success --> F[List files from potentially traversed directory];
        E -- Error --> G[Handle error];
    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Precondition:** Ensure "Package Subfolder Intellisense" is enabled in VS Code settings (`"npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense": true`).
    2. Open a Javascript or Typescript project in VS Code that has a `node_modules` directory.
    3. Create a new Javascript/Typescript file or open an existing one.
    4. Type the following import statement, intentionally using path traversal `../` to try and access the project's root directory (or a directory above if possible):
    ```typescript
    import test from 'lodash/../../';
    ```
    5. Observe if the autocompletion suggests files and directories from outside the `node_modules/lodash` directory, specifically from the project's root directory or above.
    6. If the autocompletion list shows files or directories from a location outside of the intended `node_modules/lodash` directory (e.g., project root, parent directories), then the path traversal vulnerability is confirmed.
    7. For further verification, try to traverse to more sensitive directories if the project root is not sensitive enough, e.g., if project root is in `/home/user/project`, try `lodash/../../../home/user/.ssh` (depending on OS and permissions). Observe if files from `~/.ssh` are suggested (this might be restricted by file system permissions, but even attempting to list is a vulnerability).
