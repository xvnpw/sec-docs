- **Vulnerability Name:** Path Traversal via Package Subfolder Intellisense  
  **Description:**  
  The extension’s experimental “packageSubfoldersIntellisense” feature takes the current line from the active editor and parses it to determine a module path. In doing so, it splits the module specifier string (the text following the keyword “from”) and then uses Node’s path‑joining function without sanitizing any relative path components. An attacker who controls the contents of a workspace file (for example, by including a crafted import statement) can inject “../” segments after a valid dependency name. For example, if the workspace’s package.json lists “lodash” as a dependency, an attacker could write an import such as:  
  ```
  import foo from 'lodash/../../sensitive_directory'
  ```  
  When the extension processes this line (after “packageSubfoldersIntellisense” is enabled), it calls a routine that uses the unsanitized segments to build a filesystem path. Because the join operation simply concatenates segments and then normalizes the resulting path, the “../” parts can traverse outside the intended “node_modules” directory. As a result, the extension may list files from an arbitrary directory (relative to the workspace root), disclosing directory contents that the user did not intend to expose.

  **Impact:**  
  An attacker who supplies (or “tricks” a user into opening) a file with a malicious import statement can force the extension to perform a directory listing on an unintended filesystem location. This leads to an information disclosure vulnerability where sensitive files or directory structures inside the workspace (or even beyond if the workspace root contains sensitive data) may be enumerated and revealed via the completion items.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • There is no input sanitization in the implementation of the package subfolder lookup.  
  • The code simply uses the text from the active editor to build the filesystem path via Node’s `join` without disallowing relative path (“../”) segments.

  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Input validation and sanitization on the module specifier parsed from the editor text. In particular, the code should detect and disallow or properly resolve any “../” sequences so that the lookup is constrained to the intended module directory inside “node_modules.”  
  • A strict whitelist or path–restriction mechanism ensuring that only subfolders within the valid dependency directory are accessed.

  **Preconditions:**  
  • The experimental setting “packageSubfoldersIntellisense” must be enabled in the user’s configuration.  
  • The workspace’s package.json must list a dependency that matches the first segment of the crafted module specifier.  
  • The active file must include an import statement which the attacker has crafted to include relative path traversal segments (for example, containing “../”).

  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  1. In `src/provide.ts`, the function `readModuleSubFolders` is called when the configuration key `packageSubfoldersIntellisense` is enabled.  
  2. The function starts by splitting the current line (taken from the active editor via `state.textCurrentLine`) using `"from "` as the delimiter. The last fragment is then split using a regular expression (`/['"]/`) to isolate the module specifier (assigned to `pkgFragment`).  
  3. The module specifier is then split by the slash character (`/`) into an array (`pkgFragmentSplit`). The first element (`packageName`) is used to check against the list of declared dependencies.  
  4. If the dependency is found among the project’s dependencies, the code computes a new path by calling:  
     ```js
     const path = join(state.rootPath, 'node_modules', ...pkgFragmentSplit);
     ```  
     Since `pkgFragmentSplit` comes directly from the unvalidated module specifier, any “../” segments will be passed to `join`. Node’s path joining and normalization will resolve these segments and potentially produce a path outside the intended “node_modules/<dependency>” folder.  
  5. The function then calls `fsf.readDir(path)` in an attempt to list files from the computed directory. If the attacker’s injected path leads to an unintended directory (for example, one containing sensitive project files), the file list is returned and later used to create completion items (potentially disclosing the directory structure).

  **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup:**  
     - Ensure that the extension is installed and that the experimental feature “packageSubfoldersIntellisense” is enabled in the settings (for example, by setting `"npm-intellisense.packageSubfoldersIntellisense": true`).  
     - In the workspace’s package.json, include a dependency entry such as `"lodash": "version"` so that “lodash” is a recognized dependency.
  2. **Test File Creation:**  
     - Create or open a JavaScript/TypeScript file in the workspace.  
     - Add an import statement with a crafted specifier that includes path traversal, for example:  
       ```js
       import foo from 'lodash/../../sensitive_directory'
       ```  
     - Ensure that the directory `sensitive_directory` exists relative to the workspace root (or point to a directory that contains files you expect to be out of scope).
  3. **Triggering the Vulnerability:**  
     - Place the cursor in the active editor on the line with the malicious import statement so that the extension’s completion (or “Import” command) is triggered.  
     - Observe that the extension attempts to list the subfolder contents by calling `fsf.readDir` on the constructed path.
  4. **Verification:**  
     - Check the QuickPick UI (or any other output from the extension) to verify that the returned file names include entries from the directory targeted by the injected traversal (for instance, from “sensitive_directory”).  
     - Confirm that the files or directories returned were not within the expected “node_modules/lodash” folder but were instead resolved to the unintended location.
  5. **Conclusion:**  
     - If the files from the unauthorized directory are visible in the autocompletion results, the test confirms that the vulnerability is present.

By addressing the unsanitized path joining in the package subfolder lookup, the risk of unauthorized directory traversal and information disclosure can be mitigated.
