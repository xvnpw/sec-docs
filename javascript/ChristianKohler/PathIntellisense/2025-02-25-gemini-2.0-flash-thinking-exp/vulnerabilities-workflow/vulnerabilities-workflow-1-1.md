### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal via Malicious Workspace Mappings
- Description: A malicious user can craft a workspace configuration with a `path-intellisense.mappings` setting that points to locations outside the intended workspace. When the Path Intellisense plugin uses these mappings to resolve file paths for autocompletion, it may access files outside the workspace, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- Impact: Information disclosure. An attacker could potentially read sensitive files on the user's file system if the plugin reads the content of the files it resolves for autocompletion (which is likely to provide file path suggestions).
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None apparent from the provided files. The README describes the feature, but not any security considerations.
- Missing mitigations: Input validation and sanitization for the `path-intellisense.mappings` setting. The plugin should ensure that mappings stay within the workspace or intended directories and prevent path traversal.  It should also restrict file access to only within the workspace.
- Preconditions:
    - User installs the Path Intellisense plugin.
    - Attacker convinces the user to open a malicious workspace that contains a crafted `.vscode/settings.json` file with malicious mappings.
- Source code analysis:
    - (No source code provided, so this analysis is hypothetical based on plugin description)
    - The plugin reads the `path-intellisense.mappings` from the workspace settings (`.vscode/settings.json`).
    - When the user types a path in the editor, the plugin uses these mappings to resolve the path.
    - For example, if the mapping is `"/": "/"` and the user types `/etc/passwd`, the plugin resolves this to `/etc/passwd`.
    - The plugin then attempts to access and read the file at `/etc/passwd` to provide autocompletion suggestions.
    - If there are no checks to ensure that the resolved path is within the workspace or allowed directories, path traversal occurs.
- Security test case:
    1. Create a public malicious Git repository.
    2. In the repository, create a `.vscode` folder.
    3. In the `.vscode` folder, create a `settings.json` file.
    4. In `settings.json`, add the following configuration:
        ```json
        {
            "path-intellisense.mappings": {
                "/": "/"
            }
        }
        ```
    5. Add a README.md to the repository to make it seem plausible.
    6. Publish the repository on GitHub or a similar platform.
    7. As a victim, clone the malicious repository to your local machine.
    8. Open the cloned repository in Visual Studio Code with the Path Intellisense plugin installed.
    9. Create or open a file (e.g., `test.js`).
    10. In `test.js`, type `require('/etc/passwd')` or `import '/etc/passwd'`.
    11. Observe if Path Intellisense attempts to access or provide autocompletion suggestions for files under `/etc/passwd`.
    12. To confirm the vulnerability, use a process monitor (like Sysmon on Windows or `fs_usage` on macOS/Linux) to monitor file system access by the VS Code process when typing the path. Filter for processes related to VS Code or the Path Intellisense extension. If the plugin attempts to read `/etc/passwd` or files under `/etc/passwd`, it confirms the path traversal vulnerability.
