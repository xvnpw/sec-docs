### Vulnerability: Path Traversal via `absolutePathTo` Configuration

**Description:**

1.  An attacker can craft a malicious VS Code workspace configuration and trick a user into opening this workspace. This could be achieved by sending a user a link to a Git repository containing the malicious workspace configuration.
2.  The malicious workspace configuration, specifically the `.vscode/settings.json` file, will contain a setting to override the `path-intellisense.absolutePathTo` configuration. This setting can be set to a path outside the intended workspace, for example, pointing to the root directory or a parent directory using path traversal sequences like `"../../../"`. Alternatively, the attacker can set `absolutePathToWorkspace` to `false` to make absolute paths resolve from the disk root if `absolutePathTo` is not explicitly set.
3.  When the user opens a file within this workspace and triggers the Path Intellisense extension (e.g., by typing an import statement and then a forward slash, quote, or double quote to trigger path completion), the extension reads the workspace configuration, including the attacker-controlled `absolutePathTo` setting or the `absolutePathToWorkspace` setting.
4.  The extension's path resolution logic uses the `absolutePathTo` setting (or the workspace root if `absolutePathToWorkspace` is true and `absolutePathTo` is not set) as the base directory for resolving file paths. The function `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` computes the folder from which to list files, normalizing user-supplied text from import statements using `path.normalize`, but without enforcing that the resolved path stays within a safe area.
5.  If the user, either intentionally or unintentionally, types path traversal characters (like `../` or `/`) in their import statement or path, the extension will interpret these relative to the attacker-specified `absolutePathTo` path, or the disk root if `absolutePathToWorkspace` is false and `absolutePathTo` is not set.
6.  This allows the extension to suggest files and directories from locations outside the intended workspace directory, effectively enabling path traversal and arbitrary file disclosure. If the attacker sets `absolutePathTo` to the root directory (`/`) or uses `absolutePathToWorkspace=false` without other restrictions, the extension could potentially provide suggestions for any file on the user's file system, limited by the permissions of the VS Code process.

**Impact:**

-   **Information Disclosure**: A successful path traversal attack can allow the attacker to list and potentially read file names and directory contents outside the intended workspace scope. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as source code, configuration files, private keys, personal documents, or system files, depending on the user's file system and the permissions of the VS Code process. This leakage may include sensitive configuration files, credentials, or system files that can aid further exploitation.
-   **Further Exploitation**: While the extension itself might not directly execute code, the information disclosed could be used to plan further attacks. For instance, exposed configuration files might contain credentials, or source code might reveal other vulnerabilities in related systems or applications.

**Vulnerability Rank:** High

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**

-   None. The extension directly uses the configured `absolutePathTo` value without sanitization or validation.
-   The code uses `path.normalize` and `path.join` in path construction, but these functions do not enforce any security boundary.
-   There is a “filesExclude” filter applied after reading the directory, but it only filters out files matching configured glob patterns and does not prevent directory traversal.
-   The documentation warns about how these settings work; however, no runtime enforcement or validation of the chosen root is performed.

**Missing Mitigations:**

-   **Input Sanitization and Validation**: The extension should sanitize and validate the `absolutePathTo` configuration value. This could include:
    -   Checking if the provided path is within the workspace directory or a predefined safe directory.
    -   Removing or escaping path traversal characters (e.g., `../`, `..\\`).
    -   Using secure path manipulation functions that prevent traversal.
-   **Workspace Scope Enforcement**: The extension should enforce that path suggestions are always within the intended workspace scope, regardless of the `absolutePathTo` setting. This might involve resolving paths relative to the workspace root and preventing users from traversing above it.
-   **Strict Boundary Check**: Implement runtime checks that restrict the effective root for absolute paths to a safe subset (for example, forcing resolution only within the workspace).
-   **Path Validation**: The extension should validate that the resolved path based on `absolutePathTo` stays within the intended boundaries (e.g., workspace root or a predefined safe directory).

**Preconditions:**

-   The user must have the Path Intellisense extension installed and activated in VS Code.
-   The user must open a workspace that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file crafted by the attacker, or be in a workspace where the `absolutePathToWorkspace` setting is set to false (or `absolutePathTo` is configured to point outside the workspace).
-   The attacker must be able to modify the VS Code workspace settings (e.g., by convincing a user to open a malicious workspace or by modifying a shared workspace configuration).
-   The `path-intellisense.absolutePathToWorkspace` setting must be enabled (or implicitly default to true) for `absolutePathTo` based traversal, or set to false for disk root traversal.
-   The user must trigger path completion within a file in the malicious workspace, typically by typing an import statement and then initiating path suggestions (e.g., by typing `/`, `"`, or `'`).
-   The extension must be used in an environment where the attacker can supply or influence file content that contains import statements (e.g., a shared or publicly exposed workspace).
-   The attacker must be able to cause the completion provider to process an import string containing directory traversal sequences.

**Source Code Analysis:**

1.  **`src/configuration/configuration.service.ts:resolveAbsolutePathTo`**: This function resolves the `absolutePathTo` configuration value.
    ```typescript
    function resolveAbsolutePathTo(
      cfgPath?: string,
      workfolder?: vscode.WorkspaceFolder
    ): string | null {
      const rootPath = workfolder?.uri.path;

      return rootPath && cfgPath
        ? replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath(cfgPath, rootPath)
        : null;
    }
    ```
    This function takes the user-provided `cfgPath` and uses `replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath` to replace placeholders. It does not perform any sanitization or validation to prevent path traversal.

2.  **`src/utils/file-utills.ts:replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath`**: This function replaces placeholders like `${workspaceFolder}` with the workspace root path.
    ```typescript
    export function replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath(
      value: string,
      rootPath: string
    ) {
      return value
        .replace("${workspaceRoot}", rootPath)
        .replace("${workspaceFolder}", rootPath);
    }
    ```
    This function only performs string replacement and does not sanitize or validate the resulting path.

3.  **`src/utils/file-utills.ts:getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles`**: This function uses the resolved `rootPath` (which can be influenced by `absolutePathTo`) and `path.join` to construct the path for file lookup.
    ```typescript
    export function getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles(
      fileName: string,
      text: string | undefined,
      rootPath?: string, // <--- Attacker controlled rootPath
      mappings?: Mapping[]
    ): string {
      const normalizedText = path.normalize(text || "");
      let rootFolder: string;
      const isPathAbsolute = normalizedText.startsWith(path.sep);
      let pathEntered = normalizedText;

      rootFolder = isPathAbsolute ? rootPath || "" : path.dirname(fileName);

      return path.join(rootFolder, pathEntered); // <--- path.join with attacker controlled rootFolder and user input
    }
    ```
    `path.join` itself is safe, but if `rootFolder` is maliciously crafted using `absolutePathTo`, or if `rootPath` is the disk root due to misconfiguration, it will join paths outside the intended workspace. The input parameter `text` is normalized using `path.normalize`, but this does not prevent traversal if the base `rootFolder` is already outside the intended boundaries.

4.  **`src/configuration/configuration.service.ts:getConfiguration`**: Reads configuration, including `absolutePathToWorkspace` and `absolutePathTo` from user settings.
    ```typescript
    export function getConfiguration(
      folder: vscode.WorkspaceFolder | undefined
    ): Configuration {
      const workspaceConfiguration = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration(
        "path-intellisense",
        folder?.uri
      );

      const absolutePathToWorkspace = workspaceConfiguration.get<boolean>(
        "absolutePathToWorkspace",
        true // default value
      );
      const absolutePathTo = workspaceConfiguration.get<string>(
        "absolutePathTo",
        undefined
      );

      return {
        absolutePathToWorkspace: absolutePathToWorkspace === true,
        absolutePathTo: absolutePathTo,
        // ... other configurations
      };
    }
    ```

5.  **JavaScript and Nix Providers**: Use the configuration to determine `rootPath`:
    ```typescript
    const rootPath = config.absolutePathTo || (config.absolutePathToWorkspace ? workspace?.uri.fsPath : undefined);
    ```
    This logic, combined with the lack of sanitization, allows an attacker-controlled or misconfigured `absolutePathTo` to dictate the root for path resolution, leading to traversal.

6.  **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (in import statement) --> createContext --> JavaScriptProvider/NixProvider --> provideCompletionItems
                                                                    |
                                                                    V
    getConfiguration --> reads path-intellisense.absolutePathTo & absolutePathToWorkspace from .vscode/settings.json (ATTACKER CONTROLLED)
                                                                    |
                                                                    V
    resolveAbsolutePathTo --> replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath (NO SANITIZATION) --> rootPath
                                                                    |
                                                                    V
    getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles(..., rootPath, ...) --> path.join(rootFolder, user_path_input) --> file system path for suggestions
    ```

**Security Test Case:**

1.  **Setup Malicious Workspace:**
    -   Create a new directory, e.g., `path-traversal-test`.
    -   Inside `path-traversal-test`, create a `.vscode` directory.
    -   Inside `.vscode`, create a `settings.json` file with the following content to test `absolutePathTo` traversal:
        ```json
        {
          "path-intellisense.absolutePathTo": "${workspaceFolder}/../../../",
          "path-intellisense.showOnAbsoluteSlash": true
        }
        ```
    -   Alternatively, to test disk root access via misconfiguration, use:
        ```json
        {
          "path-intellisense.absolutePathToWorkspace": false,
          "path-intellisense.showOnAbsoluteSlash": true
        }
        ```
    -   Open the `path-traversal-test` directory as a workspace in VS Code.
    -   Create a JavaScript file named `test.js` in the `path-traversal-test` workspace.

2.  **Trigger Path Completion:**
    -   In `test.js`, type the following import statement: `import {} from "/../../` (for `absolutePathTo` traversal test) or `import {} from "/etc/` (for disk root access test).  Do not close the quote to trigger path completion. This will trigger path completion after typing the last `/`.

3.  **Observe Completion Suggestions:**
    -   Observe the completion suggestions provided by Path Intellisense.
    -   **Expected Vulnerability (`absolutePathTo` traversal)**: The suggestions should include directories and files from outside the `path-traversal-test` workspace. If `absolutePathTo` is correctly traversed to parent directories, you might see directories and files from parent directories of your workspace.
    -   **Expected Vulnerability (Disk Root Access)**: The suggestions should include directories and files from the root directory of the file system (e.g., top-level directories like `Applications`, `Users`, `etc`, etc., depending on your OS and file system structure).

4.  **Verify Information Disclosure:**
    -   If you see files and directories from outside your intended workspace, especially sensitive system directories like `/etc` or user home directories, the vulnerability is confirmed. The extension is suggesting files from locations it should not have access to based on the intended workspace scope.

5.  **Mitigation Verification (After Mitigation is Implemented):**
    -   After implementing sanitization and validation for `absolutePathTo` and/or enforcing workspace scope, repeat steps 1-3.
    -   **Expected Mitigation**: The completion suggestions should now be restricted to files and directories within the `path-traversal-test` workspace, or a safe, predefined scope. Suggestions from outside the workspace (e.g., from parent directories or the root directory) should no longer be presented, indicating that the path traversal vulnerability has been successfully mitigated.
