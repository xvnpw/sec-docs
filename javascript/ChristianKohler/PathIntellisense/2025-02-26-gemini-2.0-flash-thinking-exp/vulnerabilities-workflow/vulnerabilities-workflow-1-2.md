- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Disclosure via Directory Traversal in File Lookup
  **Description:**
  The function that computes the folder from which to list files (located in `src/utils/file-utills.ts`) accepts the “text” (typically extracted from an import statement) and “normalizes” it using `path.normalize` but does not enforce that the resolved path remains within a safe area. An attacker who supplies an import string containing directory traversal sequences (for example, using `"../../etc/"`) can cause the computed folder to resolve outside the intended workspace (for example, to `/etc`). When the extension later calls `vscode.workspace.fs.readDirectory` on that computed path, it will list files from an arbitrary location.
  **Impact:**
  An attacker can force the extension to disclose directory contents (and by extension, file names and metadata) from locations outside the project workspace. This leakage may include sensitive configuration files, credentials, or system files that can aid further exploitation.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The code uses `path.normalize` and `path.join` to combine the user-supplied text with a root folder, but these functions do not enforce any security boundary.
  • There is a “filesExclude” filter applied after reading the directory—but it only filters out files matching configured glob patterns and does not stop directory traversal.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • A strict boundary check is missing that validates the resolved path against an allowed base (for example, ensuring it does not leave the workspace folder).
  • Input sanitization to reject or remove traversal substrings (such as `"../"`) before using them to compute file paths.
  **Preconditions:**
  • The extension must be used in an environment where the attacker can supply or influence file content that contains import statements (e.g. a shared or publicly exposed workspace).
  • The attacker must be able to cause the completion provider to process an import string containing directory traversal sequences.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In `getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles` (located in `src/utils/file-utills.ts`), the input parameter `text` is normalized:
  `const normalizedText = path.normalize(text || "");`
  • The function then determines a “rootFolder” based on whether the normalized text starts with the system path separator—if it does, `rootPath` (or an empty string) is used.
  • There is no check to ensure that after joining, the resulting path (even if it contains segments like `"../"`) remains within an approved directory.
  • As a result, an import like `"../../etc/"` can be transformed into a file system path pointing to `/etc` (or another sensitive directory).
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Open (or create) a file in the workspace and insert an import statement with a traversal-based path such as:
  `import {} from "/../../etc/";`
  2. Position the cursor immediately after the import string to trigger the autocomplete/completion provider.
  3. Observe the list of completion items returned by the extension.
  4. If files or directories from a sensitive system folder (for example, `/etc`) appear in the completion suggestions, then the vulnerability is confirmed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Misconfiguration‑Based Arbitrary File Access via Absolute Path Resolution
  **Description:**
  The extension supports configuration options that affect how absolute paths are resolved. In particular, the setting `absolutePathToWorkspace` (and the related `absolutePathTo`) controls whether an import beginning with “/” is resolved relative to the workspace root or the disk root. When `absolutePathToWorkspace` is set to false (or overridden by a value of `absolutePathTo`), an absolute import might resolve to a directory on the disk (such as the system root). An attacker who can manipulate file content or workspace settings may supply import strings that, together with such a configuration, drive the extension to reveal files outside the intended project folder.
  **Impact:**
  Sensitive files outside the workspace—including system files or other applications’ configuration files—could be inadvertently enumerated and disclosed via the autocomplete suggestions. This may expose useful information for further attacks.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • The configuration is read cleanly from the workspace settings (see `src/configuration/configuration.service.ts`) and then applied to control the resolution of absolute paths.
  • The documentation warns how these settings work; however, no runtime enforcement or validation of the chosen root is performed.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Implement runtime checks that restrict the effective root for absolute paths to a safe subset (for example, forcing resolution only within the workspace).
  • Validate and sanitize the user-supplied configuration values to prevent them from inadvertently allowing resolution to the disk root.
  **Preconditions:**
  • The extension is deployed in an environment where configuration settings can be influenced by an attacker (for example, via a compromised workspace or a multi‐tenant setup in a publicly accessible instance).
  • The attacker can supply import statements that begin with “/” so they are resolved relative to a misconfigured absolute path.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  • In `getConfiguration` (located in `src/configuration/configuration.service.ts`), the settings `absolutePathToWorkspace` and `absolutePathTo` are read from the user configuration.
  • Later in both the JavaScript and Nix providers, the code computes the “rootPath” using these configuration values:
  `const rootPath = config.absolutePathTo || (config.absolutePathToWorkspace ? workspace?.uri.fsPath : undefined);`
  • Without a check to force the resolved path to remain inside the workspace, an attacker–chosen absolute path (or one misconfigured to use the disk root) can allow file system lookup in unintended areas.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In the workspace settings, set `absolutePathToWorkspace` to false and configure `absolutePathTo` to a value that points to the disk root (for example, `"${workspaceFolder}/.."` or simply configure it to resolve to `/`).
  2. Open (or create) a file and insert an import statement such as:
  `import {} from "/etc/";`
  3. Trigger the extension’s completion provider by positioning the cursor appropriately.
  4. Check whether the completion suggestions include files from outside the intended project (for example, files from `/etc`).
  5. If the autocomplete returns sensitive files from a system directory, the vulnerability is confirmed.
