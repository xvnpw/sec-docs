### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal via `absolutePathTo` Configuration
- Description:
    1. An attacker can configure the `path-intellisense.absolutePathTo` setting in VS Code workspace settings to include path traversal characters, such as `..`.
    2. When the extension is triggered to provide path completion suggestions, the extension uses the user-provided `absolutePathTo` value as a base path for file system lookups.
    3. By crafting a malicious `absolutePathTo` value, an attacker can cause the extension to list directories and files outside the intended workspace directory.
    4. This can be triggered in any file type supported by the extension (JavaScript, Nix, etc.) when path completion is activated (e.g., by typing `/` or quotes).
- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially list files and directories outside the workspace, gaining access to sensitive information if the VS Code process has sufficient permissions.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The extension directly uses the configured `absolutePathTo` value without sanitization.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Path sanitization: The extension should sanitize the `absolutePathTo` configuration value to prevent path traversal sequences like `..`.
    - Path validation: The extension should validate that the resolved path based on `absolutePathTo` stays within the intended boundaries (e.g., workspace root or a predefined safe directory).
- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must be able to modify the VS Code workspace settings (e.g., by convincing a user to open a malicious workspace or by modifying a shared workspace configuration).
    - The `path-intellisense.absolutePathToWorkspace` setting must be enabled (or `absolutePathTo` is used in a way that it resolves outside workspace).
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`src/configuration/configuration.service.ts:resolveAbsolutePathTo`**: This function resolves the `absolutePathTo` configuration value.
    ```typescript
    function resolveAbsolutePathTo(
      cfgPath?: string,
      workfolder?: vscode.WorkspaceFolder
    ): string | null {
      const rootPath = workfolder?.uri.path;

      return rootPath && cfgPath
        ? replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath(cfgPath, rootPath)
        : null;
    }
    ```
    This function takes the user-provided `cfgPath` and uses `replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath` to replace placeholders. It does not perform any sanitization or validation to prevent path traversal.

    2. **`src/utils/file-utills.ts:replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath`**: This function replaces placeholders like `${workspaceFolder}` with the workspace root path.
    ```typescript
    export function replaceWorkspaceFolderWithRootPath(
      value: string,
      rootPath: string
    ) {
      return value
        .replace("${workspaceRoot}", rootPath)
        .replace("${workspaceFolder}", rootPath);
    }
    ```
    This function only performs string replacement and does not sanitize or validate the resulting path.

    3. **`src/utils/file-utills.ts:getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles`**: This function uses the resolved `rootPath` (which can be influenced by `absolutePathTo`) and `path.join` to construct the path for file lookup.
    ```typescript
    export function getPathOfFolderToLookupFiles(
      fileName: string,
      text: string | undefined,
      rootPath?: string,
      mappings?: Mapping[]
    ): string {
      // ...
      rootFolder = isPathAbsolute ? rootPath || "" : path.dirname(fileName);
      // ...
      return path.join(rootFolder, pathEntered);
    }
    ```
    `path.join` itself is safe, but if `rootFolder` is maliciously crafted using `absolutePathTo`, it will join paths outside the intended workspace.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Open VS Code with a workspace.
    2. Create a new workspace settings file (`.vscode/settings.json`).
    3. Add the following configuration to the `settings.json` to set a malicious `absolutePathTo` value that traverses up one directory from the workspace root:
    ```json
    {
        "path-intellisense.absolutePathToWorkspace": true,
        "path-intellisense.absolutePathTo": "${workspaceFolder}/../",
        "path-intellisense.showOnAbsoluteSlash": true
    }
    ```
    4. Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `test.js`) in the workspace.
    5. In `test.js`, type the following line to trigger path completion:
    ```javascript
    import {} from "/";
    ```
    6. Observe the completion suggestions. If the vulnerability exists, you will see directories and files listed from the parent directory of your workspace, indicating successful path traversal. For example, if your workspace is in `/home/user/myproject`, you might see directories like `user`, `home`, `etc`, etc. in the suggestions, which are outside `/home/user/myproject`.
