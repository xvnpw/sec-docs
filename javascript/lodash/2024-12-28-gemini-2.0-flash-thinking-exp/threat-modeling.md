*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution via Deep Merge/Set
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input (e.g., a JSON object) that, when processed by Lodash's `_.merge`, `_.mergeWith`, `_.defaultsDeep`, or `_.set` functions, injects properties into the `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes. This can overwrite existing properties or add new ones, affecting the behavior of other objects in the application.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to denial of service by causing unexpected errors, information disclosure by manipulating object properties used in security checks, or in some scenarios, even remote code execution if the polluted prototype properties are later used in a vulnerable way.
    *   **Lodash Component Affected:** Modules and functions related to deep object manipulation, specifically `_.merge`, `_.mergeWith`, `_.defaultsDeep`, and `_.set`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the application's usage of object properties).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Lodash updated to the latest version, as security patches often address prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
        *   Carefully sanitize or validate user-provided input before using it with Lodash's deep merge/set functions.
        *   Avoid using deep merge/set functions directly on user-controlled data. Consider alternative approaches or explicitly define the allowed properties.
        *   Freeze or seal objects when possible to prevent modification of their prototypes.

*   **Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted input strings that cause Lodash functions utilizing vulnerable regular expressions (internally) to enter a catastrophic backtracking state. This leads to excessive CPU consumption and can result in a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, impacting availability for legitimate users.
    *   **Lodash Component Affected:** Functions that perform string manipulation or pattern matching internally using regular expressions (specific vulnerable functions may vary across Lodash versions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerable function and the application's exposure to user-provided strings).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Lodash updated, as updates may include fixes for vulnerable regular expressions.
        *   Be cautious when using Lodash functions to process untrusted or user-provided strings, especially in scenarios involving complex pattern matching.
        *   Implement timeouts for string processing operations if feasible.
        *   Consider using alternative, more performant, and less vulnerable string manipulation methods if the risk is significant.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack - Compromised Lodash Package
    *   **Description:** Although highly unlikely for a widely used library like Lodash, a malicious actor could potentially compromise the official Lodash package on npm or other package registries and inject malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially severe, including remote code execution on servers and client machines, data theft, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Lodash Component Affected:** The entire Lodash library.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use package integrity checks (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`) to verify the integrity of installed packages.
        *   Consider using a private npm registry or dependency management tools with security scanning capabilities.
        *   Regularly review project dependencies and be aware of any security advisories related to Lodash.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.
