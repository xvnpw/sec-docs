*   **Attack Surface: Prototype Pollution**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker can manipulate the properties of built-in JavaScript object prototypes (like `Object.prototype`). This can lead to unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, and potentially even remote code execution if these polluted properties are later accessed and used by the application's code.
    *   **How Lodash Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Lodash functions that deeply merge or set object properties, such as `_.merge`, `_.mergeWith`, `_.defaultsDeep`, `_.set`, and `_.assign`, can be exploited if attacker-controlled input is used as keys in the objects being merged or set. These functions can traverse the prototype chain and modify inherited properties.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Vulnerable code using _.merge
        const userInput = JSON.parse('{"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}');
        const obj = {};
        _.merge(obj, userInput);

        // Now, any object created will inherit isAdmin = true
        const newObj = {};
        console.log(newObj.isAdmin); // Output: true
        ```
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to privilege escalation, denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution depending on how the polluted properties are used within the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using Lodash functions that perform deep merges or sets with user-controlled keys. If absolutely necessary, sanitize and validate the keys rigorously to prevent access to `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`.
        *   Consider using alternative, safer methods for merging or setting object properties. Plain JavaScript object spread (`{...obj1, ...obj2}`) or `Object.assign()` are generally safer for simple merges.
        *   Freeze object prototypes: While not always feasible, freezing prototypes can prevent modification.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization:  Strictly validate any user-provided data that will be used as keys in object operations.

*   **Attack Surface: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via `_.template`**
    *   **Description:**  The `_.template` function in Lodash allows for the dynamic execution of JavaScript code within a template string. If user-controlled input is directly used as the template string without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed by the application.
    *   **How Lodash Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `_.template` function provides the mechanism for dynamic code execution based on the provided template string.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Vulnerable code using _.template
        const userInput = "<%= process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('rm -rf /').toString() %>";
        const compiled = _.template(userInput);
        compiled({}); // Executes the malicious command
        ```
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the server or client-side environment where the code is executed. Attackers can gain complete control over the system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never use user-provided input directly as the template string for `_.template`. This is the most crucial mitigation.
        *   If dynamic templating is required, use a templating engine specifically designed for security and context-aware escaping. Consider alternatives that automatically sanitize output.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization if you absolutely must use user input in templates. However, this is highly discouraged due to the complexity and risk of bypass.

*   **Attack Surface: Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker can craft malicious input that, when processed by certain Lodash functions, consumes excessive CPU or memory resources, leading to a denial of service. This can make the application unresponsive or crash.
    *   **How Lodash Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Some Lodash functions, particularly those dealing with large arrays or objects (e.g., `_.chunk`, `_.flattenDeep`, `_.zip`, `_.range`), can be computationally expensive or memory-intensive when processing very large or deeply nested data structures.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Vulnerable code using _.range (can cause memory exhaustion)
        const maliciousInput = 1000000000; // A very large number
        _.range(maliciousInput); // Attempts to create a massive array
        ```
    *   **Impact:**  Application becomes unavailable, impacting users and potentially causing financial loss or reputational damage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement input size limits and validation for data processed by potentially resource-intensive Lodash functions. Set reasonable limits on array sizes, object depths, and string lengths.
        *   Use Lodash functions with caution when dealing with user-provided data. Consider the potential for malicious input designed to exploit these functions.
        *   Implement timeouts and resource monitoring to detect and mitigate DoS attempts.
