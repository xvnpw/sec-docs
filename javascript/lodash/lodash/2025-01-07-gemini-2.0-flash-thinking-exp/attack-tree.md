## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Lodash Weaknesses **[CN]**](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_lodash_weaknesses__cn_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**[HR]** Utilize Prototype Pollution **[CN]**](./attack_tree_paths/_hr__utilize_prototype_pollution__cn_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  This path exploits a fundamental characteristic of JavaScript's prototype inheritance. Attackers aim to manipulate the prototypes of built-in objects like `Object` by injecting malicious properties.
*   **How it works:**
    *   **Inject malicious properties via object manipulation functions:** Lodash's object manipulation functions (like `_.merge`, `_.assign`, `_.defaultsDeep`) can be vulnerable if they process user-controlled input without proper sanitization. Attackers craft malicious JSON or JavaScript objects containing properties like `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`. When these objects are processed by the vulnerable Lodash functions, the attacker can overwrite properties of the base `Object.prototype` or the `constructor.prototype`.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to:
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application later accesses these injected properties and treats them as executable code (e.g., using `eval` or similar constructs).
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting properties that disrupt the normal behavior of JavaScript objects, causing errors or unexpected behavior that crashes the application or makes it unavailable.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known, pre-existing vulnerabilities related to prototype pollution in specific versions of Lodash.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   Attackers identify the specific version of Lodash used by the target application. If it's an older, vulnerable version, they can leverage publicly available exploits that target these known prototype pollution flaws.
        *   **Impact:** This can lead to:
            *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Exploits can directly inject code to be executed on the server or client.
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploits can be designed to crash the application or consume excessive resources.
            *   **Data Exfiltration:** In some cases, prototype pollution vulnerabilities can be leveraged to access and steal sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HR]** Inject malicious properties via object manipulation functions (e.g., \_.merge, \_.assign, \_.defaults) **[CN]**](./attack_tree_paths/_hr__inject_malicious_properties_via_object_manipulation_functions__e_g_____merge____assign____defau_da5f3e84.md)

        *   **Impact:** This can lead to:
            *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** If the application later accesses these injected properties and treats them as executable code (e.g., using `eval` or similar constructs).
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting properties that disrupt the normal behavior of JavaScript objects, causing errors or unexpected behavior that crashes the application or makes it unavailable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) **[CN]** **[Critical Impact]**](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce___cn___critical_impact_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE)**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Regardless of the specific path taken (prototype pollution or `_.template` injection), achieving Remote Code Execution is the most critical outcome.
    *   **How it works:** By successfully exploiting a vulnerability, the attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server or client machine running the application.
    *   **Impact:** This represents a complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system. Attackers can:
        *   Install malware.
        *   Steal sensitive data.
        *   Modify application data or functionality.
        *   Use the compromised system as a launchpad for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) **[CN]** **[High Impact]**](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos___cn___high_impact_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Cause Denial of Service (DoS)**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities to make the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **How it works:** Attackers can leverage vulnerabilities to crash the application, consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), or disrupt its functionality.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to:
        *   Loss of business and revenue.
        *   Damage to reputation.
        *   Inability for users to access critical services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit known prototype pollution vulnerabilities in specific Lodash versions **[CN]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_prototype_pollution_vulnerabilities_in_specific_lodash_versions__cn_.md)

    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting known, pre-existing vulnerabilities related to prototype pollution in specific versions of Lodash.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   Attackers identify the specific version of Lodash used by the target application. If it's an older, vulnerable version, they can leverage publicly available exploits that target these known prototype pollution flaws.
        *   **Impact:** This can lead to:
            *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Exploits can directly inject code to be executed on the server or client.
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Exploits can be designed to crash the application or consume excessive resources.
            *   **Data Exfiltration:** In some cases, prototype pollution vulnerabilities can be leveraged to access and steal sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Exfiltration **[CN]** **[High Impact]**](./attack_tree_paths/data_exfiltration__cn___high_impact_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Data Exfiltration**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access to and steal sensitive data.
    *   **How it works:**  Attackers can leverage vulnerabilities to bypass security controls and access databases, files, or other storage mechanisms containing sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:** This can result in:
        *   Financial loss due to theft of financial data.
        *   Reputational damage due to breaches of customer data.
        *   Legal and regulatory penalties for failing to protect personal information.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HR]** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Specific Lodash Functions **[CN]**](./attack_tree_paths/_hr__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_specific_lodash_functions__cn_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Targeting known security flaws within specific Lodash functions.
*   **How it works:**
    *   **Leverage known vulnerabilities in `_.template` or similar templating functionalities:** If the application uses Lodash's `_.template` function (or similar templating features) to dynamically generate content based on user input without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to template injection attacks. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code directly into the template string.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The injected JavaScript code will be executed when the template is processed, potentially allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server or client-side, depending on where the template rendering occurs.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting other, less common, but potentially critical vulnerabilities in specific Lodash functions.
    *   **How it works:**
        *   This requires the discovery of new or unpatched vulnerabilities in specific Lodash functions. Attackers would need to analyze the source code of Lodash to identify potential flaws (e.g., buffer overflows, incorrect input validation).
        *   **Impact:**
            *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  A successful exploit could allow arbitrary code execution.
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The vulnerability could be triggered to crash the application.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The injected JavaScript code will be executed when the template is processed, potentially allowing the attacker to run arbitrary commands on the server or client-side, depending on where the template rendering occurs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in other specific Lodash functions **[CN]**](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_other_specific_lodash_functions__cn_.md)
