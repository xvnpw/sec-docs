# Threat Model Analysis for lodash/lodash

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution](./threats/prototype_pollution.md)

**Description:** An attacker can manipulate input data processed by Lodash's object manipulation functions (like `_.merge`, `_.set`, `_.assign`, `_.defaultsDeep`) to inject properties into the `Object.prototype`. This is achieved by crafting malicious input that targets the `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties during the merging or setting process.

**Impact:**  Polluting the prototype can lead to application-wide vulnerabilities. Attackers could:
* Modify the behavior of built-in JavaScript methods.
* Inject malicious properties that are inherited by all objects, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or denial of service.
* Bypass security checks that rely on standard object properties.

**Affected Lodash Component:** Functions within the `Object` module, specifically `_.merge`, `_.set`, `_.assign`, `_.defaultsDeep`, and potentially others that perform deep object manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user-provided input before using it with Lodash's object manipulation functions. Specifically, strip or escape characters that could be used to target prototype properties.
* **Object Creation:** When merging or extending objects with potentially untrusted data, consider creating new objects using `Object.create(null)` as the base, which does not inherit from `Object.prototype`.
* **Defensive Copying:**  Instead of modifying existing objects directly, create copies of objects before merging or modifying them with untrusted data.
* **Avoid Deep Merging Untrusted Data:**  Be cautious when using deep merge operations (`_.merge`, `_.defaultsDeep`) with untrusted input. Consider flattening or explicitly handling nested structures.
* **Update Lodash:** Keep Lodash updated to the latest version, as security patches for prototype pollution vulnerabilities are often released.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Deeply Nested Objects/Arrays](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_deeply_nested_objectsarrays.md)

**Description:** An attacker can provide extremely large or deeply nested JavaScript objects or arrays as input to Lodash functions that recursively process these structures (e.g., `_.cloneDeep`, `_.merge`, `_.isEqual`). This can consume excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to application slowdown or complete service disruption.

**Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing it. This can lead to financial losses, reputational damage, and disruption of services.

**Affected Lodash Component:** Functions that perform deep traversal or cloning, such as `_.cloneDeep`, `_.merge`, `_.isEqual`, and potentially iterative functions like `_.forEachDeep`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Input Size Limits:** Implement limits on the size and depth of objects and arrays accepted as input. Reject requests with excessively large or deeply nested structures.
* **Timeouts:** Set reasonable timeouts for Lodash operations, especially when processing user-provided data. If an operation takes too long, terminate it to prevent resource exhaustion.
* **Resource Monitoring:** Monitor server resources (CPU, memory) to detect potential DoS attacks and implement alerting mechanisms.
* **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on API endpoints that accept complex data structures to prevent attackers from overwhelming the server with malicious requests.
