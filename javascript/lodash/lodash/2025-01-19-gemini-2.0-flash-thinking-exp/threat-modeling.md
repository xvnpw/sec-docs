# Threat Model Analysis for lodash/lodash

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution](./threats/prototype_pollution.md)

**Description:** An attacker could leverage specific Lodash functions that modify objects (e.g., `_.set`, `_.merge`, `_.assign`) with carefully crafted input to inject malicious properties into the `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes. This can lead to unexpected behavior across the application, potentially allowing the attacker to bypass security checks, inject malicious scripts, or even achieve remote code execution in certain scenarios.

**Impact:** Critical. Successful prototype pollution can have widespread and severe consequences, affecting the entire application's behavior and potentially leading to complete compromise.

**Affected Component:** Modules and functions related to object manipulation, including but not limited to: `_.set`, `_.merge`, `_.assign`, `_.defaults`, `_.defaultsDeep`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and sanitize any user-provided input before using it with Lodash object manipulation functions.
*   Avoid using Lodash functions to directly modify prototypes if possible.
*   Consider using immutable data structures or defensive programming techniques to limit the impact of prototype pollution.
*   Regularly update Lodash to the latest version, as security vulnerabilities related to prototype pollution are sometimes patched.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential script injection if prototype pollution is exploited for that purpose.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could provide maliciously crafted input to certain Lodash functions, especially those dealing with complex data transformations or iterations over large datasets (e.g., `_.merge`, `_.cloneDeep`, `_.map`, `_.filter`). This could force Lodash to perform computationally expensive operations, consuming excessive CPU or memory resources and potentially leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Impact:** High. A successful DoS attack can make the application unavailable, disrupting business operations and potentially causing financial losses.

**Affected Component:** Modules and functions involved in data manipulation and iteration, such as `_.merge`, `_.cloneDeep`, `_.map`, `_.filter`, `_.reduce`, and potentially others depending on the specific attack vector.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent processing of excessively large or malformed data.
*   Set appropriate limits on the size and complexity of data processed by Lodash functions.
*   Monitor application performance and resource usage to detect potential DoS attacks.
*   Implement rate limiting or other traffic management techniques to mitigate the impact of malicious requests.
*   Consider using techniques like pagination or data streaming to handle large datasets more efficiently.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks (Compromised Lodash Package)](./threats/supply_chain_attacks__compromised_lodash_package_.md)

**Description:** Although rare, there is a risk that the official Lodash package on npm or other package registries could be compromised. An attacker could inject malicious code into the package, which would then be included in applications that depend on Lodash. This malicious code could perform various harmful actions, such as stealing credentials, injecting malware, or exfiltrating data.

**Impact:** Critical. A compromised Lodash package could have a widespread and severe impact on all applications using the malicious version.

**Affected Component:** The entire Lodash package.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use package managers with integrity checking features (e.g., `npm` with lockfiles, `yarn`).
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or other verification methods.
*   Consider using private package registries or mirroring official registries to have more control over the packages used.
*   Monitor for unusual activity or changes in the Lodash package or its dependencies.
*   Implement strong security practices for the development environment and build pipeline.

## Threat: [Misuse of Powerful Functions Leading to Security Vulnerabilities](./threats/misuse_of_powerful_functions_leading_to_security_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Lodash provides powerful utility functions that, if misused or applied to untrusted data, could create security vulnerabilities. For example, using `_.get` with unsanitized user input to access object properties could potentially lead to information disclosure if the input allows accessing properties that should be restricted. Similarly, functions that dynamically execute code or manipulate strings based on external input could be exploited if not handled carefully.

**Impact:** Medium to High. The impact depends on the specific function misused and the context of its usage. It could range from information disclosure to potential code execution.

**Affected Component:** Various Lodash functions depending on the specific misuse scenario, including but not limited to `_.get`, string manipulation functions, and potentially others.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Exercise caution when using Lodash functions that involve dynamic property access, string manipulation based on external input, or any operation that could be influenced by untrusted data.
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input used with these functions.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege and only use the necessary Lodash functions for the task at hand.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential instances of insecure usage of powerful Lodash functions.
