# Attack Surface Analysis for lodash/lodash

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution via Object Manipulation Functions](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution_via_object_manipulation_functions.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Prototype Pollution via Object Manipulation Functions
    *   **Description:**  An attacker can inject properties into the `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes by manipulating object merging or setting functions. This can lead to unexpected behavior, security bypasses, or denial of service.
    *   **How Lodash Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Lodash functions like `_.merge`, `_.assign`, `_.defaults`, `_.set`, and `_.setWith` can be vulnerable if they process user-controlled input as keys or paths without proper sanitization. These functions are designed to deeply merge or set object properties, and if a malicious key like `__proto__` is provided, it can modify the prototype chain.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Vulnerable code using _.merge
        const userInput = JSON.parse('{"__proto__": {"isAdmin": true}}');
        const obj = {};
        _.merge(obj, userInput);
        console.log(obj.isAdmin); // undefined (property is on Object.prototype)
        console.log(({}).isAdmin); // true (prototype pollution)
        ```
    *   **Impact:**  Critical. Prototype pollution can have widespread and severe consequences, potentially allowing attackers to:
        *   Bypass authentication or authorization checks.
        *   Execute arbitrary code (in certain environments).
        *   Cause denial of service by modifying core object behaviors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid using Lodash functions with user-controlled keys or paths directly. Sanitize and validate input rigorously.
        *   Use safer alternatives for merging or setting properties when dealing with untrusted data. Consider using object spread (`{...obj, ...userProvidedData}`) for shallow merges or libraries specifically designed for secure object manipulation.
        *   Freeze prototypes: In some environments, freezing `Object.prototype` can prevent prototype pollution.
        *   Input validation:  Strictly validate the structure and content of user-provided data before using it with Lodash's object manipulation functions.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution via `_.template`](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution_via____template_.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Arbitrary Code Execution via `_.template`
    *   **Description:** If user-provided data is directly used within the `_.template` function without proper sanitization, it can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   **How Lodash Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `_.template` function in Lodash allows for the execution of JavaScript code within template delimiters (`<%= %>`). If an attacker can control the content passed to `_.template`, they can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed during template rendering.
    *   **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Vulnerable code using _.template
        const userInput = "<%= process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('rm -rf /') %>";
        const compiled = _.template(userInput);
        compiled({}); // Executes the malicious command (example is dangerous, do not run)
        ```
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Arbitrary code execution allows attackers to:
        *   Gain complete control over the server or client.
        *   Steal sensitive data.
        *   Install malware.
        *   Cause significant damage to the system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never use user-provided data directly within `_.template` without strict sanitization.
        *   Prefer using template engines that offer automatic escaping of HTML and JavaScript.
        *   If `_.template` is necessary, ensure all user input is properly escaped or use a sandboxed environment for template rendering (if possible).
        *   Consider alternative templating solutions that are designed with security in mind.

## Attack Surface: [Potential for Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in String Functions](./attack_surfaces/potential_for_regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_string_functions.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Potential for Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in String Functions
    *   **Description:** Certain Lodash string manipulation functions that rely on regular expressions might be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks if they process maliciously crafted input strings.
    *   **How Lodash Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Lodash provides numerous string manipulation functions (e.g., `_.escapeRegExp`, `_.split`, `_.replace`) that internally use regular expressions. If these regular expressions are not carefully designed, an attacker can provide input strings that cause excessive backtracking in the regex engine, leading to high CPU utilization and potential denial of service.
    *   **Example:** (Illustrative, specific vulnerable regex depends on Lodash version)
        ```javascript
        // Potentially vulnerable code (example)
        const maliciousInput = "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!"; // Input designed to cause backtracking
        const result = _.split(maliciousInput, /a+b/); // Example regex, actual vulnerability varies
        // Processing this input might take an unexpectedly long time
        ```
    *   **Impact:** High. ReDoS can lead to:
        *   Denial of service, making the application unavailable.
        *   Resource exhaustion on the server.
        *   Performance degradation for legitimate users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Be cautious when using Lodash string functions with user-provided input.
        *   Review the regular expressions used internally by Lodash functions if performance issues arise with specific inputs.
        *   Implement timeouts for string processing operations to prevent indefinite blocking.
        *   Consider using alternative string manipulation methods or libraries that are less susceptible to ReDoS if performance is critical and user input is involved.
        *   Test string processing with a variety of inputs, including potentially malicious patterns.
