# Threat Model Analysis for lodash/lodash

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution](./threats/prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker provides specially crafted JSON or object input containing properties like `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`.  When vulnerable Lodash functions merge, clone, or set values on objects using this input, the attacker can modify `Object.prototype`. This pollutes the base object, affecting all objects in the application. The attacker can alter application logic, bypass security checks, or potentially achieve remote code execution.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Application crashes or becomes unresponsive.
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): In specific cases, carefully crafted pollution can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    *   Data Tampering: Modification of application data and behavior.
    *   Security Bypass: Circumvention of security mechanisms.
*   **Affected Lodash Component:**
    *   `_.merge` (especially older versions)
    *   `_.defaultsDeep` (especially older versions)
    *   `_.cloneDeep` (indirectly, if used with polluted objects)
    *   `_.set` (with untrusted keys)
    *   `_.zipObjectDeep`
    *   Any function internally relying on these.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible) or High (for DoS and data tampering).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Update Lodash:** Use the *latest* Lodash version.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Rigorously validate and sanitize *all* user-provided input, especially nested objects and keys. Remove or neutralize harmful properties. Use a dedicated sanitization library.
    *   **Defensive Programming:** Avoid relying on the default `Object.prototype`. Use `Object.create(null)` where appropriate.
    *   **Safer Alternatives:** Consider built-in JavaScript methods (e.g., `Object.assign` for shallow copies) or secure deep-cloning libraries.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review code using these functions, focusing on input handling.
    *   **Freeze Prototypes (with caution):** `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)` can prevent modifications, but may break compatibility.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos_.md)

*   **Threat:** ReDoS Attack
*   **Description:** An attacker provides a crafted string as input to a Lodash function that internally uses regular expressions. If the regex is vulnerable (e.g., contains "evil regex" patterns), processing time can become exponentially long, causing a denial-of-service.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Application becomes unresponsive due to excessive CPU usage.
*   **Affected Lodash Component:**
    *   `_.template` (if the template or data contains user-controlled regular expressions).
    *   Potentially other functions using string matching with regular expressions (less common, requires investigation).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid User-Controlled Regex:** Do *not* allow users to directly supply regular expressions used by Lodash.
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** If user input is used within strings processed with regex, validate and sanitize it thoroughly.
    *   **Regex Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for regular expression processing.
    *   **Safer Alternatives:** Prefer simpler string manipulation over regex with user input.
    *   **Review Lodash Source:** Examine the source code of used Lodash functions to understand their regex usage.

## Threat: [Unintended Code Execution via `_.template`](./threats/unintended_code_execution_via____template_.md)

*   **Threat:** Template Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker provides a malicious template string or data to `_.template`. If the template string or the data used within the template contains unsanitized user input, the attacker can inject JavaScript code that will be executed by the application (similar to an `eval()` vulnerability).
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Affected Lodash Component:**
    *   `_.template`
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Use Untrusted Templates:** Do *not* use user-provided input as the template string for `_.template`.
    *   **Sanitize Template Data:** If user input is used as *data* within the template, rigorously sanitize it to prevent JavaScript injection. Use appropriate escaping.
    *   **Safer Templating Engines:** Consider a more secure templating engine with built-in protection against code injection (e.g., a sandboxed engine).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict inline script execution.
