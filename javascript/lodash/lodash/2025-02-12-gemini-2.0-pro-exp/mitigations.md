# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for lodash/lodash

## Mitigation Strategy: [Granular Module Imports](./mitigation_strategies/granular_module_imports.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Lodash Functions:** Developers should carefully review the codebase to identify all instances where Lodash is used.
2.  **Replace Full Imports:**  Wherever `import _ from 'lodash';` is found, replace it with imports of specific functions.  For example: `import { debounce, cloneDeep } from 'lodash';`
3.  **Prefer Per-Function Packages:**  Even better, use per-function imports: `import debounce from 'lodash/debounce'; import cloneDeep from 'lodash/cloneDeep';`
4.  **Automated Checks (ESLint):** Configure ESLint with the `lodash/import-scope` rule set to `method` (or `member` if appropriate) to automatically flag and prevent full library imports. This rule can be configured to automatically fix these issues.
5. **Documentation:** Update project documentation and coding guidelines.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical):** Reduces the likelihood of exploiting vulnerabilities in unused Lodash functions. If a vulnerability exists in a function *not* imported, the application is not exposed.
*   **Denial of Service (High):**  Similar to above, reduces the attack surface for DoS vulnerabilities that might exist in unused functions.
*   **Information Disclosure (Medium):**  While less direct, reducing the overall code size can indirectly reduce the potential for information leaks through vulnerabilities in unused code.

**Impact:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Significantly reduces risk. The attack surface is limited to the explicitly used functions.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Significantly reduces risk, for the same reason as above.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Provides a moderate reduction in risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Partially implemented.  Some parts of the codebase use granular imports, while others still import the entire library.  ESLint rule is configured but not consistently enforced.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Legacy modules (e.g., `src/legacy/utils.js`, `src/components/oldTable.js`) still use full Lodash imports.
*   New developers are not always aware of the per-function import policy.
*   Consistent enforcement of the ESLint rule is lacking.  Automatic fixes are not always applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prototype Pollution Prevention (Specific to `_.merge`, `_.defaultsDeep`, `_.mergeWith`, `_.set`, `_.setWith`)](./mitigation_strategies/prototype_pollution_prevention__specific_to____merge______defaultsdeep______mergewith______set_______645a147e.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Vulnerable Functions:**  Identify all uses of `_.merge`, `_.defaultsDeep`, `_.mergeWith`, `_.set`, and `_.setWith`.
2.  **Input Validation:**  Before using these functions with *any* user-supplied data (even indirectly), implement strict input validation using a schema validation library (e.g., Joi, Ajv).  Define the expected structure and types of the input data.
3.  **Input Sanitization:**  Implement input sanitization to remove or escape potentially dangerous properties like `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`. This can be a custom function or part of the validation process.
4.  **Safe Deep Cloning:** If the input data *must* be modified, create a *secure* deep clone of the input *before* passing it to the Lodash function.  Do *not* use `_.cloneDeep` on untrusted input.  Consider a dedicated secure deep cloning library or a custom implementation that explicitly avoids prototype properties.
5.  **Consider Alternatives:** Explore safer alternatives to these functions.  For example:
    *   Use the spread operator (`...`) or `Object.assign` for shallow merging, if you can guarantee the input is safe.
    *   Construct objects manually instead of relying on deep merging.
6. **Documentation:** Update project documentation and coding guidelines.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Prototype Pollution (Critical):**  Directly addresses the risk of attackers injecting malicious properties into object prototypes.
*   **Denial of Service (High):**  Prototype pollution can lead to DoS by disrupting application logic.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Critical):**  In some cases, prototype pollution can be escalated to achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Data Tampering (High):** Attackers can modify application data by polluting prototypes.

**Impact:**
*   **Prototype Pollution:**  Significantly reduces risk when implemented correctly.
*   **Denial of Service:**  Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  Significantly reduces risk.
*   **Data Tampering:** Significantly reduces risk.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Some input validation is performed in certain parts of the application, but it's not consistently applied to all user-supplied data before using Lodash functions.
*   No specific sanitization for prototype pollution properties is implemented.
*   `_.cloneDeep` is sometimes used on potentially untrusted input.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Comprehensive input validation using a schema validation library is missing in many areas.
*   Input sanitization specifically targeting prototype pollution is not implemented.
*   Safe deep cloning practices are not consistently followed.
*   Alternatives to vulnerable functions are not consistently considered.

## Mitigation Strategy: [ReDoS Prevention (Specific to functions that might use regular expressions internally)](./mitigation_strategies/redos_prevention__specific_to_functions_that_might_use_regular_expressions_internally_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Potentially Vulnerable Functions:** Review the codebase and Lodash documentation to identify functions that might use regular expressions internally, especially those that process string input (e.g., string manipulation functions, template compilation).  Examples might include (but are not limited to): `_.template`, `_.escapeRegExp`, `_.words`, and potentially others depending on how they are used.
2.  **Analyze Regular Expressions:** If user input is passed to these functions, carefully analyze any regular expressions used *within Lodash's implementation* for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.  This requires examining the Lodash source code for the specific version you are using. Use tools like Regex101 or specialized ReDoS checkers. Look for patterns like nested quantifiers (e.g., `(a+)+`).
3. **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize any user input *before* it reaches a Lodash function that might use a regular expression. Limit string length, restrict character sets, and escape special characters as appropriate for the context.
4. **Consider Alternatives:** If a Lodash function's internal regex is found to be vulnerable, and you cannot sufficiently sanitize the input, consider:
    *   Using a different Lodash function that achieves the same result without using a vulnerable regex.
    *   Implementing the functionality yourself using a safe regular expression or a different approach entirely.
5. **Documentation:** Update project documentation and coding guidelines.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (High):**  Directly addresses the risk of attackers causing the application to become unresponsive by exploiting poorly designed regular expressions *within Lodash's implementation*.

**Impact:**
*   **ReDoS:** Significantly reduces risk when implemented correctly.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic input validation (e.g., checking for empty strings) is performed in some areas.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Systematic analysis of regular expressions *within Lodash functions* for ReDoS vulnerabilities is not performed.
*   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization specifically targeting ReDoS is lacking.
