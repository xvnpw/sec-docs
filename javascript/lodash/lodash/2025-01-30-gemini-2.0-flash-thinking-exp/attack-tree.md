## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Known Lodash Vulnerabilities -> Prototype Pollution](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_known_lodash_vulnerabilities_-_prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    *   **1.1.1. Identify vulnerable Lodash functions susceptible to prototype pollution:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker first needs to identify which Lodash functions used in the application are known to be vulnerable to prototype pollution. Common examples include `_.merge`, `_.set`, `_.assign`, `_.defaultsDeep` and their deep variants.
        *   **How it works:** These functions, when used to merge or set properties of objects, might not properly handle properties like `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`, or other prototype-related attributes if the input is maliciously crafted.
        *   **Attacker Action:** Code review of the application (if possible), dynamic analysis by observing application behavior, or referencing known vulnerability databases and security advisories related to Lodash.
    *   **1.1.2. Craft malicious input to manipulate object prototypes via vulnerable Lodash functions:**
        *   **Description:** Once vulnerable functions are identified, the attacker crafts malicious input data. This input is designed to be processed by the vulnerable Lodash function in a way that it modifies the prototype of JavaScript objects instead of the intended target object.
        *   **How it works:** The malicious input typically includes properties like `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` within the input object. When the vulnerable Lodash function processes this input, it inadvertently modifies the prototype chain.
        *   **Attacker Action:** Experiment with different input structures targeting prototype properties, often within JSON or object structures passed as parameters to API endpoints or application logic that uses vulnerable Lodash functions.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] 1.1.3. Achieve Code Execution or Denial of Service by polluting prototypes:**
        *   **Description:** Successful prototype pollution allows the attacker to inject properties into the prototypes of built-in JavaScript objects like `Object.prototype` or `Array.prototype`. This can have wide-ranging consequences across the application.
        *   **How it works:** By polluting `Object.prototype`, for example, the attacker can add a malicious property that becomes available to *all* JavaScript objects in the application's scope. This can lead to:
            *   **Code Execution (XSS):** Injecting properties that are later used in a vulnerable way in the application's logic, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting. For example, setting a property that is later used in a DOM manipulation function without proper sanitization.
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Polluting prototypes in a way that causes unexpected errors, crashes, or infinite loops within the application's JavaScript code.
            *   **Logic Flaws:** Altering the behavior of built-in methods or object properties, leading to unexpected application behavior and potential security vulnerabilities in application logic.
        *   **Attacker Action:** After successful prototype pollution, analyze application behavior to identify how the polluted prototypes are used. Craft further exploits to leverage the pollution for code execution or DoS.
    *   **1.1.4. Exploit side effects of prototype pollution in application logic:**
        *   **Description:** Even if direct code execution or DoS is not immediately achievable, prototype pollution can create subtle side effects in the application's logic. These side effects can be further exploited to achieve more significant compromises.
        *   **How it works:** Prototype pollution can alter the expected behavior of objects and functions throughout the application. This can lead to logic flaws, data manipulation vulnerabilities, or bypasses of security checks.
        *   **Attacker Action:** Thoroughly analyze the application's functionality after successful prototype pollution. Look for unexpected behaviors, logic errors, or data inconsistencies that can be leveraged for further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Misuse of Lodash in Application Code -> Unsafe Usage of `_.template` or similar templating functions](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_misuse_of_lodash_in_application_code_-_unsafe_usage_of____template__or_simila_2093f74c.md)

*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    *   **2.1.1. Identify application code using `_.template` or similar Lodash templating functions with user-controlled input:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker needs to find instances in the application's codebase where Lodash's templating functions (`_.template`, potentially others that process templates) are used, and where the template content or data passed to the template is derived from user-controlled input.
        *   **How it works:** `_.template` compiles JavaScript templates. If user input is directly embedded into the template string without proper sanitization, it can lead to template injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Attacker Action:** Code review of the application's source code, searching for usages of `_.template` and tracing back the source of the template string and data. Dynamic analysis by observing how the application handles user input and renders dynamic content.
    *   **2.1.2. Inject malicious JavaScript code into templates via user input:**
        *   **Description:** Once a vulnerable `_.template` usage is found, the attacker crafts malicious input strings that contain JavaScript code. This code is designed to be injected into the template and executed when the template is rendered.
        *   **How it works:** If user input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being placed into the template, the template engine will interpret the malicious JavaScript code as part of the template logic and execute it.
        *   **Attacker Action:** Craft input strings containing JavaScript code snippets, such as `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` for Cross-Site Scripting or more complex payloads for potential Remote Code Execution (if server-side templating is vulnerable and misconfigured).
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] 2.1.3. Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Remote Code Execution (RCE) through template injection:**
        *   **Description:** Successful template injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code. The impact depends on where the template is rendered:
            *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the template is rendered in the user's browser (client-side templating, common with Lodash in web applications), the injected JavaScript code will execute in the user's browser context. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and other client-side attacks.
            *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In less common scenarios where `_.template` is used on the server-side to generate content that is then executed on the server (highly discouraged and insecure practice with Lodash directly, but theoretically possible if misused in server-side JavaScript environments), template injection could potentially lead to RCE on the server.
        *   **Attacker Action:** After successful template injection, refine the injected JavaScript payload to achieve the desired malicious outcome, such as stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or performing actions on behalf of the user (XSS), or attempting to execute system commands (in the rare case of server-side RCE).
    *   **2.1.4. Bypass input sanitization or output encoding by leveraging template engine features:**
        *   **Description:** Applications might attempt to sanitize user input or encode output to prevent XSS. However, template engines often have features that can be used to bypass these security measures if not properly understood and configured.
        *   **How it works:** Template engines might offer directives or syntax to output raw HTML, bypass encoding, or execute JavaScript code directly within the template. Attackers can leverage these features to bypass naive sanitization or encoding attempts.
        *   **Attacker Action:** Analyze the application's sanitization and encoding mechanisms. Experiment with template engine-specific syntax and directives to find ways to inject malicious code that bypasses these security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: 3.1.4. Compromise application by injecting malicious code through the fake Lodash package (Dependency Confusion)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_3_1_4__compromise_application_by_injecting_malicious_code_through_the_fake_lodash_pack_c9b4fc6f.md)

*   **Attack Vector Breakdown:**
    *   **3.1.4. Compromise application by injecting malicious code through the fake Lodash package:**
        *   **Description:** This attack leverages a dependency confusion vulnerability in the application's build process. If the application is configured to fetch dependencies from both public and internal package registries, and if the internal registry is not properly secured or prioritized, an attacker can publish a malicious package with the same name as a legitimate internal dependency (or in this case, a well-known public dependency like Lodash) on a public registry (like npmjs.com).
        *   **How it works:** When the application's build process attempts to resolve the Lodash dependency, it might mistakenly fetch and install the malicious package from the public registry instead of the legitimate Lodash package (or potentially an intended internal "lodash" package if that was the scenario). The malicious package can contain arbitrary code that will be executed during the application's build or runtime.
        *   **Attacker Action:**
            *   **Reconnaissance:** Identify if the target application uses an internal package registry and how its dependency resolution is configured.
            *   **Publish Malicious Package:** Create a malicious npm package named "lodash" (or the name of the targeted internal dependency) on a public registry like npmjs.com. This package will contain malicious code designed to compromise the application.
            *   **Wait for Installation:** If the application's build process is vulnerable, it will download and install the malicious "lodash" package during the next build or dependency update.
            *   **Exploitation:** The malicious code within the fake Lodash package will execute within the application's environment, allowing the attacker to achieve various malicious goals, such as data theft, backdoors, or complete application takeover.
