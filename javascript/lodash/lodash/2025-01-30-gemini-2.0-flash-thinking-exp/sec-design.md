# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, represented by the lodash GitHub repository, provides a widely used JavaScript utility library.

- Business Priorities:
  - Stability and reliability of utility functions.
  - Performance and efficiency of the library.
  - Broad compatibility across JavaScript environments (browsers, Node.js).
  - Ease of use and developer experience.
  - Community support and active maintenance.
  - Wide adoption and trust within the JavaScript development community.

- Business Goals:
  - To be the leading JavaScript utility library.
  - To simplify JavaScript development by providing robust and performant utility functions.
  - To maintain a high level of quality and reliability.
  - To foster a strong and active community around the library.

- Business Risks:
  - Supply chain attacks compromising the library distribution channels (e.g., npm).
  - Vulnerabilities within the lodash library code leading to security issues in dependent projects.
  - Performance regressions impacting applications using lodash.
  - Breaking changes introduced in new versions causing compatibility issues.
  - Reputational damage due to security incidents or lack of maintenance.
  - Legal liabilities arising from vulnerabilities or licensing issues.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are likely performed by maintainers and contributors as part of the pull request process. (Location: GitHub Pull Request process)
  - security control: Unit and integration tests are implemented to ensure code correctness and prevent regressions. (Location: Test suite within the repository)
  - security control: Static analysis tools and linters are likely used to enforce code quality and identify potential issues. (Location: CI/CD pipeline, developer tooling)
  - security control: Dependency scanning might be used to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies. (Location: CI/CD pipeline, dependency management tools)
  - security control: Public vulnerability reporting process via GitHub issues or security channels. (Location: GitHub repository, project documentation)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on open-source contributions, which may introduce vulnerabilities if not properly vetted.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to exist in the code due to the complexity of utility functions and wide range of use cases.
  - accepted risk: Security of the npm registry and other distribution channels is partially outside of the project's direct control.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Formalize a security vulnerability disclosure and response process with dedicated security contacts.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits or penetration testing, especially for critical components.
  - security control: Implement dependency vulnerability scanning and automated updates for dependencies.
  - security control: Enforce branch protection rules and code review requirements for all changes.
  - security control: Secure the build and release pipeline to prevent tampering and ensure integrity of published packages.
  - security control: Consider using code signing for published packages to enhance integrity verification.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a utility library. Lodash itself does not handle authentication. However, applications using lodash will need to implement their own authentication mechanisms.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a utility library. Lodash functions operate based on the input data provided by the calling application. Authorization logic resides in the application using lodash.
  - Input Validation: Lodash functions should handle various input types gracefully and avoid unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities due to invalid input. Input validation is primarily the responsibility of the application using lodash, but lodash should strive for robustness.
  - Cryptography: Lodash does not directly implement cryptographic functions. If cryptographic operations are needed, applications should use dedicated cryptography libraries. Lodash should avoid implementing custom cryptography.
