# Threat Model Analysis for lodash/lodash

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution](./threats/prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   An attacker crafts malicious input data with properties like `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`, or `prototype`.
    *   Vulnerable lodash functions such as `_.merge`, `_.assign`, `_.defaults`, `_.set`, or `_.setWith`, when used with unsanitized user input, can inadvertently set these malicious properties onto the prototypes of built-in JavaScript objects.
    *   This pollution modifies the behavior of all objects inheriting from the polluted prototype, leading to unexpected application behavior or security vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Application crashes or malfunctions.
    *   Security Bypass: Circumvention of security checks.
    *   Potential Remote Code Execution (RCE): In specific contexts, prototype pollution might be chained to achieve RCE.
*   **Lodash Component Affected:**
    *   Functions: `_.merge`, `_.assign`, `_.defaults`, `_.set`, `_.setWith` (when used with user-controlled input as keys/paths).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Input Sanitization and Validation:  Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input before using it as keys or paths in lodash object manipulation functions.
    *   Use Safer Alternatives:  Avoid vulnerable functions with user input. Consider explicitly copying and whitelisting properties.
    *   Object Freezing (Defensive Measure): Consider freezing prototypes of built-in objects (with caution for compatibility).
    *   Code Reviews:  Conduct thorough code reviews for unsafe lodash usage.
    *   Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST):  Use SAST tools to detect prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   An attacker injects malicious code into user-controlled input.
    *   This input is directly embedded into a template string used with `_.template` for server-side rendering, without proper escaping.
    *   When the server processes the template using `_.template`, the injected code is executed on the server.
    *   Attackers can achieve remote code execution, data breaches, or server compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE): Full control over the server.
    *   Data Breaches: Access to sensitive data.
    *   Server Compromise: Complete takeover of the server.
*   **Lodash Component Affected:**
    *   Function: `_.template` (when used to render user-provided content on the server without escaping).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid User Input in Templates:  Completely avoid embedding user-controlled input directly into `_.template` server-side templates.
    *   Context-Aware Output Encoding/Escaping (Manual and Complex): If user input *must* be included, implement robust manual escaping (highly discouraged and error-prone).
    *   Use a Secure Templating Engine:  Utilize a secure templating engine with built-in auto-escaping for user-generated content. Avoid `_.template` for this purpose.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong CSP to limit SSTI impact.
