### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Critical - Remote Code Execution via Malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` Configuration
- Description:
    - A malicious actor could craft a `.jsbeautifyrc` file containing a payload that, when parsed by the `js-beautify` VS Code extension, leads to arbitrary code execution within the user's VS Code environment.
    - Step 1: Attacker creates a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file. This file is crafted to exploit a potential vulnerability in the extension's configuration parsing logic. For example, if the extension uses `eval()` or a similar unsafe mechanism to process certain configuration options, the payload could be JavaScript code.
    - Step 2: Attacker places this malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in a location where the VS Code extension will search for configuration files. This could be in a public repository that a victim user might clone, or any directory that is higher in the file path tree than the files the victim user is working on, up to the user's home directory based on the described search order in `README.md`.
    - Step 3: Victim user opens a code file within VS Code from a directory that is within or below the directory containing the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file.
    - Step 4: When the extension is activated (either automatically on file open, or when the user manually triggers beautification), it searches for `.jsbeautifyrc` files in the file path tree.
    - Step 5: The extension finds and parses the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file. If the parsing process is vulnerable, the attacker's payload is executed.
- Impact:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the user's VS Code instance. This could lead to:
        - Full control over the user's VS Code environment.
        - Access to sensitive data, including files and environment variables accessible to VS Code.
        - Potential for further system compromise if VS Code processes have sufficient privileges.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided project files. The files describe the functionality of the extension and available settings, but do not mention any specific security measures against malicious configuration files.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Secure parsing of `.jsbeautifyrc` files: The extension should use safe JSON parsing methods that avoid code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Input validation and sanitization: Validate all settings read from `.jsbeautifyrc` to ensure they conform to expected types and values, preventing injection of malicious payloads.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: If possible, process `.jsbeautifyrc` files in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of any potential vulnerabilities.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure the extension operates with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential damage from code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Restricting `.jsbeautifyrc` search scope: Consider limiting the directories searched for `.jsbeautifyrc` files to prevent loading configurations from untrusted locations, especially user home directories or system-wide locations.
- Preconditions:
    - Attacker can place a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in a directory that will be searched by the VS Code extension when a victim user opens a file.
    - Victim user opens a file in VS Code within a directory structure that includes the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in its path tree.
    - The VS Code `js-beautify` extension attempts to beautify code (either automatically or manually triggered by the user).
- Source code analysis:
    - **Note:** No source code for the extension is provided in PROJECT FILES. This analysis is based on the description of the extension's functionality in the provided documentation and makes assumptions about potential implementation weaknesses.
    - Based on the `README.md`, the extension loads settings from `.jsbeautifyrc` files. If the code responsible for parsing and applying these settings is not carefully implemented, it could be vulnerable to code injection.
    - For example, if the extension uses a JavaScript function like `eval()` or `Function()` to process any part of the configuration values, it could be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code within the `.jsbeautifyrc` file.
    - Another potential area is insecure deserialization. If the extension attempts to deserialize configuration values in a way that is not type-safe or does not properly sanitize inputs, it could lead to vulnerabilities.
    - Prototype pollution in JavaScript is also a potential concern if the configuration parsing process involves merging or manipulating JavaScript objects in an unsafe manner. An attacker might be able to pollute the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects, leading to unexpected behavior or potentially code execution.
- Security test case:
    - Step 1: Create a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file with a payload designed to trigger code execution. For example, if testing for a hypothetical `eval()` vulnerability, the `.jsbeautifyrc` might contain:
    ```json
    {
        "malicious_setting": "eval('require(\\'child_process\\').execSync(\\'calc.exe\\')')"
    }
    ```
    (Note: `calc.exe` is used as a benign example for Windows. A real attack would use a more harmful payload.)
    - Step 2: Place this `malicious.jsbeautifyrc` file in a test directory, for example, `/tmp/jsbeautify_test/malicious.jsbeautifyrc`.
    - Step 3: Open VS Code and create or open a JavaScript file within a subdirectory of the test directory, for example, `/tmp/jsbeautify_test/project/test.js`.
    - Step 4: Trigger the beautification command by either:
        - Configuring VS Code to format on save (`"editor.formatOnSave": true`) and saving the `test.js` file.
        - Manually executing the "Beautify File" command (F1 -> Beautify file).
    - Step 5: Observe if the payload is executed. For the example payload above (`calc.exe`), check if the Windows calculator application is launched. On other operating systems, a similar benign command (like `open -a Calculator` on macOS or `gnome-calculator` on Linux) could be used, or a simpler indicator like creating a file on the filesystem.
    - Step 6: If the payload executes successfully, this demonstrates a Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
