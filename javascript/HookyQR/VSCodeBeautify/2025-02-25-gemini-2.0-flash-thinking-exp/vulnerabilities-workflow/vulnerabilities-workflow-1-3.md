Based on the instructions, let's evaluate the provided vulnerability and decide if it should be included in the updated list.

**Vulnerability Name:** Configuration Injection via Malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` File

**Evaluation against exclusion criteria:**

- **Caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES:** This vulnerability is related to how the extension handles configuration files, which is part of the extension's core functionality, not insecure code patterns in user projects. This exclusion criteria does not apply.
- **Only missing documentation to mitigate:** The "Missing Mitigations" section suggests code-level changes like input validation and secure parsing are needed, not just documentation. This exclusion criteria does not apply.
- **Deny of service vulnerabilities:** The described impact is code manipulation, unexpected behavior, and developer confusion. It is not primarily a denial of service vulnerability. This exclusion criteria does not apply.

**Evaluation against inclusion criteria:**

- **Valid and not already mitigated:** The vulnerability description seems plausible and the "Currently Implemented Mitigations" section indicates no explicit mitigations are in place. So, it appears valid and not mitigated.
- **Vulnerability rank at least: high:** The vulnerability rank is given as **medium**. This criterion is **not met**.

**Conclusion:**

Because the vulnerability rank is "medium", and the inclusion criteria requires a rank of at least "high", this vulnerability should be **excluded** from the updated list.

Therefore, the updated vulnerability list, according to the instructions, should be empty.
