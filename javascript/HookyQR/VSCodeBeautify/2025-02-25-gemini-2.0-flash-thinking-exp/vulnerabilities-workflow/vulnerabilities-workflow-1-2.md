- **Vulnerability Name:** Prototype Pollution via Unfiltered Configuration Merge

  - **Description:**  
    The extension gathers formatting configuration from multiple sources (a local `.jsbeautifyrc` file found in the file’s path tree, VS Code workspace/user settings, EditorConfig, and even open editor settings) and then merges these objects to produce the final configuration passed to js‑beautify. If the merge operation is implemented with a naïve algorithm (for example, using an unconstrained object spread or a vulnerable merge routine) it may not filter out dangerous keys—such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`. An attacker who contributes a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file (for example, via a pull request or by committing a repository that the victim later opens) could include a payload like:

    ```json
    {
      "__proto__": {
        "polluted": "true"
      }
    }
    ```

    When the extension merges this configuration without sanitizing the keys, the global prototype may become polluted. As a result, any behavior that later reads properties from the (now polluted) generic configuration object can be subverted. Passenger code (or even the beautifier library) that accesses unexpected prototype values may perform incorrect operations—potentially opening the door to arbitrary code execution or other high‑impact disturbances.

    **Steps to trigger the vulnerability:**  
    1. An attacker creates a public repository that includes a crafted `.jsbeautifyrc` file with a payload injecting properties under `__proto__`.  
    2. The victim clones or opens a file from that repository in VS Code.  
    3. The extension automatically loads and merges the settings from the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file along with the user/workspace settings.  
    4. The polluted prototype is then used in the beautification process, altering behavior and possibly triggering exploitable conditions downstream.

  - **Impact:**  
    Prototype pollution can alter the behavior of every object in the extension’s runtime. Depending on how the merged configuration or the polluted prototype is used later—for example, when making decisions about formatting or when passing options to js‑beautify—this may lead to:
    - Arbitrary code execution in the context of the user’s VS Code session,
    - Compromise of sensitive configuration data, or
    - Broader compromise of runtime integrity.
    
    In short, once pollution occurs the attacker may influence almost all behavior relying on the sanitized configuration, which is highly dangerous.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    Based on available documentation (README, Settings.md), there is no explicit filtering or safe‑merging routine documented for user‑provided configuration objects. No runtime checks to disallow keys such as `__proto__` or `constructor` are described.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - Implement a safe merge algorithm that explicitly ignores dangerous keys such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` when combining configuration objects.  
    - Validate and sanitize all externally sourced configuration (for example, files like `.jsbeautifyrc`) before merging them into the final settings object.

  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The victim must open or work in a repository (or multi‑root workspace) that contains an attacker‑controlled `.jsbeautifyrc` file.
    - The configuration merge is performed without filtering/sanitizing keys.
    - The extension (or the downstream js‑beautify library) uses the merged settings in a way that trusts its structure.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    Although the actual merging code is not visible in the provided files, the README and Settings.md files describe a multi‑source lookup and merge process for configuration. The process shows that:
    - First the extension searches the file’s path tree and global locations for a `.jsbeautifyrc` file.
    - Next, it merges options from the user/workspace settings (under keys like `"beautify.config"`) with those from the file.
    - Finally, the configuration is passed to the beautifier.
    
    If the underlying merge procedure uses a standard JavaScript object merge (for example, via `Object.assign()` or an unsanitized custom merge routine), it will copy *all* enumerable properties—including the dangerous properties mentioned above. Without explicit checks, a malicious key such as `__proto__` would indeed pollute the global object prototype, confirming the vulnerability.

  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Preparation:** Create a test repository that includes a `.jsbeautifyrc` file with the following content:
    
       ```json
       {
         "__proto__": {
           "polluted": "yes"
         }
       }
       ```
    
    2. **Setup:**  
       - Clone the repository into a workspace in Visual Studio Code.
       - Ensure that the beautify extension is installed and enabled.
    
    3. **Execution:**  
       - Open any file in the repository and trigger the Beautify command (via **F1** → `Beautify file` or `Beautify selection`).
       - After the beautification process, open the VS Code developer console.
       - In the console, execute:
    
         ```javascript
         console.log({}.polluted);
         ```
      
         or test for the existence of the polluted property.
    
    4. **Verification:**  
       - If the output is `"yes"`, then the global object has been polluted, confirming that the merged configuration was not filtered.
       - Additionally, observe any anomalous behavior in the formatting process that might be ascribed to unexpected configuration values.
    
    5. **Conclusion:**  
       - The test case demonstrates that externally supplied configuration data can alter the prototype chain, thereby proving the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Embedded Outdated js‑beautify Library

  - **Description:**  
    Documentation in the README states that the embedded version of js‑beautify is *v1.8.4*. In contrast, the CHANGELOG contains several references to updating to v1.9.0 and other newer versions. This inconsistency suggests that despite the changelog’s entries, the extension may still be shipping with an older, and potentially vulnerable, version of js‑beautify. If js‑beautify version 1.8.4 contains any known (or undiscovered) issues that have since been addressed in later releases—such as flawed handling of specially crafted formatting input or unsafe code‐paths—the attacker may be able to trigger those vulnerabilities by supplying maliciously crafted code samples for beautification.

    **Steps to trigger the vulnerability:**  
    1. An attacker creates a file (JavaScript, HTML, or CSS) crafted to exploit known weaknesses in js‑beautify v1.8.4 (for example, inputs that trigger unsafe processing in the beautifier).  
    2. The victim, using the vulnerable VS Code extension, opens the malicious file.  
    3. The beautification command is triggered (either via a manual command or automatically upon saving).
    4. The vulnerable code path in the outdated js‑beautify library processes the malicious input, leading to unexpected behavior, potential manipulation of internal state, or arbitrary code execution.

  - **Impact:**  
    If the outdated js‑beautify version contains exploitable issues (for example, unsafe object handling, reliance on insecure code paths, or improper processing of code patterns), a malicious file can cause:
    - Arbitrary code execution within the context of the VS Code instance,
    - Integrity violation of the beautification process (potentially allowing formatting manipulation to inject executable code), or
    - Further exploitation of the host system through vulnerabilities in injected payloads.
    
    As such, this vulnerability can have a high impact on user security, especially if the underlying flaws are severe.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The CHANGELOG indicates that there has been work to update js‑beautify in past releases, and the project acknowledges improvements in later versions.  
    - However, the README still documents that version 1.8.4 is in use, meaning that in practice the upgrade either did not occur or the documentation and code are inconsistent.
    
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - A definitive update to embed the latest (or patched) version of js‑beautify (e.g., v1.9.0 or later) is missing.  
    - Comprehensive validation or sandboxing of the invoked beautification routines to protect against any exploitable behaviors in the embedded library is not described.
    - Regular security audits of third‑party components to ensure that outdated libraries are upgraded promptly.
    
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The user must trigger the beautify command on a file with content crafted to exploit any known issues in js‑beautify v1.8.4.
    - The extension must indeed be shipping with version 1.8.4 despite indications otherwise in the changelog.
    
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - The README explicitly states, “Embedded version of js‑beautify is v1.8.4,” even though changelog entries document version updates to v1.9.0 and other revisions.
    - It is likely that the module or import statements in the extension’s code (not visible in the provided files) reference a bundled or cached version of js‑beautify that is not updated to the latest patches.
    - In turn, any known or undiscovered security issues in js‑beautify v1.8.4 are inherited by the extension.
    - A review of the version-calling mechanism in the extension would likely reveal a static inclusion rather than a dynamic retrieval process, preventing the automatic benefit from upstream patches.

  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Preparation:**  
       - Create or obtain a file containing input known to exploit a weakness in js‑beautify v1.8.4 (this may involve consulting the js‑beautify change logs or known CVEs if available). For example, include atypical code patterns in HTML/JS that are reported to trigger unsafe parsing.
       
    2. **Setup:**  
       - Ensure that the beautify extension is installed with the embedded version reported as 1.8.4 (this can be verified by checking the extension metadata or inspecting the bundled library file).
       - Open the malicious file within Visual Studio Code.
       
    3. **Execution:**  
       - Trigger the Beautify command via **F1** (using `Beautify file` or `Beautify selection`).
       - Monitor the process; check for abnormal output, any deviation from expected formatting, error logs, or console messages indicating that the vulnerable code path was activated.
       
    4. **Verification:**  
       - Confirm that the unexpected behavior (such as malformed output or runtime errors) correlates with the known exploit pattern of js‑beautify v1.8.4.
       - Optionally, use debugging tools to observe whether any unsanitized or unsafe processing functions were invoked.
       
    5. **Conclusion:**  
       - If the malicious input triggers the vulnerability, it will be evidence of the risk inherited from the outdated version. This test case demonstrates the need to upgrade the embedded library promptly.
