### Combined Vulnerability List

#### Vulnerability Name: Critical - Remote Code Execution via Malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` Configuration

- **Description:**
    - A malicious actor could craft a `.jsbeautifyrc` file containing a payload that, when parsed by the `js-beautify` VS Code extension, leads to arbitrary code execution within the user's VS Code environment.
    - Step 1: Attacker creates a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file. This file is crafted to exploit a potential vulnerability in the extension's configuration parsing logic. For example, if the extension uses `eval()` or a similar unsafe mechanism to process certain configuration options, the payload could be JavaScript code.
    - Step 2: Attacker places this malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in a location where the VS Code extension will search for configuration files. This could be in a public repository that a victim user might clone, or any directory that is higher in the file path tree than the files the victim user is working on, up to the user's home directory based on the described search order in `README.md`.
    - Step 3: Victim user opens a code file within VS Code from a directory that is within or below the directory containing the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file.
    - Step 4: When the extension is activated (either automatically on file open, or when the user manually triggers beautification), it searches for `.jsbeautifyrc` files in the file path tree.
    - Step 5: The extension finds and parses the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file. If the parsing process is vulnerable, the attacker's payload is executed.
- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the user's VS Code instance. This could lead to:
        - Full control over the user's VS Code environment.
        - Access to sensitive data, including files and environment variables accessible to VS Code.
        - Potential for further system compromise if VS Code processes have sufficient privileges.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - None apparent from the provided project files. The files describe the functionality of the extension and available settings, but do not mention any specific security measures against malicious configuration files.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Secure parsing of `.jsbeautifyrc` files: The extension should use safe JSON parsing methods that avoid code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Input validation and sanitization: Validate all settings read from `.jsbeautifyrc` to ensure they conform to expected types and values, preventing injection of malicious payloads.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: If possible, process `.jsbeautifyrc` files in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of any potential vulnerabilities.
    - Principle of least privilege: Ensure the extension operates with the minimum necessary privileges to reduce the potential damage from code execution vulnerabilities.
    - Restricting `.jsbeautifyrc` search scope: Consider limiting the directories searched for `.jsbeautifyrc` files to prevent loading configurations from untrusted locations, especially user home directories or system-wide locations.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker can place a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in a directory that will be searched by the VS Code extension when a victim user opens a file.
    - Victim user opens a file in VS Code within a directory structure that includes the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file in its path tree.
    - The VS Code `js-beautify` extension attempts to beautify code (either automatically or manually triggered by the user).
- **Source code analysis:**
    - **Note:** No source code for the extension is provided in PROJECT FILES. This analysis is based on the description of the extension's functionality in the provided documentation and makes assumptions about potential implementation weaknesses.
    - Based on the `README.md`, the extension loads settings from `.jsbeautifyrc` files. If the code responsible for parsing and applying these settings is not carefully implemented, it could be vulnerable to code injection.
    - For example, if the extension uses a JavaScript function like `eval()` or `Function()` to process any part of the configuration values, it could be exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript code within the `.jsbeautifyrc` file.
    - Another potential area is insecure deserialization. If the extension attempts to deserialize configuration values in a way that is not type-safe or does not properly sanitize inputs, it could lead to vulnerabilities.
    - Prototype pollution in JavaScript is also a potential concern if the configuration parsing process involves merging or manipulating JavaScript objects in an unsafe manner. An attacker might be able to pollute the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects, leading to unexpected behavior or potentially code execution.
- **Security test case:**
    - Step 1: Create a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file with a payload designed to trigger code execution. For example, if testing for a hypothetical `eval()` vulnerability, the `.jsbeautifyrc` might contain:
    ```json
    {
        "malicious_setting": "eval('require(\\'child_process\\').execSync(\\'calc.exe\\')')"
    }
    ```
    (Note: `calc.exe` is used as a benign example for Windows. A real attack would use a more harmful payload.)
    - Step 2: Place this `malicious.jsbeautifyrc` file in a test directory, for example, `/tmp/jsbeautify_test/malicious.jsbeautifyrc`.
    - Step 3: Open VS Code and create or open a JavaScript file within a subdirectory of the test directory, for example, `/tmp/jsbeautify_test/project/test.js`.
    - Step 4: Trigger the beautification command by either:
        - Configuring VS Code to format on save (`"editor.formatOnSave": true`) and saving the `test.js` file.
        - Manually executing the "Beautify File" command (F1 -> Beautify file).
    - Step 5: Observe if the payload is executed. For the example payload above (`calc.exe`), check if the Windows calculator application is launched. On other operating systems, a similar benign command (like `open -a Calculator` on macOS or `gnome-calculator` on Linux) could be used, or a simpler indicator like creating a file on the filesystem.
    - Step 6: If the payload executes successfully, this demonstrates a Remote Code Execution vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability Name: Critical - Prototype Pollution via Unfiltered Configuration Merge

- **Description:**
    - The extension gathers formatting configuration from multiple sources (a local `.jsbeautifyrc` file found in the file’s path tree, VS Code workspace/user settings, EditorConfig, and even open editor settings) and then merges these objects to produce the final configuration passed to js‑beautify. If the merge operation is implemented with a naïve algorithm (for example, using an unconstrained object spread or a vulnerable merge routine) it may not filter out dangerous keys—such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`. An attacker who contributes a malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file (for example, via a pull request or by committing a repository that the victim later opens) could include a payload like:
    ```json
    {
      "__proto__": {
        "polluted": "true"
      }
    }
    ```
    - When the extension merges this configuration without sanitizing the keys, the global prototype may become polluted. As a result, any behavior that later reads properties from the (now polluted) generic configuration object can be subverted. Passenger code (or even the beautifier library) that accesses unexpected prototype values may perform incorrect operations—potentially opening the door to arbitrary code execution or other high‑impact disturbances.
    - **Steps to trigger the vulnerability:**
        1. An attacker creates a public repository that includes a crafted `.jsbeautifyrc` file with a payload injecting properties under `__proto__`.
        2. The victim clones or opens a file from that repository in VS Code.
        3. The extension automatically loads and merges the settings from the malicious `.jsbeautifyrc` file along with the user/workspace settings.
        4. The polluted prototype is then used in the beautification process, altering behavior and possibly triggering exploitable conditions downstream.
- **Impact:**
    - Prototype pollution can alter the behavior of every object in the extension’s runtime. Depending on how the merged configuration or the polluted prototype is used later—for example, when making decisions about formatting or when passing options to js‑beautify—this may lead to:
        - Arbitrary code execution in the context of the user’s VS Code session,
        - Compromise of sensitive configuration data, or
        - Broader compromise of runtime integrity.
    - In short, once pollution occurs the attacker may influence almost all behavior relying on the sanitized configuration, which is highly dangerous.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - Based on available documentation (README, Settings.md), there is no explicit filtering or safe‑merging routine documented for user‑provided configuration objects. No runtime checks to disallow keys such as `__proto__` or `constructor` are described.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - Implement a safe merge algorithm that explicitly ignores dangerous keys such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` when combining configuration objects.
    - Validate and sanitize all externally sourced configuration (for example, files like `.jsbeautifyrc`) before merging them into the final settings object.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim must open or work in a repository (or multi‑root workspace) that contains an attacker‑controlled `.jsbeautifyrc` file.
    - The configuration merge is performed without filtering/sanitizing keys.
    - The extension (or the downstream js‑beautify library) uses the merged settings in a way that trusts its structure.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - Although the actual merging code is not visible in the provided files, the README and Settings.md files describe a multi‑source lookup and merge process for configuration. The process shows that:
        - First the extension searches the file’s path tree and global locations for a `.jsbeautifyrc` file.
        - Next, it merges options from the user/workspace settings (under keys like `"beautify.config"`) with those from the file.
        - Finally, the configuration is passed to the beautifier.
    - If the underlying merge procedure uses a standard JavaScript object merge (for example, via `Object.assign()` or an unsanitized custom merge routine), it will copy *all* enumerable properties—including the dangerous properties mentioned above. Without explicit checks, a malicious key such as `__proto__` would indeed pollute the global object prototype, confirming the vulnerability.
- **Security test case:**
    - 1. **Preparation:** Create a test repository that includes a `.jsbeautifyrc` file with the following content:
       ```json
       {
         "__proto__": {
           "polluted": "yes"
         }
       }
       ```
    - 2. **Setup:**
        - Clone the repository into a workspace in Visual Studio Code.
        - Ensure that the beautify extension is installed and enabled.
    - 3. **Execution:**
        - Open any file in the repository and trigger the Beautify command (via **F1** → `Beautify file` or `Beautify selection`).
        - After the beautification process, open the VS Code developer console.
        - In the console, execute:
         ```javascript
         console.log({}.polluted);
         ```
         or test for the existence of the polluted property.
    - 4. **Verification:**
        - If the output is `"yes"`, then the global object has been polluted, confirming that the merged configuration was not filtered.
        - Additionally, observe any anomalous behavior in the formatting process that might be ascribed to unexpected configuration values.
    - 5. **Conclusion:**
        - The test case demonstrates that externally supplied configuration data can alter the prototype chain, thereby proving the vulnerability.

#### Vulnerability Name: High - Embedded Outdated js‑beautify Library

- **Description:**
    - Documentation in the README states that the embedded version of js‑beautify is *v1.8.4*. In contrast, the CHANGELOG contains several references to updating to v1.9.0 and other newer versions. This inconsistency suggests that despite the changelog’s entries, the extension may still be shipping with an older, and potentially vulnerable, version of js‑beautify. If js‑beautify version 1.8.4 contains any known (or undiscovered) issues that have since been addressed in later releases—such as flawed handling of specially crafted formatting input or unsafe code‐paths—the attacker may be able to trigger those vulnerabilities by supplying maliciously crafted code samples for beautification.
    - **Steps to trigger the vulnerability:**
        1. An attacker creates a file (JavaScript, HTML, or CSS) crafted to exploit known weaknesses in js‑beautify v1.8.4 (for example, inputs that trigger unsafe processing in the beautifier).
        2. The victim, using the vulnerable VS Code extension, opens the malicious file.
        3. The beautification command is triggered (either via a manual command or automatically upon saving).
        4. The vulnerable code path in the outdated js‑beautify library processes the malicious input, leading to unexpected behavior, potential manipulation of internal state, or arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact:**
    - If the outdated js‑beautify version contains exploitable issues (for example, unsafe object handling, reliance on insecure code paths, or improper processing of code patterns), a malicious file can cause:
        - Arbitrary code execution within the context of the VS Code instance,
        - Integrity violation of the beautification process (potentially allowing formatting manipulation to inject executable code), or
        - Further exploitation of the host system through vulnerabilities in injected payloads.
    - As such, this vulnerability can have a high impact on user security, especially if the underlying flaws are severe.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - The CHANGELOG indicates that there has been work to update js‑beautify in past releases, and the project acknowledges improvements in later versions.
    - However, the README still documents that version 1.8.4 is in use, meaning that in practice the upgrade either did not occur or the documentation and code are inconsistent.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - A definitive update to embed the latest (or patched) version of js‑beautify (e.g., v1.9.0 or later) is missing.
    - Comprehensive validation or sandboxing of the invoked beautification routines to protect against any exploitable behaviors in the embedded library is not described.
    - Regular security audits of third‑party components to ensure that outdated libraries are upgraded promptly.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must trigger the beautify command on a file with content crafted to exploit any known issues in js‑beautify v1.8.4.
    - The extension must indeed be shipping with version 1.8.4 despite indications otherwise in the changelog.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - The README explicitly states, “Embedded version of js‑beautify is v1.8.4,” even though changelog entries document version updates to v1.9.0 and other revisions.
    - It is likely that the module or import statements in the extension’s code (not visible in the provided files) reference a bundled or cached version of js‑beautify that is not updated to the latest patches.
    - In turn, any known or undiscovered security issues in js‑beautify v1.8.4 are inherited by the extension.
    - A review of the version-calling mechanism in the extension would likely reveal a static inclusion rather than a dynamic retrieval process, preventing the automatic benefit from upstream patches.
- **Security test case:**
    - 1. **Preparation:**
        - Create or obtain a file containing input known to exploit a weakness in js‑beautify v1.8.4 (this may involve consulting the js‑beautify change logs or known CVEs if available). For example, include atypical code patterns in HTML/JS that are reported to trigger unsafe parsing.
    - 2. **Setup:**
        - Ensure that the beautify extension is installed with the embedded version reported as 1.8.4 (this can be verified by checking the extension metadata or inspecting the bundled library file).
        - Open the malicious file within Visual Studio Code.
    - 3. **Execution:**
        - Trigger the Beautify command via **F1** (using `Beautify file` or `Beautify selection`).
        - Monitor the process; check for abnormal output, any deviation from expected formatting, error logs, or console messages indicating that the vulnerable code path was activated.
    - 4. **Verification:**
        - Confirm that the unexpected behavior (such as malformed output or runtime errors) correlates with the known exploit pattern of js‑beautify v1.8.4.
        - Optionally, use debugging tools to observe whether any unsanitized or unsafe processing functions were invoked.
    - 5. **Conclusion:**
        - If the malicious input triggers the vulnerability, it will be evidence of the risk inherited from the outdated version. This test case demonstrates the need to upgrade the embedded library promptly.
