- **Vulnerability Name:** DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Web Build

  - **Description:**
    - Starting with version 2.5.0 the extension added support for a web build. In this mode the extension processes document content (e.g., to find and style color values) using dynamic DOM manipulation.
    - The extension likely uses regular expressions to detect various color formats (including advanced formats such as LCH, RGB with floating-point numbers, and CSS color module level 4 values).
    - If the input (the extracted “color” string) is used directly to construct HTML elements or inline styles without proper sanitization or encoding, a specially crafted file may contain a malicious “color” definition that escapes the intended attribute or context.
    - An external attacker could therefore create a file containing a crafted color string (for example: `#fff" onerror="alert('XSS')`) so that when a user opens that document in the web-based environment, the malicious payload is injected into the DOM.

  - **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the context of the victim’s session in the VS Code web application.
    - Potential outcomes include session hijacking, data theft, further propagation of malicious code, or modifications in the UI that trick the user.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - There is no evidence in the README or changelog that the extension applies strict input sanitization or output encoding for color value processing in the web build.
    - The extension appears to rely on the host (VS Code or its web sandbox) for a baseline level of protection but does not implement its own defense-in-depth measures against unsanitized input.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** A whitelist-based validation of color strings that allows only known-safe patterns.
    - **Output Encoding/Sanitization:** Proper encoding or sanitization of any string used for DOM insertion—especially when generating inline style attributes or HTML elements.
    - **Secure DOM Manipulation:** Use of secure APIs (or templating frameworks) that avoid direct assignment to properties like innerHTML.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user is running the web-based version of VS Code with the extension enabled.
    - The attacker is able to supply or persuade the victim to open a file (or repository) containing a maliciously crafted “color” string that bypasses the extension’s expected regex filtering.
    - The regex used in the extension’s color detection is permissive enough so that an injected payload is not trivially rejected.

  - **Source Code Analysis (Hypothetical Walkthrough):**
    - **Step 1: Document Read**
      - The extension reads the content of the currently opened file via VS Code’s API.
    - **Step 2: Color Extraction**
      - A set of regular expressions (enhanced over time to support formats like LCH, hsl without functions, floating-point numbers, etc.) is used to scan the file for tokens that look like color definitions.
    - **Step 3: DOM Construction**
      - For each match, the extension constructs a visual marker (e.g., a colored dot or an inline decoration). In the web build, this construction may involve creating DOM elements or setting inline style properties.
      - If the matched token is used directly (by using string concatenation) to build element attributes (or inserted via innerHTML), then an injected sequence (such as an extraneous attribute declaration) could break out of the intended context.
    - **Step 4: Exploitation**
      - A malicious payload (for example, a crafted hexadecimal value appended with `" onerror="alert('XSS')`) might be accepted by the regex and then inserted into the DOM without sanitization, causing the browser to execute the injected JavaScript.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    - **Step 1:** Create a test file (e.g., `malicious.txt`) containing a line with a deliberately malformed “color” string. For example, insert a token like:
      ```
      /* Example malicious color */
      var background = '#fff" onerror="alert(\'XSS\')"';
      ```
    - **Step 2:** Open this test file in the web-based instance of Visual Studio Code (make sure the extension is enabled).
    - **Step 3:** Observe the area where the extension decorates color values. Use the browser’s developer tools to inspect whether an HTML element has been created with the injected attribute.
    - **Step 4:** Check for evidence of script execution (e.g., an alert popup or execution of test JavaScript). An alert dialog or any unexpected behavior would indicate that the malicious payload was processed and executed.
    - **Step 5:** Repeat with variations (if needed) to confirm that the injection is not an isolated case and verify that proper sanitization (if later implemented) prevents the execution.
