- **Vulnerability Name:** Mutable External Action References in CI/CD Workflows

- **Description:**
  The project’s GitHub workflows (for example, in the Nix test and FlakeHub publish workflows) reference external GitHub Actions using mutable branch references (e.g. using `@main`) rather than fixed, pinned commit hashes or version tags. An attacker who is able to compromise or inject code into one of these external actions (such as the repositories maintained by DeterminateSystems) can cause the CI/CD pipeline to execute malicious code. In a step‐by‐step scenario:
  1. An attacker targets an external GitHub Action referenced in the project—for example, the action defined as
     `- uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main`
     or
     `- uses: DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action@main` (also found in the FlakeHub publish workflow).
  2. By compromising the maintainer’s *main* branch or pushing a malicious update to that branch, the attacker causes these actions to serve a modified (malicious) version.
  3. When the project’s workflow runs (on push, pull request, or manual dispatch), the compromised action is fetched and executed as part of the build/release process.
  4. The malicious payload executed in the CI/CD pipeline could—for example—exfiltrate secrets, tamper with the build artifacts (VSIX packages), or inject altered theme JSON files.
  5. Once the compromised artifact is published (via the Visual Studio Marketplace, Open VSX Registry, or via NPM), many end users installing or updating the theme risk receiving a malicious payload.

- **Impact:**
  If exploited, this vulnerability can compromise the project’s build and release pipelines. The attacker could ultimately distribute a tampered VSCode theme extension to a large user base—thus turning the trusted theme into a supply‑chain attack vector. End users might unknowingly install an extension that exfiltrates sensitive data from their development environment or misleads them via altered UI elements.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  • Several workflows (for example, those using actions like `actions/checkout@...` and `actions/setup-node@...`) already use fixed commit hashes to lock down the versions of those actions.
  • The project maintains a disciplined CI/CD process and only publishes artifacts after running full builds and tests.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Some external actions (notably those provided by DeterminateSystems such as the nix-installer, magic-nix-cache, and flakehub-push actions) are referenced using a mutable branch tag (`@main`) rather than a pinned commit hash or a specific release tag.
  • There is no additional runtime check (for example, verifying a known digital signature or checksum) to ensure that the fetched action code is exactly what is expected.

- **Preconditions:**
  • The attacker must be able to influence or compromise one or more external GitHub Action repositories that the project depends on.
  • The CI/CD pipelines must be triggered (which happens on pushes, pull requests, or manual dispatch) so that the changed external action is pulled in during workflow execution.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  In the file `.github/workflows/nix.yml`, the following lines illustrate the issue:
  - `- uses: DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action@main`
  - `- uses: DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action@main`
    Similarly, in `.github/workflows/flakehub-publish.yml`, you will find a reference such as:
  - `- uses: DeterminateSystems/flakehub-push@main`
  These references point to the live *main* branch of the respective repositories. Unlike pinned dependencies (e.g. `actions/checkout@11bd71901bbe5b1630ceea73d27597364c9af683`), these mutable references do not guarantee that the code pulled for the action remains constant over time.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Preparation:**
     - In a controlled CI/CD test environment (or a fork of the repository), modify the workflow YAML temporarily to simulate an external action update. For example, replace one of the mutable action references with a test repository or a forked version that deliberately logs a distinct “malicious” marker (e.g., by inserting a command that writes a known string to a file).
  2. **Execution:**
     - Trigger the workflow (via a push or a manually dispatched workflow run) so that the altered (simulated malicious) external action is used during execution.
  3. **Verification:**
     - Examine the workflow logs and any generated build artifacts. Verify whether the “malicious” marker was executed (for instance, check for the presence of the known string in logs or output files).
     - Confirm that the action’s mutable reference allowed the execution of unintended behavior.
  4. **Mitigation Confirmation:**
     - After testing, update the workflow files to pin the external actions to a fixed commit hash or verified release tag. Re-run the workflow to ensure that the marker test no longer executes.
