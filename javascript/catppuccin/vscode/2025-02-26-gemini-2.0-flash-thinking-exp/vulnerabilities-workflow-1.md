## Combined Vulnerability List

This document consolidates identified vulnerabilities from multiple analyses into a single list, removing duplicates and providing a comprehensive view of each issue.

### Potential Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS) via `unsafeStatic` in Storybook Code Preview

- **Description:**
    The Storybook story file (`CodePreview.stories.ts`) dynamically fetches code samples from a GitHub URL based on predefined filenames. This fetched code is then processed by Shiki’s `codeToHtml` function to generate HTML with syntax highlighting. Critically, the resulting HTML is injected into the Lit template using the `unsafeStatic` directive. This method inserts the HTML directly into the Document Object Model (DOM) without any sanitization. Consequently, if an attacker can compromise the trusted source of these code samples or intercept and manipulate network traffic, they could replace the expected code with a malicious payload. This unsanitized insertion via `unsafeStatic` would then allow for the execution of arbitrary scripts within the user's browser when viewing the Storybook.

- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser context of any user who views the affected Storybook instance. This can lead to severe consequences, including session hijacking, theft of sensitive user information, and the potential to further exploit other client-side vulnerabilities present in the application or the user's browsing session.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    Several mitigations are currently in place, though they are not sufficient to fully eliminate the risk:
    - The filenames of the fetched code samples are hardcoded within the Storybook stories. This limits direct external control over which files are fetched, making it harder for an attacker to directly specify a malicious file.
    - Code samples are fetched over HTTPS from a repository on GitHub that is presumed to be a trusted source. This protects against simple man-in-the-middle attacks in transit, assuming the GitHub repository itself remains secure.
    - Shiki’s syntax highlighter is expected to escape special characters within the code snippets during normal operation. This is intended to prevent accidental HTML injection through syntax highlighting, but it is not designed as a comprehensive security sanitization measure against intentionally malicious payloads.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    Crucially, there is no sanitization step applied to the HTML output generated by `highlighter.codeToHtml` before it is rendered using `unsafeStatic`. This is the primary missing mitigation that allows the XSS vulnerability to exist.
    - A safer rendering strategy is needed. This could involve implementing a sanitization library (like DOMPurify) to process the HTML output from Shiki before rendering. Alternatively, using Lit's safer directives that provide automatic sanitization would be a more secure approach than `unsafeStatic`.
    - There is no integrity verification mechanism in place to ensure the fetched code samples have not been tampered with. Implementing Subresource Integrity (SRI) or hash checking could provide a mechanism to verify the integrity of the fetched content and detect if it has been altered from the expected version.

- **Preconditions:**
    Several conditions must be met for this vulnerability to be exploitable:
    - An attacker must be capable of manipulating the content served from the designated GitHub URL. This could be achieved by compromising the remote GitHub repository itself, performing DNS hijacking to redirect requests, or successfully executing a man-in-the-middle attack.
    - The Storybook instance where this vulnerability exists must be publicly accessible to external users. If the Storybook is only available on a private network, the risk of external exploitation is significantly reduced.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    The vulnerability stems from the following sequence of operations within the `StoryBuilder` function and the Lit template:
    - **Step 1: URL Construction:** A URL is dynamically constructed. It starts with a trusted base URL (`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/main/samples/`) and appends a hardcoded filename (e.g., `"bash.sh"`, `"cpp.cpp"`, etc.).
    - **Step 2: Fetching Code Sample:** An HTTP GET request is made using `fetch` to retrieve the content of the file from the constructed GitHub URL.
    - **Step 3: Syntax Highlighting:** The raw code text obtained from the fetch request is passed to Shiki's `codeToHtml` function. This function processes the code and generates HTML markup intended for syntax highlighting.
    - **Step 4: Unsafe HTML Injection:** The HTML string generated by Shiki (`codeHtml`) is directly injected into the DOM using Lit's `unsafeStatic` directive within a template literal. This bypasses Lit's built-in HTML sanitization mechanisms.

    **Visualization of Data Flow:**

    ```
    [Start] --> URL Construction
        |
        v
    [Fetch from GitHub] --> Raw Code (potentially malicious)
        |
        v
    [Shiki: codeToHtml] --> HTML with syntax highlighting (codeHtml) - potentially containing malicious HTML
        |
        v
    [Lit Template: ${unsafeStatic(codeHtml)}] --> DOM Injection (Unsanitized HTML rendered) --> [XSS Vulnerability if malicious code injected]
    ```

    Without sanitization between the HTML generation from Shiki and the DOM injection via `unsafeStatic`, any malicious HTML tags or JavaScript code embedded in the fetched code sample will be directly rendered and executed in the user's browser.

- **Security Test Case:**
    To validate this XSS vulnerability, the following steps can be performed:
    - **Step 1: Setup Test Environment:** Establish a local or staging instance of the Storybook application. Configure an environment override to modify the base URL used for fetching code samples. This override should point the application to a controlled server that you manage.
    - **Step 2: Configure Controlled Server:** On the controlled server, set up a simple HTTP server. This server will serve a malicious code sample instead of the expected code file when requested. The malicious sample should contain a simple XSS payload, for example: `` `<img src=x onerror="alert('XSS Vulnerability!')">` ``.
    - **Step 3: Trigger Story in Browser:** Open the Storybook instance in a web browser. Navigate to and trigger a Story (e.g., the "Bash" story) that utilizes the code preview component and fetches a file that you are now controlling with your server.
    - **Step 4: Observe for XSS Execution:** Monitor the browser's behavior. If the malicious payload is successfully executed, an alert box displaying "XSS Vulnerability!" should appear in the browser window. This confirms the presence of the XSS vulnerability.
    - **Step 5: Implement and Verify Mitigation:** After confirming the vulnerability, implement a sanitization step. This could involve using a library like DOMPurify to sanitize the `codeHtml` string before passing it to `unsafeStatic`, or replacing `unsafeStatic` with a safer Lit directive that provides automatic sanitization. After implementing the mitigation, repeat steps 3 and 4 to verify that the malicious payload is no longer executed and the XSS vulnerability is resolved.
