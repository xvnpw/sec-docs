- **Potential Cross‑Site Scripting (XSS) via `unsafeStatic` in Storybook Code Preview**  
  - **Description:**  
    - The Storybook story file (`CodePreview.stories.ts`) fetches code samples at runtime from a GitHub URL based on a hardcoded file name.
    - The fetched code is passed to Shiki’s `codeToHtml` function to generate HTML with syntax highlighting.
    - The resulting HTML is then injected into the Lit template using the `unsafeStatic` function—which means that the HTML is inserted into the DOM without further sanitization.
    - If an attacker manages to compromise the trusted source (or manipulate network traffic) so that a malicious payload is returned in place of the expected code sample, the unsanitized insertion via `unsafeStatic` may lead to arbitrary script execution.
  - **Impact:**  
    - An attacker who succeeds in injecting malicious HTML/JavaScript can execute scripts in the browser context of any user viewing the Storybook instance.
    - This may further allow session hijacking, theft of sensitive information, or exploitation of other client-side vulnerabilities.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The list of sample file names is hardcoded in the Storybook stories, limiting direct external control over which file is fetched.
    - Code is fetched over HTTPS from a trusted GitHub repository.
    - Shiki’s highlighter is expected to properly escape characters in code snippets under normal operation.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - There is no additional sanitization step for the HTML output from `highlighter.codeToHtml` before it is rendered via `unsafeStatic`.
    - A safer rendering strategy (such as using a sanitization library or a safer directive) is not implemented.
    - There is no integrity verification (i.e. hash checking or Subresource Integrity) to ensure that the fetched samples have not been tampered with.
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The attacker must be able to manipulate the content served from the GitHub URL (for example, by compromising the remote repository, DNS hijacking, or a successful man‑in‑the‑middle attack).
    - The Storybook instance must be publicly accessible to external users.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - **Step 1:** In the `StoryBuilder` function, a URL is constructed by concatenating a trusted base URL with a hardcoded file name (e.g., `"bash.sh"`, `"cpp.cpp"`, etc.).
    - **Step 2:** An HTTP GET request is made via `fetch` to retrieve the file content from GitHub.
    - **Step 3:** The raw code text is passed to Shiki’s `codeToHtml` function which generates HTML for syntax highlighting.
    - **Step 4:** The resulting HTML is injected into the DOM using Lit’s `unsafeStatic`, thereby bypassing Lit’s built‑in safeguards.
    - **Visualization:**  
      - **Fetch Phase:**  
        • URL: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/catppuccin/catppuccin/main/samples/${file}`  
        • Response: Raw code (e.g., if malicious, could include `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>`)
      - **Processing Phase:**  
        • Highlighter processes the code → produces HTML (`codeHtml`)  
      - **Rendering Phase:**  
        • Template literal:  
          `<div> ... ${unsafeStatic(codeHtml)} ... </div>`  
        • Without sanitization, any malicious payload in `codeHtml` is rendered directly.
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    - **Step 1:** Set up a local or staging instance of Storybook with an environment override so that the fetch URL points to a controlled server.
    - **Step 2:** Configure the controlled server to serve a malicious code sample containing a payload (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`).
    - **Step 3:** Open the Storybook instance in a browser and trigger the story (for example, the “Bash” story) that uses the manipulated file.
    - **Step 4:** Observe the output in the rendered page; if the malicious payload is executed (i.e. an alert box appears), this confirms an XSS vulnerability.
    - **Step 5:** After confirming the vulnerability, implement a sanitization step on `codeHtml` (or replace `unsafeStatic` with a safer directive) and verify that the malicious payload is no longer executed.
