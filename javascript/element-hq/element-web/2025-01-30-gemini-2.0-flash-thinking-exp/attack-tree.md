## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Element-Web Vulnerabilities Directly [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_element-web_vulnerabilities_directly__critical_node_.md)

* This is a broad category encompassing direct attacks targeting weaknesses within Element-Web's code, dependencies, or server-side interactions. Success here directly compromises the application through Element-Web.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Element-Web Code [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_element-web_code__critical_node_.md)

* Focuses on vulnerabilities residing in the client-side JavaScript code of Element-Web. Exploiting these can lead to direct user compromise within the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1__cross-site_scripting__xss__attacks__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into Element-Web that executes in users' browsers.
* **Types:**
    * **Stored XSS in Messages/Room Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious scripts into messages or room data (names, topics) that are stored on the server and displayed to other users.
        * **Impact:** When other users view the compromised message or room data, the malicious script executes in their browsers, potentially stealing session cookies, credentials, performing actions on behalf of the user, or redirecting to malicious sites.
        * **Example:** An attacker sends a message containing `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` in a chat room. When other users open the chat room, the script executes.
    * **Script execution on other users' clients viewing the data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Consequence of successful Stored XSS. The malicious script injected in 1.1.1.1.1 now executes on every user's client who views the affected data.
