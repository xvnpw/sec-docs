    *   **React Sanitization:** Utilize React's built-in `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with caution and only after thorough sanitization using a library like `DOMPurify` to prevent XSS when rendering user-generated content.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Implement context-aware output encoding based on where user data is rendered (HTML, URL, JavaScript, etc.) to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews focusing on input validation and output encoding logic to ensure consistency and effectiveness.

**Recommendation 2: Strengthen Content Security Policy (CSP):**

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict CSP Directives:** Implement a CSP with strict directives, including:
        *   `default-src 'none';`
        *   `script-src 'self' 'nonce-{random}'` (using server-generated nonces for inline scripts).
        *   `style-src 'self' 'nonce-{random}'` (using server-generated nonces for inline styles).
        *   `img-src 'self' data: https:;`
        *   `object-src 'none';`
        *   `base-uri 'none';`
        *   `form-action 'self';`
        *   `frame-ancestors 'none';`
        *   `upgrade-insecure-requests;`
