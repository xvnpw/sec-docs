# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for element-hq/element-web

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement a Strong Content Security Policy (CSP)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_a_strong_content_security_policy__csp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a Strong Content Security Policy (CSP)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Policy in Element Web Configuration:** Within Element Web's configuration files or build process, define a CSP header. This might involve modifying server-side headers if Element Web is served directly, or configuring meta tags if CSP is set client-side.
    2.  **Restrict `script-src` in Element Web:** Set `script-src` directive to `'self'` to primarily allow scripts from Element Web's origin. If external scripts are absolutely necessary for Element Web's functionality (e.g., from trusted CDNs for specific libraries *used by Element Web*), explicitly list those trusted origins.  Strictly avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` within Element Web's CSP.
    3.  **Restrict other directives relevant to Element Web:** Configure `style-src`, `img-src`, `object-src`, `media-src`, `frame-ancestors`, `base-uri`, `form-action`, `connect-src`, `font-src`, and `manifest-src` directives to restrict resource loading to trusted origins and sources specifically needed by Element Web.
    4.  **Report-URI/report-to for Element Web:** Configure `report-uri` or `report-to` directives to receive reports of CSP violations specifically occurring within the Element Web application, allowing for monitoring and policy refinement tailored to Element Web's behavior.
    5.  **Testing and Refinement within Element Web's context:** Deploy the CSP in report-only mode initially to monitor for violations without breaking Element Web's functionality. Gradually enforce the policy and refine it based on reported violations and Element Web's specific needs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious scripts into Element Web by limiting script sources.
    *   **Data Injection (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of injecting malicious content through various resource types loaded by Element Web.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** `frame-ancestors` directive can prevent embedding Element Web in malicious iframes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** High reduction specifically within Element Web. CSP is a very effective control against many types of XSS attacks targeting Element Web.
    *   **Data Injection:** Medium reduction in the context of resources loaded and used by Element Web.
    *   **Clickjacking:** Medium reduction for attacks targeting embedding of Element Web.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely Implemented in Element Web itself. Modern web applications and frameworks often encourage or default to CSP implementation. Element Web, being security-focused, likely has a CSP in place. Check the HTTP headers served by Element Web or its configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Policy Refinement for Element Web:**  The existing CSP in Element Web might need to be reviewed and strengthened to be as restrictive as possible *specifically for Element Web's functionality* without breaking its features.
    *   **Report Monitoring for Element Web:** Ensure CSP violation reports are actively monitored and used to improve the policy *specifically for Element Web*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI)](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_subresource_integrity__sri_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate SRI Hashes for Element Web's External Resources:** For each external JavaScript and CSS file loaded by Element Web via `<script>` or `<link>` tags (e.g., from CDNs used by Element Web), generate an SRI hash.
    2.  **Add `integrity` Attribute in Element Web's HTML:** Add the `integrity` attribute to the `<script>` and `<link>` tags within Element Web's HTML structure, setting its value to the generated SRI hash and specifying the algorithm.
    3.  **Ensure `crossorigin="anonymous"` for Element Web's CDN Resources:** For resources loaded from different origins (like CDNs used by Element Web), include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute in Element Web's `<script>` and `<link>` tags to enable CORS and allow SRI checks.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised CDN/Third-Party Dependency used by Element Web (High Severity):** Prevents execution of malicious code if a CDN or third-party resource *used by Element Web* is compromised and its content is altered.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks targeting Element Web's resources (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of MITM attacks injecting malicious code by tampering with external resources *loaded by Element Web* during transit.
*   **Impact:**
