# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   What is the intended scale and user base for Element Web? This will influence scalability and performance requirements, as well as the criticality of certain security controls (e.g., DDoS protection).
    *   Are there specific regulatory compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that Element Web needs to adhere to? This will dictate specific security and privacy controls.
    *   What is the organization's risk tolerance? A higher risk tolerance might lead to accepting more risks or delaying implementation of certain security controls.
    *   What is the budget allocated for security measures? Budget constraints can impact the feasibility of implementing certain security controls.
    *   What is the process for incident response and security monitoring? Understanding the incident response plan is crucial for threat modeling.
*   Assumptions:
    *   End-to-end encryption is a core security feature and is considered essential for Element Web.
    *   User privacy and data confidentiality are high priorities.
    *   Standard web application security best practices are expected and should be implemented.
    *   The Matrix homeserver infrastructure is assumed to be reasonably secure, but Element Web should still implement client-side security controls to mitigate risks.
    *   The target deployment environment is a standard cloud-based infrastructure using CDN and web servers.
