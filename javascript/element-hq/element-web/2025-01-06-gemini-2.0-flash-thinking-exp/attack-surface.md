# Attack Surface Analysis for element-hq/element-web

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Element Web Contributes:** Element Web, as a dynamic web application handling user-generated content (messages, room names, user profiles), can be vulnerable if it doesn't properly sanitize or encode this content before rendering it in the browser. The complex nature of rendering rich text, markdown, and potentially embedded media increases the attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user crafts a message containing a `<script>` tag that, when viewed by other users, executes arbitrary JavaScript in their browsers, potentially stealing session cookies or redirecting them to a phishing site.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application interface for other users.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Developers):**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, significantly reducing the impact of XSS.
        *   Employ a framework that provides built-in protection against XSS vulnerabilities (e.g., React's JSX escaping).
        *   Regularly review and update dependencies to patch known XSS vulnerabilities in libraries.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Users):**
        *   Keep your web browser updated to the latest version.
        *   Be cautious about clicking on links from untrusted sources within Element Web.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/client-side_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities exist in the third-party JavaScript libraries and frameworks that Element Web relies upon.
    *   **How Element Web Contributes:** Element Web utilizes numerous open-source libraries (e.g., React, various UI components). If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, and Element Web uses the vulnerable versions, it becomes susceptible to exploitation.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific version of a UI library used by Element Web allows an attacker to trigger a denial-of-service or execute arbitrary code within the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:**  XSS, remote code execution in the browser, denial of service, information disclosure, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Developers):**
        *   Maintain a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track all dependencies.
        *   Implement automated dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to the latest secure versions.
        *   Consider using dependency management tools that provide vulnerability alerts.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Users):**
        *   No direct mitigation for users, as this is a development-side responsibility.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities (specifically related to End-to-End Encryption - E2EE)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_logic_vulnerabilities__specifically_related_to_end-to-end_encryption_-_e2ee_.md)

*   **Description:** Flaws in the JavaScript code handling the complex logic of E2EE can lead to security breaches.
    *   **How Element Web Contributes:** Element Web implements E2EE. Vulnerabilities in the key management, encryption/decryption processes, or secure storage of keys within the client-side code can compromise the confidentiality of messages.
    *   **Example:** A bug in the key verification process allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and inject their own key, allowing them to decrypt future messages.
    *   **Impact:**  Loss of message confidentiality, potential for impersonation if keys are compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Developers):**
        *   Implement rigorous code reviews, especially for security-sensitive areas like cryptography.
        *   Follow established best practices for cryptographic implementation.
        *   Consider third-party security audits of the E2EE implementation.
        *   Implement robust key verification mechanisms and clearly communicate the status to users.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Users):**
        *   Carefully verify the security status of conversations and the identities of participants.
        *   Be aware of potential phishing attempts that might try to trick you into accepting malicious keys.

## Attack Surface: [Local Storage/Session Storage Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/local_storagesession_storage_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information stored in the browser's local or session storage is accessed by malicious scripts.
    *   **How Element Web Contributes:** Element Web might store sensitive data like access tokens, encryption keys, or user preferences in local or session storage. If an XSS vulnerability exists, an attacker could execute JavaScript to access this stored data.
    *   **Example:** An XSS attack allows an attacker's script to read the access token stored in local storage and use it to impersonate the user.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, data theft, unauthorized access to user information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Developers):**
        *   Minimize the amount of sensitive data stored in local or session storage.
        *   If sensitive data must be stored, encrypt it client-side before storing it.
        *   Implement robust XSS prevention measures (as mentioned above) to prevent attackers from accessing this storage.
        *   Consider using HttpOnly and Secure flags for cookies (though this doesn't directly protect local/session storage).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies (Users):**
        *   Keep your web browser updated.
        *   Be cautious about running untrusted browser extensions.
