# Threat Model Analysis for element-hq/element-web

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Message Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_message_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious message containing JavaScript code. When a user's `element-web` client processes and renders this message, the embedded script executes within the user's browser context. This can happen through direct messages, room messages, or even state events.

**Impact:**  A successful XSS attack can allow the attacker to steal the user's session token (hijacking their account), exfiltrate encryption keys leading to the ability to decrypt past and future messages, impersonate the user to send further malicious messages, or redirect the user to a phishing site.

**Affected Component:** `Message rendering module`, `Event handling`, `DOM manipulation logic`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:** Implement strict input sanitization on all user-provided content before rendering. Utilize secure output encoding techniques to prevent the execution of injected scripts. Employ a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded. Regularly review and update dependencies.
* **Users:** Keep your browser and `element-web` application updated. Be cautious about clicking on links or interacting with content from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM-Based XSS)](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__dom-based_xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates parts of the URL (e.g., hash fragments) or other client-side data that is then used by JavaScript code in `element-web` to update the DOM without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Similar to regular XSS, this can lead to session hijacking, data theft, impersonation, and redirection to malicious sites.

**Affected Component:** `URL parsing logic`, `Client-side routing`, `DOM manipulation functions`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:** Avoid using client-side data directly in DOM manipulation without proper sanitization. Implement secure coding practices for handling URL parameters and other client-side inputs. Regularly audit JavaScript code for potential DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Users:** Be wary of suspicious links, especially those with unusual URL parameters or hash fragments.

## Threat: [Exposure of Encryption Keys through Client-Side Vulnerabilities](./threats/exposure_of_encryption_keys_through_client-side_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the `element-web` codebase could allow an attacker to access and exfiltrate the user's encryption keys, which are typically stored in the browser's local storage or IndexedDB. This could be achieved through XSS, or other client-side exploits.

**Impact:** If encryption keys are compromised, the attacker can decrypt past and future messages sent and received by the user, effectively breaking end-to-end encryption.

**Affected Component:** `Key management module`, `Local storage access`, `IndexedDB access`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:** Implement robust security measures to protect encryption keys at rest in the browser. Employ encryption for local storage if possible. Thoroughly test for client-side vulnerabilities that could lead to key exposure. Use secure storage mechanisms provided by the browser.
* **Users:**  Keep your browser and operating system secure and free from malware.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_dependencies.md)

**Description:** `element-web` relies on various third-party JavaScript libraries. These libraries may contain known security vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit if `element-web` uses a vulnerable version.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from XSS to remote code execution within the context of the `element-web` application.

**Affected Component:**  Various modules depending on the vulnerable library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:** Regularly update all third-party dependencies used by `element-web`. Implement a dependency management system to track and manage dependencies. Automated tools can be used to identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) where possible to ensure the integrity of loaded resources.
