# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for element-hq/element-web

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement a Robust Content Security Policy (CSP)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_a_robust_content_security_policy__csp_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a Robust Content Security Policy (CSP)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define the CSP Header:** In the web server configuration serving Element Web, set the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header.
    2.  **Start with a restrictive policy tailored for Element Web:** Begin with a base policy like: `default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data:; object-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'self'; base-uri 'self'; form-action 'self'; upgrade-insecure-requests; block-all-mixed-content; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint;` This is a starting point and needs to be adjusted based on Element Web's specific resource needs.
    3.  **Refine directives based on Element Web's functionalities:** Analyze Element Web's resource loading requirements, including CDNs for fonts, media servers, and any external integrations. Adjust CSP directives accordingly, adding allowed domains to directives like `font-src`, `img-src`, `media-src`, `connect-src`, etc.
    4.  **Use `'nonce'` or `'hash'` for inline scripts and styles in Element Web (if necessary):** If Element Web's codebase uses unavoidable inline scripts or styles, use nonces or hashes to allowlist specific inline code blocks instead of `'unsafe-inline'` for better security. This requires modifications in Element Web's code generation or templating.
    5.  **Enable CSP Reporting for Element Web deployments:** Configure a `report-uri` or `report-to` directive to receive reports of CSP violations specifically from Element Web deployments. Analyze these reports to identify policy issues and refine the CSP further for Element Web.
    6.  **Test and Iterate on CSP within Element Web environment:** Thoroughly test Element Web with the CSP enabled to ensure all features function correctly. Iterate on the policy based on testing and CSP violation reports, specifically within the context of Element Web's functionalities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** CSP significantly reduces the attack surface for XSS in Element Web by controlling script sources and inline execution.
    *   **Data Injection Attacks (Medium Severity):** CSP can limit the loading of malicious data from untrusted sources within Element Web.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** `frame-ancestors` directive mitigates clickjacking attacks against Element Web.
    *   **Mixed Content (Medium Severity):** `block-all-mixed-content` and `upgrade-insecure-requests` directives prevent loading insecure resources over HTTPS in Element Web, protecting user data in transit.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** High risk reduction in Element Web.
    *   **Data Injection:** Medium risk reduction in Element Web.
    *   **Clickjacking:** Medium risk reduction for Element Web.
    *   **Mixed Content:** High risk reduction in Element Web.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Load Widgets in iframes within Element Web:** Ensure that all widgets within Element Web are loaded within `<iframe>` elements, isolating them from the main Element Web application context. This should be a core architectural design of Element Web's widget system.
    2.  **Apply Restrictive CSP to Widget iframes in Element Web:** Set a restrictive Content Security Policy specifically for widget iframes loaded by Element Web. This CSP should limit the iframe's access to resources, scripts, and browser features. Example iframe CSP: `default-src 'none'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self' data:;` (adjust based on widget needs, but keep it minimal and specific to widget iframes within Element Web).
    3.  **Use `sandbox` attribute on iframes in Element Web:** Utilize the `sandbox` attribute on `<iframe>` tags used for widgets in Element Web to further restrict widget capabilities. Use a restrictive sandbox configuration and selectively add sandbox flags as needed (e.g., `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"` - use with caution and only if necessary for widgets in Element Web).
    4.  **Minimize Inter-frame Communication in Element Web:** Limit communication between the main Element Web application and widget iframes to only essential interactions. Use secure inter-frame communication mechanisms (e.g., `postMessage` with origin validation) for communication between Element Web and its widgets.
