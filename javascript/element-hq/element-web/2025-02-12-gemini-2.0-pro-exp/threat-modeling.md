# Threat Model Analysis for element-hq/element-web

## Threat: [Key Compromise Due to Client-Side Bug](./threats/key_compromise_due_to_client-side_bug.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in Element Web's cryptographic implementation (e.g., in the Olm/Megolm library wrappers, key storage, or key exchange logic) allows an attacker to steal or compromise a user's encryption keys. This could be due to a coding error, a weakness in the random number generator, or a side-channel attack (though less likely in a web context).
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of E2EE.  The attacker can decrypt all past and future messages for the affected user.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `crypto` directory (Olm/Megolm implementation), `MatrixClient` (key management), `IndexedDB` (key storage).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Use well-vetted and audited cryptographic libraries (e.g., `libolm`, `@matrix-org/olm`).
            *   Follow secure coding practices for cryptography.  Avoid common pitfalls like weak randomness, improper key handling, and timing attacks.
            *   Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing of the cryptographic implementation.
            *   Use the Web Crypto API where possible for cryptographic operations.
            *   Implement secure key storage mechanisms (e.g., encrypting keys in IndexedDB with a key derived from a user password).
            *   Implement key rotation mechanisms.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Keep Element Web updated to the latest version.
            *   Use a strong and unique password for their Matrix account.
            *   Be aware of the risks of physical access to their device.

## Threat: [Malicious Widget Accessing User Data](./threats/malicious_widget_accessing_user_data.md)

*   **Description:** A user adds a malicious or compromised widget to a room. The widget exploits its privileges to access the user's messages, room metadata, or other sensitive information.  It could also attempt to perform actions on behalf of the user.  This is *high* risk because Element Web controls the widget sandboxing.
    *   **Impact:**  Data breach, unauthorized access to user accounts, potential for further attacks (e.g., spreading malware).
    *   **Affected Component:**  Widget API (`Widgets.js` or similar), `MatrixClient` (permissions management for widgets), `Room` object (widget integration).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement a *strict* sandboxing mechanism for widgets.  Widgets should run in isolated iframes with limited access to the main Element Web context.
            *   Implement a clear and granular permissions model for widgets.  Users should be able to control which data and actions a widget can access.
            *   Provide a mechanism for users to report malicious widgets.
            *   Consider a review process for widgets before they are made available to users.
            *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the resources that widgets can load.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Only add widgets from trusted sources.
            *   Carefully review the permissions requested by a widget before adding it.
            *   Regularly review and remove any unnecessary widgets.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in one of Element Web's JavaScript dependencies (e.g., a vulnerable version of React, a compromised npm package). The attacker could inject malicious code, steal data, or perform other unauthorized actions. This is *high* risk because Element Web directly includes and executes these dependencies.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could range from significant data leaks to complete compromise of the client.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Any component that uses the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:**  High (depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Regularly update *all* dependencies to their latest secure versions.  Use automated tools like `npm audit` or Dependabot to identify and track vulnerabilities.
            *   Use a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies and their versions.
            *   Carefully vet any new dependencies before adding them to the project.
            *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of potential dependency vulnerabilities.
            *   Implement robust code review processes.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Keep Element Web updated to the latest version.

## Threat: [Malicious Homeserver Eavesdropping on Unencrypted Messages (Element Web's Handling)](./threats/malicious_homeserver_eavesdropping_on_unencrypted_messages__element_web's_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** While the *primary* responsibility lies with the homeserver, Element Web's handling of encryption failures or lack of clear UI indicators can lead to users unknowingly sending unencrypted messages. A compromised or malicious homeserver intercepts these messages.
    *   **Impact:** Complete loss of confidentiality for unencrypted communications.
    *   **Affected Component:** `MatrixClient` (message sending/receiving logic, E2EE handling), `Room` object (UI for displaying encryption status).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if E2EE is expected but fails silently). High (if users are unaware of the lack of E2EE due to poor UI).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Ensure E2EE is enabled by default for new rooms where possible.
            *   Provide *very* clear, prominent, and *unambiguous* visual indicators of E2EE status.  Use multiple cues (icons, colors, text).
            *   Implement robust error handling for E2EE failures.  *Fail securely* â€“ do *not* send messages in plain text if encryption fails.  Display a clear error message to the user.
            *   Make it difficult or impossible for users to *accidentally* disable E2EE.
            *   Regularly audit the E2EE implementation and UI.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Always *actively* verify that E2EE is enabled before sending sensitive information.
            *   Use key verification (cross-signing).

## Threat: [Homeserver Spoofing Messages (Element Web's Handling)](./threats/homeserver_spoofing_messages__element_web's_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** While the homeserver originates the spoof, Element Web's failure to properly verify signatures or clearly display sender information allows the spoofed message to be presented as legitimate.
    *   **Impact:**  Loss of message integrity and authenticity. Users could be tricked.
    *   **Affected Component:** `MatrixClient` (event handling and verification logic), `Room` object (message display and ordering).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement *strict* signature verification for *all* incoming events.  *Reject* any event with an invalid signature.
            *   Clearly display the sender's *full* Matrix ID and homeserver, even within the room display.  Visually distinguish messages from different homeservers.
            *   Implement robust replay attack protection.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be wary of messages that seem out of character.
            *   Verify the sender's Matrix ID and homeserver if in doubt.
            *   Use key verification.

## Threat: [Malicious Device Added to Account (Element-Web's Role)](./threats/malicious_device_added_to_account__element-web's_role_.md)

*   **Description:** Although the device is added via homeserver interaction, Element-Web is responsible for device management and key-sharing. If Element-Web fails to properly notify the user, or makes device verification difficult, a malicious device can compromise E2EE.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of E2EE.
    *   **Affected Component:** `MatrixClient` (device management, key sharing), `crypto` (device verification).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement robust device verification mechanisms (cross-signing). Make it *easy* and intuitive for users to verify new devices.
            *   Provide *clear, immediate, and unavoidable* notifications to users when a new device is added to their account (e.g., prominent in-app notifications, email alerts).
            *   Allow users to easily view and manage their logged-in devices, including the ability to remotely log out devices *with a single click*.
            *   Implement rate limiting on device additions.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Regularly review their logged-in devices.
            *   Use cross-signing.
            *   Use a strong password and 2FA (if available).
