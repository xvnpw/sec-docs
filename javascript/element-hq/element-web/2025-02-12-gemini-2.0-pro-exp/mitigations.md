## Mitigation Strategy: [Enhanced End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) Verification (Client-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/enhanced_end-to-end_encryption__e2ee__verification__client-side_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Developer Steps (element-web):**
        *   Modify the `element-web` UI to make the device verification process (cross-signing) a central part of the user onboarding flow.
        *   Develop interactive, guided tutorials *within the Element Web UI* to explain device verification.
        *   Implement prominent visual cues (icons, color-coded badges) *within the Element Web UI* to clearly indicate verification status.
            *   Green: Verified
            *   Yellow: Unverified
            *   Red: Untrusted/Blacklisted
        *   Display a clear, unavoidable warning message *within the Element Web UI* when sending to unverified devices.
        *   Add periodic reminders (pop-up notifications *within Element Web*) to verify devices.
        *   Implement "blacklist" or "distrust" device options *in the Element Web UI*.
        *   Ensure secure storage and management of device verification keys *within the Element Web client*.
        *   Consider implementing "TOFU" (Trust On First Use) with mandatory verification after a set period *within the Element Web client*.
        *   Improve device management UI *within Element Web*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Compromised Devices:** (Severity: High)

    *   **Impersonation:** Significantly reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Cross-signing and device verification are implemented.
    *   Basic visual indicators exist.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More prominent visual cues and warnings.

    1.  **Developer Steps (element-web):**
        *   Ensure *all* widgets are embedded within iframes *within the Element Web application*.
        *   Apply the most restrictive `sandbox` attribute to these iframes:
            *   `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-forms allow-popups-to-escape-sandbox"` (Adjust *only* as strictly necessary).  *Never* allow `allow-top-navigation` without extreme caution and justification.
        *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) *specifically for the widget iframes* within `element-web`.
        *   Develop a mechanism *within element-web* to verify the origin of widgets before loading.
        *   Implement a granular permission model *within element-web* for widgets, controlling capabilities via `postMessage` API.  Carefully validate all messages.
        *   Provide clear documentation *for widget developers* on secure coding practices, specifically addressing `element-web` integration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Widgets:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Phishing:** (Severity: Medium-High)
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Significantly reduces risk.
    *   **Phishing:** Reduces risk.
    *   **DoS:** Reduces risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Widgets are loaded in iframes.
    *   Some basic sandboxing likely exists.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Most restrictive `sandbox` attribute.
    *   Strict CSP for widget iframes.
    *   Widget origin verification.
    *   Granular permission model.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Event Validation (Client-Side)](./mitigation_strategies/robust_event_validation__client-side_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Developer Steps (element-web):**
        *   Implement client-side validation of *all* incoming Matrix events *within the Element Web client, before rendering*:
            *   Re-verify signatures and timestamps.
            *   Check for inconsistencies in event data.
            *   Sanitize and encode user-provided data within events to prevent XSS *within the Element Web rendering logic*.
        *   Implement client-side rate limiting *within Element Web* to mitigate spam and DoS.
        *   Log all client-side validation failures *within Element Web* (consider privacy implications).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Events:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Spam:** (Severity: Medium)
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** (Severity: Medium)

        *   Configure the SCA tool to scan *all element-web dependencies* for vulnerabilities.
        *   Set up automated alerts *for the element-web development team*.

        *   Use dependency pinning (e.g., `package-lock.json`) *in the element-web project*.
        *   Thoroughly test `element-web` after major dependency updates.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries:** (Severity: Variable, potentially High)

        *   Implement checks *within the Element Web client* to ensure client-side state consistency with received events. Detect and handle inconsistencies.
        *   Use checksums or other data integrity mechanisms *within the Element Web client* to verify the integrity of critical client-side data.
        *   Explore tamper-proofing techniques *for the Element Web client code* (obfuscation, integrity checks - with the understanding that these are not foolproof).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Client-Side State Manipulation:** (Severity: Medium-High) - Attackers attempting to modify the client's view of the Matrix world, potentially leading to incorrect display of information or exploitation of logic flaws.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side State Manipulation:** Reduces the likelihood of successful attacks and makes exploitation more difficult.
