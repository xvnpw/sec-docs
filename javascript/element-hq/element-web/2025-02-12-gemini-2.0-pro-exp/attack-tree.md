## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to, Modify, or Disrupt Matrix Communications](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to__modify__or_disrupt_matrix_communications.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker, focusing on the core functionality and data handled by Element-Web and the Matrix protocol.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Element-Web Codebase](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_element-web_codebase.md)

*   **Description:** Directly targeting flaws within the Element-Web application code itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities that exist within the client-side code of Element-Web, running in the user's browser. This is the primary attack surface.
    *   **[**XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) (via Element-Web Specific Features)**]**
        *   **Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into the Element-Web application, exploiting features specific to Element-Web.
        *   **[**E2EE Bypass**]**
            *   **Description:** A highly critical XSS vulnerability that specifically targets and bypasses the end-to-end encryption mechanism of Matrix, allowing the attacker to read or modify encrypted messages. This could involve manipulating key exchange, message decryption, or other E2EE-related processes.
        *   **Rich Text Editor Vuln:** (Not explicitly in the high-risk tree, but a common XSS vector)
            *    **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the rich text editor used for message formatting.
    *   **[CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) (via Element-Web Specific Features)]**
        *   **Description:** Tricking a user's browser into making unintended requests to the Matrix homeserver, leveraging Element-Web specific features. This could lead to unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Dependencies of Element-Web](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_dependencies_of_element-web.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries that Element-Web depends on.
    *   **[**Vulnerable Dependency**]**
        *   **Description:** A dependency with a known, publicly disclosed, and unpatched vulnerability.
        *   **[**Known Vuln. in Dep.**]**
            *   **Description:**  The specific instance of a known vulnerability within a dependency. Attackers often scan for these known vulnerabilities.
    *   **[**Supply Chain Attack on Dependency**]**
        *   **Description:** A sophisticated attack where the attacker compromises the supply chain of a dependency, injecting malicious code before it reaches Element-Web.
        *   **[**Compromised Developer Account**]**
            *   **Description:** The attacker gains access to the account of a developer who maintains a dependency used by Element-Web. This allows the attacker to push malicious code updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Element-Web Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_element-web_configuration.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses or misconfigurations in how Element-Web or the connected homeserver is set up.
    * **[Misconfigured Homeserver]**
        * **Description:** The Matrix homeserver that Element-Web connects to is improperly configured, exposing vulnerabilities.
        * **[**Outdated Homeserver Config**]**
            * **Description:** The homeserver software (e.g., Synapse) is running an outdated version with known vulnerabilities.
        * **[**Weak Crypto Config**]**
            * **Description:** The homeserver is configured to use weak cryptographic algorithms or settings, making it easier to break encryption or forge signatures.
    * **[Weak/Default Credentials]**
        * **Description:** Using default or easily guessable credentials for the homeserver administration or other related services, allowing attackers to gain unauthorized access.
