# Threat Model Analysis for element-hq/element-web

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Maliciously Crafted Messages](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_maliciously_crafted_messages.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends a specially crafted message through the Matrix server that, when rendered by Element Web, executes arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This could involve stealing session cookies specific to the Element Web instance, accessing local storage data used by Element Web, or performing actions on their behalf within the Element Web application.

**Impact:** High - Account takeover within the Element Web context, theft of data managed by Element Web (e.g., encryption keys, message history), potential for further attacks if Element Web's session is compromised.

**Affected Component:** `message rendering module`, specifically the functions responsible for sanitizing and displaying message content (e.g., within the `Message` component or related rendering logic).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure strict input sanitization and output encoding are implemented in Element Web's message rendering logic.
*   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed within the Element Web application.
*   Regularly review and update Element Web to benefit from security patches addressing XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_leading_to_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

**Description:** A third-party JavaScript library used by Element Web contains a known vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine. This could be triggered by the user simply visiting a room or interacting with content that causes Element Web to load the vulnerable library's code.

**Impact:** Critical - Full compromise of the user's machine, including data theft, malware installation, and system control, directly resulting from a flaw in Element Web's dependencies.

**Affected Component:** Varies depending on the vulnerable library, but could affect various modules like `media handling`, `encryption`, or `UI components` that rely on the vulnerable dependency within Element Web.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly scan Element Web's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `Yarn audit`.
*   Keep Element Web's dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools for continuous monitoring of dependency risks within the Element Web project.

## Threat: [Insecure Handling of Web Workers Leading to Code Injection](./threats/insecure_handling_of_web_workers_leading_to_code_injection.md)

**Description:** If Element Web utilizes Web Workers and doesn't properly sanitize the code or data passed to them, an attacker could potentially inject malicious code that gets executed within the worker's context. This injected code could then perform actions with the privileges of the Web Worker, potentially accessing sensitive data or manipulating the Element Web application's state.

**Impact:** High - Potential for arbitrary code execution within the Web Worker's scope in Element Web, potentially leading to data manipulation, information disclosure, or further attacks within the application.

**Affected Component:** Modules within Element Web utilizing Web Workers, such as those involved in `encryption`, `media processing`, or background tasks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and sanitize any code or data passed to Web Workers within Element Web.
*   Ensure Web Workers operate with the least privileges necessary within the Element Web architecture.
*   Avoid dynamically generating code for execution within Web Workers in Element Web if possible.
