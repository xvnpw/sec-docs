# Attack Surface Analysis for element-hq/element-web

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Maliciously Crafted Messages](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_maliciously_crafted_messages.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into messages that are then executed in other users' browsers when they view the message.
*   **How Element Web Contributes:** Element Web's rendering of user-generated content from Matrix rooms, including formatted text, mentions, and potentially embedded media, directly contributes to this risk. Insufficient input sanitization within Element Web allows malicious HTML or JavaScript to be rendered.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views this message in Element Web, the alert box pops up, demonstrating arbitrary JavaScript execution. More sophisticated attacks could steal cookies or redirect users.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the Element Web interface for other users.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust client-side input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content within Element Web. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and the actions that scripts can perform. Leverage the security features of the UI framework (e.g., React's built-in XSS protection). Regularly update dependencies to patch potential vulnerabilities in rendering libraries.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Room Names or Topics](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_room_names_or_topics.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to message XSS, but the malicious script is injected into the room name or topic, affecting all users viewing the room.
*   **How Element Web Contributes:** Element Web's display of room names and topics, without proper sanitization, allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of users viewing the room information.
*   **Example:** An attacker creates a room with the name `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`. When other users join or view the room list in Element Web, the script executes.
*   **Impact:** Similar to message XSS, potentially affecting a wider group of users within a specific room.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strict input validation and output encoding specifically for room names and topics within Element Web. Enforce character limits and restrict potentially dangerous characters. Apply a restrictive CSP.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Client-Side Storage](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_client-side_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as session tokens or encryption keys (if temporarily managed client-side by Element Web), is vulnerable to access by malicious scripts or browser extensions.
*   **How Element Web Contributes:** Element Web's choice of using browser storage mechanisms (like `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`) and the way it handles sensitive data within these mechanisms directly impacts this risk. If not implemented with strong security measures, this data can be accessed through vulnerabilities within Element Web itself.
*   **Example:** An XSS vulnerability within Element Web allows an attacker's script to access `localStorage` and steal the user's session token, allowing them to impersonate the user.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to messages and data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Minimize the storage of sensitive information client-side within Element Web. If client-side storage is necessary, use secure storage mechanisms with appropriate flags (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure` for cookies if applicable). Implement robust XSS prevention measures within Element Web as the primary defense against this attack. Consider using the browser's `IndexedDB` API with encryption for more sensitive data if absolutely necessary client-side.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Element Web relies on numerous third-party JavaScript libraries and frameworks. Known vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited through Element Web if not properly managed and updated.
*   **How Element Web Contributes:** Element Web's inclusion and integration of these dependencies directly exposes it to any vulnerabilities present within them. Failure to regularly update these dependencies leaves the application vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A known XSS vulnerability exists in a specific version of a UI library used by Element Web. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through a carefully crafted input processed by that library within Element Web.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including XSS, remote code execution, and information disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement a robust dependency management process for Element Web. Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`. Keep dependencies updated to the latest stable and secure versions. Utilize Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in the CI/CD pipeline for Element Web.
