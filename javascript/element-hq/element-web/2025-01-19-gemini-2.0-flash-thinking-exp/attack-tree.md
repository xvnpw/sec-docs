## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Element Web (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_element_web__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved a significant breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Element Web (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_element_web__critical_node_.md)

This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses within the client-side code of Element Web, which is executed in the user's browser. Client-side vulnerabilities are often easier to target and can have a broad impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

XSS vulnerabilities allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Script via Message Content (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__inject_malicious_script_via_message_content__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector: An attacker crafts a malicious message containing JavaScript code. When this message is rendered by Element Web in another user's browser, the script executes within the context of that user's session.
        AND Target Vulnerable Message Rendering Logic (CRITICAL NODE): This highlights the underlying weakness in how Element Web processes and displays messages.
            **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Leverage Insufficient Input Sanitization (CRITICAL NODE): The core issue is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided message content before it is rendered, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities Leading to XSS (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities_leading_to_xss__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector: Element Web relies on various third-party JavaScript libraries. If these libraries have known XSS vulnerabilities, an attacker can exploit them through Element Web.
        AND Identify and Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Element Web's Dependencies (CRITICAL NODE): This involves the attacker identifying vulnerable dependencies.
            Leverage Publicly Disclosed Vulnerabilities in Libraries like React, etc. (CRITICAL NODE):  Attackers often target well-known libraries with publicly documented vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) Implementation (Client-Side) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_end-to-end_encryption__e2ee__implementation__client-side_1acd3603.md)

Attack Vector: This path targets weaknesses in the client-side implementation of end-to-end encryption, potentially allowing attackers to decrypt messages or compromise encryption keys.
        AND Target Weaknesses in Key Management or Encryption/Decryption Logic (CRITICAL NODE): This focuses on flaws in how encryption keys are managed or how encryption/decryption is performed.
            Exploit Bugs in the Olm/Megolm Libraries (if directly exposed) (CRITICAL NODE):  Olm and Megolm are the cryptographic libraries used by Matrix for E2EE. Vulnerabilities in these libraries can be critical.
            Manipulate Key Exchange Processes (CRITICAL NODE): Attackers might try to interfere with the key exchange process to compromise the encryption.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Local Storage or Session Management (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_local_storage_or_session_management__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector: Element Web stores certain data locally in the user's browser, including potentially sensitive information like session tokens or encryption keys. Vulnerabilities in how this data is stored and managed can be exploited.
        AND Access Sensitive Data Stored Locally (CRITICAL NODE): The goal is to gain access to this locally stored sensitive data.
            **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Exploit Lack of Encryption for Sensitive Local Storage Data (CRITICAL NODE): If sensitive data is stored without encryption, it can be easily accessed by an attacker with access to the user's local storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Element Web's Handling of External Resources (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_element_web's_handling_of_external_resources__critical_n_ad1eeea4.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how Element Web handles external content, such as links and media.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Handling of External Media or Links (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_insecure_handling_of_external_media_or_links__critical_node_.md)

Attack Vector: Attackers can leverage Element Web's handling of external resources to serve malicious content or redirect users to malicious sites.
        **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Serve Malicious Content via Linked Resources (CRITICAL NODE):
            AND Inject Links to Malicious Websites or Files (CRITICAL NODE): Attackers inject malicious links into messages or other content within Element Web.
                **[HIGH-RISK PATH]** Leverage Lack of Proper URL Validation or Content Security Policy (CSP) (CRITICAL NODE): The lack of proper validation of URLs or a strong Content Security Policy allows the injection and execution of malicious external content.
