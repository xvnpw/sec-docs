* **Threat:** Malicious Configuration Files
    * **Description:** An attacker could introduce or modify configuration files that `rc` loads. This could be achieved by exploiting write permissions on default configuration file locations, through vulnerabilities allowing file uploads, or by compromising the system where configuration files are stored. The attacker would then inject malicious settings, potentially including JavaScript code.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server if the configuration file contains malicious JavaScript that `rc` evaluates. Modification of application behavior, leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other security compromises.
    * **Affected `rc` Component:** Configuration Loading (specifically the file loading mechanism).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Restrict write access to configuration file directories to only the necessary user accounts.
        * Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files.
        * Avoid using default, predictable locations for sensitive configuration files.
        * If possible, disable JavaScript evaluation within configuration files.
        * Implement strong input validation and sanitization for any configuration values read from files.

* **Threat:** Remote Code Execution via JavaScript Evaluation
    * **Description:** `rc` allows evaluating JavaScript code within configuration files. If an attacker can control the content of a loaded configuration file (through the "Malicious Configuration Files" threat), they can execute arbitrary code on the server.
    * **Impact:** Full system compromise, data breaches, installation of malware, and other severe consequences. This is a critical vulnerability.
    * **Affected `rc` Component:** JavaScript Evaluation (the part of `rc` that processes and executes JavaScript within configuration).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strongly recommended:** Disable JavaScript evaluation within `rc` if it's not a necessary feature for the application. This is the most effective mitigation.
        * If JavaScript evaluation is required, strictly control the sources of configuration files and implement rigorous security measures to prevent unauthorized modification.
        * Consider using a sandboxed environment for evaluating JavaScript, although this can be complex to implement securely.

* **Threat:** Environment Variable Manipulation
    * **Description:** An attacker with control over the application's execution environment could set malicious environment variables that `rc` uses to override default configurations. This could happen in containerized environments, shared hosting, or if the attacker has gained some level of system access.
    * **Impact:** Modification of application behavior, potentially leading to security bypasses, redirection of traffic to malicious servers, or exposure of sensitive information if logging or other features are manipulated.
    * **Affected `rc` Component:** Configuration Loading (specifically the environment variable loading mechanism).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Run the application in an isolated environment with restricted access to environment variables.
        * Avoid relying on environment variables for highly sensitive configuration.
        * If environment variables are used, document which ones are expected and validate their values.
        * Implement security policies to prevent unauthorized modification of environment variables in the deployment environment.

* **Threat:** Exploiting Configuration Precedence
    * **Description:** Attackers might exploit the order in which `rc` loads configuration sources (command-line arguments > environment variables > config files) to override legitimate settings with malicious ones. By manipulating a higher-precedence source they can control, they can force the application to use their configuration.
    * **Impact:**  This can lead to various issues depending on the overridden settings, including security bypasses (e.g., disabling authentication), data manipulation (e.g., changing database connection details), or denial of service (e.g., setting resource limits to very low values).
    * **Affected `rc` Component:** Configuration Loading (the logic that determines the order of precedence for configuration sources).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Be aware of `rc`'s configuration precedence rules and design the application's configuration accordingly.
        * Prioritize more secure configuration sources for critical settings.
        * Clearly document the expected configuration sources and their precedence.
        * Implement monitoring to detect unexpected configuration changes.

* **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Configuration Files
    * **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, etc.) might be stored in configuration files that are accessible to unauthorized individuals. This could be due to misconfigured file permissions, insecure storage, or vulnerabilities allowing access to the file system.
    * **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to further attacks, data breaches, or unauthorized access to other systems.
    * **Affected `rc` Component:** Configuration Loading (the file loading mechanism and how it handles the content of configuration files).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files.
        * Use secure storage mechanisms for secrets, such as environment variables (when properly secured), dedicated secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), or encrypted configuration files.
        * Ensure strict file permissions on configuration files, limiting read access to only the necessary user accounts.
