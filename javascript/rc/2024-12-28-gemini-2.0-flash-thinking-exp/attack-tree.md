**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application Using rc (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access or control over the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to the `rc` library.

* **Influence Configuration Source Priority (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * Attackers aim to manipulate the order in which `rc` loads configuration sources. By successfully influencing this priority, they can ensure their malicious configuration takes precedence over legitimate configurations.

* **Manipulate Environment Variables to Override Other Sources (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attackers attempt to set or modify environment variables that `rc` uses to locate or prioritize configuration files. This allows them to inject their own configuration sources.

* **Set RC_CONFIG_FILES or similar to point to attacker-controlled file (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * Attackers specifically target environment variables like `RC_CONFIG_FILES` (or similar variables used by `rc` or the application) to point the application to a configuration file they control. This file will contain malicious configuration values.

* **Inject Malicious Configuration Values (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Once control over a configuration source is established, attackers inject malicious values into configuration keys. These values are designed to exploit vulnerabilities in how the application processes and uses configuration data.

* **Exploit Vulnerable Application Logic Using Malicious Config (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * The injected malicious configuration values are used by the application in a way that leads to exploitation. This could involve code injection, command injection, path traversal, or other vulnerabilities depending on how the application handles configuration.

* **Control Command-Line Arguments to Override Other Sources (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attackers attempt to influence the command-line arguments passed to the application during startup. This allows them to specify a malicious configuration file directly, overriding other configuration sources.

* **Provide --config or similar argument pointing to attacker-controlled file (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * Attackers specifically use command-line arguments like `--config` (or similar options) to point the application to a configuration file they control, containing malicious values.

* **Prototype Pollution via Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * Attackers leverage the ability to set object properties through configuration to inject properties like `__proto__` or modify `constructor.prototype`. This can globally alter the behavior of objects in the JavaScript runtime.

* **Inject "__proto__" or "constructor.prototype" Properties (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * This is the specific action of setting the `__proto__` property or modifying the `constructor.prototype` of objects through configuration.

* **Modify Object Behavior Globally (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Successful prototype pollution allows attackers to change the behavior of all objects inheriting from the polluted prototype. This can lead to unexpected application behavior, denial of service, or even code execution.

* **Achieve Code Execution via Gadgets or Exploitable Logic (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * By carefully crafting the prototype pollution payload, attackers can leverage existing code "gadgets" within the application or its dependencies to achieve arbitrary code execution.

* **Exploit Vulnerable Configuration Handlers (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * Attackers target specific parts of the application code that handle configuration values. If these handlers are not properly secured, attackers can inject malicious values that trigger vulnerabilities within these handlers.

* **Inject Malicious Values into Specific Configuration Keys (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * Attackers identify specific configuration keys that are processed by vulnerable handlers and inject malicious values tailored to exploit those vulnerabilities.

* **Trigger Code Execution in Vulnerable Handler Function (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * The injected malicious values are processed by the vulnerable handler function in a way that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could involve using functions like `eval`, `child_process.spawn`, or insecure templating engines.
