### Key Attack Surface List for Applications Using `rc` (High & Critical, Directly Involving `rc`)

*   **Attack Surface:** Configuration File Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to write to configuration files that `rc` loads. This allows them to inject arbitrary configuration values.
    *   **How `rc` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rc`'s core functionality is to load configuration from various file locations. It inherently trusts the content of these files.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises the server and modifies the `config/default.json` file to include a malicious API key or a command to be executed when the application starts.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially critical. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if the application uses `eval` on configuration values, data breaches by injecting malicious credentials, or denial of service by injecting resource-intensive configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file system permissions to prevent unauthorized write access to configuration directories and files.
        *   Avoid using `eval` or similar dynamic code execution on configuration values.
        *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums) for configuration files to detect unauthorized modifications.
        *   Run the application with the least privileged user account.

*   **Attack Surface:** Environment Variable Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains control over the environment variables where the application is running. Since `rc` reads configuration from environment variables, the attacker can inject malicious values.
    *   **How `rc` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rc` explicitly looks for and loads configuration from environment variables prefixed with the application name.
    *   **Example:** In a containerized environment, an attacker might manipulate the environment variables passed to the container to override database credentials or API endpoints.
    *   **Impact:** High. Attackers can override intended configuration, potentially disabling security features, redirecting application flow, or gaining access to sensitive resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict control over the environment where the application runs.
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables if possible. Consider using secrets management solutions.
        *   Validate and sanitize environment variables used for configuration before using them in the application.
        *   Run the application in isolated environments to limit the scope of environment variable manipulation.

*   **Attack Surface:** Command-Line Argument Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker can influence the command-line arguments used to start the application. `rc` parses these arguments for configuration overrides.
    *   **How `rc` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `rc` is designed to parse command-line arguments and use them to override configuration from other sources.
    *   **Example:** An attacker might exploit a vulnerability in a process management system to inject malicious command-line arguments when the application is started or restarted, such as `--api_key=malicious_key`.
    *   **Impact:** High. Similar to environment variable manipulation, attackers can override settings, potentially compromising security or application functionality. The impact depends on the specific configuration options controllable via command-line arguments.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the process by which the application is started and managed.
        *   Limit access to the system where the application is deployed.
        *   Avoid exposing sensitive configuration options directly as command-line arguments if possible.
        *   Validate and sanitize command-line arguments used for configuration.
