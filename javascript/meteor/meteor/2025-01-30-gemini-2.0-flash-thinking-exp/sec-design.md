# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Rapid Application Development: Meteor aims to enable developers to build applications quickly and efficiently, reducing time to market.
 - Real-time Functionality: Meteor is designed for building applications that require real-time data updates and interactions.
 - Full-Stack JavaScript Development: Meteor allows developers to use JavaScript for both frontend and backend development, simplifying the development process and reducing technology stack complexity.
 - Open Source Community: Meteor relies on a vibrant open-source community for contributions, package development, and support.
- Business Risks:
 - Security Vulnerabilities: As a full-stack framework and open-source project, Meteor and its ecosystem might be susceptible to security vulnerabilities that could impact applications built with it.
 - Dependency Management Risks: Meteor relies on a package ecosystem, introducing risks associated with vulnerable or malicious packages.
 - Community Dependency: The project's future and support depend on the active community, which can fluctuate.
 - Compatibility and Updates:  Maintaining compatibility across different browsers, platforms, and evolving JavaScript standards can be challenging.
 - Performance and Scalability:  Real-time features and reactive data handling might introduce performance and scalability challenges for large-scale applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Rate limiting on API endpoints (implementation details would be in application code or server configurations).
 - security control: Input sanitization and validation (developer responsibility within application code, guidance in documentation).
 - security control: HTTPS for communication (server configuration responsibility, recommended in deployment guides).
 - security control: MongoDB security features (database configuration responsibility, documented by MongoDB).
 - security control: Package security scanning (community-driven, tools like `npm audit` or similar can be used on project dependencies).
- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community-maintained packages, which might have varying security quality.
 - accepted risk: Developer responsibility for implementing many security controls within applications built on Meteor.
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in older versions of Meteor and its packages if not actively maintained.
- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Automated security scanning of application code (SAST/DAST) integrated into the development pipeline.
 - security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning as part of the build process.
 - security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing of applications built with Meteor.
 - security control: Security training for developers on secure coding practices for Meteor applications.
 - security control: Centralized security logging and monitoring for Meteor applications.
- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Meteor applications should support secure user authentication mechanisms.
  - Requirement: Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be considered for sensitive applications.
  - Requirement: Secure password storage using hashing algorithms.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user permissions and access to resources.
  - Requirement: Fine-grained authorization mechanisms to control data access based on user roles and context.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: All user inputs, both on the client and server-side, must be thoroughly validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, command injection).
  - Requirement: Input validation should be applied at multiple layers (client-side for immediate feedback, server-side for security enforcement).
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Sensitive data at rest and in transit must be encrypted using strong cryptographic algorithms.
  - Requirement: Secure key management practices for encryption keys.
  - Requirement: Proper use of HTTPS for all communication between clients and servers.
