### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Lack of Input Validation in Methods

#### 9. Lack of Input Validation in Methods (Critical Node)

**Description:** This critical node highlights the vulnerability arising from the absence or insufficient input validation within Meteor methods. When server-side methods, which handle user requests and data manipulation, fail to properly validate incoming data, they become susceptible to various attacks. This lack of validation allows attackers to inject malicious payloads or manipulate data in unintended ways, leading to severe security breaches.

**Attack Vectors:**

##### 9.1. Command Injection

*   **Explanation:** Command injection occurs when an application executes operating system commands based on user-supplied input without proper sanitization. If a Meteor method constructs a system command using unsanitized input, an attacker can inject malicious commands that will be executed by the server with the privileges of the application.

*   **Meteor Context:** Meteor methods run on the server and can interact with the underlying operating system. If a method uses user input to construct commands for processes like file manipulation, external tools, or system utilities (e.g., using `child_process` module in Node.js), it becomes vulnerable to command injection.

*   **Example Scenario:**

    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable Meteor Method (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
    Meteor.methods({
      processFile: function(filename) {
        check(filename, String); // Basic type check, insufficient!
        const command = `convert ${filename} output.png`; // Constructing command with user input
        try {
          const result = child_process.execSync(command); // Executing command
          return "File processed successfully!";
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Error processing file:", error);
          throw new Meteor.Error("file-processing-error", "Failed to process file.");
        }
      }
    });
    ```

    In this vulnerable example, even with a basic `check(filename, String)`, an attacker could provide a filename like `"image.jpg; rm -rf /"` . The constructed command would become `convert image.jpg; rm -rf / output.png`, leading to the execution of `rm -rf /` on the server, potentially deleting critical system files.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Server Compromise:** Full control over the server, allowing attackers to install malware, steal sensitive data, or launch further attacks.
    *   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data stored on the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the server or disrupting services.
    *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust and damage to the organization's reputation.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid System Commands:**  Whenever possible, avoid executing system commands based on user input. Look for alternative libraries or built-in functionalities to achieve the desired outcome.
    *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize user input. Use allow lists of characters and formats.  For filenames, validate against allowed extensions and paths.
    *   **Parameterization/Escaping:** If system commands are unavoidable, use parameterization or proper escaping mechanisms provided by the command execution library to prevent injection.  However, parameterization is often not directly applicable to shell commands in the same way as database queries.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Meteor application with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful command injection attack.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not directly preventing command injection, CSP can help mitigate some consequences by limiting the actions an attacker can take after gaining control.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify and address potential command injection vulnerabilities.

##### 9.2. NoSQL Injection (MongoDB)

*   **Explanation:** NoSQL injection, specifically MongoDB injection in this context, occurs when an attacker manipulates MongoDB queries constructed in server-side code by injecting malicious operators or commands through user-supplied input. This can bypass security measures, allow unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

*   **Meteor Context:** Meteor applications heavily rely on MongoDB. Server methods often construct MongoDB queries using user input to filter, search, or manipulate data. If these queries are built dynamically without proper input validation, they become vulnerable to NoSQL injection.

*   **Example Scenario:**

    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable Meteor Method (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
    Meteor.methods({
      findUserByName: function(name) {
        check(name, String); // Basic type check, insufficient!
        const query = { username: name }; // Constructing query with user input
        return Users.find(query).fetch();
      }
    });
    ```

    In this vulnerable example, an attacker could provide a `name` like `{$ne: ''}`. The constructed query would become `{ username: {$ne: ''} }`, which would return all users in the `Users` collection, bypassing the intended search for a specific username. More sophisticated injections can involve operators like `$where`, `$regex`, or `$expr` to execute arbitrary JavaScript code or extract sensitive data.

    Another example using `$regex` for more advanced injection:

    ```javascript
    // Still Vulnerable Meteor Method (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
    Meteor.methods({
      searchUsers: function(searchTerm) {
        check(searchTerm, String); // Basic type check, insufficient!
        const query = { username: { $regex: searchTerm, $options: 'i' } }; // Constructing regex query
        return Users.find(query).fetch();
      }
    });
    ```

    An attacker could inject a malicious regex like `.*` or more complex patterns to extract data beyond the intended search scope or cause performance issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in MongoDB.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modification or deletion of data, leading to data integrity issues.
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** Circumventing authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining access to resources or functionalities beyond the attacker's intended privileges.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crafting queries that consume excessive server resources, leading to performance degradation or server crashes.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterization (Query Builders):** Utilize MongoDB query builders (like Mongoose or Meteor's built-in methods in a secure way) that parameterize queries, preventing direct injection of operators.  Avoid constructing queries using string concatenation with user input.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize user input before using it in MongoDB queries. Define allowed characters, data types, and formats.  Specifically, sanitize or reject MongoDB operators in user input if they are not intended to be used directly by users.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Database Access):** Grant the Meteor application only the necessary database permissions. Limit read, write, and administrative privileges to the minimum required for its functionality.
    *   **Input Whitelisting:**  Instead of blacklisting potentially dangerous characters or operators, use whitelisting to explicitly allow only expected and safe input patterns.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Specifically test for NoSQL injection vulnerabilities in Meteor methods that interact with MongoDB.
    *   **Use Secure Query Patterns:**  Favor using exact match queries or predefined query structures over dynamic query construction based on raw user input.

##### 9.3. Business Logic Bypasses

*   **Explanation:** Business logic bypasses occur when attackers manipulate input parameters to server methods in ways that circumvent intended business rules, security checks, or access controls. This can lead to unauthorized actions, data manipulation, or access to restricted functionalities.

*   **Meteor Context:** Meteor methods often implement complex business logic, including authentication, authorization, data validation, and workflow management.  If input validation is insufficient or business logic is flawed, attackers can craft requests that bypass these checks and achieve unintended outcomes.

*   **Example Scenario:**

    ```javascript
    // Vulnerable Meteor Method (DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION)
    Meteor.methods({
      updateOrderStatus: function(orderId, newStatus) {
        check(orderId, String);
        check(newStatus, String);

        const order = Orders.findOne(orderId);
        if (!order) {
          throw new Meteor.Error("order-not-found", "Order not found.");
        }

        // Insecure Authorization - Only checks if user is logged in, not roles
        if (!Meteor.userId()) {
          throw new Meteor.Error("not-authorized", "You must be logged in to update order status.");
        }

        // Insufficient Validation - Accepts any string as status
        if (newStatus !== "pending" && newStatus !== "processing" && newStatus !== "shipped" && newStatus !== "delivered") {
          console.warn("Invalid order status:", newStatus);
          // No error thrown, proceeds with potentially invalid status
        }

        Orders.update(orderId, { $set: { status: newStatus } });
        return "Order status updated successfully!";
      }
    });
    ```

    In this example, while there's a basic login check, there's no proper role-based authorization. An attacker could potentially call this method even if they are not authorized to change order statuses.  Furthermore, the status validation is weak; it only logs a warning but still proceeds to update the order with an invalid status. An attacker could exploit this to set arbitrary statuses, potentially disrupting order processing or gaining unauthorized access to order information based on status.

    Another bypass could involve manipulating `orderId` to access or modify orders belonging to other users if authorization is not correctly implemented based on user ownership of orders.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to restricted functionalities or data.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Modifying data in ways that violate business rules or integrity.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Performing actions that should be restricted to users with higher privileges.
    *   **Financial Loss:**  Manipulating prices, discounts, or transactions leading to financial losses.
    *   **Reputational Damage:**  Loss of customer trust and damage to the organization's reputation due to business process failures or data breaches.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Validation:**  Implement comprehensive input validation that goes beyond basic type checks. Validate against allowed values, ranges, formats, and business rules.
    *   **Strong Authorization:** Implement robust authorization mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can perform specific actions. Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC) as appropriate. Meteor's `alanning:roles` package or similar solutions can be helpful.
    *   **Business Logic Validation:**  Enforce business rules and constraints within server methods. Validate the state of the application and data before performing actions.
    *   **Secure Session Management:**  Ensure secure session management to prevent session hijacking or manipulation.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Method Access):**  Restrict access to sensitive methods to only authorized users or roles.
    *   **Thorough Testing:**  Conduct thorough testing, including business logic testing and edge case testing, to identify potential bypass vulnerabilities.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:**  Proactively review code and business logic to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
