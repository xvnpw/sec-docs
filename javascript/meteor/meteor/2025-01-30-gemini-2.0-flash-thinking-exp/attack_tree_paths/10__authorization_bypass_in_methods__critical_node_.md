### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Authorization Bypass in Methods

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Missing Authorization Checks

**Description:**

This is the most fundamental and often critical authorization vulnerability. It occurs when server-side Meteor methods that perform sensitive operations (e.g., data modification, deletion, access to restricted resources) are implemented without any checks to verify if the user making the request is authorized to perform that action.  Essentially, the method is publicly accessible to anyone who can call it, regardless of their identity or permissions.

**Meteor Context:**

Meteor methods are designed to be called from the client. If a method is defined on the server without any authorization logic, any client-side code (even malicious or crafted code) can invoke it.  Meteor's built-in `Meteor.userId()` function provides the identity of the currently logged-in user on the server, but if this is not used within the method to perform authorization checks, the method becomes vulnerable.

**Vulnerability Examples:**

*   **Direct Data Manipulation:** A method to delete a user account might be implemented without checking if the currently logged-in user is an administrator or the owner of the account being deleted.
    ```javascript
    Meteor.methods({
      deleteUser: function(userId) { // Vulnerable - No authorization check
        Meteor.users.remove(userId);
        return { success: true };
      }
    });
    ```
    An attacker could call this method from the client with any `userId` and potentially delete any user account.

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A method to promote a user to an administrator role might lack authorization checks, allowing any authenticated user to elevate their own privileges.
    ```javascript
    Meteor.methods({
      promoteToAdmin: function(userId) { // Vulnerable - No authorization check
        Roles.addUsersToRoles(userId, 'admin'); // Using a roles package
        return { success: true };
      }
    });
    ```

*   **Access to Sensitive Data:** A method to retrieve sensitive user data (e.g., email addresses, private profiles) might not verify if the requesting user is authorized to access that data.

**Impact:**

*   **Complete Data Breach:** Unauthorized access, modification, or deletion of sensitive data.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can manipulate user accounts, including administrator accounts.
*   **System Compromise:**  In severe cases, attackers could gain control over critical system functionalities.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of user trust and damage to the application's reputation.

**Likelihood:**

High. This is a common vulnerability, especially in early stages of development or when developers are not fully aware of security best practices. It's easy to overlook authorization checks, particularly in methods that seem "internal" but are still exposed to the client.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Implement Authorization Checks in Every Sensitive Method:**  **Mandatory.**  Every server-side method that performs actions beyond retrieving public data *must* include authorization checks.
*   **Utilize `Meteor.userId()`:**  Use `Meteor.userId()` to identify the currently logged-in user and base authorization decisions on this identity.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC using packages like `alanning:roles` or custom solutions to manage user roles and permissions. Check user roles within methods.
*   **Ownership-Based Authorization:** For data owned by specific users, implement checks to ensure that only the owner (or authorized roles) can modify or delete that data.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their tasks. Avoid overly permissive roles or methods.
*   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify methods lacking authorization checks.
*   **Automated Security Scans:** Utilize static analysis tools (if available for Meteor/JavaScript) to detect potential missing authorization checks.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: Flawed Authorization Logic

**Description:**

This attack vector arises when authorization checks are present in server methods, but the logic implementing these checks contains errors, vulnerabilities, or weaknesses that can be exploited to bypass them.  The intention to secure the method is there, but the implementation is flawed.

**Meteor Context:**

Authorization logic in Meteor methods often involves checking user roles, permissions, data ownership, or specific conditions. Flaws can occur in the conditional statements, comparisons, data retrieval, or assumptions made within this logic.

**Vulnerability Examples:**

*   **Client-Side Data Reliance for Authorization:**  Relying on data sent from the client to make authorization decisions without proper server-side validation.
    ```javascript
    Meteor.methods({
      updateDocument: function(docId, updateData) {
        check(docId, String);
        check(updateData, Object);
        const doc = Documents.findOne(docId);
        if (doc && doc.ownerId === updateData.userId) { // Flawed - Relying on client-provided userId
          Documents.update(docId, {$set: updateData});
          return { success: true };
        } else {
          throw new Meteor.Error('not-authorized', 'You are not authorized to update this document.');
        }
      }
    });
    ```
    An attacker could manipulate the `updateData.userId` on the client-side to match the `doc.ownerId` and bypass the intended authorization, even if they are not the actual owner.

*   **Logic Errors in Conditional Statements:** Incorrect use of logical operators (AND, OR), incorrect comparisons (e.g., using `==` instead of `===`), or off-by-one errors in range checks.
    ```javascript
    Meteor.methods({
      accessRestrictedResource: function(resourceId) {
        check(resourceId, String);
        const user = Meteor.users.findOne(this.userId);
        if (user && (user.role === 'admin' || user.role !== 'editor')) { // Flawed logic - OR and NOT combination
          // ... access granted
          return { access: true };
        } else {
          throw new Meteor.Error('not-authorized', 'Insufficient permissions.');
        }
      }
    });
    ```
    The flawed logic `(user.role === 'admin' || user.role !== 'editor')` will always evaluate to true if the user has a role, effectively bypassing the intended role-based restriction.

*   **Race Conditions in Authorization Checks:** In concurrent environments, authorization checks might be performed based on outdated data, leading to bypasses. (Less common in typical Meteor method scenarios but possible in complex systems).

*   **Inconsistent Authorization Logic Across Methods:**  Different methods might implement authorization checks in inconsistent ways, leading to loopholes and bypass opportunities.

**Impact:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Access to resources or functionalities that should be restricted.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Unauthorized modification or deletion of data.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining higher privileges than intended.
*   **Circumvention of Security Controls:** Bypassing intended security mechanisms.

**Likelihood:**

Medium to High. Flawed logic is a common source of vulnerabilities. Complex authorization requirements and intricate conditional statements increase the risk of introducing logic errors.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Server-Side Validation of All Input:** **Crucial.** Never trust client-provided data for authorization decisions directly. Validate and sanitize all input parameters on the server.
*   **Thorough Testing of Authorization Logic:**  Write unit and integration tests specifically to verify the correctness of authorization logic under various scenarios, including edge cases and boundary conditions.
*   **Use Clear and Simple Logic:**  Keep authorization logic as simple and straightforward as possible to reduce the chance of errors. Avoid overly complex nested conditions.
*   **Code Reviews Focused on Authorization:**  Specifically review authorization logic during code reviews, paying close attention to conditional statements, comparisons, and data retrieval.
*   **Centralized Authorization Logic (where feasible):**  Consider centralizing authorization logic into reusable functions or modules to ensure consistency and reduce code duplication.
*   **Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits to review authorization mechanisms and identify potential flaws.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (again):**  Minimize the complexity of authorization rules by granting only necessary permissions.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector: Parameter Tampering for Authorization Bypass

**Description:**

This attack vector involves manipulating the parameters sent to a server-side Meteor method in a way that circumvents the intended authorization checks. Attackers attempt to alter parameters to gain unauthorized access to data or perform actions they are not supposed to.

**Meteor Context:**

Clients can send arbitrary data as arguments to Meteor methods. While Meteor provides `check` for basic type validation, it doesn't inherently prevent attackers from sending validly typed but malicious values designed to bypass authorization logic.

**Vulnerability Examples:**

*   **Manipulating Resource IDs:**  Changing the `docId` parameter in a method to access documents belonging to other users.
    ```javascript
    Meteor.methods({
      viewDocument: function(docId) {
        check(docId, String);
        if (userHasAccess(this.userId, docId)) { // Authorization check
          const doc = Documents.findOne(docId);
          return doc;
        } else {
          throw new Meteor.Error('not-authorized', 'You do not have access to this document.');
        }
      }
    });
    ```
    If `userHasAccess` function relies on client-provided `docId` without sufficient validation or secure ID generation, an attacker could try to guess or enumerate valid `docId` values belonging to other users and access their documents.

*   **Changing User IDs in Parameters:**  If authorization logic relies on user IDs passed as parameters (as seen in the flawed logic example above), attackers can manipulate these IDs to impersonate other users.

*   **Exploiting Parameter Type Coercion or Weak Typing:**  In JavaScript (and therefore Meteor), type coercion can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior. Attackers might try to exploit this by sending parameters of unexpected types that are still considered "valid" by the `check` function but bypass authorization logic. (Less common in well-typed Meteor code, but worth considering).

*   **Bypassing Parameter-Based Filters:** If authorization logic uses parameters to filter data access, attackers might manipulate these parameters to broaden the filter and access more data than intended.

**Impact:**

*   **Data Breaches:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data belonging to other users or the system.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Performing actions on behalf of other users or without proper authorization.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Gaining access to resources or functionalities that should be restricted based on user roles or permissions.

**Likelihood:**

Medium. Parameter tampering is a well-known attack vector. The likelihood depends on the complexity of the application, the sensitivity of the data, and the robustness of the authorization logic and input validation.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Server-Side Validation and Sanitization of All Input:** **Critical.**  Beyond basic type checking with `check`, implement robust server-side validation to ensure that parameter values are within expected ranges, formats, and are valid in the application's context. Sanitize input to prevent injection attacks (though less directly related to authorization bypass, it's good practice).
*   **Use Secure and Unpredictable Resource IDs:**  Use UUIDs or other non-sequential, hard-to-guess identifiers for resources (documents, users, etc.). Avoid predictable or sequential IDs that can be easily enumerated.
*   **Avoid Relying on Client-Provided User IDs for Authorization:**  Whenever possible, use `this.userId` on the server to get the *authenticated* user ID. Avoid relying on user IDs passed as parameters from the client for authorization decisions unless absolutely necessary and very carefully validated.
*   **Implement Proper Data Filtering and Access Control:**  When using parameters to filter data, ensure that the filtering logic is secure and cannot be easily bypassed by manipulating parameters. Implement robust access control mechanisms that go beyond simple parameter-based filtering.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege (again):**  Minimize the data and functionalities accessible through methods to reduce the potential impact of parameter tampering.
*   **Regular Security Testing:** Conduct penetration testing and security audits to identify vulnerabilities related to parameter tampering and authorization bypass.
