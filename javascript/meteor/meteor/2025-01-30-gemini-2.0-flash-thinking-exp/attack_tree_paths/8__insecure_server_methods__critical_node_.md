#### 8. Insecure Server Methods (Critical Node)

This node highlights a critical area of vulnerability in Meteor applications: **server-side methods**. Meteor methods are the primary mechanism for clients to interact with the server and perform operations that require server-side logic and data access.  If these methods are not implemented securely, they can become a major entry point for attackers.

*   **Attack Vectors:** This category encompasses various ways attackers can exploit insecure server methods. The following sub-nodes detail the most critical attack vectors.

    *   **8.1. Lack of Input Validation in Methods (Critical Node):**

        *   **Description:** This vulnerability arises when server-side methods do not properly validate or sanitize user-provided input before processing it.  Attackers can manipulate input data to inject malicious code or data, leading to various injection vulnerabilities.

        *   **Impact in Meteor Applications:**
            *   **Injection Vulnerabilities (SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, Command Injection):**  If methods interact with databases (MongoDB in Meteor's case) or external systems without proper input sanitization, attackers can inject malicious queries or commands.  While MongoDB injection is less common than SQL injection, it's still possible, especially if using string concatenation to build queries or if relying on insecurely constructed selectors. Command injection can occur if methods execute shell commands based on user input.
            *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Indirect):** While server-side methods don't directly render HTML, they can store malicious data in the database. If this data is later retrieved and displayed on the client-side without proper output encoding, it can lead to stored XSS vulnerabilities.
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Maliciously crafted input can cause methods to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory, database connections), leading to DoS.
            *   **Data Corruption:**  Invalid or malicious input can corrupt data stored in the database, affecting application functionality and data integrity.
            *   **Logic Errors and Unexpected Behavior:**  Unvalidated input can lead to unexpected program behavior, potentially revealing sensitive information or creating further vulnerabilities.

        *   **Concrete Examples in Meteor:**

            ```javascript
            // Insecure Meteor Method - No Input Validation
            Meteor.methods({
              updateUserProfile: function(userId, profileData) {
                // No validation on profileData!
                Meteor.users.update(userId, { $set: { profile: profileData } });
              }
            });

            // Client-side call (potentially malicious)
            Meteor.call('updateUserProfile', 'someUserId', {
              name: 'John Doe',
              isAdmin: true // Attacker tries to elevate privileges
            });
            ```
            In this example, the `updateUserProfile` method directly updates the user profile with the provided `profileData` without any validation. An attacker could potentially inject arbitrary data, including fields like `isAdmin`, to escalate privileges or modify other sensitive user information.

            Another example, potentially leading to NoSQL injection (though less direct in MongoDB):

            ```javascript
            Meteor.methods({
              findUsersByName: function(name) {
                // Insecure - Directly using user input in query
                return Meteor.users.find({ "profile.name": name }).fetch();
              }
            });

            // Client-side call (potentially malicious)
            Meteor.call('findUsersByName', '{$gt: ""}'); // Might bypass intended query logic
            ```
            While MongoDB is generally less susceptible to traditional SQL injection, crafting specific input can still manipulate query logic if input is not properly handled.

        *   **Mitigation Strategies in Meteor:**

            *   **Use `check` package:** Meteor's built-in `check` package is crucial for input validation. It allows you to define expected data types and patterns for method arguments.

                ```javascript
                import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
                import { check, Match } from 'meteor/check';

                Meteor.methods({
                  updateUserProfile: function(userId, profileData) {
                    check(userId, String); // Validate userId is a string
                    check(profileData, { // Validate structure of profileData
                      name: String,
                      email: Match.Optional(String) // Optional email, if present, must be a string
                      // Do NOT allow isAdmin or other sensitive fields to be directly updated from client input
                    });

                    // ... further authorization checks (see next section) ...

                    const allowedProfileFields = { name: profileData.name, email: profileData.email }; // Only allow whitelisted fields
                    Meteor.users.update(userId, { $set: { profile: allowedProfileFields } });
                  }
                });
                ```

            *   **Whitelist Input Fields:**  Explicitly define and whitelist the fields that are allowed to be updated or processed from user input. Avoid directly accepting and using entire objects without validation and filtering.
            *   **Sanitize Input (if necessary):**  While `check` is primarily for type and structure validation, for specific cases where sanitization is needed (e.g., preventing XSS in stored data), use appropriate sanitization libraries or built-in functions. However, focus on proper output encoding on the client-side to prevent XSS.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Design methods to only accept the necessary input and perform the minimum required operations. Avoid methods that are overly broad and accept arbitrary data.

        *   **Detection and Prevention Tools/Techniques:**
            *   **Code Reviews:**  Manual code reviews are essential to identify methods lacking input validation.
            *   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Tools that can analyze code for potential input validation vulnerabilities (though Meteor-specific tools might be limited, general JavaScript static analysis can help).
            *   **Unit Testing:**  Write unit tests that specifically test method behavior with invalid and malicious input to ensure proper validation and error handling.
            *   **Fuzzing:**  Use fuzzing techniques to automatically generate and send a wide range of inputs to methods to identify unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

    *   **8.2. Authorization Bypass in Methods (Critical Node):**

        *   **Description:** This vulnerability occurs when server-side methods fail to properly enforce authorization checks, allowing users to perform actions they are not permitted to. This can lead to unauthorized access to data, modification of resources, or execution of privileged operations.

        *   **Impact in Meteor Applications:**
            *   **Unauthorized Data Access:**  Users can access data they should not be able to see, potentially including sensitive personal information, financial records, or confidential business data.
            *   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** Users can modify data they are not authorized to change, leading to data corruption, integrity issues, and potential business disruption.
            *   **Privilege Escalation:**  Users can gain administrative or higher-level privileges, allowing them to perform actions reserved for administrators, such as user management, system configuration changes, or data deletion.
            *   **Circumvention of Business Logic:**  Attackers can bypass intended business rules and workflows by directly calling methods without proper authorization checks.

        *   **Concrete Examples in Meteor:**

            ```javascript
            // Insecure Meteor Method - Missing Authorization Check
            Meteor.methods({
              deleteUser: function(userId) {
                // No authorization check! Anyone can call this method.
                Meteor.users.remove(userId);
              }
            });

            // Client-side call (malicious user deleting another user)
            Meteor.call('deleteUser', 'anotherUserId');
            ```
            In this example, the `deleteUser` method lacks any authorization check. Any logged-in user (or even an unauthenticated user if methods are not properly secured) could potentially call this method and delete any user account.

            Another example, insufficient authorization:

            ```javascript
            Meteor.methods({
              updateBlogPost: function(postId, content) {
                const post = BlogPosts.findOne(postId);
                if (!post) {
                  throw new Meteor.Error('post-not-found', 'Post not found');
                }
                // Insufficient authorization - only checks if post exists, not user's permission
                BlogPosts.update(postId, { $set: { content: content } });
              }
            });
            ```
            This method checks if the post exists, but it doesn't verify if the *current user* is authorized to update that specific post (e.g., if they are the author or an admin).

        *   **Mitigation Strategies in Meteor:**

            *   **Implement Authorization Checks in Methods:**  Every server-side method that performs sensitive operations or accesses protected data **must** include explicit authorization checks.
            *   **Use `Meteor.userId()` and Roles Packages:**  Utilize `Meteor.userId()` to identify the currently logged-in user and integrate with roles management packages (like `alanning:roles` or `percolate:synced-data`) to define and enforce user roles and permissions.

                ```javascript
                import { Meteor } from 'meteor/meteor';
                import { check, Match } from 'meteor/check';
                import { Roles } from 'meteor/alanning:roles'; // Example using alanning:roles

                Meteor.methods({
                  deleteUser: function(userId) {
                    check(userId, String);

                    if (!Meteor.userId()) { // Check if user is logged in
                      throw new Meteor.Error('not-authorized', 'Not logged in');
                    }

                    if (!Roles.userIsInRole(Meteor.userId(), ['admin'], Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP)) { // Check if user is an admin
                      throw new Meteor.Error('not-authorized', 'Insufficient permissions');
                    }

                    Meteor.users.remove(userId);
                  },

                  updateBlogPost: function(postId, content) {
                    check(postId, String);
                    check(content, String);

                    const post = BlogPosts.findOne(postId);
                    if (!post) {
                      throw new Meteor.Error('post-not-found', 'Post not found');
                    }

                    if (post.authorId !== Meteor.userId() && !Roles.userIsInRole(Meteor.userId(), ['admin'], Roles.GLOBAL_GROUP)) { // Check if user is author or admin
                      throw new Meteor.Error('not-authorized', 'Not authorized to update this post');
                    }

                    BlogPosts.update(postId, { $set: { content: content } });
                  }
                });
                ```

            *   **`allow/deny` Rules (for Collections, but less secure for complex logic):** While `allow/deny` rules can provide basic authorization for direct database operations, they are generally less secure and harder to manage for complex authorization logic within methods. It's recommended to perform authorization checks *within* methods for better control and security.
            *   **Centralized Authorization Logic:**  Consider creating reusable authorization functions or modules to avoid code duplication and ensure consistent authorization checks across methods.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege (again):**  Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions required for their roles.

        *   **Detection and Prevention Tools/Techniques:**
            *   **Code Reviews:**  Thorough code reviews are crucial to identify missing or inadequate authorization checks in methods.
            *   **Security Testing:**  Perform penetration testing to attempt to bypass authorization controls and access unauthorized resources or perform unauthorized actions.
            *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation and Testing:**  Ensure that RBAC is correctly implemented and tested to verify that users are only able to access resources and perform actions according to their assigned roles.
            *   **Automated Security Scanners (limited effectiveness for authorization logic):**  While automated scanners might not fully understand complex authorization logic, they can sometimes detect basic authorization issues or misconfigurations.

    *   **8.3. Server-Side Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):**

        *   **Description:** Meteor applications, like most modern web applications, rely on numerous server-side dependencies (npm packages). These dependencies can contain vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the application.

        *   **Impact in Meteor Applications:**
            *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Vulnerabilities in dependencies can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the server and application.
            *   **Data Breaches:**  Dependencies might have vulnerabilities that allow attackers to access sensitive data stored on the server or within the application's database.
            *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Vulnerable dependencies can be exploited to cause DoS attacks, making the application unavailable.
            *   **Supply Chain Attacks:**  Compromised dependencies can be intentionally injected with malicious code, affecting all applications that use them.

        *   **Concrete Examples in Meteor:**

            *   **Vulnerable npm Package:**  Imagine a Meteor application uses an older version of a popular npm package that has a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specially crafted request to the Meteor application, triggering the vulnerable code in the dependency and gaining control of the server.
            *   **Transitive Dependencies:**  Vulnerabilities can exist not only in direct dependencies but also in their dependencies (transitive dependencies).  Managing and patching these transitive dependencies is crucial.

        *   **Mitigation Strategies in Meteor:**

            *   **Regular Dependency Audits:**  Regularly audit your project's dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.

                ```bash
                meteor npm audit
                ```

            *   **Dependency Management Tools:**  Use dependency management tools (npm, yarn) effectively to manage and update dependencies.
            *   **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:**  Proactively update dependencies to the latest versions, especially security patches.  Consider using tools like `npm-check-updates` to help with this process.
            *   **Dependency Pinning/Locking:**  Use package lock files (`package-lock.json` for npm, `yarn.lock` for yarn) to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments and prevent unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.
            *   **Vulnerability Scanning Tools:**  Integrate vulnerability scanning tools into your CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for dependency vulnerabilities during builds and deployments. Services like Snyk, WhiteSource, and GitHub Dependabot can help.
            *   **Monitor Security Advisories:**  Stay informed about security advisories and vulnerability disclosures related to the dependencies your application uses. Subscribe to security mailing lists and monitor security news sources.
            *   **Principle of Least Dependency:**  Minimize the number of dependencies your application relies on.  Evaluate if you can implement certain functionalities yourself instead of relying on external packages, especially for small or critical functionalities.

        *   **Detection and Prevention Tools/Techniques:**
            *   **`npm audit` / `yarn audit`:**  Command-line tools for auditing npm/yarn dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Snyk, WhiteSource, GitHub Dependabot:**  Commercial and free services that provide continuous dependency vulnerability scanning, alerting, and remediation advice.
            *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA) Tools:**  Broader category of tools that analyze software components (including dependencies) for security risks, license compliance, and other issues.
            *   **CI/CD Integration:**  Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning into your Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment pipelines to automate vulnerability detection and prevent vulnerable code from reaching production.
