# Attack Surface Analysis for meteor/meteor

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured DDP Endpoint](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_ddp_endpoint.md)

*   **Description:**  Meteor applications expose a Distributed Data Protocol (DDP) endpoint by default. If not properly secured, this endpoint becomes a direct channel to the application's data and methods, bypassing intended UI and security layers.
*   **Meteor Contribution:** Meteor's core architecture *requires* DDP for real-time data synchronization between client and server. This inherent exposure of DDP is a fundamental and unavoidable aspect of Meteor applications, making its security paramount.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses a DDP client library to connect directly to the `/websocket` endpoint. They subscribe to publications intended for authenticated users, but due to missing server-side authorization in the publication, they gain access to sensitive user data like email addresses and private settings.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential for privilege escalation if methods are also accessible and exploitable, full application compromise possible.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Server-Side Authorization in Publications:**  *Always* implement robust server-side authorization within publication functions. Use `this.userId` and database queries to strictly control data access based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **Mandatory Server-Side Authorization in Methods:**  *Always* verify user permissions within Meteor methods *before* executing any actions. Implement role-based access control and input validation within methods.
    *   **Rate Limit DDP Connections and Requests:** Implement rate limiting on the DDP endpoint to prevent Denial of Service attacks. Utilize packages like `ddp-rate-limiter` and configure appropriate limits.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Publications and Methods:** Conduct frequent security audits, specifically reviewing publication and method code to ensure authorization logic is sound and consistently applied.

## Attack Surface: [Method Parameter Injection](./attack_surfaces/method_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Meteor methods are server-side functions callable from the client. If method parameters are not properly validated and sanitized on the server-side, they are highly vulnerable to injection attacks, allowing attackers to manipulate server-side logic and potentially gain full control.
*   **Meteor Contribution:** Meteor's method system is a core mechanism for client-server interaction. The ease of defining and calling methods from the client makes robust server-side input validation absolutely critical.
*   **Example:** A method to update product details takes a `productDescription` parameter. If this parameter is not sanitized, an attacker injects malicious JavaScript code. This code, when processed server-side, executes arbitrary commands on the server, allowing the attacker to install malware or steal sensitive server-side keys.
*   **Impact:** Server-side code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, data manipulation, denial of service, full control over the application and potentially the server infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side Input Validation and Sanitization:**  *Mandatory* and *thoroughly* validate and sanitize *all* method parameters on the server-side *before* any processing. Use robust validation libraries and context-aware sanitization techniques.
    *   **Parameter Type Enforcement:**  Enforce strict type checking for method parameters on the server-side to ensure data conforms to expected types and formats, preventing unexpected input.
    *   **Prepared Statements/Parameterized Queries (NoSQL Injection Prevention):**  *Always* use prepared statements or parameterized queries when interacting with MongoDB within methods to *completely prevent* NoSQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Method Execution Context:**  Run server-side method code with the absolute minimum necessary privileges to limit the potential damage from a successful injection attack.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Meteor Packages](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_meteor_packages.md)

*   **Description:** Meteor applications heavily rely on packages from Atmosphere and npm. Using outdated or vulnerable packages directly introduces known security vulnerabilities into the application, creating easily exploitable attack vectors.
*   **Meteor Contribution:** Meteor's package ecosystem is central to its development model. The ease of package integration can lead to developers overlooking the security implications of using third-party code, especially if packages are not actively maintained or vetted.
*   **Example:** A Meteor application uses an outdated version of a file upload package with a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker uploads a specially crafted file, exploiting the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server, gaining full control of the application and server.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete server compromise, data breach, denial of service, full control over the application and potentially the server infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Aggressive and Regular Package Updates:**  Implement a process for *continuous* monitoring and updating of Meteor core and *all* packages (Atmosphere and npm). Apply security updates *immediately* upon release.
    *   **Automated Vulnerability Scanning:**  Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools (e.g., `npm audit`, `snyk`, `OWASP Dependency-Check`) into the CI/CD pipeline to *proactively* identify and alert on known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Proactive Package Vetting and Selection:**  Before adopting any new package, conduct thorough research into its security history, maintainership, community reputation, and code quality. Prioritize actively maintained packages with strong security track records.
    *   **Dependency Locking and Reproducible Builds:**  Utilize package lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json` for npm) to ensure consistent dependency versions across all environments and prevent unexpected updates that could introduce vulnerabilities. Regularly audit and review dependency trees.
