# Threat Model Analysis for meteor/meteor

## Threat: [1. Data Leakage through Over-Publication](./threats/1__data_leakage_through_over-publication.md)

* **Threat:** Data Leakage via Insecure DDP Publications
* **Description:** An attacker could passively observe DDP traffic and gain access to sensitive data that is unintentionally published by the server. Developers using Meteor might over-publish data through DDP, assuming client-side filtering is sufficient for security, which is a flawed approach. This allows attackers to bypass client-side restrictions and access data they should not.
* **Impact:** Confidential data breach, privacy violations, reputational damage, potential regulatory fines.
* **Meteor Component Affected:** DDP Publication Functions (`Meteor.publish()`), DDP Protocol
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict server-side filtering and authorization within `Meteor.publish()` functions.
    * Minimize the data published by each publication to the absolute minimum required for authorized clients.
    * Avoid relying on client-side filtering for security.
    * Use `Meteor.methods()` for actions requiring authorization and data manipulation instead of publications.
    * Regularly audit publication code to ensure minimal data exposure and proper authorization.

## Threat: [2. DDP Method Argument Injection](./threats/2__ddp_method_argument_injection.md)

* **Threat:** DDP Method Argument Injection Vulnerability
* **Description:** An attacker could manipulate arguments passed to `Meteor.methods()`, potentially injecting malicious code or commands if server-side input validation is insufficient.  Due to Meteor's reliance on methods for server-side operations, vulnerabilities here can lead to significant compromise, including data manipulation, unauthorized actions, or even server-side code execution if exploited effectively.
* **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized access, potential server compromise, application malfunction, remote code execution in severe cases.
* **Meteor Component Affected:** DDP Method Handlers (`Meteor.methods()`), DDP Protocol
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input data received in `Meteor.methods()` arguments on the server-side.
    * Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent database injection vulnerabilities within methods.
    * Implement strong input validation using packages like `audit-argument-checks` to automatically validate method arguments against defined schemas.
    * Apply the principle of least privilege to method functionality and access control, ensuring methods only perform necessary actions.

## Threat: [3. Client-Side Security Logic Bypass in Meteor Applications](./threats/3__client-side_security_logic_bypass_in_meteor_applications.md)

* **Threat:** Client-Side Security Logic Exploitation
* **Description:**  While not a vulnerability in Meteor itself, Meteor's architecture encourages significant client-side logic. Developers might mistakenly implement security checks or authorization logic solely in client-side JavaScript. An attacker, controlling the client-side environment (browser), can easily bypass these client-side checks by manipulating the JavaScript code, allowing them to perform unauthorized actions or access data as if they were authorized. This is amplified in Meteor applications due to the framework's emphasis on client-side reactivity and single-page application architecture.
* **Impact:** Data integrity issues, unauthorized actions performed as legitimate users, circumvention of intended security measures, potential for privilege escalation.
* **Meteor Component Affected:** Client-Side JavaScript Code, Templates, Helpers (within Meteor application structure)
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Never rely solely on client-side logic for security enforcement in Meteor applications.**
    * Always perform critical security checks and authorization on the server-side within `Meteor.methods()` and publications.
    * Minimize sensitive logic and data handling in client-side code.
    * Implement robust server-side validation and authorization for all critical operations, treating the client as untrusted.
    * Educate developers on the dangers of client-side security and emphasize server-side enforcement in Meteor applications.
