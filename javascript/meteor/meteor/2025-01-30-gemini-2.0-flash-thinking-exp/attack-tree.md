## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Meteor Application (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_meteor_application__critical_node_.md)

This is the root goal. All subsequent attack paths are vectors to achieve this compromise.  Successful exploitation of any of the sub-nodes can lead to application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Meteor Specific) (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__meteor_specific___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the client-side application to be executed in users' browsers. This can be achieved through:
        *   **DOM-Based XSS:** Manipulating the DOM environment on the client-side to execute malicious scripts, often through unsanitized user input rendered in templates.
        *   **Reflected XSS:** Injecting malicious scripts via URL parameters or form submissions that are immediately reflected in the page without proper sanitization.
        *   **Stored XSS:** Persistently storing malicious scripts in the database, which are then served to users when they access the affected data.
    *   **Client-Side Logic Manipulation:** Exploiting flaws in client-side JavaScript code to bypass security checks, manipulate data in the client-side MiniMongo database, or alter the intended application behavior.
    *   **Client-Side Dependency Exploits:** Leveraging known security vulnerabilities in client-side JavaScript libraries (packages from npm or Atmosphere) used by the Meteor application.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Client-Side Code Injection/Manipulation (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/3__client-side_code_injectionmanipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** (Similar to "Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities" but focusing on code injection and manipulation)
    *   **JavaScript Injection:** Injecting and executing arbitrary JavaScript code within the client's browser context.
    *   **DOM Manipulation:** Altering the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page to change its appearance or behavior, potentially leading to malicious actions.
    *   **Client-Side Logic Bypasses:**  Modifying or circumventing client-side JavaScript logic to bypass security controls or gain unauthorized access to features.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Insecure Client-Side Logic (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/4__insecure_client-side_logic__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Bypassing Client-Side Validation:**  Client-side validation is easily bypassed. Attackers can use browser developer tools or intercept requests to send invalid or malicious data directly to the server, bypassing client-side checks.
    *   **Data Manipulation in MiniMongo:** While MiniMongo is not persistent, attackers can manipulate data in the client-side cache to influence client-side behavior or craft malicious requests to the server based on this manipulated data.
    *   **Logic Flaws in Client-Side Routing or State Management:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how client-side routing or application state is managed to gain unauthorized access to parts of the application or trigger unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Client-Side Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/5__client-side_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs):** Utilizing publicly available information and exploits for known vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in outdated client-side JavaScript packages.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Less Likely but Possible):** Discovering and exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities (zero-day vulnerabilities) in client-side packages.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. DOM-Based XSS via Client-Side Rendering Flaws (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/6__dom-based_xss_via_client-side_rendering_flaws__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Unsanitized User Input in Templates:** Injecting malicious scripts through user-controlled data that is dynamically rendered in the client-side templates (e.g., using Meteor's templating engine or React/Vue integrations) without proper encoding or sanitization.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Client-Side Framework/Library Rendering Logic:** Exploiting subtle flaws or unexpected behavior in how Meteor or other client-side libraries handle dynamic content rendering, leading to XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities (Meteor Specific) (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/7__exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities__meteor_specific___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Server-Side Code Injection:** Injecting malicious code into server-side execution contexts due to lack of input validation. This can include:
        *   **Command Injection:** Injecting operating system commands to be executed on the server.
        *   **NoSQL Injection (MongoDB):** Injecting malicious MongoDB queries to bypass security, extract sensitive data, or modify data in the database.
    *   **Authorization Bypasses:** Circumventing server-side authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to resources or perform actions that should be restricted.
    *   **Server-Side Dependency Exploits:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities in server-side Node.js packages (from npm or Atmosphere) used by the Meteor application.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Insecure Server Methods (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/8__insecure_server_methods__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** (This is a category; specific attack vectors are detailed in sub-nodes)
    *   **Lack of Input Validation in Methods (Critical Node):** Leads to injection vulnerabilities (see point 9).
    *   **Authorization Bypass in Methods (Critical Node):** Leads to unauthorized access and actions (see point 10).
    *   **Server-Side Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):** Leads to various server-side exploits (see point 11).

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Lack of Input Validation in Methods (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/9__lack_of_input_validation_in_methods__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Command Injection:** Injecting operating system commands into server methods that process user-supplied input without proper sanitization, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
    *   **NoSQL Injection (MongoDB):** Injecting malicious MongoDB query operators or commands into server methods that construct MongoDB queries based on user input, potentially allowing attackers to bypass security, extract data, or modify data in the database.
    *   **Business Logic Bypasses:** Manipulating input parameters to server methods in ways that bypass intended business logic or security checks, leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [10. Authorization Bypass in Methods (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/10__authorization_bypass_in_methods__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Missing Authorization Checks:** Server methods that perform sensitive operations lack any authorization checks, allowing any authenticated or even unauthenticated user to call them and perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Flawed Authorization Logic:** Authorization checks are present in server methods but contain logic errors or vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to bypass them by manipulating parameters, session state, or other factors.
    *   **Parameter Tampering for Authorization Bypass:** Manipulating method parameters in a way that circumvents authorization checks, for example, by changing user IDs or resource identifiers to access data or actions belonging to other users.

## Attack Tree Path: [11. Server-Side Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/11__server-side_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities (CVEs):** Utilizing publicly available information and exploits for known vulnerabilities in outdated server-side Node.js packages. This can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), Denial of Service (DoS), or data breaches, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Zero-Day Exploits (Less Likely but Possible):** Discovering and exploiting previously unknown vulnerabilities in server-side packages, potentially leading to severe compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [12. Vulnerable Atmosphere/NPM Packages (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/12__vulnerable_atmospherenpm_packages__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:** (This is a category; specific attack vectors are detailed in sub-node)
    *   **Using Outdated Packages with Known Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):**  The primary attack vector is exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated packages (see point 13).

## Attack Tree Path: [13. Using Outdated Packages with Known Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path):](./attack_tree_paths/13__using_outdated_packages_with_known_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploiting Publicly Known CVEs:** Attackers can easily find and utilize publicly available exploits and proof-of-concept code for known vulnerabilities in outdated packages.
    *   **Automated Exploitation Tools:** Attackers can use automated vulnerability scanners and exploitation tools that are designed to identify and exploit known vulnerabilities in outdated dependencies, making exploitation relatively easy and scalable.

## Attack Tree Path: [14. Weak Password Policies (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/14__weak_password_policies__critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attackers can use automated tools to try a large number of password combinations to guess user passwords, especially if password policies are weak (e.g., short passwords, no complexity requirements).
    *   **Dictionary Attacks:** Attackers can use dictionaries of common passwords and variations to quickly crack weak passwords.
    *   **Credential Stuffing:** If user credentials (usernames and passwords) are leaked from other breaches, attackers can attempt to reuse these credentials to log into the Meteor application, which is more likely to succeed if password policies are weak and users reuse passwords across services.

## Attack Tree Path: [15. Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) (Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/15__lack_of_multi-factor_authentication__mfa___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Account Takeover via Password Compromise:** If user passwords are compromised through phishing, password leaks, or cracking (especially with weak password policies), the lack of MFA means that attackers can easily take over user accounts without any additional security barrier.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Attackers can more easily trick users into revealing their passwords through social engineering tactics (e.g., phishing) if MFA is not in place, as there is no secondary authentication factor to protect the account.
