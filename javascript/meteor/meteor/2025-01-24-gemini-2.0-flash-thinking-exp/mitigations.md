# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for meteor/meteor

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Publications with Authorization and Field Limiting (Meteor Publications)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_publications_with_authorization_and_field_limiting__meteor_publications_.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Review all `Meteor.publish()` functions:** Identify all publications in your server-side code. These are Meteor's mechanism for sending data to clients.
        2.  **Implement Authorization Logic *within* Publications:** Inside each `Meteor.publish()` function, add server-side code to verify if the current user is authorized to access the data being published. Use `this.userId` and server-side data to determine authorization.  *This is crucial in Meteor as publications are the primary way data is exposed.*
        3.  **Apply Field Limiting using `fields` option:** In `Meteor.publish()`, use the `fields` option to explicitly select only the necessary data fields to send to the client. Avoid publishing entire documents unnecessarily. *This is a Meteor-specific feature to control data exposure in publications.*
        4.  **Test Publication Security:** Thoroughly test each publication to ensure only authorized users receive the intended data and only the specified fields are published. *Testing should focus on Meteor's publish/subscribe system.*

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access via Publications (High Severity):**  If publications are not secured, Meteor's publish/subscribe system can inadvertently expose sensitive data to unauthorized clients. *This is a direct threat arising from Meteor's data handling model.*
        *   **Data Over-Exposure through Publications (Medium Severity):** Publishing more data than needed via publications increases the risk of accidental data leaks, even if access is technically authorized. *This is related to efficient use of Meteor's publication feature.*

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access via Publications:** High reduction in risk. Securing publications is fundamental to controlling data access in Meteor applications.
        *   **Data Over-Exposure through Publications:** Medium reduction in risk. Field limiting in publications minimizes unnecessary data transfer and potential exposure.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Authorization checks are implemented in publications related to user profiles and administrative dashboards, located in `server/publications/userPublications.js` and `server/publications/adminPublications.js`. Field limiting is used in user profile publications. *Example within a Meteor project.*

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Authorization checks and field limiting are not fully implemented in publications related to project data and task management, located in `server/publications/projectPublications.js` and `server/publications/taskPublications.js`. These publications currently publish more data than necessary and lack granular authorization. *Example within a Meteor project, highlighting Meteor-specific areas.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Robust Method Validation and Authorization (Meteor Methods)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_robust_method_validation_and_authorization__meteor_methods_.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Define Schemas for Meteor Method Arguments:** Use a validation library (like `joi` or `simpl-schema`) to define schemas for the arguments of all `Meteor.methods()` functions. *This is about securing Meteor's method calls.*
        2.  **Validate Method Arguments Server-Side:** Inside each `Meteor.methods()` function, validate the incoming arguments against the defined schema *on the server*. Reject invalid requests. *Server-side validation is key for Meteor method security.*
        3.  **Implement Authorization Logic *within* Methods:** Before executing the core logic in `Meteor.methods()`, implement server-side authorization checks. Verify user permissions and roles using `this.userId` and server-side data. *Authorization within methods is crucial for controlling actions in Meteor.*
        4.  **Test Method Security:** Thoroughly test each method with various inputs and user roles to ensure validation and authorization are effective. *Testing should focus on Meteor's method invocation mechanism.*

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Actions via Methods (High Severity):** Insecure Meteor methods can allow attackers to perform actions they shouldn't be able to, leading to data manipulation or system compromise. *This is a direct threat from insecure Meteor method design.*
        *   **Data Manipulation via Methods (High Severity):** Lack of validation in Meteor methods can lead to data corruption or injection attacks if methods interact with the database. *This is about securing data flow through Meteor methods.*

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Actions via Methods:** High reduction in risk. Securing Meteor methods is essential for controlling server-side operations.
        *   **Data Manipulation via Methods:** High reduction in risk. Input validation in methods prevents malicious data from being processed server-side.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Input validation using `simpl-schema` is implemented for user registration and profile update methods in `server/methods/userMethods.js`. Basic authorization checks are in place for administrative methods in `server/methods/adminMethods.js`. *Example within a Meteor project, showing Meteor method context.*

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Method validation and authorization are missing or incomplete for methods related to project and task management in `server/methods/projectMethods.js` and `server/methods/taskMethods.js`. Many methods lack input validation and rely on client-side validation. *Example within a Meteor project, highlighting Meteor method security gaps.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Rate Limiting for Methods (Meteor Methods)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_rate_limiting_for_methods__meteor_methods_.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Use a Rate Limiting Package (e.g., `ddp-rate-limiter`):** Install a Meteor package designed for rate limiting DDP methods. *This is about using a Meteor-specific or compatible package.*
        2.  **Configure Rate Limits for `Meteor.methods()`:** Define rate limits specifically for your Meteor methods. Set limits per method, per user, and per time window. *This is about applying rate limiting to Meteor's method calls.*
        3.  **Apply Rate Limits to Relevant Methods:** Use the package's API to apply the configured rate limits to your `Meteor.methods()` functions, especially for sensitive operations like login, data modification, etc. *Targeting Meteor methods for rate limiting.*
        4.  **Customize Rate Limit Error Handling:** Provide informative error messages to clients when they exceed rate limits. *User feedback within the Meteor application context.*

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Meteor Methods (High Severity):** Rate limiting protects Meteor methods from brute-force attempts, such as password guessing or repeated malicious actions. *Specifically targeting attacks via Meteor methods.*
        *   **DoS Attacks via Method Overload (High Severity):** Rate limiting can prevent attackers from overwhelming the server by excessively calling Meteor methods. *Protecting against DoS targeting Meteor's method handling.*
        *   **Method Abuse (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting helps prevent abuse of Meteor methods for unintended purposes or resource exhaustion. *Controlling usage of Meteor methods.*

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks on Meteor Methods:** High reduction in risk. Rate limiting makes brute-force attacks via Meteor methods much less effective.
        *   **DoS Attacks via Method Overload:** Medium reduction in risk. Rate limiting can mitigate some DoS attacks targeting Meteor methods.
        *   **Method Abuse:** Medium reduction in risk. Rate limiting helps control and limit abuse of Meteor methods.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic rate limiting is implemented for login and password reset methods using `ddp-rate-limiter` in `server/rate-limiter.js`. *Example within a Meteor project, showing Meteor-specific rate limiting.*

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Rate limiting is not implemented for other critical Meteor methods, particularly those related to data modification, resource creation, and administrative actions in `server/methods/projectMethods.js`, `server/methods/taskMethods.js`, and `server/methods/adminMethods.js`. *Example within a Meteor project, highlighting areas for Meteor method rate limiting.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Remove `autopublish` Package in Production (Meteor Package)](./mitigation_strategies/remove__autopublish__package_in_production__meteor_package_.md)

*   **Description:**
        1.  **Check `meteor list` or `packages` file:** Verify if the `autopublish` package is included in your Meteor project's dependencies.
        2.  **Remove `autopublish`:** If `autopublish` is present, remove it using `meteor remove autopublish` in your project directory.
        3.  **Verify Removal:** Run `meteor list` again to confirm that `autopublish` is no longer listed.
        4.  **Implement Explicit Publications:** Ensure you have implemented explicit `Meteor.publish()` functions for all data that clients legitimately need to access. *This is the secure alternative to `autopublish` in Meteor.*

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Massive Data Exposure (Critical Severity):** The `autopublish` package automatically publishes *all* database collections to *all* clients. This is a severe security vulnerability as it exposes potentially sensitive data to anyone who can connect to your Meteor application. *This is a direct and critical security risk introduced by the `autopublish` Meteor package.*

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Massive Data Exposure:** Critical reduction in risk. Removing `autopublish` is essential to prevent unintentional and widespread data exposure in Meteor applications.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   The `autopublish` package is confirmed to be removed from the `packages` file and is not listed in `meteor list` in the production environment. *Example within a Meteor project.*

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   N/A - `autopublish` is already removed in production. However, regularly verify that it does not accidentally get reintroduced during development or deployment processes. *Reinforcing the removal of a Meteor-specific risky package.*
