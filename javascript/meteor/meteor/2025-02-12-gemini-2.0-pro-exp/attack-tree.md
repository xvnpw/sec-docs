## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate Methods & Publications [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_methods_&_publications__hr_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the most critical area for Meteor security. Meteor Methods are server-side functions callable from the client, and Publications control data subscriptions. Flaws in either can lead to severe vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Insecure Methods [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_insecure_methods__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Meteor Methods lacking proper server-side validation and authorization checks. This allows attackers to directly call methods with malicious parameters, bypassing any client-side restrictions.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Attacker inspects client-side code (using browser developer tools) to identify Meteor Method calls and their parameters.
    2.  Attacker crafts malicious input, potentially modifying user IDs, bypassing permission checks, or injecting unexpected data types.
    3.  Attacker directly calls the Meteor Method using the `Meteor.call()` function (or equivalent) from the browser console, bypassing client-side validation.
    4.  The server-side Method executes with the malicious input, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, deletion, or other unintended actions.
*   **Example:** A method `updateUserProfile(userId, profileData)` intended to update *only* the logged-in user's profile is called with a different `userId`, allowing the attacker to modify another user's profile.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side Validation:** Validate *all* input parameters within the Method definition on the server. Use schema validation (e.g., `simpl-schema`). Check data types, ranges, and formats.
    *   **Authentication:** Verify that the user is authenticated using `this.userId` within the Method.
    *   **Authorization:** Check that the authenticated user has the *permission* to perform the requested action. Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if necessary.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the frequency of Method calls to prevent abuse.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Bypass Client-Side Auth in Methods](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_bypass_client-side_auth_in_methods.md)

*   **Description:** Developers mistakenly rely solely on client-side authentication checks, which are easily bypassed.
*   **Attack Vector:** Identical to 1.1, but the vulnerability stems from the *absence* of server-side authentication, rather than inadequate validation.
*   **Mitigation:** *Always* perform authentication and authorization checks *within* the Method definition on the server, using `this.userId`.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Abuse `autopublish` or Insecure Publications [CN] [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_abuse__autopublish__or_insecure_publications__cn___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** `autopublish` automatically publishes all data to all clients (a development-only package that should *never* be in production). Insecure Publications are those that return more data than the user is authorized to see.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   **`autopublish`:** If present, the attacker simply connects to the application and receives all data.
    *   **Insecure Publications:**
        1.  Attacker inspects client-side code to identify Publications.
        2.  Attacker subscribes to the Publication.
        3.  The server sends data to the client, potentially including sensitive information that the user should not have access to.
*   **Example:** A Publication intended to return only the current user's profile data returns *all* user profiles.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Remove `autopublish`:** Ensure it's not included in production builds.
    *   **Secure Publications:** Design Publications to return *only* the data the current user (identified by `this.userId`) is authorized to see. Filter data based on user roles and permissions. Return only the necessary fields.
    *   **Test Publications Thoroughly:** Inspect the data received by the client to ensure no data leakage.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Attack Server-Side Infrastructure (Meteor Specific)](./attack_tree_paths/3__attack_server-side_infrastructure__meteor_specific_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** These attacks target Meteor's server-side infrastructure and communication protocols.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 DDP DoS (DDP Rate Limit) [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_ddp_dos__ddp_rate_limit___hr_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the server with DDP messages, overwhelming it and causing a denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Attacker creates a script or uses a tool to send a large number of DDP messages (method calls, subscriptions, etc.) to the Meteor server.
    2.  The server becomes overloaded, unable to process legitimate requests.
    3.  The application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
*   **Mitigation:** Configure Meteor's built-in DDP rate limiter to restrict the number of messages a client can send per unit of time. Tune the limits appropriately.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 Package Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_package_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** Meteor applications rely on third-party packages. Outdated or vulnerable packages can introduce security risks. This is a *critical node* because it represents a broad and constantly evolving attack surface.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    1.  Attacker identifies a known vulnerability in a Meteor package used by the application (e.g., through public vulnerability databases).
    2.  Attacker crafts an exploit specific to the vulnerability.
    3.  Attacker uses the exploit to gain unauthorized access, execute malicious code, or otherwise compromise the application.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep Packages Updated:** Regularly update all Meteor packages to the latest versions (`meteor update`).
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools like `npm audit` or `snyk` to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Careful Package Selection:** Choose well-maintained and reputable packages.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3 DoS via Method/Publication Overload](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_dos_via_methodpublication_overload.md)

*    **Description:** Similar to DDP DoS, but focuses on overwhelming specific, computationally expensive methods or publications.
*    **Attack Vector:**
        1. Attacker identifies a method or publication that performs complex operations (e.g., large database queries).
        2. Attacker repeatedly calls this method or subscribes/unsubscribes from the publication.
        3. Server resources are exhausted, leading to denial of service.
*    **Mitigation:**
        *   **Optimize Methods and Publications:** Improve the performance of resource-intensive operations.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Specific):** Implement rate limiting on specific methods and publications.
        *   **Caching:** Use caching to reduce server load.
