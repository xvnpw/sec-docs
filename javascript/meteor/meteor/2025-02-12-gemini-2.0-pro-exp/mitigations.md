# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for meteor/meteor

## Mitigation Strategy: [Remove `autopublish` and `insecure` and Implement Explicit Publications/Subscriptions](./mitigation_strategies/remove__autopublish__and__insecure__and_implement_explicit_publicationssubscriptions.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Removal:** Run `meteor remove autopublish` and `meteor remove insecure` in the project's root directory. This is the *critical first step* to disable Meteor's insecure defaults.
2.  **Publications (Server):** Create files (e.g., `server/publications.js`) to define publications using `Meteor.publish('publicationName', function() { ... })`.  Inside:
    *   Use `this.userId` for authorization checks.  Return `this.ready()` or throw a `Meteor.Error` if unauthorized.
    *   Use `MyCollection.find(selector, { fields: { ... } })` to query the database.
        *   `selector`:  *Which* documents (e.g., `{ owner: this.userId }`).
        *   `fields`:  *Which fields* (e.g., `{ title: 1, summary: 1 }`).  Be extremely selective.
3.  **Subscriptions (Client):** Use `Meteor.subscribe('publicationName', arguments)` in client-side components.
4.  **Data Access:** Access data with `MyCollection.find(...)` on the client. The client-side collection will only contain published data.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Data Exposure (Critical):** `autopublish` sends *all* data to *all* clients. This mitigates that completely.
*   **Unintentional Data Modification (Critical):** `insecure` allows *any* client to modify the database. This removes that capability.
*   **Information Disclosure (High):** Limits data sent to the client, reducing the attack surface.

**Impact:**
*   **Data Exposure:** Risk reduced from *critical* to *negligible* (if publications are correctly implemented).
*   **Unintentional Data Modification:** Risk reduced from *critical* to *negligible*.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `autopublish` and `insecure` are removed.
*   Publications for `Users` and `Posts` are in `server/publications.js`.
*   Subscriptions are used in `client/components/UserList.js` and `client/components/PostList.js`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Publication for `Comments` is missing (using insecure client-side `find()`).
*   Field restrictions are inconsistent. `Posts` publication sends `authorId` unnecessarily.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Input Validation and Rate Limiting for Meteor Methods](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_input_validation_and_rate_limiting_for_meteor_methods.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Input Validation (Server-Side):** *Within each Meteor Method*, use a validation library *before* any logic.
    *   **`check` (Meteor Package):** `check(argument, pattern)` for basic type checking.
    *   **`simpl-schema` (Recommended):** Define a `SimpleSchema` for each method's input. Use `schema.validate(data)`. Handle validation errors (e.g., `throw new Meteor.Error(...)`).
2.  **Rate Limiting (`ddp-rate-limiter` - Meteor Package):**
    *   Install: `meteor add ddp-rate-limiter`.
    *   Define Rules: `DDPRateLimiter.addRule(rule, limit, interval)`. Specify the method, call limit, and time interval.
3.  **Authorization Checks:** Use `this.userId` and a roles package (like `alanning:roles` - Meteor Package) to verify user permissions *within* the method.
4. **Deny all client-side database writes:** Use `Mongo.Collection.deny` to explicitly deny all client-side inserts, updates, and removes.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (Critical):** (Indirectly) Validation prevents malicious input used in commands/queries.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (High):** Rate limiting prevents method call floods.
*   **Data Tampering (High):** Input validation prevents malicious data modification.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High):** Authorization checks prevent unauthorized method execution.
*   **NoSQL Injection (High):** Validation and correct use of Meteor's API prevent injection.

**Impact:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **DoS:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Data Tampering:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **NoSQL Injection:** Risk reduced to negligible.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `simpl-schema` validation for `createPost` in `server/methods.js`.
*   Basic `check` validation for `updateUser`.
*   `ddp-rate-limiter` is installed.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   `simpl-schema` should be used consistently for *all* methods.
*   Rate limiting rules need to be defined and applied.
*   Authorization checks are missing from `deletePost` and others.
*   Deny rules are not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Meteor's Built-in Security Features and Packages](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_meteor's_built-in_security_features_and_packages.md)

**Description:**
1.  **`force-ssl` (Meteor Package):** Enforce HTTPS in production: `meteor add force-ssl`. This redirects all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
2.  **Session Management (Accounts Packages):** Leverage Meteor's `accounts-base` and related packages (e.g., `accounts-password`, `accounts-ui`) for secure user authentication and session management.  These packages handle session ID generation, storage, and (usually) regeneration on login. *Verify* that session IDs are regenerated and that cookies have the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags.
3. **`alanning:roles` (Meteor Package):** Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) using this package. Define roles and assign them to users. Use `Roles.userIsInRole(this.userId, 'roleName')` within Meteor Methods and publications to restrict access.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Session Hijacking (High):** `force-ssl` prevents interception of session cookies.
*   **Session Fixation (High):** Accounts packages (usually) handle session ID regeneration.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High):** `force-ssl` protects against MitM.
*   **Privilege Escalation (High):** `alanning:roles` enables fine-grained access control.

**Impact:**
*   **Session Hijacking:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Session Fixation:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **MitM Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Risk significantly reduced.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `force-ssl` is added and configured.
*   `accounts-password` and `accounts-ui` are used for user authentication.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Explicit verification of session ID regeneration and cookie flags.
*   `alanning:roles` is not implemented. Role-based access control is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prevent NoSQL Injection using Meteor API](./mitigation_strategies/prevent_nosql_injection_using_meteor_api.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Avoid String Concatenation:** Never build MongoDB queries by concatenating user input.
2.  **Parameterized Queries (Meteor's API):** Use Meteor's `find`, `update`, `insert`, and `remove` methods with object-based selectors. Pass user input as *values* within these objects, *not* as part of a string. This is how Meteor's API is *designed* to be used, and it inherently protects against injection if used correctly.
3. **Use Methods for all database operations:** Do not allow client to directly modify database.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**
*   **NoSQL Injection (High):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious MongoDB operators.

**Impact:**
*   **NoSQL Injection:** Risk reduced to negligible if Meteor's API is used correctly.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Meteor Methods are used for all database interactions.
*   Parameterized queries are used within Meteor Methods.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   None, assuming the existing parameterized queries are comprehensive and correctly implemented.  A code review is recommended to confirm this.
