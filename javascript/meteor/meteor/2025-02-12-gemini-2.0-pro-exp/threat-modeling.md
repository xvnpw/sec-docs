# Threat Model Analysis for meteor/meteor

## Threat: [Unrestricted Data Publication (Over-Publication)](./threats/unrestricted_data_publication__over-publication_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unrestricted Data Publication (Over-Publication)

    *   **Description:** An attacker inspects the client-side JavaScript code and network traffic (using browser developer tools) to identify published collections. They then subscribe to these collections, potentially receiving *all* data within them, even data intended only for administrators or other users. The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated or have any specific privileges. This leverages Meteor's default data synchronization behavior.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Breach:** Sensitive user data, internal system information, or proprietary data is exposed to unauthorized individuals.
        *   **Privacy Violation:** Users' personal information is compromised.
        *   **Reputational Damage:** Loss of trust in the application and organization.
        *   **Legal and Regulatory Consequences:** Potential fines and legal action due to data breaches.
    *   **Affected Meteor Component:** `Meteor.publish()` function and the publication/subscription mechanism. The core issue is the *lack* of proper restrictions within `Meteor.publish()`, a core Meteor feature.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Explicit Publications:** Always define `Meteor.publish()` functions with specific queries to limit the data returned.  Never rely on autopublish (remove it with `meteor remove autopublish`).
        *   **`this.userId` Checks:** Within publications, check `this.userId` to ensure the user is authenticated and authorized to receive the requested data.
        *   **Field Filtering:** Use the `fields` option in the publication's `find()` query to return only the necessary fields, not the entire document.  Example: `return MyCollection.find({ userId: this.userId }, { fields: { secretField: 0 } });`
        *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Use a package like `alanning:roles` to restrict publications based on user roles, integrated directly with Meteor's user system.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review all publication code to ensure data is properly restricted.
        *   **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to verify that publications only return the expected data for different user roles and scenarios. These tests should specifically target the Meteor publication system.

## Threat: [Insecure Meteor Method Execution](./threats/insecure_meteor_method_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Meteor Method Execution

    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies Meteor Methods exposed to the client (by inspecting the client-side code). They then call these methods directly, potentially with manipulated parameters, bypassing client-side validation and potentially performing unauthorized actions or modifying data directly on the server. This exploits Meteor's RPC mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can create, update, or delete data without proper authorization.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can gain higher privileges within the application, potentially leveraging Meteor's user accounts.
        *   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers could potentially gain control of the server.
    *   **Affected Meteor Component:** `Meteor.methods()` function and the method invocation mechanism. The vulnerability lies in insufficient server-side validation and authorization within the method definitions, a core part of Meteor's client-server communication.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **`this.userId` Validation:** Always check `this.userId` within methods to ensure the user is authenticated, using Meteor's built-in user management.
        *   **RBAC:** Use `alanning:roles` or a similar package to restrict method access based on user roles, integrating with Meteor's user and roles system.
        *   **Schema Validation:** Use a schema validation library (e.g., `simpl-schema`, `zod`) to validate *all* method parameters.  Never trust client-provided data. This is crucial for securing Meteor methods.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on methods to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks, specifically targeting the Meteor method call frequency.
        *   **Server-Side Validation:**  Always perform validation on the server, even if client-side validation is also present. This is essential because Meteor methods are executed on the server.
        *   **Audit Logging:** Log all method calls, including parameters and user information, specifically tracking Meteor method invocations.

## Threat: [Client-Side Code Exposure (Sensitive Logic)](./threats/client-side_code_exposure__sensitive_logic_.md)

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Code Exposure (Sensitive Logic)

    *   **Description:** An attacker examines the client-side JavaScript code (using browser developer tools) and finds sensitive logic, API keys, or configuration details that should only be present on the server. This can happen due to improper use of `isClient` and `isServer` checks or accidental inclusion of server-only code in files accessible to the client. This is a direct consequence of Meteor's isomorphic code structure.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **API Key Compromise:** Attackers can use exposed API keys to access third-party services.
        *   **Algorithm Exposure:**  Proprietary algorithms or business logic can be revealed.
        *   **Increased Attack Surface:**  Attackers gain a better understanding of the application.
    *   **Affected Meteor Component:** The isomorphic nature of Meteor (shared code between client and server) and the developer's responsibility to properly separate client and server code using Meteor's `isClient` and `isServer` flags.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Code Separation:**  Use the `isClient` and `isServer` flags diligently to ensure that server-only code is never executed on the client. This is fundamental to secure Meteor development.
        *   **Environment Variables:** Store sensitive information (API keys, secrets) in environment variables on the server and access them only from server-side code, leveraging Meteor's server-side environment.
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Carefully review code to ensure that sensitive logic is not exposed.
        *   **Build Process:** Use build tools to remove server-only code from the client bundle, optimizing for Meteor's build system.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Third-Party Packages (Specifically Meteor Packages)](./threats/vulnerable_third-party_packages__specifically_meteor_packages_.md)

* **Threat:** Vulnerable Third-Party Packages (Specifically Meteor Packages)

    *   **Description:** An attacker identifies outdated or vulnerable *Meteor* packages used by the application (using tools like `meteor list` or by examining the `versions` file). They then exploit known vulnerabilities in these *Meteor-specific* packages to gain access to the application or data. This is distinct from general npm package vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **System Compromise:** Attackers can gain control of the application or server.
        *   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data can be exposed.
        *   **Denial of Service:** The application can be made unavailable.
    *   **Affected Meteor Component:** Any *Meteor* package (`meteor add <package>`) used by the application. This is specific to the Meteor package ecosystem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Meteor and all *Meteor* packages up to date using `meteor update`. This is the primary defense against Meteor package vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** While `npm audit` is useful, focus on tools and advisories that specifically cover Meteor packages.
        *   **Package Selection:** Choose well-maintained *Meteor* packages from reputable sources within the Atmosphere package repository.
        *   **Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories specifically for Meteor and the *Meteor* packages used.
