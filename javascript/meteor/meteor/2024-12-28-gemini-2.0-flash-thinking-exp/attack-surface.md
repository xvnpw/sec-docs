Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Meteor, focusing on High and Critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface:** Unsecured DDP Subscriptions
    *   **Description:** Publications in Meteor expose data to clients based on subscriptions. If these publications don't properly filter data based on user roles or permissions, unauthorized users can access sensitive information.
    *   **How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor's publish/subscribe mechanism relies on developers implementing proper authorization logic within publication functions. Lack of this logic directly leads to this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A publication intended to show only a user's own profile data might inadvertently return all user profiles if the `userId` check is missing or flawed. An attacker could subscribe to this publication and gain access to other users' information.
    *   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential data exfiltration, violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks within publication functions using `this.userId` and role-based access control.
        *   Use database queries within publications to filter data based on user permissions.
        *   Thoroughly test publications with different user roles to ensure data isolation.
        *   Consider using packages like `alanning:roles` for managing user roles and permissions.

*   **Attack Surface:** Method Call Abuse
    *   **Description:** Meteor methods allow clients to execute server-side code. If these methods lack proper authorization checks or input validation, attackers can call them directly (e.g., via the browser console or crafted DDP messages) to perform unauthorized actions or manipulate data.
    *   **How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor's ease of defining and calling methods can lead to developers overlooking security considerations like authorization and input sanitization.
    *   **Example:** A method to delete a user account might not check if the currently logged-in user is an administrator or the owner of the account being deleted. An attacker could call this method with another user's ID and delete their account.
    *   **Impact:** Data integrity compromise, unauthorized data modification or deletion, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict authorization checks at the beginning of each method using `this.userId` and role-based access control.
        *   Validate and sanitize all input parameters passed to methods to prevent injection attacks.
        *   Use rate limiting on methods to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attempts.
        *   Avoid exposing sensitive business logic directly through client-callable methods; consider using server-side only functions.

*   **Attack Surface:** Vulnerable Atmosphere Packages
    *   **Description:** Meteor applications rely on packages from Atmosphere. Using outdated or vulnerable packages can introduce security flaws into the application.
    *   **How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor's package management system, while convenient, relies on the security of third-party contributions.
    *   **Example:** A popular UI component package might have a known Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. If an application uses this vulnerable version, attackers can inject malicious scripts into the application through this component.
    *   **Impact:** Various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including XSS, Remote Code Execution (RCE), and information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update all Atmosphere packages to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Carefully vet and audit the packages used in the application, considering their maintainership and security history.
        *   Use tools like `npm audit` (if using npm for frontend dependencies) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Consider using specific versions of packages and locking them down to avoid unexpected updates that might introduce vulnerabilities.

*   **Attack Surface:** Client-Side Code Injection via Insecure Template Helpers
    *   **Description:** If template helpers in Meteor are not properly sanitized, they can be exploited for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor's templating system allows developers to embed dynamic data into HTML. If this data is not escaped, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Example:** A template helper that displays user-provided text without proper escaping could allow an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in other users' browsers.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize user-provided data before displaying it in templates. Meteor's default templating engine often provides automatic escaping, but be mindful of cases where you might be rendering raw HTML.
        *   Use secure coding practices when writing template helpers, avoiding direct manipulation of the DOM with potentially unsafe data.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
