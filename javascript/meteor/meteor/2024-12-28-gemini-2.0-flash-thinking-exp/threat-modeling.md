*   **Threat:** Unauthenticated Access to Data Streams
    *   **Description:** An attacker could subscribe to DDP publications without proper authentication or authorization checks. They might use a custom DDP client or the browser's developer tools to establish a connection and listen to data being published by the Meteor server. This bypasses intended access controls.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data managed by the Meteor application, potentially leading to information leakage, privacy violations, or misuse of data.
    *   **Affected Component:** Publication functions (`Meteor.publish`), DDP protocol.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust authorization checks within `Meteor.publish` functions using `this.userId` and role-based access control. Avoid publishing sensitive data without proper authentication.

*   **Threat:** Data Injection via DDP
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious DDP messages to insert or update data in the MongoDB database directly, bypassing server-side validation and business logic implemented in `Meteor.methods`. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in publication logic that inadvertently allows direct database modifications or manipulating DDP messages intended for methods.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized modification of data, potential for further exploitation through injected malicious data, and bypassing intended application logic.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.methods`, Publication functions (if allowing direct writes), DDP protocol, MongoDB integration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs within `Meteor.methods`. Avoid direct database writes from publications. Implement schema validation (e.g., using `SimpleSchema` or `check`) on both client and server. Secure method definitions with proper authorization.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via DDP Overload
    *   **Description:** An attacker could open a large number of DDP connections or send a high volume of DDP messages to the Meteor server, overwhelming its resources (CPU, memory, network) and causing it to become unresponsive or crash. This exploits the real-time nature of DDP to flood the server.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, impacting legitimate users and potentially causing financial or reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** DDP protocol, Meteor server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement rate limiting on DDP connections and message frequency. Monitor server resource usage and implement safeguards against excessive connection attempts. Consider using techniques like pagination and limiting the amount of data sent in publications. Implement connection limits per IP address.

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure through Insecure Publication Logic
    *   **Description:** Poorly designed publication logic in `Meteor.publish` might inadvertently expose sensitive data that should not be accessible to certain users. This could occur through overly broad database queries or lack of proper filtering based on user roles or permissions within the publication function itself.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information managed by the Meteor application, potentially leading to privacy breaches, identity theft, or other security incidents.
    *   **Affected Component:** Publication functions (`Meteor.publish`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully design publication logic to only return the necessary data for each user based on their roles and permissions. Avoid publishing entire collections without specific filtering. Utilize database-level access controls in conjunction with publication logic.

*   **Threat:** DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS) through Client-Side Rendering
    *   **Description:** If client-side templates (using Blaze or Spacebars) or JavaScript code improperly handle user-provided data that is then rendered in the DOM, an attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser. This exploits Meteor's reactive rendering where user input can directly influence the DOM.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the application interface.
    *   **Affected Component:** Blaze templates, Spacebars, client-side JavaScript code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Sanitize user input before rendering it in templates. Use Meteor's built-in helpers and template features to prevent XSS (e.g., using triple curly braces `{{{ ... }}}` with caution or using safer alternatives). Be cautious when using third-party libraries that manipulate the DOM.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks through Malicious Packages
    *   **Description:** Using community packages from Atmosphere or npm introduces the risk of including malicious code or vulnerabilities from compromised or intentionally malicious packages. This malicious code can be executed within the Meteor application's context, potentially compromising the server or client.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of the Meteor application and potentially the server it runs on, data breaches, and reputational damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Meteor's package management system, `package.js`, `package-lock.json`, `node_modules`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully vet and audit the packages used in your application. Check package maintainers, popularity, and recent activity. Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Consider using a private package registry for internal components. Regularly review and update dependencies.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information during Build
    *   **Description:** If environment variables or configuration files containing sensitive information (like API keys, database credentials, or secrets used by Meteor packages) are inadvertently included in the client-side bundle during the Meteor build process, attackers could potentially extract this information by inspecting the client-side JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, potentially leading to unauthorized access to external services, the application's database, or other critical resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** Meteor's build process, client-side bundle.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Carefully manage environment variables and configuration. Avoid including sensitive information directly in client-side code. Use server-side methods or environment variables accessed on the server to handle sensitive data. Utilize `.env` files and ensure they are not included in the client bundle.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Method Definitions and Authorization
    *   **Description:** If `Meteor.methods` are not properly secured with authorization checks, unauthorized users could call them from the client-side and perform actions they shouldn't be allowed to. This bypasses intended access controls and can lead to data manipulation or privilege escalation within the Meteor application.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of the application's integrity.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.methods`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement robust authorization logic within method definitions, checking user roles and permissions using `Meteor.userId()` and database lookups. Ensure all sensitive actions are protected by authorization checks.

*   **Threat:** Parameter Tampering in Method Calls
    *   **Description:** Attackers could manipulate the parameters sent to server-side `Meteor.methods` from the client-side to bypass security checks or perform unintended actions. This involves modifying the data sent in the DDP message when calling a method.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security checks, data manipulation, potential for further exploitation by sending unexpected or malicious data to server-side logic.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.methods`, DDP protocol.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all parameters passed to server-side methods. Use schema validation libraries like `SimpleSchema` or `check` to enforce data integrity on method arguments.

*   **Threat:** NoSQL Injection in Server-Side Methods
    *   **Description:** If server-side `Meteor.methods` directly use user-provided data in MongoDB queries without proper sanitization or using insecure query construction techniques, attackers could inject malicious NoSQL queries to extract, modify, or delete data from the database. This exploits Meteor's tight integration with MongoDB.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, potential for denial of service by crafting queries that consume excessive resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.methods`, MongoDB integration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Use parameterized queries or ORM features (though less common in direct Meteor with MongoDB). Sanitize user input before using it in database queries. Avoid constructing queries using string concatenation with user input. Use MongoDB's built-in sanitization features where applicable.
