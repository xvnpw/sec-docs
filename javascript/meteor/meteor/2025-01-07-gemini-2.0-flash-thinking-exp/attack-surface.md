# Attack Surface Analysis for meteor/meteor

## Attack Surface: [Insecure DDP Method Calls](./attack_surfaces/insecure_ddp_method_calls.md)

**Description:** Server-side methods exposed via DDP without proper authorization or input validation allow malicious clients to execute arbitrary server-side code or manipulate data.

**How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor's ease of defining and exposing methods can lead to developers overlooking security best practices. The automatic DDP exposure makes these methods directly accessible.

**Example:** A `removePost` method that doesn't verify the user's ownership of the post. An attacker could call this method with any post ID to delete arbitrary posts.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized actions, server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authorization checks within method calls using `this.userId` and database queries.
* Validate all input parameters using packages like `check` to prevent unexpected data types or values.
* Follow the principle of least privilege â€“ only expose necessary methods.
* Consider using Meteor's built-in security features and best practices for method design.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure DDP Publications](./attack_surfaces/insecure_ddp_publications.md)

**Description:** Publishing sensitive data without proper filtering or authorization allows unauthorized clients to access information they shouldn't.

**How Meteor Contributes:** The ease of defining publications can lead to over-publishing data. The reactive nature of subscriptions means clients automatically receive updates, increasing the risk of exposure.

**Example:** A publication that sends all user profile information to every logged-in user, including email addresses and private details.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, privacy violations, potential for social engineering attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement fine-grained data filtering in publications using `this.userId` and database queries to only send relevant data to authorized users.
* Avoid publishing sensitive fields unless absolutely necessary.
* Consider using reactive joins with caution and ensure proper authorization at each level.
* Test publications thoroughly to ensure they only return the intended data.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (NPM Packages)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__npm_packages_.md)

**Description:** Using outdated or vulnerable NPM packages in the Meteor application introduces security risks from those dependencies.

**How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor relies heavily on the NPM ecosystem for packages. The more dependencies, the larger the attack surface.

**Example:** Using an outdated version of a popular image processing library with a known remote code execution vulnerability.

**Impact:**  Remote code execution, denial of service, data breaches, depending on the vulnerability in the package.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update all NPM packages to their latest stable versions.
* Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
* Consider using a dependency management tool that can automatically update packages and alert to vulnerabilities.
* Be mindful of the packages you include and only use those that are necessary and well-maintained.

## Attack Surface: [Hot Code Reloading in Production (Misconfiguration)](./attack_surfaces/hot_code_reloading_in_production__misconfiguration_.md)

**Description:** Leaving hot code reloading enabled in production environments can introduce security risks by allowing potential code injection or unexpected behavior.

**How Meteor Contributes:** Hot code reload is a core development feature of Meteor that watches for file changes and automatically updates the application. It's not intended for production.

**Example:** An attacker gaining access to the server and modifying files, which would then be automatically loaded into the running application.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, application instability, potential for data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never enable hot code reloading in production environments.**
* Ensure your deployment process disables hot code reloading.
