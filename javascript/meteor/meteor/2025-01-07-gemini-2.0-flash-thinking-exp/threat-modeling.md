# Threat Model Analysis for meteor/meteor

## Threat: [DDP Message Forgery](./threats/ddp_message_forgery.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious DDP messages and sends them to the server. This could involve subscribing to unauthorized data by manipulating the subscription name or parameters, or calling methods with forged arguments to bypass server-side validation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, manipulation of server-side state, potentially triggering unintended actions or errors.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.publish`, `Meteor.methods`, DDP protocol handling on the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks within `Meteor.publish` functions to verify user permissions before sending data.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input parameters within `Meteor.methods`.
        *   Consider using a schema validation library (e.g., `joi`, `simpl-schema`) on both client and server for DDP messages.
        *   Use HTTPS to encrypt DDP communication and prevent message interception.

## Threat: [DDP Subscription Hijacking](./threats/ddp_subscription_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the DDP connection (if not secured with HTTPS) and takes over an existing subscription, potentially gaining access to real-time data streams intended for another user.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive user data, potential for impersonation or manipulation based on the intercepted data.
    *   **Affected Component:** DDP connection, `Meteor.subscribe`, session management.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory HTTPS:** Enforce HTTPS for all DDP connections to encrypt communication and prevent interception.
        *   Implement secure session management practices to minimize the risk of session hijacking.

## Threat: [Insecure Method Implementations](./threats/insecure_method_implementations.md)

*   **Description:** `Meteor.methods` are the primary way clients interact with the server. Improperly secured methods can introduce vulnerabilities due to lack of authorization checks or inadequate input validation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data modification, access to sensitive information, potential for server-side errors or crashes.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.methods`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks within each `Meteor.method` to ensure only authorized users can execute them.
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input parameters passed to `Meteor.methods` to prevent injection attacks and unexpected behavior.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting method access.

## Threat: [MongoDB Injection through Methods](./threats/mongodb_injection_through_methods.md)

*   **Description:** If method parameters are directly used in MongoDB queries without proper sanitization, attackers can craft malicious input that modifies the intended query, potentially leading to unauthorized data access or manipulation.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification or deletion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.methods`, MongoDB integration (within `meteor/meteor`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never directly embed user input into raw MongoDB queries.**
        *   Use MongoDB's query operators and methods (e.g., `$eq`, `$in`) to construct queries safely.
        *   Utilize schema validation libraries (e.g., `joi`, `simpl-schema`) to enforce data types and formats before constructing queries.

## Threat: [Weaknesses in Built-in Accounts System](./threats/weaknesses_in_built-in_accounts_system.md)

*   **Description:** If the built-in Meteor accounts system is not configured securely, it can be vulnerable to attacks like brute-force password guessing or account enumeration.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.users`, `Accounts` package (part of the Meteor core).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strong password policies.
        *   Implement rate limiting on login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.
        *   Consider implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA).
        *   Regularly review and update the `accounts-password` package.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through DDP Subscriptions](./threats/information_disclosure_through_ddp_subscriptions.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly configured `Meteor.publish` functions might expose more data than intended to clients who subscribe to them. This can happen if the publish function doesn't adequately filter data based on user permissions.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data to unauthorized users.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.publish`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement fine-grained authorization checks within `Meteor.publish` functions to ensure users only receive data they are authorized to access.
        *   Carefully consider the data being published and whether it needs to be restricted based on user roles or permissions.
        *   Avoid publishing entire collections without proper filtering.
