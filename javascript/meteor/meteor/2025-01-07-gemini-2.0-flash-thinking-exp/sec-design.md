## Project Design Document: Meteor Framework

**1. Introduction**

This document provides a high-level architectural overview of the Meteor framework, intended to serve as a basis for subsequent threat modeling activities. It outlines the key components, their interactions, and the data flows within a typical Meteor application deployment.

**2. Project Overview**

Meteor is an open-source, full-stack JavaScript framework for developing web, mobile, and desktop applications. It emphasizes rapid prototyping and development by providing a cohesive set of tools and libraries. Key features include:

*   Real-time data synchronization between client and server.
*   A single language (JavaScript) used for both front-end and back-end development.
*   Reactive programming model.
*   A rich ecosystem of packages.

**3. Architectural Overview**

The Meteor architecture can be broadly divided into the following key components:

*   **Client:** The user interface running in a web browser or a mobile application (using frameworks like Cordova or React Native).
*   **Server:** The Node.js process responsible for serving the application, managing data, and handling business logic.
*   **Database:** MongoDB, the default database for Meteor applications.
*   **Publish/Subscribe System:** Meteor's mechanism for real-time data synchronization between the server and clients.
*   **Method Calls:** A remote procedure call (RPC) mechanism for clients to invoke server-side functions.
*   **Build System:**  Responsible for bundling and packaging the application for deployment.
*   **Package Management (Atmosphere):** A repository of community-contributed packages that extend Meteor's functionality.

**4. Component Details**

*   **Client (Web Browser/Mobile App):**
    *   Runs JavaScript code responsible for rendering the user interface and handling user interactions.
    *   Utilizes libraries like Blaze (the original templating engine), React, or Vue.js for UI development.
    *   Connects to the Meteor server via WebSocket or SockJS for real-time communication.
    *   Manages a local data cache (Minimongo) that mirrors a subset of the server-side database.
    *   Sends method calls to the server to perform actions that modify data or trigger server-side logic.
    *   Subscribes to specific data sets published by the server.

*   **Server (Node.js):**
    *   Runs on a Node.js environment.
    *   Hosts the application's server-side JavaScript code.
    *   Connects to the MongoDB database.
    *   Defines publications, which specify the data that clients can subscribe to.
    *   Implements methods, which are functions that can be called remotely by clients.
    *   Handles authentication and authorization.
    *   Manages user sessions.
    *   Can integrate with other services and APIs.

*   **Database (MongoDB):**
    *   A NoSQL document database that stores the application's data.
    *   Accessed by the Meteor server.
    *   Data is typically structured as collections of JSON-like documents.

*   **Publish/Subscribe System:**
    *   Enables the server to selectively push data updates to connected clients in real-time.
    *   Clients subscribe to named publications, which define the criteria for the data they want to receive.
    *   The server monitors database changes and sends relevant updates to subscribed clients.

*   **Method Calls:**
    *   A mechanism for clients to execute server-side functions.
    *   Clients call methods by name, passing arguments.
    *   The server executes the corresponding method and returns a result (or an error).
    *   Methods are typically used for actions that require server-side logic or data manipulation.

*   **Build System:**
    *   Takes the application's source code and assets and bundles them into a deployable package.
    *   Handles tasks like code minification, bundling of JavaScript and CSS, and asset management.

*   **Package Management (Atmosphere):**
    *   A central repository for Meteor packages.
    *   Packages can provide additional functionality, such as user authentication, file uploads, and integrations with third-party services.
    *   Managed using the `meteor add` command.

```

**6. Key Interactions and Processes**

*   **User Interaction:** A user interacts with the client application, triggering events.
*   **Data Subscription:** The client subscribes to relevant data publications from the server.
*   **Real-time Data Synchronization:** The server pushes data updates to subscribed clients whenever the underlying data changes in the database.
*   **Method Invocation:** The client calls a server-side method to perform an action.
*   **Server-Side Processing:** The server executes the method, potentially interacting with the database or other services.
*   **Method Response:** The server sends a response (success or error) back to the client.
*   **Data Modification:** Server-side methods can modify data in the MongoDB database.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Users are authenticated (e.g., using passwords, OAuth) and authorized to access specific data and functionalities.

**7. Deployment Considerations**

*   Meteor applications can be deployed to various platforms, including cloud providers (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) and self-hosted servers.
*   Deployment typically involves bundling the application and running the Node.js server.
*   Considerations for scalability, load balancing, and database management are important for production deployments.

**8. Technology Stack**

*   **Programming Language:** JavaScript
*   **Server-side Runtime:** Node.js
*   **Database:** MongoDB
*   **Client-side Libraries:** Blaze, React, Vue.js (optional)
*   **Communication Protocol:** WebSocket, SockJS
*   **Package Manager:** Atmosphere

**9. Security Considerations (High-Level)**

This section provides a preliminary overview of security considerations. A more detailed threat model will build upon this foundation.

*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Securely managing user identities and access permissions is crucial.
*   **Data Validation and Sanitization:** Input from clients should be validated and sanitized on the server to prevent injection attacks.
*   **Secure Communication:**  Using HTTPS for all communication between clients and the server is essential.
*   **Database Security:**  Securing the MongoDB database, including access control and encryption, is important.
*   **Dependency Management:**  Keeping dependencies up-to-date to address known vulnerabilities.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protecting against abuse by limiting the rate of requests.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Preventing the injection of malicious scripts into the client-side application.
*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** Protecting against unauthorized actions performed on behalf of authenticated users.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Implementing measures to mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

**10. Future Considerations**

*   Exploring alternative database options.
*   Adopting newer JavaScript features and frameworks.
*   Enhancing scalability and performance.

This document provides a foundational understanding of the Meteor framework's architecture. The details presented here will be crucial for identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities during the subsequent threat modeling process.
