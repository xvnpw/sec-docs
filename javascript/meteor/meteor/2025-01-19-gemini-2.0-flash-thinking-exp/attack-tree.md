## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (OR) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__or___high-risk_path_.md)

This represents the broad category of attacks targeting the client-side JavaScript code and browser environment. It's a high-risk path because the client-side is directly exposed to the attacker and often handles sensitive data or logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Client-Side Logic (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_client-side_logic__and___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can use browser developer tools or proxy software to intercept and modify DDP messages exchanged between the client and server. This allows them to bypass client-side validation, manipulate application state in unintended ways, potentially triggering server-side vulnerabilities or accessing data they shouldn't.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Third-Party Client-Side Packages (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_third-party_client-side_packages__and___high-risk_path_.md)

Meteor applications heavily rely on community packages. Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in these packages to execute malicious code on the client-side, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Used Packages](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_used_packages.md)

Attackers scan for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in the specific versions of client-side packages used by the application and utilize existing exploits to compromise the client.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities (OR) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities__or___high-risk_path_.md)

This encompasses attacks targeting the server-side code, data, and infrastructure. It's a high-risk path because successful server-side exploitation can lead to significant data breaches, complete application compromise, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Insecure Publications (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_insecure_publications__and___high-risk_path_.md)

Publications control the data sent from the server to the client. If not properly secured, attackers can gain unauthorized access to data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Data Without Proper Authorization](./attack_tree_paths/access_data_without_proper_authorization.md)

Attackers can subscribe to publications they shouldn't have access to or craft queries that bypass intended filters, leading to the exposure of sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Insecure Methods (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_insecure_methods__and___high-risk_path_.md)

Methods are server-side functions called by the client. Vulnerabilities here can allow attackers to perform actions they are not authorized for or manipulate data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Tampering/Injection](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_tamperinginjection.md)

Attackers send malicious or unexpected data in the arguments of method calls. If the server-side code doesn't properly validate and sanitize these inputs, it can lead to data manipulation, code injection, or other unintended consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Accounts System (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_accounts_system__and___high-risk_path_.md)

The accounts system manages user authentication and authorization. Exploiting vulnerabilities here can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__brute-forcecredential_stuffing_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers attempt to guess user credentials by trying numerous combinations of usernames and passwords (brute-force) or by using lists of previously compromised credentials (credential stuffing). Successful attacks grant unauthorized access to user accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Third-Party Server-Side Packages (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_third-party_server-side_packages__and___high-risk_path_.md)

Similar to client-side packages, vulnerabilities in server-side packages can be exploited to gain control of the server, access sensitive data, or disrupt application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Used Packages](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_used_packages.md)

Attackers identify publicly known vulnerabilities in the server-side packages used by the application and exploit them to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Server-Side Code (AND)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_server-side_code__and_.md)

This refers to general programming errors or logic flaws in the server-side code that can be exploited to bypass security measures, access unauthorized data, or manipulate application state.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Build Process/Deployment Weaknesses (OR) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_build_processdeployment_weaknesses__or___high-risk_path_.md)

This category involves attacks that target the processes used to build and deploy the application, potentially compromising the application before it even reaches production.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Insecure Deployment Practices (AND) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_insecure_deployment_practices__and___high-risk_path_.md)

This focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by how the application is deployed and configured on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Configuration Data](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_configuration_data.md)

Attackers can find and exploit publicly accessible configuration files or environment variables that contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or other secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use Insecure Server Configurations](./attack_tree_paths/use_insecure_server_configurations.md)

Using default or poorly configured server settings can leave the application vulnerable to various attacks, such as unauthorized access, remote code execution, or information disclosure.
