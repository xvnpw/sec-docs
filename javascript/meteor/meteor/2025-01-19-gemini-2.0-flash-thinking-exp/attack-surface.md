# Attack Surface Analysis for meteor/meteor

## Attack Surface: [DDP Message Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/ddp_message_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers can craft and send malicious DDP messages to the server, potentially bypassing security checks or triggering unintended actions.
*   **How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor's real-time data synchronization relies heavily on the DDP protocol. If server-side validation of incoming DDP messages is insufficient, the framework's core communication mechanism becomes a vulnerability.
*   **Example:** An attacker could send a DDP `method` call with manipulated arguments to bypass authorization checks and update data they shouldn't have access to. For instance, modifying the `userId` in an update profile method call.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust server-side validation for all incoming DDP messages, especially method calls and subscription parameters.
        *   Never rely solely on client-side validation for security.
        *   Use Meteor's built-in security features like `allow` and `deny` rules on collections, but understand their limitations and potential for bypass if not carefully configured.
        *   Sanitize and validate all user inputs before processing them on the server.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Meteor Methods](./attack_surfaces/insecure_meteor_methods.md)

**Description:** Meteor Methods are server-side functions called from the client. If these methods are not properly secured, they can be exploited to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor's architecture encourages the use of Methods for client-server interaction. The ease of defining and calling Methods can lead to vulnerabilities if security is not a primary concern during development.
*   **Example:** A method designed to update a user's profile might not properly validate the `userId` argument, allowing an attacker to update another user's profile by calling the method with a different `userId`.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, execution of arbitrary server-side code (if methods are poorly written).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong authorization checks within each Method to ensure the calling user has the necessary permissions.
        *   Validate and sanitize all input parameters passed to Methods.
        *   Avoid directly exposing database operations in Methods without proper authorization and input validation.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when designing Methods.

## Attack Surface: [Information Disclosure via Insecure Publications](./attack_surfaces/information_disclosure_via_insecure_publications.md)

**Description:** Meteor Publications control what data is sent from the server to the client. If publications are not properly secured, they can leak sensitive information to unauthorized users.
*   **How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor's publish/subscribe mechanism is a core feature. Incorrectly configured publications can inadvertently expose data that should be restricted.
*   **Example:** A publication intended to show a user their own profile information might inadvertently include sensitive fields like social security numbers or financial details if the publication logic is not carefully crafted.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations, exposure of sensitive business information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Carefully design publications to only return the necessary data for the intended users.
        *   Implement robust authorization checks within publications to ensure only authorized users receive specific data.
        *   Use reactive data sources within publications to dynamically filter data based on user roles or permissions.

## Attack Surface: [NoSQL Injection (MongoDB Integration)](./attack_surfaces/nosql_injection__mongodb_integration_.md)

**Description:** When user input is directly incorporated into MongoDB queries without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious NoSQL queries to bypass security checks or access unauthorized data.
*   **How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor's default integration with MongoDB makes NoSQL injection a relevant attack vector if developers are not careful with database interactions within Methods and Publications.
*   **Example:** A search functionality might directly use user-provided search terms in a MongoDB query. An attacker could inject a malicious query like `{$ne: null}` to bypass the intended search criteria and retrieve all data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data access, data manipulation, potential denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Avoid directly embedding user input into MongoDB queries.
        *   Use parameterized queries or MongoDB's query operators to safely construct queries.
        *   Sanitize and validate all user input before using it in database queries.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Password Reset Mechanisms](./attack_surfaces/insecure_password_reset_mechanisms.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the password reset process can allow attackers to gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
*   **How Meteor Contributes:** Meteor provides a built-in accounts system, and vulnerabilities in its default password reset flow or in custom implementations can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A password reset link might not expire after a single use, allowing an attacker to use a previously sent link to reset a user's password.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data breaches, unauthorized access to user information.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use secure and well-tested password reset mechanisms.
        *   Ensure password reset links are time-limited and can only be used once.
        *   Implement strong account recovery options.
        *   Rate-limit password reset requests to prevent brute-force attacks.
