### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Insecure Server-Side Code

The "Exploit Insecure Server-Side Code" attack path represents a broad category of vulnerabilities stemming from flaws in the server-side implementation of the Meteor application. The "(AND)" in the attack tree path signifies that multiple types of insecure server-side code vulnerabilities can exist and potentially be exploited in combination.

Here's a breakdown of common vulnerabilities within this path:

**4.1 Input Validation Issues:**

* **Description:** Failure to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied data before processing it on the server. This can lead to various injection attacks.
* **Impact:**
    * **NoSQL Injection:**  Malicious code injected into database queries, potentially allowing attackers to bypass authentication, access sensitive data, modify data, or even drop collections.
    * **Command Injection:**  Execution of arbitrary commands on the server operating system.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Server-Side Rendering:** While primarily a client-side issue, if server-side rendering is used and input is not properly escaped, it can lead to XSS.
    * **Path Traversal:**  Accessing files and directories outside the intended application scope.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Submitting large or malformed input that consumes excessive server resources.
* **Meteor-Specific Considerations:**
    * **Meteor Methods:**  Parameters passed to Meteor Methods are prime targets for malicious input.
    * **Publications:**  If publication logic relies on unsanitized input, it could lead to unauthorized data access.
    * **Database Interactions:**  Directly constructing MongoDB queries with user input without proper sanitization is a major risk.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust validation rules on all user inputs, checking data types, formats, lengths, and allowed characters.
    * **Data Sanitization/Escaping:** Sanitize or escape user input before using it in database queries, system commands, or when rendering output. Use libraries specifically designed for this purpose.
    * **Parameterization/Prepared Statements:** Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with the database to prevent NoSQL injection. Meteor's built-in MongoDB driver helps with this, but developers need to be mindful of how they construct queries.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure database users and application processes have only the necessary permissions.

**4.2 Authentication and Authorization Flaws:**

* **Description:** Weaknesses in how the application verifies user identity (authentication) and controls access to resources (authorization).
* **Impact:**
    * **Bypassing Authentication:**  Gaining access to the application without proper credentials.
    * **Privilege Escalation:**  Gaining access to resources or functionalities that the user is not authorized to access.
    * **Data Breaches:**  Accessing sensitive data belonging to other users or the application itself.
    * **Account Takeover:**  Gaining control of another user's account.
* **Meteor-Specific Considerations:**
    * **Insecure Password Storage:**  Storing passwords in plain text or using weak hashing algorithms.
    * **Session Management Issues:**  Vulnerabilities in how user sessions are created, maintained, and invalidated.
    * **Insecure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Flaws in the implementation of RBAC logic, allowing unauthorized access.
    * **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Publications:**  Publishing data that should be restricted to certain users or roles.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Strong Password Hashing:** Use robust and well-vetted password hashing algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
    * **Secure Session Management:** Implement secure session management practices, including using secure cookies, HTTP-only flags, and proper session invalidation.
    * **Robust Authorization Logic:** Implement clear and well-defined authorization rules and enforce them consistently throughout the application. Utilize Meteor's built-in `check` package for validating method arguments and consider using packages for more complex authorization scenarios.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege (Authorization):** Grant users only the necessary permissions to perform their tasks.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Review authentication and authorization logic for potential flaws.

**4.3 Insecure Data Handling:**

* **Description:**  Improper handling of sensitive data, leading to its exposure or compromise.
* **Impact:**
