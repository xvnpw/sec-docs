# Threat Model Analysis for meteor/meteor

## Threat: [Insecure Data Exposure via Publications](./threats/insecure_data_exposure_via_publications.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could subscribe to a Meteor publication that is not properly secured with authorization checks. This allows them to access data intended only for specific users or roles. They might enumerate subscriptions or manipulate parameters to gain access to a wider dataset than intended.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential data breach, violation of privacy regulations.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.publish` function, DDP protocol.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization logic within `Meteor.publish` functions using `this.userId` and database queries to filter data based on user permissions.
        *   Avoid publishing entire collections without specific filtering.
        *   Thoroughly test publication logic to ensure only authorized data is exposed.

## Threat: [Malicious Method Argument Injection](./threats/malicious_method_argument_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could call a Meteor method with crafted or malicious arguments that are not properly validated on the server-side. This could lead to unintended actions, data manipulation, or even server-side errors. For example, they might inject unexpected data types or values to bypass validation or trigger vulnerabilities in the method's logic.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption, privilege escalation, denial of service, potential remote code execution depending on the method's functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.methods` function, method argument handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate all method arguments on the server-side using type checking, regular expressions, and other validation techniques.
        *   Sanitize input data to remove potentially harmful characters or code.
        *   Implement input validation libraries or frameworks.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation via Unprotected Methods](./threats/privilege_escalation_via_unprotected_methods.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could call a Meteor method that lacks proper authorization checks. This allows them to perform actions they are not intended to, potentially gaining administrative privileges or modifying sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data modification, potential full control over the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Meteor.methods` function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always implement authorization logic within Meteor methods to ensure only authorized users can execute them.
        *   Use `this.userId` to identify the current user and implement role-based access control.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when defining method access.

## Threat: [Account Compromise via Accounts System Vulnerability](./threats/account_compromise_via_accounts_system_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability in Meteor's built-in accounts system or related packages to gain unauthorized access to user accounts. This could involve exploiting flaws in password reset mechanisms, session management, or other authentication-related features.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data, potential impersonation.
    *   **Affected Component:** `meteor/accounts-*` packages.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Meteor and all related packages updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Review and configure the accounts system settings carefully, including password policies and rate limiting for login attempts.
        *   Consider using third-party authentication providers for enhanced security.

## Threat: [Account Takeover via Insecure Password Reset](./threats/account_takeover_via_insecure_password_reset.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit weaknesses in the password reset functionality provided by Meteor's accounts system to gain access to a user's account. This might involve predictable reset tokens, lack of email verification, or vulnerabilities in the reset process itself.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, unauthorized access to user data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Accounts.forgotPassword`, `Accounts.resetPassword`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure password reset tokens are generated securely and are unpredictable.
        *   Implement email verification to confirm the user's identity before allowing a password reset.
        *   Set expiration times for password reset tokens.
        *   Prevent brute-force attacks on the password reset endpoint.

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Hot Code Push](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_hot_code_push.md)

*   **Description:** If an attacker gains unauthorized access to the deployment process, they could potentially push malicious code updates to the application using Meteor's hot code push feature.
    *   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, serving malicious content to users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Meteor's hot code push mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the deployment pipeline and restrict access to the deployment process.
        *   Implement code review and testing procedures for all code changes, including hot code pushes.
        *   Use secure authentication and authorization for deployment processes.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection](./threats/server-side_template_injection.md)

*   **Description:** If the application uses server-side rendering and incorporates user-provided data directly into templates without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious code that is executed on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, full compromise of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Server-side rendering, templating engine (when used with user input unsafely).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly embedding user input into server-side templates.
        *   Use parameterized queries or template engines with built-in escaping mechanisms.
