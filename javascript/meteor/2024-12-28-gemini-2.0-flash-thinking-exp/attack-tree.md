## Focused Threat Model: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes in a Meteor Application

**Objective:** Attacker's Goal: To compromise a Meteor application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Meteor framework itself.

**Sub-Tree: High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**1. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (AND) -> [CRITICAL NODE] Exfiltrate Sensitive Client-Side Data:**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in client-side JavaScript code or browser storage mechanisms to steal sensitive information residing in the client-side application state or local storage.
* **Description:**
    * **Accessing Local Storage/Session Storage:** Exploiting vulnerabilities or lack of proper security measures to access data stored in the browser's local or session storage.
    * **Man-in-the-Browser Attacks:** Using browser extensions or malware to intercept and exfiltrate data processed by the client-side application.
    * **Exploiting Debugging Information:** Leaking sensitive data through improperly configured debugging tools or error messages exposed to the client.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Avoid storing highly sensitive data on the client-side if possible.
    * Encrypt sensitive data stored in local or session storage.
    * Implement measures to detect and prevent Man-in-the-Browser attacks.
    * Ensure debugging tools are disabled in production environments.

**2. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities (AND) -> [CRITICAL NODE] Gain Unauthorized Data Access:**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers bypass authorization checks to access data they are not permitted to see, often exploiting vulnerabilities in Meteor's publish/subscribe mechanism or method implementations.
* **Description:**
    * **Insecure Publish Rules:** Exploiting overly permissive or poorly written publish rules that expose more data than intended.
    * **Bypassing Method Authorization:** Manipulating method calls or parameters to bypass authorization checks and access restricted data.
    * **Direct MongoDB Access Vulnerabilities (Less Common with Meteor's Abstraction):** While Meteor abstracts MongoDB access, vulnerabilities in custom server-side code interacting directly with the database could be exploited.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict and well-defined publish rules, only publishing the necessary data to specific users or roles.
    * Enforce robust authorization checks within Meteor methods, verifying user permissions before accessing or modifying data.
    * Avoid direct, unvalidated database queries on the server-side if possible. Utilize Meteor's data layer abstractions.

**3. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities (AND) -> [CRITICAL NODE] Execute Arbitrary Code on Server:**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers find ways to execute their own code on the server running the Meteor application, leading to complete system compromise.
* **Description:**
    * **Exploiting Insecure Method Implementations:** Finding vulnerabilities in server-side methods that allow for code injection or execution (e.g., through insecure use of `eval()` or shell commands).
    * **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in server-side packages used by the Meteor application.
    * **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Tricking the server into making requests to internal or external resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input received by server-side methods.
    * Avoid using dynamic code execution functions like `eval()` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    * Regularly update Meteor and all server-side packages to patch known vulnerabilities.
    * Implement network segmentation and restrict outbound traffic from the server to only necessary destinations to mitigate SSRF risks.

**4. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Package Dependencies (AND) -> [CRITICAL NODE] Introduce Malicious Code via Vulnerable Package:**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage vulnerabilities in third-party packages used by the Meteor application to inject malicious code or gain unauthorized access.
* **Description:**
    * **Using Packages with Known Vulnerabilities:** Failing to update packages with known security flaws.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** Compromising legitimate packages with malicious code that is then included in the application.
    * **Typosquatting:** Installing malicious packages with names similar to legitimate ones.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly audit and update all package dependencies.
    * Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.
    * Verify the integrity and authenticity of packages before installation.
    * Consider using a private package registry for better control over dependencies.

**5. [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Deployment/Update Mechanisms (AND) -> Inject Malicious Code during Deployment/Update:**

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the deployment or update process to inject malicious code into the application.
* **Description:**
    * **Compromising Deployment Credentials:** Gaining access to credentials used for deploying updates.
    * **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Update Channels:** Intercepting and modifying updates being pushed to the application.
    * **Exploiting Vulnerabilities in the Hot Code Push Mechanism:** Injecting malicious code during a hot code push update.
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure deployment credentials and use multi-factor authentication.
    * Ensure secure communication channels for deployment and updates.
    * Implement integrity checks for updates to verify their authenticity.
    * Restrict access to the hot code push mechanism and require authentication.

This focused view of the attack tree provides a clear understanding of the most critical threats to a Meteor application, allowing development teams to prioritize their security efforts effectively.
