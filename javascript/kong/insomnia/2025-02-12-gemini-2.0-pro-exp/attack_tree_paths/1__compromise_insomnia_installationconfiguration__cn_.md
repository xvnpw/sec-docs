## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 Unprotected Config Files

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with unprotected configuration files in the Insomnia application, identify specific vulnerabilities, propose concrete mitigation strategies, and provide actionable recommendations for the development team to enhance the application's security posture.  We aim to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within Insomnia's configuration.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on attack path **1.1.1 Unprotected Config Files**, within the broader context of compromising the Insomnia installation/configuration.  We will consider:

*   The specific file locations used by Insomnia on different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux).
*   The types of sensitive data stored in these configuration files.
*   The default file permissions set by Insomnia during installation and runtime.
*   Potential attack scenarios exploiting weak file permissions.
*   The impact of successful exploitation on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
*   Mitigation strategies, including secure coding practices, secure configuration defaults, and user education.
*   Detection methods for identifying potential vulnerabilities and successful attacks.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methods:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the Insomnia source code (available on GitHub) to understand how configuration files are created, accessed, and managed.  This includes identifying:
    *   File I/O operations related to configuration data.
    *   Permission-setting logic (e.g., `chmod`, `SetFileSecurity`).
    *   Error handling related to file access.
    *   Use of libraries or system calls that affect file permissions.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):** We will install Insomnia on various operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and perform the following tests:
    *   Inspect the default file permissions of newly created configuration files.
    *   Attempt to access configuration files from different user accounts with varying privilege levels.
    *   Simulate attack scenarios (e.g., creating a low-privilege user and attempting to read config files).
    *   Monitor file system activity during Insomnia's operation to identify any changes to file permissions.

3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use threat modeling techniques to identify potential attack vectors and scenarios related to unprotected configuration files. This includes considering:
    *   Attacker motivations (e.g., data theft, credential harvesting).
    *   Attacker capabilities (e.g., local access, remote access via malware).
    *   Potential entry points (e.g., compromised user account, vulnerable software).

4.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will research known vulnerabilities and exploits related to file permission issues in general and, if available, specifically related to Insomnia or similar applications.

5.  **Best Practices Review:** We will compare Insomnia's file handling practices against industry best practices for secure configuration management and file system security.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1.1 Unprotected Config Files

**2.1. Threat Actor Profile:**

*   **Local User:** A user with limited privileges on the same system as the Insomnia installation. This could be a legitimate user with malicious intent or a compromised account.
*   **Malware:** Malicious software running on the system, potentially with elevated privileges, seeking to exfiltrate sensitive data.
*   **Remote Attacker (Indirect):** An attacker who has gained initial access to the system through another vulnerability (e.g., a network service exploit) and is now attempting to escalate privileges or steal data.

**2.2. Attack Vector Details:**

The core attack vector relies on Insomnia creating or modifying configuration files with overly permissive file system permissions.  This allows unauthorized users or processes to read the contents of these files.

**2.3. Specific Vulnerabilities (Hypothetical and Confirmed):**

*   **Default World-Readable Permissions:**  If Insomnia, upon installation or during runtime, sets file permissions to allow all users (including unprivileged ones) to read the configuration files, this is a critical vulnerability.  This is often represented as `644` (rw-r--r--) or `666` (rw-rw-rw-) on Unix-like systems, or equivalent "Everyone: Read" permissions on Windows.
*   **Incorrect Use of Temporary Files:** If Insomnia uses temporary files to store sensitive data and these files are not properly secured (e.g., created in a world-readable directory with weak permissions), this creates a vulnerability.
*   **Race Conditions:**  A race condition could occur if Insomnia attempts to set secure permissions *after* creating the file.  A malicious process could potentially read the file's contents in the brief window between creation and permission setting.
*   **Configuration File Location:**  Storing configuration files in predictable, easily accessible locations (e.g., the user's home directory without a dedicated, protected subdirectory) increases the risk of unauthorized access.
*   **Lack of Integrity Checks:**  If Insomnia does not verify the integrity of its configuration files, an attacker could modify them to inject malicious settings or scripts. This is not directly related to *reading* the files, but it's a related vulnerability that could be exploited after gaining read access.
* **Downgrade of permissions:** If Insomnia, for some reason, downgrades permissions of config files during update or other operations.

**2.4. Impact Analysis:**

*   **Confidentiality:**  The primary impact is a severe breach of confidentiality.  Attackers can gain access to:
    *   API Keys:  Allowing unauthorized access to APIs and services used by the victim.
    *   Authentication Credentials:  Usernames, passwords, tokens for various services.
    *   Environment Variables:  Potentially containing sensitive configuration data for connected services.
    *   Request History:  Revealing sensitive information about the APIs and data the user interacts with.
    *   Workspace Data:  Including shared workspaces, potentially impacting other users.

*   **Integrity:**  While the primary attack vector focuses on reading data, an attacker with write access (due to overly permissive permissions) could modify configuration files, potentially leading to:
    *   Injection of malicious requests or scripts.
    *   Alteration of API endpoints or authentication settings.
    *   Disruption of Insomnia's functionality.

*   **Availability:**  While less direct, an attacker could potentially corrupt or delete configuration files, leading to a denial of service for the Insomnia user.

**2.5. Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Secure Default Permissions:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Insomnia should create configuration files with the *most restrictive* permissions possible.  Only the user who owns the Insomnia process should have read and write access.
    *   **Unix-like Systems:** Use `600` (rw-------) as the default permission for sensitive configuration files.  Avoid using `umask` values that result in overly permissive defaults.
    *   **Windows:** Use the appropriate Windows security descriptors to grant access only to the specific user account running Insomnia.  Avoid granting "Everyone" or "Authenticated Users" any access.
    *   **Cross-Platform Consistency:** Ensure consistent secure defaults across all supported operating systems.

*   **Secure Configuration File Location:**
    *   Use a dedicated subdirectory within the user's application data directory.  This directory should also have restricted permissions.
    *   Avoid storing sensitive data in easily guessable or world-readable locations.
    *   Consider using platform-specific APIs for secure storage (e.g., the macOS Keychain, Windows Credential Manager) for highly sensitive data like API keys.

*   **Atomic File Operations:**
    *   Use atomic file operations (e.g., creating a temporary file with secure permissions, then renaming it to the final configuration file name) to prevent race conditions.
    *   Ensure that file permissions are set *before* any sensitive data is written to the file.

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   If Insomnia allows users to import configuration data from external sources, rigorously validate and sanitize this data to prevent the injection of malicious settings.

*   **Integrity Checks:**
    *   Implement integrity checks (e.g., using checksums or digital signatures) to verify that configuration files have not been tampered with.

*   **User Education:**
    *   Provide clear documentation to users about the importance of securing their Insomnia installation and configuration.
    *   Warn users about the risks of importing workspaces or environments from untrusted sources.

*   **Regular Security Audits:**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of the Insomnia codebase and deployment process to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Encryption at Rest:**
    *   Consider encrypting sensitive data within the configuration files, even if the files themselves are protected by file system permissions. This adds an extra layer of defense.

**2.6. Detection Methods:**

*   **Static Code Analysis Tools:** Use static analysis tools to automatically scan the Insomnia codebase for potential file permission vulnerabilities.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Runtime Monitoring):** Monitor file system activity during Insomnia's operation to detect any unexpected changes to file permissions or unauthorized access attempts.
*   **Security Audits:** Regularly review the file permissions of Insomnia's configuration files on various systems.
*   **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):** Configure IDS rules to detect attempts to access Insomnia's configuration files by unauthorized users or processes.
*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** Use FIM tools to monitor changes to Insomnia's configuration files and alert on any unauthorized modifications.

**2.7. Actionable Recommendations for the Development Team:**

1.  **Immediate Action:**
    *   Review and update the file permission setting logic in the Insomnia codebase to ensure secure defaults (`600` on Unix-like, restricted user access on Windows).
    *   Implement atomic file operations for configuration file creation and modification.
    *   Verify that temporary files are handled securely.

2.  **Short-Term Actions:**
    *   Implement integrity checks for configuration files.
    *   Add input validation and sanitization for imported configuration data.
    *   Improve documentation on secure configuration practices.

3.  **Long-Term Actions:**
    *   Consider encrypting sensitive data within configuration files.
    *   Explore using platform-specific secure storage APIs.
    *   Integrate static and dynamic analysis tools into the development pipeline.
    *   Establish a regular security audit schedule.
