## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Insomnia Installation/Configuration [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_insomnia_installationconfiguration__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical node because gaining control over the Insomnia installation or its configuration files provides direct access to stored data (API keys, requests, environments, etc.).
*   **High-Risk Paths:**
    *   **1.1 Local File Access to Insomnia Data [HR]**
        *   **1.1.1 Unprotected Config Files [HR] [CN]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with local access (either directly or through another compromised application) exploits weak file system permissions on Insomnia's data directory to read sensitive configuration files.
            *   **Details:**
                *   Insomnia stores data in files (location varies by OS).
                *   Weak permissions (e.g., world-readable) allow unauthorized access.
                *   Attacker can read API keys, credentials, request history, and environment variables.
                *   This could be combined with other attacks (e.g., malware) to gain initial local access.
    *   **1.2 Weak/Default Credentials/Permissions [HR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits weak or default credentials used for Insomnia's data synchronization feature (if enabled) or for shared workspaces to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        *   **Details:**
            *   If Insomnia uses a cloud service for sync, weak credentials for that service can be compromised.
            *   Shared workspaces with overly permissive access controls can be exploited.
            *   Attacker gains access to synchronized data, potentially across multiple devices.
    *   **1.3 Malicious Workspace/Environment [HR]**
        *   **1.3.1 Social Engineering [HR]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker tricks a user into importing a malicious workspace or environment file containing crafted requests or scripts.
            *   **Details:**
                *   Attacker uses social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing emails, deceptive messages) to persuade the user.
                *   The malicious workspace/environment might contain requests that exfiltrate data when run.
                *   It could also contain scripts that execute malicious code within Insomnia's context.
        *   **1.3.2 Phishing for Insomnia Credentials [HR]**
            *   **Attack Vector:** If Insomnia uses cloud sync, an attacker phishes for the user's cloud sync credentials.
            *   **Details:**
                *   Attacker creates a fake login page mimicking the cloud sync service.
                *   Phishing emails or messages are used to lure the user to the fake page.
                *   Once the user enters their credentials, the attacker gains access to their synced data.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Intercept/Modify Insomnia Network Traffic](./attack_tree_paths/2__interceptmodify_insomnia_network_traffic.md)

* This path is removed in the reduced tree, because the only high risk path (2.1) is conditional (if enabled).

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Insomnia Plugin Vulnerabilities [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_insomnia_plugin_vulnerabilities__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical node because Insomnia plugins can extend functionality and have access to sensitive data. Malicious or vulnerable plugins are a significant attack vector.
*   **High-Risk Paths:**
    *   **3.3 Malicious Plugin [CN] [HR]**
        *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker installs a malicious plugin (either from a compromised repository or through social engineering) that is specifically designed to compromise Insomnia.
        *   **Details:**
            *   The plugin could be disguised as a legitimate plugin.
            *   It could be distributed through unofficial channels or by compromising an official plugin repository (supply chain attack).
            *   The plugin has access to Insomnia's internal data and can interact with the user's system.
        *   **Specific Attack Types (all [HR]):**
            *   **3.3.1 Data Exfiltration:** The plugin steals API keys, credentials, request/response data, and other sensitive information.
            *   **3.3.2 Request Manipulation:** The plugin modifies API requests before they are sent, injecting malicious data or altering the intended behavior.
            *   **3.3.3 Code Injection:** The plugin injects arbitrary code into Insomnia, potentially gaining full control over the application and the user's system.
