# Attack Surface Analysis for kong/insomnia

## Attack Surface: [Sensitive Data Exposure (Local Storage)](./attack_surfaces/sensitive_data_exposure__local_storage_.md)

*   **Description:** Insomnia stores request collections, environments (with variables), and request/response history locally, potentially containing sensitive information.
*   **Insomnia Contribution:** Insomnia's core functionality involves storing this data locally, making it a direct point of risk.
*   **Example:** An environment variable contains a production database password, or a request collection includes API keys for a third-party service. An attacker gains access to the developer's laptop.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of API keys, passwords, internal URLs, and sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access to systems and data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if production credentials are stored) / **High** (for development/staging credentials).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Storing Production Credentials:** Never store production credentials in Insomnia, especially on development machines.
    *   **Use Environment Variables (OS Level):** Leverage operating system-level environment variables instead of storing sensitive values directly in Insomnia environments. Reference these OS-level variables within Insomnia.
    *   **Encrypt Workspaces:** Utilize Insomnia's workspace encryption feature.
    *   **Full Disk Encryption:** Enable full-disk encryption on the developer's machine.
    *   **Strong Access Controls:** Implement strong password policies and multi-factor authentication for the user's operating system account.
    *   **Regular Data Cleanup:** Periodically review and delete unnecessary collections, environments, and request history.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Insomnia Account (Cloud Sync)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_insomnia_account__cloud_sync_.md)

*   **Description:** If an attacker gains access to a user's Insomnia account, they can access all synced data.
*   **Insomnia Contribution:** The cloud sync feature creates a centralized repository of potentially sensitive data accessible via the Insomnia account, a direct risk introduced by this Insomnia feature.
*   **Example:** An attacker phishes a developer's Insomnia account credentials or exploits a vulnerability in Insomnia's authentication system.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of all synced collections, environments, and design documents, potentially leading to widespread unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong, Unique Passwords:** Use a strong, unique password for the Insomnia account, distinct from other accounts.
    *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enable MFA for the Insomnia account.
    *   **Phishing Awareness:** Train developers to recognize and avoid phishing attempts.
    *   **Limit Cloud Sync Usage:** Consider whether cloud sync is strictly necessary. If not, disable it.
    *   **Monitor Account Activity:** Regularly review Insomnia account activity for any suspicious logins or changes.

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Data Sharing (Collections/Environments)](./attack_surfaces/accidental_data_sharing__collectionsenvironments_.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might inadvertently share sensitive data by sharing Insomnia files without proper sanitization.
*   **Insomnia Contribution:** Insomnia's ease of sharing collections and environments *directly* increases the risk of accidental exposure. The file format and sharing mechanisms are inherent to Insomnia.
*   **Example:** A developer emails a collection file containing API keys to a colleague, or commits an environment file with secrets to a public Git repository.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sanitize Before Sharing:** Thoroughly review and remove any sensitive data (API keys, passwords, etc.) from collections and environments *before* sharing them.
    *   **Use `.gitignore`:** Always use `.gitignore` files to prevent accidental commits of Insomnia data files (especially environment files) to Git repositories.
    *   **Secure Sharing Channels:** Use secure channels (e.g., encrypted file transfer, password-protected archives) when sharing Insomnia files.
    *   **Education and Awareness:** Train developers on the risks of accidental data sharing and best practices for secure collaboration.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Installing a malicious or compromised Insomnia plugin can grant attackers access to data or the system.
*   **Insomnia Contribution:** Insomnia's plugin architecture *directly* allows for third-party code execution within the Insomnia application, creating a potential entry point for attackers. This is a feature specific to Insomnia.
*   **Example:** A developer installs a seemingly useful plugin from an untrusted source, which then steals API keys from Insomnia and sends them to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Impact:** Data theft, system compromise, potential for lateral movement within the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Trusted Sources Only:** Install plugins *only* from trusted sources, such as the official Insomnia plugin repository or reputable developers.
    *   **Code Review (If Possible):** If feasible, review the plugin's source code before installation to identify any suspicious behavior.
    *   **Minimal Plugin Usage:** Only install plugins that are absolutely necessary. Avoid installing plugins with excessive permissions.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to address any known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Monitor Plugin Behavior:** Be aware of any unusual behavior from installed plugins.
