## Attack Tree Path: [1. Access Sensitive Data Stored by Insomnia (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/1__access_sensitive_data_stored_by_insomnia__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Read Insomnia Configuration Files (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   **Critical Node: Access Insomnia's Configuration Directory (e.g., ~/.insomnia)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the file system location where Insomnia stores its configuration files. This often involves navigating to user-specific directories.
        *   **Impact:** Successful access allows attackers to extract sensitive information like API keys, authentication tokens, and potentially other credentials used to interact with the target application.
*   **Read Insomnia Cookie Jar (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   **Critical Node: Access Insomnia's Cookie Storage**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to access the file or storage mechanism where Insomnia saves cookies received from API responses.
        *   **Impact:** Obtaining session cookies for the target application allows attackers to bypass authentication and impersonate legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Insomnia Configuration (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_insomnia_configuration__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Modify Insomnia Configuration Files**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to modify Insomnia's configuration files directly. This could involve injecting malicious API endpoints, custom headers, or altering other settings.
    *   **Impact:** This allows attackers to redirect requests to malicious servers, inject malicious data into legitimate requests, or otherwise manipulate Insomnia's behavior to compromise the target application.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Insomnia Plugin Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_insomnia_plugin_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Installed Plugins (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   **Critical Node: Execute Malicious Code via Plugin Vulnerability**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers research known security vulnerabilities in Insomnia plugins that the user has installed. They then craft exploits to leverage these vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the user's machine, allowing for complete system compromise and access to sensitive data.
*   **Introduce Malicious Plugin (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   **Critical Node: Gain Access to Insomnia's Plugin Directory**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to gain write access to the directory where Insomnia stores its plugins. This could be through exploiting other vulnerabilities or through social engineering.
        *   **Impact:** Once access is gained, attackers can install a maliciously crafted plugin designed to steal data, manipulate requests, or perform other harmful actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Insomnia Application Vulnerabilities (HIGH RISK PATH - Implicit)](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_insomnia_application_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_-_implicit_.md)

*   **Critical Node: Achieve Remote Code Execution or Data Exfiltration (via Insomnia Client Vulnerability)**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities within the Insomnia application itself. This could involve crafting specific inputs or triggering certain actions within the application.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution on the user's machine or the exfiltration of sensitive data handled by Insomnia.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Social Engineering the Insomnia User (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/5__social_engineering_the_insomnia_user__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Phishing for Insomnia Credentials or Data (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   **Critical Node: Trick User into Revealing API Keys, Tokens, etc.**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers use phishing techniques to trick users into revealing sensitive information related to their Insomnia setup, such as sync credentials or API keys stored within Insomnia.
        *   **Impact:** Gaining access to credentials allows attackers to directly access the target application or manipulate the user's Insomnia data.
*   **Gaining Physical Access to User's Machine (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   **Critical Node: Directly Access Insomnia Data or Control the Application**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain physical access to the user's computer.
        *   **Impact:** Physical access allows attackers to directly access Insomnia's stored data, modify its configuration, or control the application to send malicious requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Insomnia Sync Functionality (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_insomnia_sync_functionality__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Compromise Insomnia Sync Service Account (HIGH RISK PATH)**
    *   **Critical Node: Obtain Credentials for the Sync Service Account**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers attempt to compromise the user's credentials for the Insomnia sync service. This could be through phishing, credential stuffing, or data breaches on the sync service itself.
        *   **Impact:** Compromising the sync account grants access to all of the user's synchronized Insomnia data, including potentially sensitive API keys, requests, and environment variables.
*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Insomnia Sync Implementation (HIGH RISK PATH - Implicit)**
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities to Access or Modify Synced Data**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit vulnerabilities in how Insomnia implements its synchronization feature. This could involve flaws in the synchronization protocol or insecure data storage on the sync service.
        *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow attackers to directly access or modify the user's synced Insomnia data without needing to compromise their account credentials.
