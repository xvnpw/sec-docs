# Attack Surface Analysis for kong/insomnia

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Local Storage of Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_local_storage_of_credentials.md)

**Description:** Sensitive credentials like API keys, authentication tokens (Bearer, OAuth 2.0), and passwords are stored locally by Insomnia.
*   **How Insomnia Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Insomnia's functionality requires storing these credentials for convenient access to APIs. The security of *this local storage mechanism within Insomnia* directly impacts the risk.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to a developer's laptop (through malware or physical access). They can then access Insomnia's configuration files or local storage to retrieve stored API keys and use them to access the organization's APIs.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive APIs, potential data breaches, and the ability to perform actions as the legitimate user.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Insomnia Developers:**
        *   Implement robust encryption for locally stored sensitive data within Insomnia.
        *   Consider offering integration with secure secret management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault).
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Utilize operating system-level encryption for the entire hard drive.
        *   Employ strong passwords or passphrases for their user accounts.
        *   Be cautious about installing untrusted software on the machine running Insomnia.
        *   Regularly review and remove unused or outdated credentials from Insomnia.
        *   Consider using Insomnia's environment variables and referencing secrets instead of hardcoding them in requests.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Insomnia's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality. Vulnerabilities in *these Insomnia plugins* could be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.
*   **How Insomnia Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The plugin system *within Insomnia* introduces third-party code into the application, expanding the attack surface if these plugins are not securely developed.
*   **Example:** A malicious plugin is installed *in Insomnia* that allows an attacker to craft requests to internal network resources that the user's machine has access to, bypassing firewall restrictions. This could be used to scan internal ports or access internal services.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, potential data exfiltration from internal systems, and the ability to launch further attacks from the user's machine.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Insomnia Developers:**
        *   Implement a robust plugin security model with clear guidelines and security reviews for plugin developers.
        *   Provide mechanisms for users to report potentially malicious plugins.
        *   Consider sandboxing or isolating plugins to limit their access to system resources.
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources *within the Insomnia ecosystem*.
        *   Carefully review the permissions requested by plugins before installation.
        *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider the necessity of each installed plugin and remove those that are not actively used.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure to Malicious API Responses via Rendering or Processing](./attack_surfaces/exposure_to_malicious_api_responses_via_rendering_or_processing.md)

**Description:** A malicious or compromised API could send responses containing exploits that target vulnerabilities in *the libraries used by Insomnia* for rendering or processing data (e.g., vulnerabilities in JSON or XML parsing libraries).
*   **How Insomnia Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Insomnia needs to parse and potentially render API responses for the user. If *these processes within Insomnia* are vulnerable, malicious responses can be used to compromise the client.
*   **Example:** A malicious API sends a specially crafted JSON response that exploits a known vulnerability in *Insomnia's JSON parsing library*, leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine.
*   **Impact:** Potential for arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, leading to data theft, malware installation, or system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Insomnia Developers:**
        *   Regularly update and patch all third-party libraries used for parsing and rendering API responses.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for API responses *within Insomnia's processing logic*.
        *   Consider using secure parsing libraries and techniques to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Be cautious when interacting with APIs from untrusted sources.
        *   Keep Insomnia updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks via Malicious Plugins or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_via_malicious_plugins_or_dependencies.md)

**Description:** The risk of malicious code being introduced through compromised *Insomnia plugins* or vulnerabilities in *Insomnia's own dependencies*.
*   **How Insomnia Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By relying on external plugins and libraries, *Insomnia* inherits the security risks associated with their development and distribution.
*   **Example:** A popular *Insomnia plugin* is compromised, and a malicious update is pushed to users, containing malware that steals credentials or performs other malicious actions.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of user machines, data breaches, and potential for widespread attacks if a widely used plugin is affected.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Insomnia Developers:**
        *   Implement a secure plugin distribution and update mechanism.
        *   Conduct security audits of their own dependencies and ensure they are kept up-to-date.
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify and address vulnerabilities.
    *   **Developers/Users:**
        *   Exercise caution when installing plugins and only use reputable sources *within the Insomnia ecosystem*.
        *   Keep Insomnia and its plugins updated.
        *   Monitor for any unusual behavior after installing or updating plugins.
