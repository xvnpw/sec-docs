# Attack Surface Analysis for kong/insomnia

## Attack Surface: [Local Storage of Sensitive Data](./attack_surfaces/local_storage_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** Insomnia stores request history, environment variables, and potentially sensitive credentials (like API keys, bearer tokens, OAuth tokens) locally on the user's machine.
*   **How Insomnia Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Insomnia's design necessitates storing this data for user convenience and functionality. This creates a local repository of potentially sensitive information.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains physical or remote access to a developer's workstation and retrieves API keys stored within Insomnia's data directory.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to APIs and backend systems, potential for further lateral movement within the network.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enable full disk encryption on developer workstations.
    *   Avoid storing highly sensitive credentials directly within Insomnia environments. Utilize secure secrets management solutions and reference them indirectly.
    *   Regularly review and clear request history if it contains sensitive information.
    *   Implement strong access controls on developer machines.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Third-Party Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_third-party_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Insomnia supports a plugin ecosystem, allowing users to extend its functionality. However, these plugins are developed by third parties and could be malicious or contain vulnerabilities.
*   **How Insomnia Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Insomnia provides the platform for installing and running these plugins, granting them access to Insomnia's data and potentially the local system.
*   **Example:** A developer installs a seemingly useful plugin that secretly exfiltrates API requests and responses to an external server controlled by an attacker.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, compromised API keys, potential for remote code execution on the developer's machine depending on plugin permissions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   Carefully review the permissions requested by plugins before installation.
    *   Monitor plugin activity and network traffic for suspicious behavior.
    *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for testing new or untrusted plugins.
    *   Implement a process for vetting and approving plugins within the development team.

## Attack Surface: [Code Execution via Pre-request and Response Scripts](./attack_surfaces/code_execution_via_pre-request_and_response_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Insomnia allows defining pre-request and response scripts using JavaScript. This powerful feature can be exploited if scripts are written with vulnerabilities or if malicious scripts are introduced.
*   **How Insomnia Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Insomnia provides the mechanism for executing these scripts, granting them access to the local environment and potentially sensitive data within the request/response context.
*   **Example:** A developer imports a collection from an untrusted source that contains a malicious pre-request script designed to steal local files or execute arbitrary commands.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the developer's machine, data exfiltration, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review all pre-request and response scripts before using them, especially those from external sources.
    *   Avoid using dynamic code execution (e.g., `eval()`) within scripts.
    *   Implement code review processes for scripts used in shared collections.
    *   Educate developers about the risks of executing untrusted scripts.
