# Threat Model Analysis for kong/insomnia

## Threat: [Storing Sensitive Credentials in Insomnia Collections/Environments](./threats/storing_sensitive_credentials_in_insomnia_collectionsenvironments.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to stored API keys, authentication tokens, or other sensitive credentials by accessing a developer's exported Insomnia collection file, their local Insomnia configuration files, or through a compromised Insomnia Sync account. They could then use these credentials to impersonate the application and access protected resources.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend systems, data breaches, potential financial loss, and reputational damage.

**Affected Insomnia Component:** Collections, Environment Variables, Insomnia Sync

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Utilize Insomnia environment variables for storing credentials instead of hardcoding them in collections.
- Avoid committing Insomnia configuration files or exported collections containing sensitive information to version control.
- If using Insomnia Sync, enable strong password policies and multi-factor authentication on Insomnia accounts.
- Regularly review and sanitize Insomnia collections before sharing or exporting.
- Consider using secrets management solutions and referencing secrets within Insomnia environments.

## Threat: [Malicious Insomnia Plugins/Extensions](./threats/malicious_insomnia_pluginsextensions.md)

**Description:** A developer installs a malicious or vulnerable Insomnia plugin/extension. This plugin could potentially access sensitive data within Insomnia, intercept API requests and responses, or even execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine.

**Impact:** Data breaches, credential theft, system compromise, and potential supply chain attacks.

**Affected Insomnia Component:** Plugins/Extensions framework

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Only install plugins from trusted sources.
- Review the permissions requested by plugins before installation.
- Keep Insomnia and its plugins up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Consider using a plugin vetting process within the development team.
- Monitor for unusual plugin activity or behavior.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Insomnia Application Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_insomnia_application_itself.md)

**Description:** Security vulnerabilities within the Insomnia application itself could be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to developer machines or sensitive data stored within Insomnia. This could involve remote code execution, privilege escalation, or other attack vectors.

**Impact:** System compromise, data breaches, and potential disruption of development workflows.

**Affected Insomnia Component:** Core Insomnia application

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep Insomnia updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Subscribe to security advisories related to Insomnia.
- Implement endpoint security measures on developer machines.
- Follow security best practices for software installation and management.

## Threat: [Compromised Insomnia Sync Account](./threats/compromised_insomnia_sync_account.md)

**Description:** If a developer's Insomnia Sync account is compromised (e.g., due to weak passwords or phishing), an attacker could gain access to all synced collections, environments, and potentially stored credentials.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive API configurations and credentials, potential unauthorized access to backend systems.

**Affected Insomnia Component:** Insomnia Sync, User Accounts

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Enforce strong password policies for Insomnia Sync accounts.
- Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Insomnia Sync accounts.
- Educate developers about phishing and other social engineering attacks.
- Regularly review and revoke access for inactive or former team members.

## Threat: [Accidental Use of HTTP for Sensitive APIs](./threats/accidental_use_of_http_for_sensitive_apis.md)

**Description:** Developers might mistakenly configure requests to use HTTP instead of HTTPS for sensitive API endpoints within Insomnia. This would transmit data in plaintext, making it vulnerable to interception.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data in transit, potential man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Affected Insomnia Component:** Request Editor, Protocol selection

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Enforce the use of HTTPS for all sensitive API endpoints.
- Configure Insomnia to default to HTTPS or provide warnings for HTTP connections to sensitive URLs.
- Implement server-side enforcement of HTTPS using HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS).
- Educate developers on the importance of using HTTPS for secure communication.
