# Threat Model Analysis for kong/insomnia

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Insomnia Configurations](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_insomnia_configurations.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to Insomnia configuration files stored locally (e.g., `.insomnia` directory). By examining these files, the attacker can extract sensitive information such as API keys, authentication tokens, passwords, and other credentials that developers might have inadvertently stored within requests, environments, or collections. This access could be achieved through malware, insider threats, or physical access to a developer's machine.

**Impact:**  Successful extraction of sensitive credentials allows attackers to impersonate legitimate users, gain unauthorized access to protected APIs and backend systems, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, and significant security compromises.

**Insomnia Component Affected:** Configuration Storage (local files)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly avoid** storing sensitive credentials directly within Insomnia configurations (requests, environment variables, collection descriptions).
*   Utilize secure credential management practices, such as employing environment variables and integrating with secure vault solutions to manage and inject sensitive credentials at runtime, rather than storing them persistently in Insomnia.
*   Implement robust file system access controls on developer machines to restrict unauthorized access to Insomnia configuration directories.
*   Consider enabling encryption for sensitive data within Insomnia configurations if such features are available and suitable.
*   Provide comprehensive security training to developers emphasizing secure credential handling within Insomnia and the risks of storing sensitive data in configuration files.

## Threat: [Cloud Sync Vulnerabilities (if Insomnia Sync is enabled)](./threats/cloud_sync_vulnerabilities__if_insomnia_sync_is_enabled_.md)

**Description:** If Insomnia Sync is used to synchronize configurations across devices or teams, an attacker could exploit vulnerabilities within Insomnia's cloud synchronization service or infrastructure. This could involve compromising Insomnia's servers, intercepting communication, or exploiting account-level vulnerabilities to gain access to synced configurations. These configurations may contain sensitive data.

**Impact:** A successful attack could lead to a large-scale data breach if Insomnia's cloud service is compromised, potentially exposing sensitive API credentials and configurations of numerous users. Account compromise could result in targeted theft of sensitive data for specific users or teams.

**Insomnia Component Affected:** Cloud Sync Service (Insomnia's backend infrastructure and client-side sync functionality)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully evaluate the security posture and reputation of Insomnia Sync before enabling it, especially for projects dealing with highly sensitive data.
*   Enforce strong, unique passwords and enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all Insomnia accounts that utilize Cloud Sync to protect against account compromise.
*   Stay vigilant and promptly apply security updates and patches released by Insomnia for its cloud sync service and client application.
*   Thoroughly understand and consider the data residency and compliance implications of using a cloud-based synchronization service, especially regarding sensitive data.
*   Minimize the storage of highly sensitive and critical credentials in configurations that are synchronized via Insomnia Cloud Sync.

## Threat: [Malicious Insomnia Plugins](./threats/malicious_insomnia_plugins.md)

**Description:** A developer installs a malicious Insomnia plugin from an untrusted or compromised source. This plugin could be intentionally designed to perform malicious actions, such as stealing sensitive data from Insomnia configurations, injecting malicious code into API requests, or executing arbitrary code on the developer's machine upon installation or during Insomnia usage.

**Impact:** Installation of a malicious plugin can lead to severe consequences, including data theft (credentials, API data), malware infection of developer workstations, compromise of the development environment, and potentially supply chain attacks if malicious code is injected into APIs tested and deployed using the compromised Insomnia setup.

**Insomnia Component Affected:** Plugin System (Insomnia's plugin loading and execution mechanism)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly install plugins only from trusted and highly reputable sources.** Favor plugins from the official Insomnia plugin marketplace or those developed by verified and well-known developers.
*   Whenever possible, **thoroughly review the source code of plugins before installation**, especially for open-source plugins, to identify any suspicious or malicious code.
*   Keep all installed plugins updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   Implement security scanning mechanisms for plugins if feasible, to automatically detect known vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.
*   For development teams, consider establishing a whitelist of approved and vetted Insomnia plugins to restrict the installation of unverified or potentially risky plugins.

## Threat: [Insomnia Application Vulnerabilities](./threats/insomnia_application_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Like any software application, Insomnia itself may contain security vulnerabilities in its codebase. These vulnerabilities could be exploited by attackers if they can target the Insomnia application running on a developer's machine. Exploitation could occur through various attack vectors, such as crafted network requests, malicious files, or exploiting vulnerabilities in Insomnia's dependencies.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation of Insomnia application vulnerabilities could lead to a range of severe impacts, including application crashes, unauthorized access to and theft of data stored within Insomnia configurations, arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine, and potentially wider system compromise depending on the nature and severity of the vulnerability.

**Insomnia Component Affected:** Core Application (various modules and functionalities within the Insomnia application)

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Maintain Insomnia application up-to-date at all times.** Regularly check for and install the latest versions of Insomnia to ensure that known security vulnerabilities are patched promptly.
*   Actively monitor security advisories and release notes published by the Insomnia development team to stay informed about reported vulnerabilities and recommended updates.
*   Deploy endpoint security solutions on developer machines, such as antivirus software, intrusion detection systems, and exploit mitigation tools, to help detect and prevent the exploitation of application vulnerabilities, including those in Insomnia.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Workspace/Collection Access (Insomnia Teams/Workspaces)](./threats/unauthorized_workspacecollection_access__insomnia_teamsworkspaces_.md)

**Description:** When using Insomnia Teams or Workspaces for collaborative API development and testing, vulnerabilities in the access control mechanisms or improper configuration of permissions could allow unauthorized users (both internal and external to the organization) to gain access to shared workspaces and collections. These shared resources may contain sensitive API configurations, credentials, and request details.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to workspaces and collections can result in data leakage of sensitive API information, unauthorized access to backend APIs by malicious actors, disruption of team workflows due to unauthorized modifications, and potentially wider organizational compromise if sensitive internal APIs are exposed.

**Insomnia Component Affected:** Workspace/Collection Sharing and Access Control features (specific to Insomnia Teams/Workspaces functionality)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement robust and granular access control within Insomnia Teams/Workspaces.** Carefully configure permissions to ensure that only authorized users and team members have access to specific workspaces and collections based on the principle of least privilege.
*   Regularly review and audit workspace and collection access permissions to identify and rectify any misconfigurations or unauthorized access.
*   Adhere to security best practices for team collaboration and data sharing, ensuring that sensitive API information is shared only with necessary and authorized personnel.
*   Effectively utilize role-based access control (RBAC) features within Insomnia Teams/Workspaces to manage user permissions and access levels based on their roles and responsibilities within the team or organization.
