*   **Compliance Violations:**  Exposure of sensitive data could lead to violations of data privacy regulations like GDPR, HIPAA, or PCI DSS, resulting in fines and legal repercussions.

#### 4.4. Impact Scenarios

*   **Scenario 1: Large-Scale Data Breach at Insomnia:** An attacker successfully breaches Insomnia's cloud infrastructure and gains access to the database containing synced configurations for all users. This results in a massive data breach, exposing sensitive API keys and configurations for potentially thousands of users and organizations. The impact is widespread and severe, leading to significant financial losses, reputational damage, and regulatory penalties for affected users.

*   **Scenario 2: Targeted Account Compromise:** An attacker uses credential stuffing or phishing to compromise the Insomnia account of a developer working on a critical project. They gain access to the developer's synced configurations, which contain API keys for production systems. The attacker uses these keys to access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the production environment, leading to a targeted data breach.

*   **Scenario 3: Man-in-the-Middle Attack on a Public Network:** A developer uses Insomnia Sync on a public Wi-Fi network. An attacker performs a MitM attack and intercepts the communication between the Insomnia client and the cloud service. They capture session tokens or even encrypted configurations (if encryption is weak or flawed). The attacker then uses this information to access the developer's synced configurations and potentially gain access to sensitive data.

#### 4.5. Evaluation of Mitigation Strategies and Enhancements
