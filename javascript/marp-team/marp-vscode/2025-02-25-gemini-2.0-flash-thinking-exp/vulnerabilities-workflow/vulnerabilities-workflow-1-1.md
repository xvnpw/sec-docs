### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Custom Theme URL
- Description:
    1. An attacker can influence a user to configure the `markdown.marp.themes` setting in VS Code to include a malicious URL. This could be achieved through social engineering or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to modify the user's settings.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious URL pointing to an internal resource within the user's network or an external service they control.
    3. When the Marp extension renders a Marp Markdown document in the preview, it attempts to fetch CSS from the URLs specified in the `markdown.marp.themes` setting.
    4. If the extension lacks proper validation and sanitization of these URLs, it will make a server-side request to the attacker-controlled URL without adequate protection.
    5. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as probing internal network infrastructure, accessing internal services not intended for public access, or potentially exfiltrating data, depending on the capabilities of the targeted internal resources and the attacker's setup.
- Impact:
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially scan internal networks to discover open ports, services, and potentially sensitive information exposed by these services.
    - Access to Internal Services: The attacker might gain unauthorized access to internal services that are not directly accessible from the public internet, potentially leading to further exploitation or data breaches.
    - Depending on the nature of the internal services, this SSRF vulnerability could be a stepping stone to more severe attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The README.md mentions "Workspace Trust" and marks the "Use custom theme CSS" feature with a shield icon (🛡️). This suggests that the feature might be restricted or disabled in untrusted workspaces, acting as a potential mitigation depending on the implementation of Workspace Trust. However, the exact details of this mitigation are not provided in the project files.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust URL validation and sanitization for the `markdown.marp.themes` setting to prevent the loading of arbitrary URLs.
    - Restrict the allowed protocols for remote theme URLs to "https" only to minimize the risk of insecure connections and potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - Enforce Workspace Trust to effectively restrict or disable the loading of remote themes when the workspace is not trusted. Clearly document the behavior of custom themes in trusted and untrusted workspaces.
- Preconditions:
    - The user has the Marp for VS Code extension installed and activated.
    - The user is using VS Code in a trusted workspace, or Workspace Trust does not effectively mitigate SSRF in this feature.
    - An attacker can somehow influence the user to add a malicious URL to their `markdown.marp.themes` setting.
- Source code analysis:
    - Unfortunately, the provided PROJECT FILES do not include the source code of the Marp for VS Code extension. Therefore, a precise source code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerable code section is not possible.
    - Based on the description in `README.md`, we can infer that the extension likely reads the `markdown.marp.themes` setting and uses a function to fetch CSS files from the provided URLs.
    - Without access to the source code, it's assumed that standard HTTP request libraries are used for fetching resources, and there is a lack of URL validation, protocol restriction, and SSRF protection mechanisms in place when handling URLs from the `markdown.marp.themes` setting.
    - To confirm and further detail this vulnerability, a review of the source code, specifically the parts handling configuration settings and CSS theme loading, would be necessary.
- Security test case:
    1. **Set up a simple HTTP listener:** On your local machine, use a tool like `netcat` or `python -m http.server` to set up a listener that will log incoming HTTP requests. For example, using `python -m http.server 8080` will start a basic HTTP server on port 8080 in the current directory.
    2. **Open VS Code in a trusted workspace:** Launch VS Code and ensure you are working in a "trusted" workspace if Workspace Trust is enabled.
    3. **Access VS Code Settings:** Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or Code > Settings on macOS).
    4. **Locate Marp Extension Settings:** Search for "marp themes" in the settings search bar.
    5. **Modify "Marp: Themes" Setting:** Click "Edit in settings.json" under the "Marp: Themes" setting to open your `settings.json` file.
    6. **Add a Malicious URL:** Add a URL to the `markdown.marp.themes` array that points to your HTTP listener. For example, if your local machine's IP is `127.0.0.1`, add `"http://127.0.0.1:8080/test.css"`.  Alternatively, you can use a public service like `webhook.site` to get a unique URL and use that in the settings to observe the incoming request online.
    7. **Create or Open a Marp Markdown File:** Create a new Markdown file or open an existing one. Add `marp: true` in the front-matter of the document.
    8. **Trigger Preview:** Open the preview for the Marp Markdown file. This should trigger the extension to load the custom themes.
    9. **Observe HTTP Listener Logs:** Check the logs of your HTTP listener (e.g., the console output of `python -m http.server 8080` or your `webhook.site` page). If you see an HTTP request for `/test.css` or a request to your `webhook.site` URL, it confirms that the extension is making an outbound request to the URL you provided in the settings, indicating an SSRF vulnerability.
    10. **Test Internal Network Access (Optional and Requires Caution):** To further test for internal network SSRF, replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of an internal resource within your network that should not be publicly accessible. Repeat steps 6-9. If you observe a connection attempt to the internal IP in network monitoring tools (if you have access and permission to monitor network traffic), it further validates the SSRF and its potential to reach internal resources. **Perform this step with extreme caution and only in a controlled testing environment with explicit permission.**
