### Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Custom Theme URL

  - **Description:**
    1. An attacker can influence a user to configure the `markdown.marp.themes` setting in VS Code to include a malicious URL. This could be achieved through social engineering or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to modify the user's settings.
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious URL pointing to an internal resource within the user's network or an external service they control.
    3. When the Marp extension renders a Marp Markdown document in the preview, it attempts to fetch CSS from the URLs specified in the `markdown.marp.themes` setting.
    4. If the extension lacks proper validation and sanitization of these URLs, it will make a server-side request to the attacker-controlled URL without adequate protection.
    5. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as probing internal network infrastructure, accessing internal services not intended for public access, or potentially exfiltrating data, depending on the capabilities of the targeted internal resources and the attacker's setup.

  - **Impact:**
    - Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially scan internal networks to discover open ports, services, and potentially sensitive information exposed by these services.
    - Access to Internal Services: The attacker might gain unauthorized access to internal services that are not directly accessible from the public internet, potentially leading to further exploitation or data breaches.
    - Depending on the nature of the internal services, this SSRF vulnerability could be a stepping stone to more severe attacks.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - The README.md mentions "Workspace Trust" and marks the "Use custom theme CSS" feature with a shield icon (üõ°Ô∏è). This suggests that the feature might be restricted or disabled in untrusted workspaces, acting as a potential mitigation depending on the implementation of Workspace Trust. However, the exact details of this mitigation are not provided in the project files.

  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - Implement robust URL validation and sanitization for the `markdown.marp.themes` setting to prevent the loading of arbitrary URLs.
    - Restrict the allowed protocols for remote theme URLs to "https" only to minimize the risk of insecure connections and potential man-in-the-middle attacks.
    - Enforce Workspace Trust to effectively restrict or disable the loading of remote themes when the workspace is not trusted. Clearly document the behavior of custom themes in trusted and untrusted workspaces.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user has the Marp for VS Code extension installed and activated.
    - The user is using VS Code in a trusted workspace, or Workspace Trust does not effectively mitigate SSRF in this feature.
    - An attacker can somehow influence the user to add a malicious URL to their `markdown.marp.themes` setting.

  - **Source code analysis:**
    - Unfortunately, the provided PROJECT FILES do not include the source code of the Marp for VS Code extension. Therefore, a precise source code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerable code section is not possible.
    - Based on the description in `README.md`, we can infer that the extension likely reads the `markdown.marp.themes` setting and uses a function to fetch CSS files from the provided URLs.
    - Without access to the source code, it's assumed that standard HTTP request libraries are used for fetching resources, and there is a lack of URL validation, protocol restriction, and SSRF protection mechanisms in place when handling URLs from the `markdown.marp.themes` setting.
    - To confirm and further detail this vulnerability, a review of the source code, specifically the parts handling configuration settings and CSS theme loading, would be necessary.

  - **Security test case:**
    1. **Set up a simple HTTP listener:** On your local machine, use a tool like `netcat` or `python -m http.server` to set up a listener that will log incoming HTTP requests. For example, using `python -m http.server 8080` will start a basic HTTP server on port 8080 in the current directory.
    2. **Open VS Code in a trusted workspace:** Launch VS Code and ensure you are working in a "trusted" workspace if Workspace Trust is enabled.
    3. **Access VS Code Settings:** Go to File > Preferences > Settings (or Code > Settings on macOS).
    4. **Locate Marp Extension Settings:** Search for "marp themes" in the settings search bar.
    5. **Modify "Marp: Themes" Setting:** Click "Edit in settings.json" under the "Marp: Themes" setting to open your `settings.json` file.
    6. **Add a Malicious URL:** Add a URL to the `markdown.marp.themes` array that points to your HTTP listener. For example, if your local machine's IP is `127.0.0.1`, add `"http://127.0.0.1:8080/test.css"`.  Alternatively, you can use a public service like `webhook.site` to get a unique URL and use that in the settings to observe the incoming request online.
    7. **Create or Open a Marp Markdown File:** Create a new Markdown file or open an existing one. Add `marp: true` in the front-matter of the document.
    8. **Trigger Preview:** Open the preview for the Marp Markdown file. This should trigger the extension to load the custom themes.
    9. **Observe HTTP Listener Logs:** Check the logs of your HTTP listener (e.g., the console output of `python -m http.server 8080` or your `webhook.site` page). If you see an HTTP request for `/test.css` or a request to your `webhook.site` URL, it confirms that the extension is making an outbound request to the URL you provided in the settings, indicating an SSRF vulnerability.
    10. **Test Internal Network Access (Optional and Requires Caution):** To further test for internal network SSRF, replace `127.0.0.1` with the IP address of an internal resource within your network that should not be publicly accessible. Repeat steps 6-9. If you observe a connection attempt to the internal IP in network monitoring tools (if you have access and permission to monitor network traffic), it further validates the SSRF and its potential to reach internal resources. **Perform this step with extreme caution and only in a controlled testing environment with explicit permission.**

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unrestricted HTML Rendering / HTML Injection via Markdown Content

  - **Description:**
    1. An attacker can craft a malicious Marp Markdown file containing embedded HTML elements, including potentially `<script>` tags with JavaScript code.
    2. A victim user opens this malicious Marp Markdown file in VS Code with Marp for VS Code extension enabled.
    3. If the `markdown.marp.html` setting is set to `all`, the extension renders all HTML elements in the Markdown preview, including the malicious `<script>` tags.
    4. The JavaScript code within the injected `<script>` tags executes within the context of the Markdown preview.
    5. This could lead to various attacks, including stealing information from the VS Code environment (if accessible), performing actions on behalf of the user within the VS Code context, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.

  - **Impact:**
    - High impact if `markdown.marp.html` is set to `all`. Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the VS Code preview context can lead to significant security breaches, potentially compromising the user's workspace or VS Code environment.
    - Exploitation would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the VS¬†Code instance (or its preview window). This could lead to session hijacking, theft of sensitive information, or any number of client-side attacks that compromise the user‚Äôs environment.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - Workspace Trust: In untrusted workspaces, HTML elements in Marp Markdown are always ignored, regardless of the `markdown.marp.html` setting. This is a significant mitigation factor if Workspace Trust is enforced.
    - `markdown.marp.html` setting:  The setting allows users to control HTML rendering. The default is not 'all', which limits the risk if users do not explicitly enable full HTML rendering. The README mentions that only "selectivity HTML elements by Marp" are rendered by default, which suggests a built-in allowlist.
    - When using the default behavior in trusted workspaces, Marp Core relies on a predefined allowlist (see its internal `allowlist.ts`) to filter out dangerous elements.

  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - Content Sanitization: Even if `markdown.marp.html` is not 'all', and uses an allowlist, there should be robust sanitization of allowed HTML elements and attributes to prevent XSS or other HTML injection attacks.  It is not clear from the documentation if the "selectivity HTML elements" are properly sanitized.
    - No enforcement (or runtime warning) is provided when the user explicitly sets the configuration to ‚Äúall‚Äù in a trusted workspace.
    - There is no additional sanitization or content security policy applied at render time to guard against injected scripts when the allowlist is intentionally bypassed.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The target Markdown file must be opened in a workspace that is marked as trusted.
    - The user‚Äôs configuration for HTML rendering (i.e. `markdown.marp.html`) must be set to ‚Äúall‚Äù or otherwise disable the safe allowlist.
    - For full HTML injection via `<script>` tags, the `markdown.marp.html` setting must be set to `all` and the workspace must be trusted. If set to default or 'allowed', the vulnerability might still be present depending on the "selectivity HTML elements by Marp" and if they are properly sanitized.
    - The attacker must be able to supply or trick the user into opening a maliciously crafted Markdown file.

  - **Source code analysis:**
    - The extension delegates Markdown rendering to Marp Core. Marp Core normally sanitizes HTML using an allowlist (defined in its internal file such as `src/html/allowlist.ts`).
    - Review the code that processes the `markdown.marp.html` setting and handles HTML rendering in the Markdown preview. _Without direct code access, this is based on README.md description._
    - When a user opts for ‚Äúall‚Äù via the `markdown.marp.html` setting, this allowlist is bypassed so that all HTML elements in the user‚Äôs Markdown are embedded verbatim in the output.
    - Verify how the extension handles HTML content when `markdown.marp.html` is set to 'all', 'allowed' (default), or 'off'.
    - Check if any HTML sanitization is performed before rendering, especially if 'allowed' mode still renders some HTML elements. Investigate the "Marp Core" and "allowlist.ts" mentioned in the README to understand the default HTML handling.
    - For example, a file with the following content:
      ```markdown
      ---
      marp: true
      ---

      <script>alert('XSS');</script>
      ```
      when rendered in a trusted workspace with HTML rendering set to ‚Äúall‚Äù will trigger the execution of the script.

  - **Security test case:**
    1. In VS¬†Code (with the Marp for VS¬†Code extension installed), mark a workspace as trusted.
    2. In the user settings, set `markdown.marp.html` to ‚Äúall‚Äù.
    3. Create a Markdown file with the following content:
       ```markdown
       ---
       marp: true
       ---

       <script>alert('XSS');</script>
       ```
    4. Open the file in VS¬†Code and switch to the Marp preview.
    5. Verify that the alert (or equivalent malicious behavior) occurs, confirming that the script was executed.
    6. Repeat steps 3-5, but with `markdown.marp.html` set to the default (or 'allowed' if that's a valid option).
    7. If the alert box still appears, investigate the "selectivity HTML elements" and if they are being sanitized. If the alert does not appear in default mode, the vulnerability is mitigated to some extent by the default setting, but still exists if user explicitly sets `markdown.marp.html` to `all`.
    8. Observe if the alert box `'XSS Vulnerability!'` appears. If it does, it confirms HTML injection vulnerability when `markdown.marp.html` is set to `all`.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Path Resolution During Markdown Export

  - **Description:**
    1. When exporting a slide deck (to HTML, PDF, PPTX, or images), the extension uses a path resolution method that depends on whether the Markdown file belongs to a VS¬†Code workspace.
    2. If the file does not belong to any workspace‚Äîor if the experimental setting `markdown.marp.strictPathResolutionDuringExport` is disabled‚Äîthe export functionality resolves relative paths based on the local file system rather than strictly within the workspace.
    3. An attacker can craft a Markdown file whose image or link references use relative paths that point to sensitive local files.
    4. When a user triggers an export, the export process could inadvertently include the contents of these files into the output.

  - **Impact:**
    - This vulnerability could lead to local file disclosure. Sensitive data (for example, configuration files or other restricted documents) might be embedded into an exported slide deck, revealing information that should remain private.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - An experimental setting (`markdown.marp.strictPathResolutionDuringExport`) is available that, when enabled, forces the export command to resolve paths relative to the VS¬†Code workspace of the Markdown file.

  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - The strict path resolution feature is experimental and is not enabled by default, leaving the fallback behavior vulnerable in cases where the Markdown file is not in a workspace.
    - There is no runtime sanitization or checking to prevent a maliciously crafted relative path from referencing sensitive locations on the user‚Äôs file system.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user must run the export command on a Markdown file that is not part of a recognized workspace or in an environment where `markdown.marp.strictPathResolutionDuringExport` is disabled.
    - The Markdown file must include relative paths (for example, in image links) that reference sensitive files on the local file system.

  - **Source code analysis:**
    - According to the changelog and documentation, if a Markdown file is not tied to a workspace, the export command falls back to resolving relative paths using the local file system‚Äôs structure.
    - For instance, a Markdown file containing a line like:
      ```markdown
      ![](/etc/passwd)
      ```
      when exported without strict path resolution, the export engine may try to include the content of `/etc/passwd` into the exported slide deck.
    - This behavior relies on the underlying file resolution logic in the export module, and there is no additional filtering to block access to sensitive system files.

  - **Security test case:**
    1. Create a Markdown file with Marp front matter and include a reference to a sensitive local file (e.g., an image reference such as `![](/etc/passwd)` on a Unix-like system or a similarly sensitive file on other platforms).
    2. Ensure that the Markdown file is opened outside of any VS¬†Code workspace or that the experimental strict path resolution setting is left disabled.
    3. Trigger the export command (to PDF, HTML, etc.) using the Marp for VS¬†Code extension.
    4. Review the export output to determine if the contents of the sensitive file have been included.
    5. The successful inclusion of such content confirms the vulnerability.
