# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for typicode/json-server

## Mitigation Strategy: [Production Environment Avoidance](./mitigation_strategies/production_environment_avoidance.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Acknowledge `json-server`'s Design Purpose:** Recognize that `json-server` is explicitly designed as a *development* tool for prototyping and mocking APIs. It is *not* intended for production deployments and lacks the necessary security and performance characteristics for live applications.
    2.  **Plan for Production Backend Replacement:** From the outset of the project, include a clear plan to replace `json-server` with a production-grade backend solution (e.g., built with frameworks like Express.js, Django, Spring Boot) before deploying to any production environment.
    3.  **Execute Timely Migration:** Allocate sufficient development time and resources to build, test, and deploy the production backend *before* the application is intended to go live. This includes migrating data from `db.json` to a production database and reimplementing API endpoints with appropriate security measures.
    4.  **Prevent Production Deployment of `json-server`:**  Strictly ensure that `json-server` is *never* included in production deployment pipelines, server configurations, or container images.  This should be a non-negotiable rule for production environments.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Exposure via Unsecured API (High Severity):** `json-server` serves the entire `db.json` file without any built-in access control, making all data readily available if deployed in production and accessible.
        *   **Unrestricted Data Modification (High Severity):** `json-server` enables full CRUD operations on the `db.json` file by default, allowing anyone with network access to modify or delete data if deployed in production without additional security.
        *   **Denial of Service due to Lack of Performance Optimization (Medium to High Severity):** `json-server` is not designed for high traffic loads and can be easily overwhelmed, leading to service outages if exposed to production traffic.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in `json-server` or its Dependencies (Medium Severity):** As a development tool, security patching and vulnerability monitoring for `json-server` and its dependencies might not be as rigorous as for production-focused backend frameworks.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Exposure via Unsecured API:** High reduction - completely eliminates the risk of direct, unsecured data access via `json-server` in production.
        *   **Unrestricted Data Modification:** High reduction - eliminates the risk of unauthorized data changes through `json-server` in production.
        *   **Denial of Service due to Lack of Performance Optimization:** High reduction - removes the vulnerability to DoS attacks targeting an unoptimized `json-server` in production.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in `json-server` or its Dependencies:** Medium reduction - shifts to a production backend where security updates and vulnerability management are typically more robust.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, conceptually implemented in project planning. The project plan explicitly states `json-server` is for development purposes only and a production backend is required.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Practical implementation is missing as the production backend is not yet built. The actual migration process and ensuring `json-server` is excluded from production deployments are pending.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authentication Middleware for `json-server`](./mitigation_strategies/authentication_middleware_for__json-server_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Recognize `json-server`'s Lack of Authentication:** Understand that `json-server` provides *no* built-in authentication mechanisms. By default, *anyone* who can reach the `json-server` instance can access and manipulate the data.
    2.  **Implement Authentication Layer *Before* `json-server`:**  Use middleware (e.g., Express middleware in a Node.js environment) or a reverse proxy to introduce an authentication layer that intercepts requests *before* they are processed by `json-server`.
    3.  **Validate Authentication Credentials:** Configure the middleware to verify authentication credentials (e.g., API keys, JWT tokens) provided in request headers or cookies. This might involve checking against a predefined key, verifying token signatures, or querying an authentication service.
    4.  **Block Unauthenticated Requests to `json-server`:**  If authentication fails, the middleware must reject the request and prevent it from reaching `json-server`. Return a 401 Unauthorized HTTP status code to the client.
    5.  **Allow Authenticated Requests to Proceed to `json-server`:** Only allow requests that have successfully passed authentication to be forwarded to `json-server` for data access and manipulation.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to `json-server` Data (High Severity):** Prevents anonymous or unauthorized users from accessing the data served by `json-server`.
        *   **Data Exposure via Unauthenticated `json-server` API (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of data breaches by ensuring only authenticated clients can interact with the `json-server` API.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Modification via `json-server` (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized users from creating, updating, or deleting data managed by `json-server`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Access to `json-server` Data:** High reduction - effectively blocks access for users who cannot provide valid authentication credentials.
        *   **Data Exposure via Unauthenticated `json-server` API:** High reduction - significantly reduces data exposure risk by enforcing authentication.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Modification via `json-server`:** High reduction - prevents unauthorized data manipulation by requiring authentication.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic API key authentication middleware is implemented in `server.js` using Express middleware, checking for a valid API key in the `Authorization` header before requests reach `json-server`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** More robust authentication methods like JWT are not implemented. User management and secure API key generation/revocation are missing. The current API key is hardcoded and insecure.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authorization Middleware for `json-server`](./mitigation_strategies/authorization_middleware_for__json-server_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Acknowledge `json-server`'s Lack of Authorization:** Recognize that `json-server` itself does not provide any mechanism to control *what* authenticated users are allowed to do. By default, authenticated users have full CRUD access.
    2.  **Implement Authorization Layer *After* Authentication, *Before* `json-server`:** Use middleware (or a reverse proxy) placed *after* the authentication middleware but *before* `json-server` to enforce authorization rules.
    3.  **Define and Enforce Access Control Policies:**  Implement logic in the middleware to check if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action (e.g., read, create, update, delete) on the specific resource (e.g., endpoint in `json-server`). This can be based on user roles, resource ownership, or other authorization models.
    4.  **Block Unauthorized Actions on `json-server`:** If the authenticated user is not authorized to perform the requested action, the middleware must reject the request and prevent it from reaching `json-server`. Return a 403 Forbidden HTTP status code.
    5.  **Allow Authorized Actions to Proceed to `json-server`:** Only allow requests from authorized users to be processed by `json-server`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access by Authenticated Users (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents authenticated users from accessing data they are not supposed to see, even if they have passed authentication.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Modification by Authenticated Users (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents authenticated users from modifying data they are not authorized to change, limiting potential damage from compromised or malicious accounts.
        *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of users gaining access to more data or functionality than they should have based on their intended role.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Unauthorized Data Access by Authenticated Users:** Medium to High reduction - depends on the granularity and effectiveness of the implemented authorization rules.
        *   **Unauthorized Data Modification by Authenticated Users:** Medium to High reduction - limits the scope of potential damage from compromised or misused authenticated accounts.
        *   **Privilege Escalation:** Medium reduction - helps enforce the principle of least privilege within the application's access control system.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Currently, after basic API key authentication, any authenticated user has full access to all `json-server` endpoints and operations.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Authorization middleware needs to be developed and integrated.  Specific authorization rules and policies need to be defined and implemented based on user roles or resource access requirements. Integration with the authentication middleware to obtain user identity is also necessary.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation Middleware for `json-server` Requests](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_middleware_for__json-server__requests.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Recognize `json-server`'s Blind Data Acceptance:** Understand that `json-server` will accept and store *any* data sent to it in the `db.json` file without any inherent validation. This can lead to data integrity issues and potential vulnerabilities if invalid or malicious data is stored.
    2.  **Implement Input Validation *Before* `json-server` Processing:** Use middleware (or a reverse proxy) to intercept requests *before* they are handled by `json-server` and implement input validation logic.
    3.  **Define Validation Rules for `json-server` Endpoints:** For each endpoint and request type (POST, PUT, PATCH) in your `json-server` API, define specific validation rules for the expected request body data. This includes data types, formats, required fields, allowed values, and length constraints.
    4.  **Validate Request Data Against Defined Rules:**  In the middleware, validate the incoming request body against the defined validation rules. Use a validation library (e.g., Joi, express-validator in Node.js) to simplify this process.
    5.  **Reject Invalid Requests to `json-server`:** If the request data fails validation, the middleware must reject the request and prevent it from reaching `json-server`. Return a 400 Bad Request HTTP status code with informative error messages to the client.
    6.  **Allow Valid Requests to Proceed to `json-server`:** Only allow requests that have successfully passed input validation to be processed by `json-server`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data Integrity Issues in `db.json` (Medium Severity):** Prevents invalid or malformed data from being stored in the `db.json` file, ensuring data consistency and reliability within the mock API.
        *   **Unexpected `json-server` Behavior due to Invalid Data (Low to Medium Severity):** Prevents `json-server` from encountering unexpected errors or behaving unpredictably due to processing invalid data.
        *   **Potential Exploitation of Downstream Systems (Low Severity in direct `json-server` context, but relevant for overall application):** While `json-server` itself is not directly vulnerable to typical code injection, validating input helps prevent potentially harmful data from being stored and potentially exploited in other parts of the application that consume this data.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Integrity Issues in `db.json`:** Medium reduction - significantly reduces the risk of data corruption and inconsistencies in the mock API data.
        *   **Unexpected `json-server` Behavior due to Invalid Data:** Low to Medium reduction - improves the stability and predictability of `json-server`'s behavior.
        *   **Potential Exploitation of Downstream Systems:** Low reduction in direct `json-server` context, but medium reduction in overall application security by preventing the storage of potentially harmful data.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Basic client-side validation is implemented in the frontend application for some input fields, but this is easily bypassed.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Server-side input validation middleware is completely missing. No validation is performed on the backend before data is stored in `db.json` by `json-server`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting Middleware for `json-server`](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_middleware_for__json-server_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Recognize `json-server`'s Lack of DoS Protection:** Understand that `json-server` is not designed to handle high request volumes and is vulnerable to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks if exposed to excessive traffic.
    2.  **Implement Rate Limiting *Before* `json-server`:** Use middleware (or a reverse proxy) to implement rate limiting that intercepts requests *before* they reach `json-server`.
    3.  **Configure Rate Limits for `json-server` API:** Define appropriate rate limits for the `json-server` API based on the expected usage and the resource capacity of the server running `json-server`. Rate limits can be based on requests per minute, per second, or other timeframes, and can be applied per IP address or per authenticated user.
    4.  **Enforce Rate Limits in Middleware:** Configure the rate limiting middleware to track request counts and reject requests that exceed the defined limits.
    5.  **Handle Rate-Limited Requests:** When a request is rate-limited, the middleware should return a 429 Too Many Requests HTTP status code to the client, indicating that they have exceeded the allowed request rate and should retry later.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting `json-server` (Medium Severity):** Mitigates simple DoS attacks by limiting the number of requests from a single source, preventing resource exhaustion and service unavailability of the `json-server` instance.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion of `json-server` Server (Medium Severity):** Prevents excessive request loads from overwhelming the server running `json-server`, ensuring it remains responsive for legitimate users and development tasks.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Low to Medium Severity - if authentication is added):** Can help slow down brute-force attempts against authentication endpoints (if authentication is implemented in conjunction with `json-server`), making them less effective.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks Targeting `json-server`:** Medium reduction - reduces the impact of basic DoS attacks, making `json-server` more resilient to accidental or intentional traffic spikes.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion of `json-server` Server:** Medium reduction - helps prevent server overload and maintain the availability of `json-server` for development purposes.
        *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Low to Medium reduction - can make brute-force attempts less efficient, providing a degree of protection if authentication is in place.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. No rate limiting is currently in place for `json-server` requests.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting middleware needs to be implemented and configured. Appropriate rate limits need to be determined and applied to protect the `json-server` instance from excessive traffic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [HTTPS Termination via Reverse Proxy for `json-server`](./mitigation_strategies/https_termination_via_reverse_proxy_for__json-server_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Recognize `json-server`'s Lack of HTTPS Support:** Understand that `json-server` itself does *not* directly handle HTTPS (SSL/TLS) encryption. It serves content over unencrypted HTTP by default.
    2.  **Deploy a Reverse Proxy in Front of `json-server`:** Use a reverse proxy server (e.g., Nginx, Apache, Caddy) to sit in front of the `json-server` instance.
    3.  **Configure HTTPS on the Reverse Proxy:** Configure the reverse proxy to handle HTTPS termination. This involves obtaining and installing SSL/TLS certificates for your domain or hostname on the reverse proxy.
    4.  **Proxy Requests to `json-server` over HTTP:** Configure the reverse proxy to forward incoming HTTPS requests to the `json-server` instance over plain HTTP (since `json-server` itself will be running on HTTP). The reverse proxy handles the encryption and decryption, while `json-server` operates as a backend service.
    5.  **Ensure Secure Communication between Proxy and `json-server` (Optional but Recommended for sensitive environments):** While the connection between the reverse proxy and `json-server` can be HTTP (especially if they are on the same secure network), consider using HTTPS or mutual TLS for this internal communication in highly sensitive environments to further enhance security.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Data in Transit Exposure (High Severity):** Prevents sensitive data (including authentication credentials, API keys, or application data) from being transmitted over the network in unencrypted form when accessing `json-server`.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Protects against Man-in-the-Middle attacks where attackers could intercept and eavesdrop on or manipulate communication between clients and `json-server`.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data in Transit Exposure:** High reduction - encrypts all communication between clients and the reverse proxy, protecting data in transit.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** High reduction - makes it significantly more difficult for attackers to intercept and tamper with communication.

    *   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. `json-server` is currently accessed over HTTP directly without HTTPS encryption.

    *   **Missing Implementation:** A reverse proxy (like Nginx) needs to be deployed and configured in front of `json-server` to handle HTTPS termination. SSL/TLS certificates need to be obtained and configured on the reverse proxy.
