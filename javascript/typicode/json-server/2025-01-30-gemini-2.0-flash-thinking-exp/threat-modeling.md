# Threat Model Analysis for typicode/json-server

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Data Modification](./threats/unauthenticated_data_modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker, or any unauthorized user, can send HTTP requests (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) directly to the `json-server` API endpoints to create, update, or delete data in the JSON file. This is possible because `json-server` has no built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms. An attacker might maliciously alter application data, delete critical records, or inject harmful data.

**Impact:** Data corruption, data loss, unauthorized modification of application state, potential application malfunction, reputational damage if data integrity is compromised.

**Affected Component:**  `json-server` core routing and data handling logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid exposing `json-server` to untrusted networks or users.** Use it only in isolated development environments.
*   Implement a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) in front of `json-server` and enforce authentication and authorization at the proxy level.
*   Restrict network access to the `json-server` instance using firewalls or network segmentation.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Data Access](./threats/unauthenticated_data_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker, or any unauthorized user, can send HTTP GET requests to `json-server` API endpoints to read all data stored in the JSON file.  Due to the lack of authentication, anyone who can reach the `json-server` instance can access all data. An attacker might steal sensitive information, user data, or confidential application details if stored in the JSON file.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, privacy violation, potential misuse of exposed data, reputational damage, regulatory non-compliance if sensitive data is exposed.

**Affected Component:** `json-server` core routing and data handling logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Do not store sensitive or confidential data in the JSON file used by `json-server`, especially if it is accessible outside of a completely trusted development environment.** Use dummy or anonymized data instead.
*   Restrict network access to the `json-server` instance to only trusted networks and users. Use firewalls or network segmentation.
*   Implement a reverse proxy with authentication and authorization to control access to the `json-server` API.

## Threat: [Misconfiguration - Running in Production](./threats/misconfiguration_-_running_in_production.md)

**Description:**  The most critical misconfiguration is deploying and running `json-server` in a production environment.  `json-server` is explicitly designed for development and prototyping and lacks essential security, performance, and scalability features required for production. This exposes the application to all the aforementioned threats at a much higher risk level.

**Impact:**  Severe security vulnerabilities, data breaches, data loss, application downtime, complete system compromise, significant reputational and financial damage, regulatory penalties.

**Affected Component:** Entire `json-server` instance and the application relying on it.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Absolutely avoid using `json-server` in production environments.**
*   Clearly document and communicate that `json-server` is for development and prototyping only.
*   Implement infrastructure and deployment processes that strictly prevent accidental or intentional deployment of `json-server` to production. Use proper production-grade backend technologies instead.
