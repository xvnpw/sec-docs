# Threat Model Analysis for typicode/json-server

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Data Access](./threats/unauthenticated_data_access.md)

**Threat:** Unauthenticated Data Access

**Description:** An attacker can send GET requests to any of the API endpoints exposed by `json-server` to retrieve all data stored in the underlying JSON file. They can enumerate resources and access sensitive information without any authentication.

**Impact:** Confidential data is exposed to unauthorized individuals, potentially leading to privacy breaches, identity theft, or misuse of sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Avoid using `json-server` directly in production environments.**
- If used for development, ensure it's behind a secure network and not accessible from the public internet.
- Implement a proper authentication and authorization layer *in front of* `json-server` using a reverse proxy or API gateway.
- Do not store sensitive or production data in the `json-server`'s data file.

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Data Modification](./threats/unauthenticated_data_modification.md)

**Threat:** Unauthenticated Data Modification

**Description:** An attacker can send POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests to the API endpoints to create, update, or delete data in the JSON file. They can manipulate data arbitrarily without any authentication.

**Impact:** Data integrity is compromised. Attackers can corrupt, modify, or delete critical data, leading to application malfunctions, incorrect information, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- **Never use `json-server` directly in production environments where data integrity is important.**
- If used for development, restrict access to trusted users and networks.
- Implement a secure API gateway or proxy that handles authentication and authorization before requests reach `json-server`.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization on any system interacting with the `json-server` data.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion

**Description:** An attacker can send a large number of requests to the `json-server` instance, potentially overwhelming its limited resources (CPU, memory, network connections). This can make the server unresponsive and unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** The application relying on `json-server` becomes unavailable, disrupting services and potentially causing financial or reputational damage.

**Risk Severity:** Medium (While listed as medium previously, the direct impact on the `json-server` service itself can be considered high in certain contexts, especially if it's a critical component in a development or testing pipeline. However, its inherent limitations keep it from being a *critical* production risk if best practices are followed.)

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities

**Description:** `json-server` relies on other Node.js packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could be exploited by attackers if not properly managed.

**Impact:**  Various security issues depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability, ranging from information disclosure to remote code execution on the server running `json-server`.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regularly update `json-server` and its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address dependency vulnerabilities.
- Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
