### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Modify Data Without Authorization

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Send Malicious PUT/POST/DELETE Requests

This attack vector leverages the fundamental functionality of RESTful APIs, specifically the HTTP methods used for data manipulation:

*   **PUT:** Used to update an existing resource.
*   **POST:** Used to create a new resource.
*   **DELETE:** Used to remove a resource.

The core issue is that `json-server`, by default, does not implement any form of authentication or authorization. This means that anyone who can reach the server hosting the `json-server` instance can send these requests without proving their identity or having the necessary permissions.

#### 4.2. How the Attack Works

The attack is remarkably straightforward:

1. **Identify the Target Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the endpoint corresponding to the data they want to manipulate. `json-server` automatically creates RESTful endpoints based on the keys in the `db.json` file (e.g., `/posts`, `/comments`).
2. **Craft the Malicious Request:** Using tools like `curl`, `Postman`, or even browser developer tools, the attacker constructs an HTTP request with the appropriate method (PUT, POST, or DELETE) and payload.
    *   **PUT Example (Modifying data):**
        ```bash
        curl -X PUT -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"id": 1, "title": "Maliciously Updated Title", "author": "Attacker"}' http://<server-ip>:<port>/posts/1
        ```
    *   **POST Example (Creating data):**
        ```bash
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"title": "New Malicious Post", "author": "Attacker"}' http://<server-ip>:<port>/posts
        ```
    *   **DELETE Example (Deleting data):**
        ```bash
        curl -X DELETE http://<server-ip>:<port>/posts/1
        ```
3. **Send the Request:** The attacker sends the crafted request to the `json-server` instance.
4. **Data Modification:**  Due to the lack of authentication, `json-server` processes the request and directly modifies the `db.json` file accordingly.

#### 4.3. Likelihood: High - Trivial to Execute

The likelihood of this attack is **high** because it requires minimal effort and technical skill. The necessary tools are readily available, and the process is well-documented and easily understood. The absence of any security measures makes it a trivial task for an attacker.

#### 4.4. Impact: High - Data Manipulation, Corruption, or Deletion

The impact of this attack is **high** due to the potential for significant damage:

*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers can alter existing data, leading to misinformation, incorrect application behavior, and potentially financial losses or reputational damage.
*   **Data Corruption:**  Maliciously crafted data can corrupt the `db.json` file, making the application unusable or leading to data loss.
*   **Data Deletion:** Attackers can delete critical data, causing significant disruption and potentially requiring restoration from backups.

The severity of the impact depends on the sensitivity and importance of the data stored in the `db.json` file.

#### 4.5. Effort: Low - Requires Basic HTTP Tools

The effort required to execute this attack is **low**. Attackers can use readily available tools like `curl`, `wget`, browser developer tools, or dedicated API testing clients like Postman. No specialized skills or complex tools are necessary.

#### 4.6. Skill Level: Low - Basic Understanding of HTTP

The skill level required to perform this attack is **low**. A basic understanding of HTTP methods (PUT, POST, DELETE) and how to construct HTTP requests is sufficient. No advanced programming or hacking skills are needed.

#### 4.7. Detection Difficulty: Medium - Depends on Monitoring of Write Operations

The detection difficulty is **medium**. While the attack itself is simple, detecting it relies on monitoring write operations to the `db.json` file or observing unusual API requests.

*   **Challenges in Detection:**
    *   **Legitimate Updates:** Distinguishing malicious updates from legitimate ones can be challenging without proper logging and auditing.
    *   **Low Volume Attacks:**  Small, targeted modifications might go unnoticed in high-traffic environments.
    *   **Lack of Built-in Monitoring:** `json-server` itself doesn't provide extensive built-in monitoring or alerting capabilities.

*   **Potential Detection Methods:**
    *   **File System Monitoring:** Monitoring changes to the `db.json` file can reveal unauthorized modifications.
    *   **API Request Logging:**  Analyzing API request logs for unusual patterns, such as PUT/POST/DELETE requests from unexpected sources or with suspicious payloads.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implementing systems that can detect deviations from normal API usage patterns.

#### 4.8. Underlying Vulnerability

The fundamental vulnerability enabling this attack is the **absence of authentication and authorization mechanisms** in the default configuration of `json-server`. This allows any unauthenticated user to perform actions that should be restricted to authorized users.

#### 4.9. Potential Consequences

The successful exploitation of this attack path can lead to various negative consequences:

*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive data could be modified or deleted, potentially leading to regulatory fines and reputational damage.
*   **Service Disruption:**  Data corruption or deletion can render the application unusable, causing service outages.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Incorrect data could lead to financial errors or fraudulent activities.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  Security breaches can erode user trust and damage the organization's reputation.
*   **Legal Ramifications:** Depending on the nature of the data and the applicable regulations, unauthorized data modification can have legal consequences.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk associated with this attack path, the following strategies are recommended:

*   **Implement Authentication:**  The most crucial step is to implement an authentication mechanism to verify the identity of users making requests. This could involve:
    *   **Basic Authentication:**  Simple username/password authentication.
    *   **Token-Based Authentication (e.g., JWT):**  Using tokens to authenticate requests.
    *   **OAuth 2.0:**  A more robust framework for authorization.
*   **Implement Authorization:**  Once users are authenticated, implement authorization rules to control what actions they are permitted to perform. This ensures that even authenticated users can only modify data they are authorized to access.
*   **Use `json-server` with a Proxy:**  Deploy `json-server` behind a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) that can handle authentication and authorization. This allows leveraging the security features of the proxy server.
*   **Consider Alternatives for Production:**  `json-server` is primarily intended for prototyping and development. For production environments, consider using a more robust database and backend framework with built-in security features.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address within a given timeframe. This can help mitigate brute-force attacks or prevent attackers from making rapid, large-scale modifications.
*   **Input Validation:**  While not directly preventing unauthorized access, implementing input validation can help prevent data corruption by ensuring that only valid data is accepted.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious API activity, such as unauthorized PUT/POST/DELETE requests.

### 6. Conclusion

The "Modify Data Without Authorization" attack path poses a significant risk to applications using `json-server` without proper security measures. The ease of execution and potentially high impact necessitate immediate attention and the implementation of appropriate mitigation strategies. Prioritizing the implementation of authentication and authorization is crucial to securing the application and protecting its data. While `json-server` is a useful tool for development, its default lack of security features makes it unsuitable for production environments without significant security enhancements.
