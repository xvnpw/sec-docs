# Explanation:
# 1. This Nginx configuration sets up a reverse proxy.
# 2. It enables Basic Authentication, requiring users to provide a username and password.
# 3. The `auth_basic_user_file` directive points to a file containing user credentials (created using the `htpasswd` utility).
# 4. All requests to the server are proxied to the json-server instance running on `http://localhost:3000`.

# Key Takeaways for the Development Team:

# 1. Never deploy json-server directly to a public-facing production environment without implementing robust security measures.
# 2. Understand the inherent limitations of json-server regarding security.
# 3. Prioritize security by design when choosing tools and architectures for production applications.
# 4. Implement mitigation strategies like reverse proxies with authentication or custom authentication middleware if json-server must be used in a less restricted environment.
# 5. Regularly review and update security configurations and dependencies.
