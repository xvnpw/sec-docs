# Threat Model Analysis for typicode/json-server

## Threat: [Unauthenticated Data Access](./threats/unauthenticated_data_access.md)

**Description:** An attacker could directly access the data served by `json-server` by sending HTTP GET requests to the automatically generated API endpoints. They could enumerate resources and retrieve potentially sensitive information without any authentication required.

**Impact:** Confidential information stored in the `db.json` file or other served JSON files could be exposed to unauthorized individuals or systems. This could lead to data breaches, privacy violations, or misuse of sensitive data.

**Affected Component:** Routing mechanism, data serving functionality.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict `json-server` usage to isolated development and testing environments.
*   Ensure the server is not accessible from public networks.
*   Use a reverse proxy with authentication in front of `json-server` if external access is absolutely necessary (highly discouraged).
*   Avoid storing sensitive or production data in the `db.json` file used with `json-server`.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Modification](./threats/unauthorized_data_modification.md)

**Description:** An attacker could use HTTP POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests to create, update, or delete data managed by `json-server`. This is possible because `json-server` does not enforce any authorization rules by default.

**Impact:**  The attacker could corrupt or delete critical data, manipulate application state, or inject malicious data into the system. This can lead to application malfunctions, data loss, or security vulnerabilities in consuming applications.

**Affected Component:** API endpoints handling POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE requests, data persistence mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict `json-server` usage to isolated development and testing environments.
*   Ensure the server is not accessible from public networks.
*   If write operations are not needed, ensure the environment or proxy configuration prevents these methods.
*   Use a reverse proxy with authorization rules to control access to modification endpoints if absolutely necessary (highly discouraged).
*   Implement proper data validation and sanitization in the consuming application to mitigate the impact of potentially malicious data.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS)](./threats/denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could flood the `json-server` instance with a large number of requests, exhausting its resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) and making it unresponsive to legitimate requests.

**Impact:** The application relying on `json-server` would become unavailable, disrupting development or testing processes.

**Affected Component:** Request handling mechanism, server resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict `json-server` usage to isolated development and testing environments.
*   Implement rate limiting at the network level or using a reverse proxy.
*   Ensure the server has sufficient resources to handle expected load (though `json-server` is not designed for high load).

## Threat: [Security Misconfiguration - Running in Production](./threats/security_misconfiguration_-_running_in_production.md)

**Description:** A developer might mistakenly deploy or run a `json-server` instance in a production environment. This exposes the application's data and modification capabilities without any security controls.

**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application's data and potential for unauthorized manipulation, leading to significant security breaches and data loss.

**Affected Component:** Entire `json-server` instance and its environment.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Clearly document and enforce policies against using `json-server` in production environments.
*   Implement infrastructure as code (IaC) and configuration management to prevent accidental deployment of development tools to production.
*   Use environment variables or configuration files to differentiate between development and production environments and prevent `json-server` from being initialized in production.

## Threat: [Security Misconfiguration - Publicly Accessible Server](./threats/security_misconfiguration_-_publicly_accessible_server.md)

**Description:** The `json-server` instance is configured to listen on a public IP address or is accessible through open ports on a firewall, making it reachable from the internet.

**Impact:** Exposes the application to all the threats mentioned above (unauthenticated access, unauthorized modification, DoS) from any attacker on the internet.

**Affected Component:** Server binding configuration, network configuration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure `json-server` is only bound to localhost (127.0.0.1) or internal network addresses.
*   Configure firewalls to block external access to the port `json-server` is running on.
*   Use network segmentation to isolate the development environment.
