## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.b. Modify Data via Default Routes

### 2.1. Vulnerability Explanation

`json-server` is designed for rapid prototyping and mocking REST APIs.  By default, it provides full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on any JSON data file without requiring any authentication or authorization.  This "feature" is the core of the vulnerability.

The default routes (e.g., `/posts`, `/comments`) correspond directly to the top-level keys in the `db.json` file.  When `json-server` receives a POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE request to one of these routes, it directly modifies the `db.json` file accordingly, *without any checks for user permissions or identity*.

This lack of access control means that anyone with network access to the `json-server` instance can:

*   **POST:** Create new resources (e.g., add new posts, comments, users).
*   **PUT:** Replace an entire existing resource.
*   **PATCH:** Partially update an existing resource.
*   **DELETE:** Remove a resource.

The vulnerability stems from the inherent design philosophy of `json-server` prioritizing ease of use and rapid prototyping over security.  It's crucial to understand that `json-server` is *not* intended for production use without significant security hardening.

### 2.2. Exploit Scenario Walkthrough

Let's assume a `db.json` file like this:

```json
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "title": "My First Post", "content": "Hello, world!" }
  ],
  "comments": [
    { "id": 1, "postId": 1, "body": "Great post!" }
  ]
}
```

And the `json-server` is running on `http://localhost:3000`.

**Scenario 1: Data Deletion (DELETE)**

1.  **Attacker's Request:** The attacker sends a DELETE request to `/posts/1`:

    ```http
    DELETE /posts/1 HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:3000
    ```

2.  **Server Response:** `json-server` deletes the post with `id: 1` from `db.json`.  The server likely responds with a `200 OK` status code and an empty body (or possibly `{}`).

3.  **Result:** The `db.json` file is now:

    ```json
    {
      "posts": [],
      "comments": [
        { "id": 1, "postId": 1, "body": "Great post!" }
      ]
    }
    ```
    The first post is gone.  The comment now refers to a non-existent post (a dangling reference).

**Scenario 2: Data Creation (POST)**

1.  **Attacker's Request:** The attacker sends a POST request to `/posts` with malicious data:

    ```http
    POST /posts HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:3000
    Content-Type: application/json

    { "id": 2, "title": "Malicious Post", "content": "<script>alert('XSS');</script>" }
    ```

2.  **Server Response:** `json-server` adds the new post to `db.json`.  The server likely responds with a `201 Created` status code and the newly created resource in the body.

3.  **Result:** The `db.json` file now includes the malicious post.  While this example shows a potential XSS payload (which is *outside* the scope of this specific attack path), it demonstrates the ability to inject arbitrary data.

**Scenario 3: Data Modification (PUT/PATCH)**

1.  **Attacker's Request (PUT):**  The attacker sends a PUT request to `/posts/1` to replace the entire post:

    ```http
    PUT /posts/1 HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:3000
    Content-Type: application/json

    { "id": 1, "title": "Compromised Post", "content": "All your data are belong to us." }
    ```

2.  **Server Response:** `json-server` replaces the existing post with `id: 1` with the attacker's data.  The server likely responds with a `200 OK` status code and the updated resource.

3. **Attacker's Request (PATCH):** The attacker sends a PATCH request to `/posts/1` to modify part of post:
    ```http
    PATCH /posts/1 HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost:3000
    Content-Type: application/json

    { "content": "All your data are belong to us." }
    ```
2.  **Server Response:** `json-server` updates the existing post with `id: 1` with the attacker's data.  The server likely responds with a `200 OK` status code and the updated resource.

### 2.3. Impact Assessment

The impact of this vulnerability is **high** due to the following:

*   **Data Integrity Violation:** Attackers can corrupt, delete, or inject arbitrary data, rendering the application's data unreliable.
*   **Data Confidentiality Breach (Indirect):** While this attack path doesn't directly expose data, it can be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities (e.g., reading the modified `db.json` file directly if exposed) to compromise confidentiality.
*   **Availability Degradation:** Deleting critical data or injecting malicious data can disrupt the application's functionality, leading to denial of service.
*   **Reputational Damage:** Data breaches and service disruptions can severely damage the reputation of the organization.
*   **Legal and Financial Consequences:** Depending on the nature of the data, breaches can lead to legal penalties and financial losses.

### 2.4. Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are crucial to secure a `json-server` application:

1.  **Implement Authentication:**
    *   **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):**  A common and robust approach.  Use a middleware (e.g., `express-jwt`) to verify JWTs sent in the `Authorization` header of each request.  `json-server` itself doesn't provide built-in JWT support, so you'll need to use it in conjunction with a framework like Express.js.
    *   **API Keys:**  A simpler approach, but less secure than JWT.  Each client is assigned a unique API key, which must be included in requests.
    *   **Basic Authentication:**  Generally not recommended for production due to security concerns (credentials are sent in plain text unless HTTPS is used).

2.  **Implement Authorization:**
    *   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Define roles (e.g., "admin," "user," "guest") and assign permissions to each role.  Middleware should check if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action (e.g., only admins can delete posts).
    *   **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):**  More granular than RBAC, allowing access control based on attributes of the user, resource, and environment.

3.  **Use a Custom Router (Express.js):**  The recommended approach is to *not* directly expose `json-server`'s default routes.  Instead, use a framework like Express.js to create a custom router that sits in front of `json-server`.  This allows you to:
    *   Implement authentication and authorization middleware.
    *   Validate request bodies and parameters.
    *   Control which routes are exposed and how they behave.
    *   Proxy requests to `json-server` *only after* authentication and authorization checks have passed.

    **Example (Express.js with JWT and RBAC):**

    ```javascript
    const express = require('express');
    const jsonServer = require('json-server');
    const jwt = require('express-jwt');
    const jwksRsa = require('jwks-rsa');

    const app = express();

    // Authentication middleware (JWT)
    const checkJwt = jwt({
      secret: jwksRsa.expressJwtSecret({
        cache: true,
        rateLimit: true,
        jwksRequestsPerMinute: 5,
        jwksUri: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/.well-known/jwks.json` // Replace with your Auth0 domain
      }),
      audience: 'YOUR_API_IDENTIFIER', // Replace with your API identifier
      issuer: `https://YOUR_AUTH0_DOMAIN/`, // Replace with your Auth0 domain
      algorithms: ['RS256']
    });

    // Authorization middleware (RBAC)
    function checkRole(role) {
      return (req, res, next) => {
        // Assuming user roles are stored in req.user.roles after JWT verification
        if (req.user && req.user.roles && req.user.roles.includes(role)) {
          next();
        } else {
          res.status(403).json({ message: 'Forbidden' });
        }
      };
    }

    // json-server router (used internally)
    const router = jsonServer.router('db.json');

    // Protected routes
    app.use('/api/posts', checkJwt, checkRole('admin'), router); // Only admins can access /api/posts
    //Other routes with different roles

    // Start the server
    app.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('JSON Server with authentication and authorization is running');
    });

    ```

4.  **Input Validation:**  Even with authentication and authorization, always validate the data received in request bodies (POST, PUT, PATCH).  Use a validation library (e.g., `joi`, `express-validator`) to ensure that the data conforms to the expected schema and prevent malicious input.

5.  **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service attempts.  Use a middleware like `express-rate-limit`.

6.  **Do Not Use `json-server` in Production (Without Hardening):**  This is the most important recommendation.  `json-server` is not designed for production environments without significant security measures.  Consider using a more robust backend solution (e.g., a real database with a proper API framework) for production deployments.

### 2.5. Detection Methods

Detecting attempts to exploit this vulnerability requires monitoring and analysis of server logs and network traffic:

1.  **HTTP Request Logging:**
    *   Configure your web server (or `json-server` if used directly, though not recommended) to log all HTTP requests, including:
        *   Timestamp
        *   Client IP address
        *   HTTP method (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
        *   Request URL
        *   Request body (if possible and safe – be mindful of sensitive data)
        *   Response status code
        *   User-Agent
    *   Regularly analyze these logs for suspicious patterns, such as:
        *   A high frequency of POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE requests from a single IP address.
        *   Requests to unusual or unexpected resource paths.
        *   Requests with unusual or malformed request bodies.
        *   Failed authentication attempts (if authentication is implemented).

2.  **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):**
    *   Deploy an IDS (e.g., Snort, Suricata) to monitor network traffic for malicious patterns.
    *   Configure IDS rules to detect:
        *   Unauthorized access attempts to `json-server`'s default routes.
        *   Requests with known malicious payloads.
        *   Anomalous network traffic patterns.

3.  **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**
    *   A WAF can help block malicious requests before they reach the `json-server` instance.
    *   Configure WAF rules to:
        *   Block requests to `json-server`'s default routes without proper authentication tokens.
        *   Filter out requests with known malicious payloads.
        *   Enforce rate limiting.

4.  **Audit Trails:**
    *   Implement audit trails to track all changes made to the data.  This can help identify unauthorized modifications and track down the source of the attack.  This is best implemented at the application level (e.g., within your Express.js middleware).

5.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application's security posture.

### 2.6. Testing and Verification

After implementing the mitigation strategies, it's crucial to test their effectiveness:

1.  **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for your authentication and authorization middleware to ensure they function correctly.
2.  **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire API endpoint (including authentication, authorization, and data modification) to ensure that unauthorized requests are blocked and authorized requests are processed correctly.
3.  **Penetration Testing:**  Simulate real-world attacks to test the application's resilience to unauthorized data modification.  This should include attempts to bypass authentication and authorization mechanisms.
4.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use vulnerability scanners to identify potential weaknesses in the application and its dependencies.
5. **Test all HTTP methods:** Try to use all HTTP methods (POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) with and without authentication.

By following these steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized data modification in your `json-server` application and ensure its security. Remember that security is an ongoing process, and continuous monitoring and improvement are essential.
