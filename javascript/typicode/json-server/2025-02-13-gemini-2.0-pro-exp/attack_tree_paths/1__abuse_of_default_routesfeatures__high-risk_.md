# Deep Analysis: Abuse of Default Routes/Features in `json-server`

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly investigate the "Abuse of Default Routes/Features" attack path within the context of an application utilizing `json-server`.  We will identify specific vulnerabilities arising from default configurations, assess their impact, and propose concrete mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide the development team with actionable recommendations to harden the application against this class of attacks.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the vulnerabilities exposed by `json-server`'s default behavior and configurations.  It *does not* cover:

*   Vulnerabilities in the client-side application consuming the `json-server` API (e.g., XSS, CSRF in the frontend).
*   Vulnerabilities in the underlying operating system or network infrastructure.
*   Vulnerabilities introduced by custom middleware or routes *added* to the `json-server` instance, *unless* those additions interact poorly with the defaults.
*   Attacks that do not leverage the default routes or features (e.g., a sophisticated SQL injection attack if `json-server` were somehow connected to a real SQL database â€“ which is not its intended use).
* Authentication bypass, if authentication was implemented.

The scope is specifically limited to the out-of-the-box, default behavior of `json-server`.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Default Behavior Review:**  We will examine the `json-server` documentation and source code (if necessary) to precisely understand its default behavior, including:
    *   Default routes created.
    *   Default HTTP methods allowed on those routes.
    *   Default data access permissions (read, write, create, delete).
    *   Default headers and security-related settings.
2.  **Vulnerability Identification:** Based on the default behavior, we will identify specific vulnerabilities that an attacker could exploit.  This will involve "thinking like an attacker" and considering various attack scenarios.
3.  **Impact Assessment:** For each identified vulnerability, we will assess its potential impact on the application and its data.  This includes considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad).
4.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  We will propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies to address each vulnerability.  These recommendations will prioritize practical solutions that can be readily implemented by the development team.  We will consider both configuration changes and, if necessary, code-level modifications.
5.  **Testing Recommendations:** We will suggest testing strategies to verify the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Abuse of Default Routes/Features

**4.1 Default Behavior Review**

`json-server`, by default, exhibits the following behavior:

*   **Full CRUD Operations:**  It creates RESTful endpoints for every key in the provided JSON file (or the `db.json` file if none is specified).  These endpoints support all standard HTTP methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE`.  This means, by default, *anyone* can read, create, update, and delete data.
*   **No Authentication/Authorization:**  There is no built-in authentication or authorization mechanism.  All requests are treated equally, regardless of origin or user identity.
*   **Default Port (3000):**  It listens on port 3000 by default.  This is a well-known port, making it easy for attackers to discover the server.
*   **Relationships:** It automatically handles relationships defined in the JSON data (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many).
*   **Filtering, Pagination, and Sorting:**  It provides query parameters for filtering (`_q`, field-specific filters), pagination (`_page`, `_limit`), and sorting (`_sort`, `_order`).
*   **Operators:** It supports operators like `_gte`, `_lte`, `_ne`, `_like` for more complex filtering.
*   **Static file serving:** It can serve static files from a `./public` directory.
* **No input validation:** It does not perform any input validation.

**4.2 Vulnerability Identification**

Based on the default behavior, the following vulnerabilities are present:

1.  **Unauthenticated Data Modification:**  An attacker can send `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, or `DELETE` requests to any endpoint to create, modify, or delete data without any authentication.  This is the most critical vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**  If the `db.json` contains a `users` resource, an attacker could send a `DELETE /users/1` request to delete the user with ID 1.  They could also send a `POST /users` request with arbitrary data to create a new user, potentially with elevated privileges if the application logic relies on user data for authorization.
2.  **Unauthenticated Data Disclosure:**  An attacker can send `GET` requests to any endpoint to retrieve all data.  This exposes potentially sensitive information.
    *   **Example:**  An attacker could send a `GET /users` request to retrieve all user data, including potentially sensitive information like email addresses, passwords (if stored insecurely), or other personal details.
3.  **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Payloads:**  An attacker could send a `POST` or `PUT` request with a very large payload to consume server resources and potentially cause a denial of service.  `json-server` doesn't have built-in request size limits.
4.  **DoS via Resource Exhaustion (Filtering/Pagination):** An attacker could craft requests with complex filters or manipulate pagination parameters to force the server to perform expensive operations, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.  For example, using `_like` with a wildcard on a large dataset.
5.  **Information Disclosure via Static Files:** If sensitive files are accidentally placed in the `./public` directory, an attacker could access them directly via their URL.
6. **No Rate Limiting:** An attacker can send a large number of requests in a short period, potentially overwhelming the server or triggering other vulnerabilities.

**4.3 Impact Assessment**

| Vulnerability                               | Confidentiality | Integrity | Availability | Overall Impact |
| :------------------------------------------ | :-------------- | :-------- | :----------- | :------------- |
| Unauthenticated Data Modification           | Low             | High      | Medium       | **Critical**   |
| Unauthenticated Data Disclosure             | High            | Low       | Low          | **High**       |
| DoS via Large Payloads                      | Low             | Low       | High         | **High**       |
| DoS via Resource Exhaustion (Filtering)     | Low             | Low       | High         | **High**       |
| Information Disclosure via Static Files     | High            | Low       | Low          | **High**       |
| No Rate Limiting                            | Low             | Low       | High         | **High**       |

*   **Critical:**  Complete data compromise and potential system takeover.
*   **High:**  Significant data breach or service disruption.
*   **Medium:**  Partial data breach or temporary service disruption.
*   **Low:**  Minor inconvenience or limited information disclosure.

**4.4 Mitigation Recommendations**

1.  **Disable Unnecessary Methods:**  If the application only needs to read data, disable `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` methods.  This can be done using middleware:

    ```javascript
    // server.js
    const jsonServer = require('json-server');
    const server = jsonServer.create();
    const router = jsonServer.router('db.json');
    const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults();

    server.use(middlewares);

    // Disable write operations
    server.use((req, res, next) => {
      if (['POST', 'PUT', 'PATCH', 'DELETE'].includes(req.method)) {
        res.sendStatus(403); // Forbidden
      } else {
        next();
      }
    });

    server.use(router);
    server.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('JSON Server is running');
    });
    ```

2.  **Implement Authentication and Authorization:**  `json-server` itself does *not* provide authentication.  You *must* implement this using middleware or a separate authentication service.  Consider using libraries like `jsonwebtoken` (JWT) for token-based authentication.  Authorization should be implemented to restrict access to specific resources based on user roles or permissions.

3.  **Limit Request Size:**  Use middleware to limit the size of incoming requests to prevent DoS attacks via large payloads.  The `body-parser` middleware (which `json-server` uses) can be configured for this:

    ```javascript
    const jsonServer = require('json-server');
    const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
    const server = jsonServer.create();
    const router = jsonServer.router('db.json');
    const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults();

    // Limit request body size to 1MB
    server.use(bodyParser.json({ limit: '1mb' }));
    server.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ limit: '1mb', extended: true }));
    server.use(middlewares);

    server.use(router);
    server.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('JSON Server is running');
    });
    ```

4.  **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Use middleware like `express-rate-limit` to limit the number of requests from a single IP address within a given time window. This prevents DoS and brute-force attacks.

    ```javascript
    const jsonServer = require('json-server');
    const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');
    const server = jsonServer.create();
    const router = jsonServer.router('db.json');
    const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults();

    // Rate limiting: Allow 100 requests per 15 minutes
    const limiter = rateLimit({
      windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
      max: 100, // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
    });
    server.use(limiter);
    server.use(middlewares);

    server.use(router);
    server.listen(3000, () => {
      console.log('JSON Server is running');
    });
    ```

5.  **Secure the `./public` Directory:**  Ensure that no sensitive files are placed in the `./public` directory.  If you don't need to serve static files, remove or rename this directory.

6.  **Change the Default Port:**  Change the default port (3000) to a less common port to make it harder for attackers to discover the server.

7. **Input validation:** Implement input validation using custom middleware.

8. **Disable unused features:** Disable unused features like filtering, sorting, pagination if they are not used.

**4.5 Testing Recommendations**

1.  **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Attempt to perform the attacks described in the "Vulnerability Identification" section.  Try to read, modify, and delete data without authentication.  Try to send large payloads and trigger DoS conditions.
2.  **Automated Security Scanning:**  Use automated security scanning tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to scan the application for vulnerabilities.  These tools can help identify common security issues.
3.  **Unit and Integration Tests:**  Write unit and integration tests to verify that the implemented mitigations (authentication, authorization, rate limiting, etc.) are working correctly.
4.  **Load Testing:**  Perform load testing to ensure that the server can handle the expected traffic load and that rate limiting is effective.

## 5. Conclusion

The default configuration of `json-server` presents significant security risks.  By understanding these risks and implementing the recommended mitigations, the development team can significantly improve the security posture of the application.  Regular security testing and ongoing monitoring are crucial to ensure that the application remains secure over time.  It's important to remember that `json-server` is primarily designed for prototyping and development, and using it in a production environment without significant security hardening is highly discouraged. If a production environment is required, consider using a more robust and secure backend solution.
