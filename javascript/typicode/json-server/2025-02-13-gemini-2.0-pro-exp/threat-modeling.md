# Threat Model Analysis for typicode/json-server

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Access and Modification](./threats/unauthorized_data_access_and_modification.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) to the `json-server` endpoint without any authentication.  Because `json-server` *itself* provides no built-in authentication mechanisms, any request is treated as authorized. The attacker can read, create, modify, or delete any data in the `db.json` file using standard HTTP tools.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  The attacker can steal, modify, or delete all data managed by `json-server`.
*   **Affected Component:** The core `json-server` module, specifically the request handling logic for all HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE). This is a direct consequence of `json-server`'s design, which prioritizes simplicity over built-in security.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement authentication and authorization *before* requests reach `json-server`. This *must* be done externally, using a reverse proxy (Nginx, Apache with authentication modules) or a custom Node.js application wrapping `json-server` with authentication middleware (e.g., Passport.js).  `json-server` cannot be secured on its own.
    *   Do *not* expose `json-server` directly to untrusted networks (like the internet).

## Threat: [Data Corruption via Unvalidated Input](./threats/data_corruption_via_unvalidated_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends malicious or malformed JSON data in POST, PUT, or PATCH requests.  `json-server` *itself* performs no validation on the structure or content of incoming JSON data. It blindly writes whatever it receives to the `db.json` file. This can lead to invalid JSON, data exceeding size limits, or data violating the application's intended schema.
*   **Impact:** Data integrity violation. The `db.json` file can become corrupted, rendering the API and potentially the application using it unusable.
*   **Affected Component:** The `json-server` request handling logic for `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH` requests, specifically the part that writes data to `db.json`. This is a direct result of `json-server`'s lack of input validation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement input validation and sanitization *before* requests reach `json-server`. This *must* be done externally. Use a schema validation library (e.g., Joi, Ajv) within a custom middleware or a reverse proxy to enforce data types, structures, and size limits.

## Threat: [Execution with Excessive Privileges](./threats/execution_with_excessive_privileges.md)

*   **Description:** `json-server` is run with root or administrator privileges. If a vulnerability *were to be discovered* in `json-server` itself or one of its dependencies (even a seemingly minor one), an attacker could potentially exploit it to gain those elevated privileges. While this isn't a *current* known vulnerability in `json-server`, it's a critical risk if the principle of least privilege is violated.
*   **Impact:**  Potential for complete system compromise. If a vulnerability is exploited, the attacker could gain full control of the server.
*   **Affected Component:** The entire `json-server` process and, by extension, the operating system it's running on. This highlights the importance of least privilege, even for seemingly simple tools.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (due to the potential impact if a vulnerability *were* found)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Run `json-server` with the *least privilege* necessary.  *Never* run it as root or an administrator. Create a dedicated, unprivileged user account specifically for running `json-server`.
    *   Use containerization (e.g., Docker) to isolate `json-server` and limit its access to the host system's resources. This provides an additional layer of defense even if `json-server` is compromised.
