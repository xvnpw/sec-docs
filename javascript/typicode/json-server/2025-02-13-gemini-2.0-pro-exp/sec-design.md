Okay, let's create a design document for the `json-server` project, keeping in mind its purpose and potential security implications.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a simple, fast, and easy-to-use tool for developers to create mock REST APIs.
*   Minimize setup and configuration time, allowing developers to focus on front-end development.
*   Offer a lightweight solution that doesn't require complex infrastructure or dependencies.
*   Support common REST API operations (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE).
*   Allow customization of data and routes.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data Exposure: If used with sensitive data (even mock data), there's a risk of unintentional exposure if the server is publicly accessible without proper access controls.
*   Abuse as an Attack Vector: A publicly accessible `json-server` instance could be used as a launching point for attacks against other systems, or to host malicious content.
*   Resource Exhaustion: Without proper rate limiting or resource management, a `json-server` instance could be vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Vulnerabilities in `json-server` or its dependencies could be exploited.
*   Misconfiguration: Incorrect configuration (e.g., exposing the server to the public internet unintentionally) could lead to security breaches.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Limited built-in security features. `json-server` primarily focuses on functionality, not robust security. It's designed for development and testing, not production.
*   security control: Runs locally by default (localhost). This limits exposure to the local machine. (Implemented in the code and documentation).
*   security control: Supports CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration, allowing developers to control which origins can access the API. (Documented in the README).
*   security control: Can be extended with middleware, potentially allowing for the addition of custom security logic (e.g., authentication). (Documented in the README).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The project maintainers explicitly state that `json-server` is not intended for production use with sensitive data.
*   accepted risk: Authentication and authorization are not built-in features. Users are expected to implement these themselves if needed, using middleware or external tools.
*   accepted risk: Rate limiting and other denial-of-service protections are not included by default.
*   accepted risk: Input validation is minimal. Users are responsible for validating data if necessary.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement strong input validation to prevent injection vulnerabilities, even if the data is mocked.
*   security control: Add authentication and authorization middleware if the server will be exposed to any network beyond the local machine.
*   security control: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   security control: Regularly update `json-server` and its dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Consider using a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx, Apache) in front of `json-server` to handle TLS termination, authentication, and other security concerns.
*   security control: If deploying to a cloud environment, use appropriate network security controls (e.g., security groups, network ACLs) to restrict access.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: If the server is used in an environment where access needs to be restricted, authentication should be implemented. This could involve API keys, JWT tokens, or other authentication mechanisms. The specific mechanism should be chosen based on the sensitivity of the data and the threat model.
*   Authorization: If different users or roles have different levels of access, authorization should be implemented. This could involve role-based access control (RBAC) or other authorization schemes.
*   Input Validation: All input from clients should be validated to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. This includes validating query parameters, request bodies, and headers.
*   Cryptography: If sensitive data is being transmitted, TLS/SSL should be used to encrypt the communication channel. If sensitive data is stored, it should be encrypted at rest.
*   CORS: Configure CORS properly to prevent unauthorized cross-origin requests.

4.  Serverless Function: Using a serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions) to host `json-server`. This is less common but possible.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Commits code" --> GitRepository["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    GitRepository -- "Triggers" --> CI["CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)"]
    CI -- "Runs tests" --> Tests["Tests (unit, integration)"]

    Build -- "Pushes image" --> ContainerRegistry["Container Registry"]

```
Build Process Description:

1.  Developer commits code to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  A CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered.
3.  The pipeline runs tests (unit, integration).
4.  The pipeline builds a Docker image.
5.  A security scanner (e.g., Trivy, Snyk) scans the Docker image for vulnerabilities.
6.  If the scan is successful and tests pass, the image is pushed to a container registry.

Security Controls:

*   security control: Automated builds ensure consistency and repeatability.
*   security control: CI/CD pipeline enforces security checks (tests, vulnerability scans).
*   security control: Security scanners identify vulnerabilities in the Docker image and its dependencies.
*   security control: Using signed commits.
*   security control: Using signed and verified base images for Docker.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Rapid Prototyping: The primary business process is enabling developers to quickly prototype and test front-end applications without needing a fully functional backend.
*   Mock API Development: Creating and managing mock APIs for development and testing purposes.

Data and Sensitivity:

*   Mock Data: The data used by `json-server` is typically mock data, which may not be sensitive. However, if developers use real or realistic data, the sensitivity increases.
*   Configuration Data: The `db.json` file and any configuration files may contain information about the structure of the API, which could be considered sensitive in some contexts.
*   No User Data (Typically): `json-server` itself doesn't typically handle user data, as it's a mock server. However, if developers misuse it to store user data, then that data becomes sensitive.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Will `json-server` be exposed to any network beyond the developer's local machine?
*   Will `json-server` be used with any data that could be considered sensitive, even if it's mock data?
*   What is the expected load on the `json-server` instance? (This helps determine the need for rate limiting.)
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) that need to be considered, even for mock data?
*   What level of logging and monitoring is required?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary use case is for local development and testing, not for production deployments.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Developers are aware of the security limitations of `json-server` and will take appropriate precautions if using it in a more exposed environment.
*   DESIGN: The `db.json` file is the primary data store, and no external databases are used. The deployment will use a Docker container for consistency and portability. The build process will include security scanning.
