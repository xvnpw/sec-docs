## Vulnerability List for C# for Visual Studio Code Extension

Based on the provided project files, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank, introduced by the project itself and triggerable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance, were found.

It's important to note that the provided files are primarily documentation, build scripts, CI/CD pipeline configurations, and syntax highlighting definitions for a Visual Studio Code extension. They do not contain application code that would be directly exposed to external threats in a publicly accessible environment.

Therefore, based on the current PROJECT FILES, the vulnerability list remains empty.
