# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, using the animate.css library, aims to enhance user interface and user experience of web applications by providing a collection of pre-built CSS animations.

## Business Priorities and Goals

- Enhance User Engagement: Improve website or application interactivity and visual appeal to capture and maintain user attention.
- Modernize User Interface: Adopt contemporary design trends by incorporating smooth and subtle animations.
- Improve User Experience: Make the application feel more dynamic and responsive, leading to a more positive user perception.
- Increase Brand Perception: Create a more polished and professional image for the brand through visual enhancements.

## Business Risks

- Performance Impact: Overuse or improper implementation of animations can negatively impact website loading times and performance, leading to a poor user experience and potentially higher bounce rates.
- Accessibility Concerns: Animations, if not implemented thoughtfully, can cause distractions or discomfort for users with vestibular disorders or cognitive impairments.
- Maintenance Overhead: Integrating and maintaining a third-party library introduces a dependency that needs to be managed and updated.
- Compatibility Issues: Animations might not render consistently across all browsers and devices, leading to inconsistent user experience.

# SECURITY POSTURE

This project utilizes a publicly available CSS animation library. The security posture is primarily focused on the secure integration and usage of this third-party component within a larger web application context.

## Existing Security Controls

- security control: Publicly available source code on GitHub. This allows for community review and transparency of the library's code. Implemented by: GitHub Repository.
- security control: Version control using Git. Provides history of changes and allows for tracking modifications. Implemented by: GitHub Repository.
- security control: MIT License. Defines terms of use and distribution, which is relevant from a legal and supply chain perspective. Described in: LICENSE file in the repository.

## Accepted Risks

- accepted risk: Dependency on a third-party library. The project accepts the risk that vulnerabilities might be discovered in the animate.css library in the future.
- accepted risk: Maintenance and updates are dependent on the library maintainers. The project accepts the risk that updates and security patches might not be released promptly or at all.
- accepted risk: Potential for CSS injection if user-controlled data is directly used to manipulate animation class names without proper sanitization in the consuming application.

## Recommended Security Controls

- security control: Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN usage. If animate.css is served from a Content Delivery Network (CDN), implement SRI to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the file.
- security control: Dependency scanning. Regularly check for known vulnerabilities in animate.css using automated tools or vulnerability databases.
- security control: Regular updates. Monitor for updates to animate.css and apply them promptly to benefit from bug fixes and potential security improvements.
- security control: CSS Linting. Integrate CSS linting tools into the development process to enforce CSS best practices and potentially identify security-related issues in custom CSS that interacts with animate.css.

## Security Requirements

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to animate.css itself, as it is a client-side CSS library. Authentication is relevant for the web application that utilizes animate.css to protect its own resources and functionalities.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to animate.css itself. Authorization is relevant for the web application to control access to features and data, and animations should not bypass or undermine these controls.
- Input Validation: While animate.css itself doesn't handle user input, the web application using it must perform input validation. If user input is used to dynamically construct CSS class names for animations, proper sanitization is crucial to prevent CSS injection vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to animate.css. Cryptography is relevant for securing communication (HTTPS) and protecting sensitive data within the web application that uses animate.css.

# DESIGN

The animate.css project itself is a CSS library. Its design is centered around providing a set of CSS classes that, when applied to HTML elements, trigger predefined animations. From a design document perspective, we are considering how this library is used within a web application project.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

## Critical Business Processes

The critical business process being supported by using animate.css is enhancing the user experience of the web application. This indirectly supports business goals like user engagement, brand perception, and potentially conversions or sales, depending on the application's purpose.

## Data Sensitivity

animate.css itself does not directly handle or process any data. However, the web application that uses animate.css might handle sensitive user data. The sensitivity of data depends entirely on the nature of the web application. For example, an e-commerce site might handle personal and financial data, while a simple blog might handle less sensitive data. The animations themselves should not compromise the security or confidentiality of any data handled by the application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

## Questions

- What type of web application will be using animate.css? (e.g., e-commerce, blog, dashboard, marketing website)
- What are the specific user experience goals for incorporating animations?
- How will animate.css be integrated into the project? (e.g., directly included CSS files, package manager, CDN)
- What is the expected traffic volume and performance requirements for the web application?
- Are there any specific accessibility requirements that need to be considered when using animations?

## Assumptions

- The project is a web application that aims to improve user engagement and modernize its user interface.
- The animate.css library will be used to add visual animations to enhance user experience.
- The web application will be deployed to a standard web server infrastructure, potentially with a CDN.
- Security is a consideration for the web application, and the integration of animate.css should not introduce new security vulnerabilities.
- The development team has basic web development and deployment knowledge.
