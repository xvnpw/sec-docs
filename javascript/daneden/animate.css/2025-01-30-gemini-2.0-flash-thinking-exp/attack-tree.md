# Attack Tree Analysis for daneden/animate.css

Objective: To compromise the user experience, data integrity, or confidentiality of an application using animate.css by exploiting vulnerabilities arising from the library's usage or inherent characteristics, focusing on high-risk attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Visualization

Attack Goal: Compromise Application Using Animate.css

    └─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2. CSS Injection/Manipulation via Animate.css Classes [CRITICAL NODE]
        └─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.1. Uncontrolled User Input to Class Names [CRITICAL NODE]
            └─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.1.1. Inject Malicious Class Names (Beyond Animate.css) [CRITICAL NODE]
                └─── [HIGH RISK PATH] 1.2.1.1.a. Style Injection (Defacement, Phishing UI) [CRITICAL NODE]

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2. CSS Injection/Manipulation via Animate.css Classes ](./attack_tree_paths/1_2__css_injectionmanipulation_via_animate_css_classes.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to inject or manipulate CSS within the application, leveraging the context of animate.css usage. This node represents the overarching category of CSS-related attacks.
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium to High (depending on application input handling)
    *   Impact: High (potential for defacement, phishing, data theft)
    *   Effort: Low to Medium (if input vulnerabilities exist)
    *   Skill Level: Low to Medium (basic web security knowledge)
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (defacement is visible, phishing can be subtle)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1. Uncontrolled User Input to Class Names ](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1__uncontrolled_user_input_to_class_names.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting scenarios where the application uses unsanitized user input to dynamically construct HTML class names. This is a direct enabler for CSS injection.
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium to High (common input handling vulnerability)
    *   Impact: High (opens door to style injection and broader CSS attacks)
    *   Effort: Low to Medium (if input is directly used in class names)
    *   Skill Level: Low to Medium (basic web security knowledge)
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (depends on the nature of the injection)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1. Inject Malicious Class Names (Beyond Animate.css) ](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1__inject_malicious_class_names__beyond_animate_css_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Leveraging the ability to inject arbitrary class names (due to uncontrolled user input) to introduce CSS classes that are *not* part of animate.css and are specifically designed for malicious purposes.
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium to High (if 1.2.1 is exploitable)
    *   Impact: High (allows for full control over styling, enabling defacement, phishing, etc.)
    *   Effort: Low to Medium (once injection point is found, crafting CSS is relatively easy)
    *   Skill Level: Low to Medium (basic CSS and web security knowledge)
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (defacement is visible, phishing can be subtle)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.1.1.a. Style Injection (Defacement, Phishing UI) ](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_1_1_a__style_injection__defacement__phishing_ui_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The direct consequence of injecting malicious class names. Attackers use injected CSS to modify the visual appearance of the application, leading to defacement (altering content to attacker's message) or creating phishing UI (imitating login forms to steal credentials).
*   **Risk Assessment:**
    *   Likelihood: Medium to High (if 1.2.1.1 is exploitable)
    *   Impact: High (direct damage to application reputation, user trust, potential data theft via phishing)
    *   Effort: Low to Medium (once injection point is found, crafting CSS for defacement/phishing is common knowledge)
    *   Skill Level: Low to Medium (basic CSS and web security knowledge)
    *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium (defacement is visually obvious, phishing UI might require user reports or specific monitoring)
