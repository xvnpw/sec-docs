# Threat Model Analysis for daneden/animate.css

## Threat: [Excessive Animation Client-Side Denial of Service](./threats/excessive_animation_client-side_denial_of_service.md)

*   **Description:**  Uncontrolled or poorly implemented usage of `animate.css` animations can lead to excessive browser resource consumption (CPU/GPU).  Applying complex or numerous animations simultaneously, especially on page load or in response to common user actions, can cause significant performance degradation, UI freezes, and application unresponsiveness on the client-side. An attacker could potentially trigger a large number of animations through automated scripts or by manipulating application logic to apply animations excessively.
*   **Impact:** High. Client-side Denial of Service. Users experience a severely degraded or unusable application. This can lead to user frustration, abandonment of the application, and damage to the application's reputation. In critical applications, this could disrupt essential services.
*   **Affected Component:**  Core `animate.css` library classes and the application's implementation logic that utilizes these classes. Specifically, the *inherent performance characteristics* of CSS animations when used at scale.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.  Easily triggered by poor implementation or potentially by malicious actors. Impact on user experience and application availability is significant.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Judicious Animation Implementation:**  Carefully plan and limit the use of animations. Avoid animating a large number of elements simultaneously or unnecessarily.
    *   **Performance Budgeting and Testing:** Establish performance budgets for animation usage and conduct rigorous performance testing across various devices and browsers, especially low-powered ones.
    *   **Animation Optimization:**  Favor simpler animations. Utilize CSS optimization techniques like `will-change` for complex animations to improve performance.
    *   **Lazy Loading and Conditional Animation:**  Load or trigger animations only when necessary, such as when elements are in the viewport or in response to specific user interactions, rather than applying them globally or on initial page load.
    *   **Rate Limiting Animations:** Implement mechanisms to limit the frequency or number of animations triggered within a short timeframe, especially in response to user actions, to prevent accidental or malicious overload.

## Threat: [`animate.css` Library Vulnerability](./threats/_animate_css__library_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:**  While less likely for a CSS library, a critical vulnerability could theoretically be discovered within the `animate.css` library itself. This could be a CSS parsing vulnerability that leads to unexpected browser behavior, or in an extreme (and less probable) scenario, a vulnerability that could be leveraged for client-side code execution if a browser's CSS parsing engine has a critical flaw when processing specific `animate.css` constructs.  A supply chain attack compromising the library's source or distribution is also a potential, though less direct, vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical.  Impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. Could range from unexpected UI behavior and client-side Denial of Service to, in a worst-case scenario, potential client-side code execution if a severe CSS parsing vulnerability is exploited. A compromised library could inject malicious code into applications using it.
*   **Affected Component:**  The entire `animate.css` library. Any component could be affected depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High. While the *probability* of a critical vulnerability in a CSS library like `animate.css` is relatively low compared to JavaScript libraries, the *potential impact* if one were to exist and be exploited could be significant, justifying a High risk rating.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regularly Update Dependencies:**  Keep `animate.css` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and potential security patches. Monitor security advisories related to front-end libraries.
    *   **Dependency Scanning and Vulnerability Monitoring:**  Utilize dependency scanning tools to automatically check for known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, including `animate.css`, and set up alerts for new vulnerability disclosures.
    *   **Use from Trusted Source and Verify Integrity:**  Obtain `animate.css` from a reputable and trusted source (e.g., official CDN or self-hosted from the official repository). Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes to verify the integrity of the library files loaded from CDNs, ensuring they haven't been tampered with.
    *   **Source Code Review (For Highly Critical Applications):** For applications with stringent security requirements, consider a periodic, basic review of the `animate.css` source code to understand its functionality and identify any potential areas of concern, although this is less common for CSS libraries.
