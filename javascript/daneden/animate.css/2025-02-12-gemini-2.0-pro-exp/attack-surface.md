# Attack Surface Analysis for daneden/animate.css

## Attack Surface: [CSS Injection (Indirect, via Class Name Manipulation) - Refined for Direct Involvement](./attack_surfaces/css_injection__indirect__via_class_name_manipulation__-_refined_for_direct_involvement.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious CSS by manipulating the class names *specifically provided by animate.css* that are applied to elements. This exploits vulnerabilities in how the application handles user input that is used to *select or construct* `animate.css` class names. The attack *requires* the presence of `animate.css` and its class-based system.
*   **animate.css Contribution:** `animate.css`'s core functionality relies on applying pre-defined class names to trigger animations.  If the application allows user input to directly or indirectly control which *animate.css* classes are used, without proper sanitization, this creates the injection vector. The attacker is leveraging the *specific* class names defined by the library.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to choose an animation from a dropdown list.  The dropdown values are directly used to construct the class name applied to an element (e.g., `<div class="animate__animated animate__${userChoice}">`).  If a user can manipulate the `userChoice` value (e.g., through a modified request), they can inject arbitrary CSS by providing a value like: `bounce; } #someElement { color: red; } .animate__fadeIn {`. The attacker is *specifically* targeting the `animate__` prefixed classes.
*   **Impact:** Allows the attacker to inject arbitrary CSS, potentially leading to defacement, data exfiltration (though difficult via CSS alone), or phishing attacks by altering the appearance of the page. The attacker can modify the styling and behavior of the page, potentially leading to a compromise of user data or trust.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if user input directly or indirectly affects `animate.css` class names without rigorous sanitization).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization (Whitelist Approach):** *Never* directly use user input to construct `animate.css` class names. Implement a *strict whitelist* of allowed `animate.css` class names (e.g., `['animate__bounce', 'animate__fadeIn', 'animate__fadeOut']`).  Reject *any* input that does not *exactly* match an entry in the whitelist. Do *not* attempt to "sanitize" by removing dangerous characters; instead, only allow known-good values.
    *   **Lookup Table/Mapping:** Use a server-side lookup table or mapping to translate user-friendly input (e.g., "Fade In") into the corresponding safe `animate.css` class name (e.g., `animate__fadeIn`).  This completely separates user input from the actual class name used.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strong CSP with a restrictive `style-src` directive is crucial.  This limits the impact of CSS injection, even if class name manipulation occurs.  Example:
        ```http
        Content-Security-Policy: style-src 'self' cdn.jsdelivr.net;
        ```
        (Assuming `animate.css` is loaded from `cdn.jsdelivr.net`). This prevents the execution of inline styles and styles from untrusted sources.
