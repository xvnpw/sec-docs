## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Animation Timing and Placement Review (animate.css Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_animation_timing_and_placement_review__animate_css_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Code Review (animate.css Focus):**  Concentrate code reviews on the HTML and JavaScript where `animate.css` classes are applied.  Verify that the *combination* of the element, the chosen `animate.css` class (e.g., `animate__fadeIn`, `animate__bounceOutLeft`), and any custom CSS modifying the animation properties doesn't create a deceptive scenario.
    2.  **Animation Property Analysis (animate.css Focus):** For each `animate.css` animation used, analyze these CSS properties *in the context of the specific class*:
        *   `animation-name`:  Understand the *precise* visual effect of the chosen `animate.css` class.  Is it a movement, a fade, a pulse, etc.?
        *   `animation-duration`:  Check if the default duration of the `animate.css` class is appropriate, or if it's been overridden.  Too fast or too slow can be problematic.
        *   `animation-delay`:  If a delay is used, ensure it's not creating a timing attack opportunity or misdirection.
        *   `animation-timing-function`:  Understand how the `animate.css` class's easing function affects the animation's perceived speed and smoothness.
        *   `animation-iteration-count`:  Be extremely cautious with `animate.css` classes used with `animation-iteration-count: infinite`.  Ensure this is absolutely necessary and doesn't cause performance or usability issues.
    3.  **Interactive Element Focus (animate.css Focus):**  Ensure that `animate.css` classes applied to interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) do not, through their specific animation effects, cause:
        *   Unexpected movement under the cursor.
        *   Obscuration or difficulty in interaction.
        *   Overlapping with other interactive elements.
    4.  **Manual Testing (animate.css Focus):**  Test each `animate.css` animation *in the context of the application*.  Try to interact with the page in ways that might exploit the specific animation's behavior.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Animation-based Clickjacking/UI Redressing:** (Severity: High) - Prevents deceptive use of `animate.css` animations.
    *   **Phishing/Deception through Visual Mimicry:** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of `animate.css` being used for visual deception.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Animation-based Clickjacking/UI Redressing:** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Phishing/Deception through Visual Mimicry:** Moderately reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: *Code reviews check for `animate.css` class usage, but don't consistently analyze animation properties in detail.*) **<-- Fill in based on your project**

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: *Need to formalize the animation property analysis within code reviews, specifically focusing on how `animate.css` classes are used and modified.*) **<-- Fill in based on your project**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Animating Critical Actions (animate.css Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_animating_critical_actions__animate_css_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Actions:** Maintain a list of critical actions (form submissions, purchases, deletions, etc.).
    2.  **Restrict `animate.css` Usage:**  For elements triggering these actions:
        *   Preferably, *do not* apply any `animate.css` classes.
        *   If animation is absolutely required for UX reasons, use *only* extremely subtle `animate.css` classes that do *not* involve movement or significant changes in opacity (e.g., a very subtle `animate__pulse` with a short duration and low amplitude might be acceptable, but `animate__bounceIn` would not).  Avoid any `animate.css` classes that move the element (`animate__slideIn...`, `animate__bounce...`, etc.).
    3.  **Code Review Enforcement:**  Enforce this restriction during code reviews.  Reject any use of `animate.css` classes on critical action elements that could be deceptive.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Animation-based Clickjacking/UI Redressing:** (Severity: High) - Prevents deceptive use of `animate.css` on critical actions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Animation-based Clickjacking/UI Redressing:** Very high impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: *Most critical actions avoid `animate.css`, but there are a few exceptions that need review.*) **<-- Fill in based on your project**

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: *Need a clear policy, enforced through code reviews, prohibiting or severely restricting `animate.css` on critical action elements.*) **<-- Fill in based on your project**

## Mitigation Strategy: [User-Controllable Animation Disabling (animate.css Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/user-controllable_animation_disabling__animate_css_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`prefers-reduced-motion` (animate.css Focus):**  This is the most important step, and it directly impacts `animate.css`.
        *   Add this CSS, which targets *all* animations and transitions, including those from `animate.css`:

            ```css
            @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
              /* Disable or significantly reduce animations */
              * {
                animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
                animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
                transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
                transition-delay: 0.01ms !important;
              }
            }
            ```
        *   This effectively disables all `animate.css` animations (and other animations) when the user has enabled "Reduce motion" in their OS/browser settings.
    2.  **User Preference Setting (Optional, but Recommended - animate.css Focus):**
        *   Provide a user setting to disable animations.
        *   Store this preference.
        *   Use JavaScript to add/remove a class (e.g., `animations-disabled`) to the `<body>`.
        *   Use CSS similar to the `prefers-reduced-motion` example, but targeting `.animations-disabled *`, to disable `animate.css` (and other) animations when the class is present.  This gives the user explicit control *beyond* the OS setting.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Animation-based Clickjacking/UI Redressing:** (Severity: High)
    *   **Animation-Induced Denial of Service (Client-Side):** (Severity: Medium)
    * **Phishing/Deception through Visual Mimicry:** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Animation-based Clickjacking/UI Redressing:** High impact.
    *   **Animation-Induced Denial of Service (Client-Side):** Medium impact.
    * **Phishing/Deception through Visual Mimicry:** Medium impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: *`prefers-reduced-motion` is supported.  A custom user setting is not yet implemented.*) **<-- Fill in based on your project**

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: *Implement a user-accessible setting to disable animations, which would also disable `animate.css`.*) **<-- Fill in based on your project**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Concurrent Animations (animate.css Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_concurrent_animations__animate_css_specific_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify `animate.css` Triggers:** Analyze how `animate.css` classes are added to elements. Are they added on page load, on user interaction (click, scroll), or via JavaScript timers?
    2. **Stagger `animate.css` Application:** If multiple elements are likely to receive `animate.css` classes simultaneously (e.g., a list of items all animating in at once), use JavaScript to add the classes with small delays. This prevents a sudden burst of animation.
        * Example (JavaScript - conceptual):
            ```javascript
            const items = document.querySelectorAll('.list-item');
            items.forEach((item, index) => {
                setTimeout(() => {
                    item.classList.add('animate__animated', 'animate__fadeInUp');
                }, index * 100); // Delay each item by 100ms * its index
            });
            ```
    3. **Prioritize `animate.css` Animations:** If some `animate.css` animations are more visually important, ensure they are triggered first or with less delay.
    4. **Event Listener Management (with `animate.css`):** If `animate.css` classes are added in response to user events (clicks, scrolls), use debouncing or throttling to limit how often the classes are applied, preventing excessive animation triggering. This is especially important if the event fires frequently (like scroll events).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Animation-Induced Denial of Service (Client-Side):** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Animation-Induced Denial of Service (Client-Side):** Medium impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: *No specific strategies are in place to limit concurrent `animate.css` animations.*) **<-- Fill in based on your project**

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: *Review code to identify areas where multiple `animate.css` animations might be triggered at once. Use JavaScript to stagger or prioritize the application of `animate.css` classes.*) **<-- Fill in based on your project**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Optimize Animation Properties (animate.css Indirect)](./mitigation_strategies/optimize_animation_properties__animate_css_indirect_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand `animate.css`'s Properties:** While `animate.css` itself generally uses performant properties (`transform` and `opacity`), be aware of *which* properties each class modifies.  For example, `animate__slideInLeft` uses `transform: translateX()`.
    2.  **Avoid Overriding with Expensive Properties:** If you *override* any of `animate.css`'s default styles (e.g., with custom CSS), be *extremely* careful not to introduce animations on expensive properties (width, height, top, left, etc.).  This negates the performance benefits of `animate.css`.
    3. **Review Custom Animations:** If you create *custom* animations that *use* `animate.css` as a base (e.g., by chaining `animate.css` classes or modifying their properties), ensure these custom animations also prioritize `transform` and `opacity`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Animation-Induced Denial of Service (Client-Side):** (Severity: Medium)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Animation-Induced Denial of Service (Client-Side):** Medium impact.

*   **Currently Implemented:** (Example: *Developers are generally aware of performant animation properties, but there's no formal check for overrides that might negate `animate.css`'s benefits.*) **<-- Fill in based on your project**

*   **Missing Implementation:** (Example: *Code reviews should specifically check for any custom CSS that overrides `animate.css` styles and introduces animations on expensive properties.*) **<-- Fill in based on your project**
