# Threat Model Analysis for daneden/animate.css

## Threat: [Indirect XSS via Unsanitized Input in Class Name Generation](./threats/indirect_xss_via_unsanitized_input_in_class_name_generation.md)

* **Threat:** Indirect XSS via Unsanitized Input in Class Name Generation
    * **Description:** If the application dynamically generates HTML elements or manipulates class names based on user-provided input without proper sanitization, an attacker could inject malicious HTML attributes or even script-like content within the class name string. While Animate.css itself doesn't execute scripts, other JavaScript code or browser features might interpret this injected content.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, steal cookies, or perform other malicious actions.
    * **Affected Component:** The application's code responsible for dynamically generating HTML or manipulating class names.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:** Always sanitize and validate user input before using it to construct HTML attributes, including class names. Use templating engines or DOM manipulation APIs that provide built-in escaping mechanisms.

## Threat: [Compromised Animate.css File (Supply Chain)](./threats/compromised_animate_css_file__supply_chain_.md)

* **Threat:** Compromised Animate.css File (Supply Chain)
    * **Description:** An attacker could compromise the hosted version of Animate.css (e.g., on a CDN) and inject malicious code into the file. This could happen through vulnerabilities in the CDN's infrastructure or by targeting the maintainers' accounts.
    * **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications using the affected version of Animate.css, potentially leading to data theft, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
    * **Affected Component:** The `animate.css` file itself.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:** Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes to verify the integrity of the Animate.css file loaded from a CDN. Consider hosting the library locally and regularly updating it from trusted sources.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Build Processes (Supply Chain)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_build_processes__supply_chain_.md)

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Build Processes (Supply Chain)
    * **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the package manager (like npm or yarn) or its dependencies used to include Animate.css in the application's build process. This could lead to the injection of malicious code during the build.
    * **Impact:** Inclusion of malicious code in the application, potentially leading to various security breaches.
    * **Affected Component:** The application's build process and dependency management tools.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:** Regularly audit and update dependencies. Use security scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies. Implement secure build pipelines.
