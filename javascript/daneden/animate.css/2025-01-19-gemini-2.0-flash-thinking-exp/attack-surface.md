# Attack Surface Analysis for daneden/animate.css

## Attack Surface: [Abuse via Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/abuse_via_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTML and CSS into the application, which is then rendered by the user's browser.
    * **How animate.css Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Attackers can use `animate.css` classes to make injected malicious elements more visually appealing, distracting, or deceptive, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of phishing attempts or UI manipulation.
    * **Example:** An attacker injects a fake login form with `animate.css` classes to make it slide in smoothly and appear legitimate, tricking users into entering their credentials.
    * **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malware installation, redirection to malicious sites.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding to prevent the injection of malicious HTML and CSS.
        * Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, including stylesheets.

    * **Impact:** Credentials theft, personal information disclosure, financial loss.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
