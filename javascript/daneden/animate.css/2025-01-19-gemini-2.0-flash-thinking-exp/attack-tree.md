## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious Animations [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_animations__high-risk_path_.md)

This represents the overarching goal of injecting malicious animations into the application by leveraging animate.css. Success here means the attacker has managed to control the visual behavior of the application in an unintended and potentially harmful way.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to Inject Malicious Classes [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__cross-site_scripting__xss__to_inject_malicious_classes__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack vector involves exploiting XSS vulnerabilities to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code that specifically adds animate.css classes to elements. This allows the attacker to trigger arbitrary animations, potentially leading to UI disruption, defacement, or even more serious attacks like credential theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Stored XSS Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_stored_xss_vulnerability__high-risk_path_.md)

In this scenario, the attacker injects malicious code containing animate.css classes into data that is stored by the application (e.g., in a database). When other users view this stored data, the malicious code is executed in their browsers, applying the attacker's chosen animations. This can have a persistent impact and affect multiple users.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Reflected XSS Vulnerability [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_reflected_xss_vulnerability__high-risk_path_.md)

Here, the attacker crafts a malicious URL that includes JavaScript code designed to inject elements with specific animate.css classes. When a user clicks on this specially crafted link, the script executes, applying the malicious animations. This attack typically requires social engineering to trick users into clicking the link.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Server-Side Injection Leading to Malicious Class Application](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__server-side_injection_leading_to_malicious_class_application.md)

This attack vector focuses on vulnerabilities in the server-side code that handles the application of animate.css classes. If the server-side logic doesn't properly sanitize user input or has other flaws, an attacker can inject malicious class names or code that leads to the application applying unintended animations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Vulnerable Server-Side Logic](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__vulnerable_server-side_logic.md)

This refers to flaws in the server-side code where user-controlled data is used to determine which animate.css classes are applied to elements. An attacker can manipulate this input to inject malicious class names, leading to unintended visual effects or potentially triggering other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit template injection to directly inject animate.css classes](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_template_injection_to_directly_inject_animate_css_classes.md)

If the application uses a templating engine and doesn't properly sanitize user input, an attacker might be able to inject code directly into the template that adds malicious animate.css classes to the rendered HTML. This can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server in severe cases.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Denial of Service (DoS) via Animation Overload [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__denial_of_service__dos__via_animation_overload__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack vector aims to disrupt the application's availability by overwhelming the client's browser with a large number of resource-intensive animations. By exploiting vulnerabilities or manipulating the application's logic, an attacker can trigger so many animations that the user's browser becomes unresponsive or crashes, effectively denying them access to the application.
