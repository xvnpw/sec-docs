# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for daneden/animate.css

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Regular Updates for animate.css](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_regular_updates_for_animate_css.md)

### Description:
1.  **Treat `animate.css` as a managed dependency:** Ensure `animate.css` is formally listed as a dependency in your project (e.g., in `package.json` if using npm/yarn, or a similar dependency tracking method for CSS).
2.  **Regularly check for `animate.css` updates:**  Establish a schedule (e.g., monthly) to visit the official `animate.css` GitHub repository ([https://github.com/daneden/animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css)) and check for new releases or updates in the "Releases" section or commit history.
3.  **Review release notes/changelog:** When updates are available, carefully examine the release notes or changelog provided by the `animate.css` maintainers. Look for bug fixes, performance improvements, and any mentions of security-related changes (though less common for CSS libraries, it's good practice).
4.  **Update to the latest stable `animate.css` version:** If a newer stable version is available, update your project's dependency to use this version. Follow the instructions for your dependency management tool (e.g., `npm update animate.css`, `yarn upgrade animate.css`).
5.  **Test animations after updating:** After updating `animate.css`, thoroughly test the parts of your application that use animations to ensure the update hasn't introduced any unexpected visual regressions or broken animation functionality.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Using an outdated version of `animate.css` with potential undiscovered bugs:** Severity: Low (CSS vulnerabilities are rare, but outdated libraries can have unforeseen issues or lack performance improvements).
### Impact:
*   **Using an outdated version of `animate.css` with potential undiscovered bugs:** Impact: Medium - Reduces the risk of encountering bugs or issues present in older versions of `animate.css`.
### Currently Implemented:
Yes, `animate.css` is managed as an npm dependency and updated during quarterly dependency reviews.
### Missing Implementation:
Automated checks for new `animate.css` releases are not in place. The update process is manual and relies on scheduled reminders.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Source Integrity Verification for animate.css](./mitigation_strategies/source_integrity_verification_for_animate_css.md)

### Description:
1.  **Obtain `animate.css` from a trusted source:**  Download or reference `animate.css` only from the official GitHub repository ([https://github.com/daneden/animate.css](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css)) or a reputable and established CDN (Content Delivery Network) like cdnjs or jsDelivr. Avoid downloading from unofficial or less trustworthy sources.
2.  **Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) when using a CDN for `animate.css`:** If you are using a CDN to deliver `animate.css`, utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI).
    *   Find the SRI hash for the specific version of `animate.css` you are using from the CDN provider's website or generate it yourself from the official `animate.css` file.
    *   Add the `integrity` attribute to the `<link>` tag in your HTML that includes the CDN URL for `animate.css`. Set the value of the `integrity` attribute to the SRI hash.
    *   Include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute in the same `<link>` tag.
3.  **Verify checksum for direct download (less common for CSS, but possible):** If you choose to download the `animate.css` file directly and host it yourself (less common for CSS libraries), consider verifying its integrity using a checksum (like SHA-256). Obtain the official checksum from the `animate.css` repository (if provided) or a reliable source and compare it to the checksum of your downloaded file.
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Serving a compromised or tampered version of `animate.css` from a CDN or download source:** Severity: Medium (If a CDN or download source is compromised, a malicious version of `animate.css` could be served, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or indirect attack vectors, though direct CSS-based attacks are rare).
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks altering `animate.css` during download:** Severity: Low (Less likely for CSS files, but theoretically possible during download if not using HTTPS and SRI).
### Impact:
*   **Serving a compromised or tampered version of `animate.css` from a CDN or download source:** Impact: High - SRI prevents the browser from executing a modified `animate.css` file from a compromised CDN, effectively mitigating this threat.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks altering `animate.css` during download:** Impact: Medium - Checksum verification and using HTTPS for downloads reduce the risk of MITM attacks altering the `animate.css` file.
### Currently Implemented:
Yes, using cdnjs for `animate.css` with SRI implemented in the `<link>` tag in the main layout file (`index.html`).
### Missing Implementation:
Checksum verification for locally hosted `animate.css` (if used in development or fallback scenarios) is not automated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consider Alternatives to animate.css or Custom Animations](./mitigation_strategies/consider_alternatives_to_animate_css_or_custom_animations.md)

### Description:
1.  **Evaluate animation needs vs. `animate.css` features:**  Assess the specific animation requirements of your web application. Determine if the extensive set of animations provided by `animate.css` is fully utilized or if only a small subset is actually needed.
2.  **Explore CSS transitions and keyframes for basic animations:** If your application primarily uses simple animations (e.g., fades, slides, basic scaling), consider implementing these directly using CSS transitions and keyframes. This approach avoids the need for a large external library like `animate.css`.
3.  **Develop custom CSS animation classes for specific needs:** If you require more tailored or unique animations beyond the standard set in `animate.css`, create custom CSS animation classes specifically for your application. This allows for greater control and reduces reliance on a large library.
4.  **Reduce dependency by removing `animate.css` if alternatives suffice:** If CSS transitions/keyframes or custom animations can adequately meet your application's animation needs, remove `animate.css` as a dependency. This reduces the project's dependency footprint and can simplify maintenance and potentially reduce surface area (though minimal for CSS libraries).
### List of Threats Mitigated:
*   **Unnecessary dependency on a large library (`animate.css`) when only a small portion is used:** Severity: Very Low (Primarily a code bloat and maintenance concern, indirectly related to security by increasing complexity, but not a direct security vulnerability of `animate.css` itself).
### Impact:
*   **Unnecessary dependency on a large library (`animate.css`) when only a small portion is used:** Impact: Low - Reduces code complexity, potentially improves performance by reducing CSS file size, and simplifies dependency management.
### Currently Implemented:
No, `animate.css` is currently used as the primary animation library. No recent evaluation of alternatives or custom animation implementation has been performed.
### Missing Implementation:
A formal assessment of animation needs and a feasibility study to explore replacing `animate.css` with CSS transitions/keyframes or custom animations for parts of the application is missing.
