## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via animate.css Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_animate_css_exploitation.md)

* **Critical Node: Compromise Application via animate.css Exploitation**
    * This represents the attacker successfully achieving their ultimate goal. It is critical because it signifies a complete breach of security related to the exploitation of `animate.css`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Control Over Element Styling](./attack_tree_paths/gain_control_over_element_styling.md)

* **Critical Node: Gain Control Over Element Styling**
    * This node is critical because it is a prerequisite for leveraging `animate.css` for malicious purposes. Without gaining control over how elements are styled, the attacker cannot proceed with attacks like phishing or denial of service via animations.
    * Attack Vectors Leading to this Node:
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Exploiting XSS vulnerabilities allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that can manipulate the DOM and CSS classes, granting control over element styling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) -> Manipulate Element Classes](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__-_manipulate_element_classes.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) -> Manipulate Element Classes**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - HIGH-RISK PATH START:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript into the application.
        * **Mechanism:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in input fields, server-side rendering, or other injection points.
        * **Outcome:** Successful injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
    * **Manipulate Element Classes - HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Adding malicious `animate.css` classes to HTML elements using JavaScript.
        * **Mechanism:** Once XSS is achieved, simple JavaScript commands can add or modify the `class` attribute of elements.
        * **Outcome:** Applying malicious animation classes can lead to:
            * **Phishing:** Mimicking login forms or other sensitive input fields to steal credentials.
            * **Defacement:** Displaying misleading or harmful content.
            * **Subtle Manipulation:**  Altering the user interface in subtle ways to trick users into unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Styling for Malicious Purposes -> Phishing/Deception -> Mislead User with Animated Content](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_styling_for_malicious_purposes_-_phishingdeception_-_mislead_user_with_animated_content.md)

* **High-Risk Path: Leverage Styling for Malicious Purposes -> Phishing/Deception -> Mislead User with Animated Content**
    * **Leverage Styling for Malicious Purposes - HIGH-RISK PATH START (for Phishing):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Utilizing the ability to control element styling, achieved through prior steps (like XSS).
        * **Mechanism:**  Employing CSS and `animate.css` classes to alter the visual appearance of the application.
        * **Outcome:**  Creating a foundation for deceptive content.
    * **Phishing/Deception - HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  Attempting to trick users into revealing sensitive information or performing unintended actions.
        * **Mechanism:**  Creating fake login forms, error messages, or other UI elements that mimic legitimate parts of the application.
        * **Outcome:**  Potentially leading to the theft of credentials or other sensitive data.
    * **Mislead User with Animated Content - HIGH-RISK PATH CONTINUES:**
        * **Attack Vectors:**
            * **Mimic Legitimate UI Elements:** Using animations to make fake UI elements appear authentic and interactive.
            * **Obscure Critical Information:**  Animating elements to hide important details or warnings from the user.
        * **Mechanism:**  Applying specific `animate.css` classes to control the movement, appearance, and timing of UI elements.
        * **Outcome:**  Deceiving users into interacting with malicious elements or overlooking critical information, ultimately facilitating the theft of credentials or other sensitive data.
