# Threat Model Analysis for daneden/animate.css

## Threat: [Compromised Repository](./threats/compromised_repository.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the official animate.css GitHub repository and injects malicious CSS code directly into the library files. This could involve modifying existing animation classes or adding entirely new, harmful styles.

**Impact:** Applications using the compromised version of animate.css will automatically include the malicious code, potentially leading to:

*   **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious CSS using `background-image` with data URIs to exfiltrate user data to an attacker's server.
*   **Client-Side Attacks:**  Injected CSS that redirects users to phishing sites or loads and executes malicious scripts on the client's browser.
*   **Denial of Service (Client-Side):** Introduction of resource-intensive animation classes that overload user browsers when applied.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Malicious Updates](./threats/malicious_updates.md)

**Description:** A maintainer with malicious intent, or whose account is compromised, introduces harmful code into a new version of the animate.css library. This malicious code is then distributed to applications that update their dependency.

**Impact:** Applications updating to the malicious version of animate.css will incorporate the harmful code, resulting in similar impacts as a compromised repository: data exfiltration, client-side attacks, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High
