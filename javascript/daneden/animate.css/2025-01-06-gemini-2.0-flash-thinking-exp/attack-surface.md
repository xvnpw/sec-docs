# Attack Surface Analysis for daneden/animate.css

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Indirect Risk via Compromised Source)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__indirect_risk_via_compromised_source_.md)

* **Description:** The `animate.css` file itself is compromised at its source or during delivery.
    * **How animate.css contributes:** If the downloaded or linked version of `animate.css` is malicious, it can introduce arbitrary CSS or even JavaScript (if the attacker manages to inject it within the CSS).
    * **Example:** A compromised CDN hosting `animate.css` is modified to include CSS that redirects users to a phishing site when certain elements are animated.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially severe, ranging from UI manipulation and phishing to more serious attacks if JavaScript is injected.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes when including `animate.css` from a CDN to verify the file's integrity.
        * Host `animate.css` on your own infrastructure if strict control over dependencies is required.
        * Regularly check for updates or security advisories related to the source of `animate.css`.

## Attack Surface: [Phishing and UI Redressing via Animation](./attack_surfaces/phishing_and_ui_redressing_via_animation.md)

* **Description:** Attackers use `animate.css` to create fake UI elements or animations that mimic legitimate application functionality to trick users.
    * **How animate.css contributes:** The library provides a wide range of smooth and visually appealing animations that can be used to create convincing fake interface elements.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses JavaScript to dynamically create a fake login prompt that animates into view using `animate.css` classes, overlaying the real login form to steal credentials.
    * **Impact:** Credential theft, user data compromise, unauthorized actions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent the execution of inline scripts that could manipulate the DOM and add malicious animations.
        * Educate users about phishing tactics and how to identify fake UI elements.
        * Implement security measures to detect and prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, which are often used in conjunction with this attack.
