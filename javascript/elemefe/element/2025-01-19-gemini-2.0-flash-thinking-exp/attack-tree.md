## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Application Using 'element'](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_application_using_'element'.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this node means the attacker has achieved unauthorized control or access to the application or its data by exploiting weaknesses within the `element` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical node represents the category of attacks that leverage flaws in how `element` renders dynamic content. Successful exploitation here typically leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Templates](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__inject_malicious_htmljavascript_via_templates.md)

This is a core attack vector within rendering vulnerabilities. If `element`'s templating mechanism doesn't properly handle untrusted data, attackers can inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insufficient Input Sanitization in Templates](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insufficient_input_sanitization_in_templates.md)

If user-provided data or data from untrusted sources is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Script Tags or Event Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/inject_script_tags_or_event_handlers.md)

Attackers can inject `<script>` tags containing malicious JavaScript or HTML elements with malicious event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`) that execute arbitrary code in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Improper Contextual Output Encoding](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_improper_contextual_output_encoding.md)

Even if basic sanitization is present, incorrect encoding based on the context (HTML, JavaScript, URL) can lead to vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject HTML Entities that Execute as Code](./attack_tree_paths/inject_html_entities_that_execute_as_code.md)

Attackers can inject HTML entities that, when rendered in a specific context (like within a JavaScript string), are interpreted as executable code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Event Handling Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_event_handling_mechanisms.md)

This high-risk path focuses on vulnerabilities related to how `element` handles events.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Event Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_event_handlers.md)

If `element` allows dynamic creation of HTML elements or manipulation of their attributes based on user input, attackers might inject elements with malicious event handlers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject HTML with Malicious Event Attributes](./attack_tree_paths/inject_html_with_malicious_event_attributes.md)

Attackers can inject HTML elements with event attributes (e.g., `onclick`, `onmouseover`) containing malicious JavaScript code that executes when the event is triggered by the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Interoperability Issues with Other Libraries](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_interoperability_issues_with_other_libraries.md)

This critical node highlights the risks associated with `element`'s dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Leverage Vulnerabilities in Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__leverage_vulnerabilities_in_dependencies.md)

`element` likely relies on other JavaScript libraries. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them through the application using `element`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by 'element'](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_used_by_'element'.md)

Attackers can identify known vulnerabilities in `element`'s dependencies by checking public databases and then craft exploits to leverage these weaknesses within the context of the application using `element`. This can lead to various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or data breaches.
