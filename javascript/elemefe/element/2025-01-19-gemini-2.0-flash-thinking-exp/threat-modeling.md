# Threat Model Analysis for elemefe/element

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Input Components](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_input_components.md)

**Description:**
* **What the attacker might do:** Inject malicious JavaScript code into input fields (e.g., text fields, text areas) that are rendered by `element` components. This code executes when the component is rendered or when a user interacts with it. This is due to `element`'s failure to properly sanitize or escape user-provided data.
* **How:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in `element`'s input component rendering logic that allows unsanitized user input to be interpreted as executable code by the browser.
**Impact:**
* Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking.
* Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
* Defacing the application's UI.
* Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
**Affected Component:**
* `element`'s input components (e.g., `<el-input>`, `<el-textarea>`, or similar). Specifically, the rendering logic within these components that handles and displays user-provided data.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Upgrade to the latest version of `element` that includes patches for known XSS vulnerabilities in input components.
* If a patch is not available, avoid using the vulnerable input components or implement custom sanitization logic before passing data to these components (though this is a workaround, not a true fix for the library vulnerability).
* Report the vulnerability to the `element` library maintainers.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Templating Engine](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_templating_engine.md)

**Description:**
* **What the attacker might do:** Inject malicious JavaScript code into data that is processed by `element`'s templating engine and subsequently rendered into the DOM. This occurs because `element`'s templating engine fails to properly escape or sanitize potentially malicious content.
* **How:** The attacker exploits a vulnerability in `element`'s templating engine that allows unsanitized data to be rendered as executable code in the browser.
**Impact:**
* Similar impacts to XSS via input components: session hijacking, redirection, defacement, unauthorized actions.
**Affected Component:**
* `element`'s templating engine or rendering functions responsible for processing and displaying data within component templates.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Upgrade to the latest version of `element` that includes fixes for XSS vulnerabilities in the templating engine.
* If a patch is not available, avoid using features of the templating engine that are known to be vulnerable or implement custom escaping mechanisms (again, a workaround).
* Report the vulnerability to the `element` library maintainers.
