# Attack Surface Analysis for elemefe/element

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template/Code Injection (SSTI/Code Injection)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_templatecode_injection__ssticode_injection_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious Go code into server-side component rendering logic.
*   **How `element` Contributes:** `element`'s core functionality involves server-side rendering of components based on Go code and data.  This *direct* involvement in rendering, using Go, creates the *primary* injection point if user input is mishandled.  This is *not* a general web vulnerability; it's specific to how `element` processes and renders components.
*   **Example:** A component displays a user's name: `element.NewSpan(user.Name)`. If `user.Name` comes directly from an untrusted source and contains Go code (e.g., using a hypothetical template injection syntax specific to `element`), it could execute arbitrary commands on the server. The *specific vulnerability* lies in how `element` handles this data during rendering.
*   **Impact:** Complete server compromise. An attacker could gain full control of the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate *all* user-supplied data.
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** Use `element`'s built-in safe data binding and output encoding. If these are insufficient or absent, *developers must implement robust escaping*. This is a *direct responsibility* when using `element`.
    *   **Context-Aware Escaping:** Ensure escaping is appropriate for the context.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application server with minimum privileges.
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Focus reviews on how user input is used in `element` component rendering.
    *   **Automated Security Testing:** Use SAST and DAST tools to detect injection vulnerabilities *specifically within the context of `element`'s rendering*.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_websocket_hijacking__cswsh_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker establishes a WebSocket connection from a malicious website to the `element` application on behalf of a legitimate user.
*   **How `element` Contributes:** `element`'s *reliance on WebSockets for its core communication mechanism* makes it inherently susceptible to CSWSH if proper origin validation and anti-CSRF measures are not implemented *specifically for the WebSocket connections used by `element`*. This is not a general WebSocket vulnerability; it's a vulnerability in how `element` *uses* WebSockets.
*   **Example:** A malicious site establishes a WebSocket connection to the `element` application. If `element` doesn't validate the `Origin` header *within its WebSocket handling logic*, the connection is established, allowing the malicious site to interact with the application as the user.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, data modification, potential session hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Origin Validation:** The server *must* validate the `Origin` header *within the `element` application's WebSocket handling code*. This is a *direct responsibility* when using `element`.
    *   **CSRF Tokens for WebSockets:** Implement a CSRF-like token mechanism *specifically for the WebSocket connections established by `element`*.
    *   **SameSite Cookies:** Use `SameSite` cookies to help prevent cross-site requests.

## Attack Surface: [Unauthorized Event Triggering](./attack_surfaces/unauthorized_event_triggering.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker triggers server-side events they should not have access to.
*   **How `element` Contributes:** `element`'s *server-side event handling system* is the direct point of vulnerability. If this system doesn't properly authenticate and authorize the user *before executing the event handler code*, it allows unauthorized actions. This is *intrinsic to `element`'s design*.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a WebSocket message to trigger a sensitive `element` event (e.g., "delete_user"). If `element`'s event handling logic doesn't verify the user's permissions *before executing the associated Go code*, the action is performed.
*   **Impact:** Data loss, data modification, unauthorized access, potential privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** *Always* authenticate and authorize the user *within `element`'s event handling logic* before executing any event handler. This is a *direct responsibility* when using `element`.
    *   **Session Management:** Use secure session management.
    *   **Input Validation (Event Data):** Validate data associated with the event trigger *within the context of `element`'s event handling*.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Event handlers should have minimum necessary privileges.
