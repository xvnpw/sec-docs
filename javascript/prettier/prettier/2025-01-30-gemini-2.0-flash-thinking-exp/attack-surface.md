# Attack Surface Analysis for prettier/prettier

## Attack Surface: [Input Parsing Vulnerabilities (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/input_parsing_vulnerabilities__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:**  Prettier's core functionality relies on parsing code in various languages.  Vulnerabilities in these parsers can be exploited by providing maliciously crafted input code, leading to significant disruptions.
*   **Prettier Contribution:** Prettier's fundamental operation of parsing code directly creates this attack surface. Bugs in parsers are inherent to Prettier's design.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted JavaScript file, when processed by Prettier, triggers a vulnerability in its JavaScript parser, causing an infinite loop and exhausting CPU resources in a CI/CD pipeline. This prevents code deployment.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - Critical disruption of development workflows, especially CI/CD pipelines, leading to significant delays and inability to deploy code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Prettier Updated:**  Immediately update Prettier to the latest version upon release, as updates often contain critical parser bug fixes and security patches addressing DoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Resource Limits in CI/CD:** Implement strict resource limits (CPU, memory, time) for Prettier processes within CI/CD pipelines. This will contain the impact of DoS attacks by preventing resource exhaustion from affecting the entire system.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration Vulnerabilities (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_vulnerabilities__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** Prettier's use of JavaScript configuration files (`.prettierrc.js`) introduces a risk of code execution vulnerabilities if the configuration parsing or execution mechanism is flawed.
*   **Prettier Contribution:** Prettier's design choice to support JavaScript configuration files directly creates this attack surface.  Parsing and potentially executing JavaScript code from configuration files is inherently more risky than static formats.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in Prettier's `.prettierrc.js` parsing allows an attacker to craft a malicious configuration file that, when loaded by Prettier, executes arbitrary code on the system running Prettier. This could lead to credential theft or further system compromise.
*   **Impact:**  Code Execution - Potential for arbitrary code execution on the system running Prettier, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or supply chain attacks if exploited in development environments or CI/CD.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `.prettierrc.js` Configuration:**  Strongly prefer using JSON (`.prettierrc.json`) or YAML (`.prettierrc.yaml`) configuration files instead of `.prettierrc.js`. These formats do not involve code execution and significantly reduce this attack surface.
    *   **Restrict Configuration File Sources:** Ensure `.prettierrc` files are only loaded from trusted locations within your project repository. Prevent Prettier from loading configuration from external or untrusted sources.
    *   **Keep Prettier Updated:** Updates may include critical fixes for vulnerabilities related to JavaScript configuration parsing and execution.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (High to Critical Severity)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__high_to_critical_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** Prettier's plugin system allows execution of third-party code to extend its functionality. Malicious or vulnerable plugins can introduce severe security risks.
*   **Prettier Contribution:** Prettier's plugin architecture directly creates this attack surface by design. It allows loading and executing external, potentially untrusted code within the Prettier process.
*   **Example:** A malicious Prettier plugin is installed from a compromised package registry. This plugin, when activated by Prettier, executes arbitrary code that steals developer credentials, modifies source code to inject backdoors, or exfiltrates sensitive project data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Execution - Malicious plugins can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Prettier process.
    *   Data Exfiltration - Plugins can access and exfiltrate sensitive data from the project, developer environment, or CI/CD system.
    *   Supply Chain Compromise - Malicious plugins can inject backdoors or vulnerabilities into formatted code, leading to supply chain attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:** Implement a rigorous vetting process for Prettier plugins. Only use plugins from highly trusted and reputable sources with a proven security track record.
    *   **Code Review Plugins:**  Thoroughly review the source code of any plugin before installation, paying close attention to permissions requested and potentially malicious code patterns.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:**  Only install plugins that are absolutely necessary. Reduce the attack surface by minimizing the number of plugins used.
    *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Regularly update Prettier plugins to benefit from security patches and bug fixes released by plugin authors. If a plugin is no longer maintained, consider removing it.
    *   **Security Scanning for Plugins (If Available):** Explore if any security scanning tools can analyze Prettier plugins for known vulnerabilities or malicious patterns.
