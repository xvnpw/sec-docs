## Attack Tree Path: [[1.1] Exploit Parsing Bugs -> [1.1.1] Cause Denial of Service (DoS) by providing crafted input that crashes Prettier parser. [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_1__exploit_parsing_bugs_-__1_1_1__cause_denial_of_service__dos__by_providing_crafted_input_that_c_0b711845.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Prettier parses code in various languages. Parsers can contain bugs that cause them to crash when processing specific, crafted input. An attacker provides malicious code input designed to trigger these parsing bugs.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). Prettier process crashes, potentially disrupting application functionality that relies on code formatting or processing.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Parser bugs are possible in complex software like Prettier, although active development and testing reduce the likelihood of easily exploitable bugs.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium. Crafting input might require some understanding of parsing principles, but fuzzing tools can automate the process of finding crashing inputs.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Basic understanding of parsing concepts and potentially fuzzing techniques.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy. Crashes are often logged and easily observable through system monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [[1.3] Exploit Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Prettier's regex patterns. -> [1.3.1] Provide crafted input that causes Prettier's regex engine to consume excessive resources, leading to DoS. [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_1_3__exploit_regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_prettier's_regex_patterns__-__1_3_1__p_b5381023.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Prettier likely uses regular expressions for parsing and formatting code.  Poorly written regex patterns can be vulnerable to ReDoS attacks. An attacker provides crafted input strings that trigger exponential backtracking in Prettier's regex engine.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS). Prettier process consumes excessive CPU and memory resources, leading to performance degradation or complete service disruption.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. ReDoS vulnerabilities are common in applications that heavily use regular expressions. Prettier's code processing likely involves regex.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires knowledge of ReDoS vulnerabilities and crafting specific input strings to exploit vulnerable regex patterns. Tools exist to help identify ReDoS patterns.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Understanding of regular expressions, ReDoS principles, and performance analysis.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate. Can be detected through resource monitoring (CPU spikes, memory exhaustion) and potentially through network traffic analysis if timeouts are implemented.

## Attack Tree Path: [[2.1] Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Parser Dependencies (e.g., Babel, PostCSS, etc.) -> [2.1.1] Gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) by exploiting vulnerabilities in parser dependencies if Prettier uses them in a vulnerable way or if the dependencies themselves have RCE flaws. [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_2_1__exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_parser_dependencies__e_g___babel__postcss__etc___-__2_1_1__ga_fe979fc2.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Prettier relies on parser libraries like Babel, PostCSS, etc. These dependencies can have known vulnerabilities, including Remote Code Execution (RCE) flaws. An attacker exploits these known vulnerabilities in the dependencies, potentially through input processed by Prettier.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or system running Prettier, leading to full system compromise, data theft, and other severe consequences.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Dependencies are a frequent source of vulnerabilities. Parser dependencies are complex and handle potentially untrusted input, making them attractive targets.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium. Exploiting *known* vulnerabilities can be relatively easy if exploits are publicly available. Tools and scripts often exist to automate exploitation.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium to High. Exploiting known vulnerabilities might require moderate skill to adapt existing exploits. Finding and exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities is much harder and requires expert skills.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Easy. Vulnerability scanners can detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Exploitation attempts might be logged by security systems, depending on the specific vulnerability and monitoring in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.1] Insecure Plugin Configuration (If using Prettier Plugins) -> [3.1.1] Install or configure malicious Prettier plugins that introduce vulnerabilities or backdoors during the formatting process. [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_3_1__insecure_plugin_configuration__if_using_prettier_plugins__-__3_1_1__install_or_configure_malic_4d56b401.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Prettier supports plugins to extend its functionality. An attacker could trick or convince a user or system to install or configure a malicious Prettier plugin. This plugin could be designed to introduce vulnerabilities, backdoors, or exfiltrate data during the code formatting process.
*   **Impact:** Moderate to Critical. Plugins can have broad access to the code being formatted and the environment Prettier runs in. Malicious plugins could introduce various vulnerabilities, including backdoors for persistent access, data exfiltration of sensitive code or configuration, or modification of formatted code to introduce application-level vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium. Depends on the organization's security awareness and plugin vetting process. If plugins are used without careful scrutiny, the likelihood increases. Social engineering or supply chain tactics could be used to distribute malicious plugins.
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium. Creating a malicious plugin is relatively easy for someone with software development skills. Social engineering or supply chain tactics might be needed to get it installed in a target environment.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Software development skills to create a plugin. Social engineering or supply chain manipulation skills to distribute it.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate to Difficult. Code review of plugins can help, but malicious plugins can be designed to be stealthy and hide their malicious activities. Behavioral analysis and monitoring plugin actions might be necessary for detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [[3.2] Using Prettier on Untrusted Input without Sanitization -> [3.2.1] Pass untrusted or malicious code directly to Prettier without proper sanitization, potentially triggering parser bugs or ReDoS vulnerabilities. [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_3_2__using_prettier_on_untrusted_input_without_sanitization_-__3_2_1__pass_untrusted_or_malicious_c_da8f504c.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If an application uses Prettier to format code that originates from untrusted sources (e.g., user-uploaded code, data from external APIs), and this code is directly passed to Prettier without sanitization, it can expose the application to vulnerabilities in Prettier's core, such as parser bugs or ReDoS.
*   **Impact:** Moderate. Denial of Service (DoS) is the most likely direct impact, caused by parser crashes or ReDoS. Depending on the specific parser bug triggered, other unexpected behaviors or even limited forms of code injection might be theoretically possible, although less probable in the context of a code formatter.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High. If the application processes untrusted code and directly uses Prettier to format it, this is a significant and easily exploitable risk.
*   **Effort:** Low. Crafting malicious input to trigger parser bugs or ReDoS is often relatively easy, especially if the application directly exposes Prettier to external input.
*   **Skill Level:** Medium. Understanding of parser vulnerabilities or ReDoS principles.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Moderate. Can be detected through input validation failures (if validation is attempted after Prettier processing, which is too late), resource monitoring (CPU spikes, crashes), and error logging from Prettier.
