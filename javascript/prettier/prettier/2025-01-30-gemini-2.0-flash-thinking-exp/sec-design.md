# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, Prettier, is a code formatter. The primary business priority it addresses is to ensure consistent code style across software development projects. This consistency leads to improved code readability, reduced cognitive load for developers, and easier code maintenance.

Business goals for Prettier include:
- Enhancing code quality and consistency across diverse projects and teams.
- Improving developer productivity by automating code formatting tasks.
- Reducing time spent on code reviews related to style inconsistencies.
- Facilitating easier collaboration and code maintainability.

Most important business risks associated with Prettier:
- Risk of introducing vulnerabilities into the software development lifecycle if Prettier itself is compromised or contains vulnerabilities.
- Risk of disrupting development workflows if Prettier malfunctions, produces incorrect formatting, or becomes unavailable.
- Risk of supply chain attacks targeting Prettier's dependencies or distribution channels.
- Risk of adoption friction if Prettier is perceived as too opinionated or difficult to integrate into existing workflows.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: GitHub repository access control to manage who can contribute to the project. Implemented in: GitHub repository settings.
- security control: Issue tracking and pull request reviews for code changes. Implemented in: GitHub Issues and Pull Requests.
- security control: Community driven security through open source model and public scrutiny of code. Implemented in: Open GitHub repository.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Prettier.
- accepted risk: Risk of community contributions introducing unintended security issues.
- accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the Node.js ecosystem and npm registry.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Implement Dependency Scanning to identify and monitor known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
- recommended security control: Generate and publish Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to enhance transparency and supply chain security.
- recommended security control: Sign release artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity of distributed versions.
- recommended security control: Regularly perform security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address security weaknesses.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable as Prettier is a command-line tool and library, not a service requiring user authentication. However, authentication is relevant for contributors to the project via GitHub accounts.
- Authorization: Authorization is managed by GitHub repository permissions for contributors. For users of Prettier, authorization is not a direct concern as it operates locally or within CI/CD pipelines under the context of the executing user or system.
- Input validation: Robust input validation is crucial for Prettier. It must correctly parse and handle various code syntax and structures to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities during code formatting. Input validation should be applied to the code being formatted and configuration options.
- Cryptography: Cryptography is not a primary requirement for Prettier's core functionality of code formatting. However, if Prettier implements features like secure configuration storage or communication in the future, cryptographic measures might become relevant. For now, it's not a core security requirement.

# DESIGN

Prettier is designed as a command-line interface (CLI) tool and a library that can be integrated into various development environments and tools. It primarily operates on source code files, parsing them into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), applying formatting rules, and outputting the formatted code.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Maintaining code style consistency across software projects, which indirectly supports code quality, developer productivity, and maintainability.
- The software development lifecycle itself, as Prettier is a tool integrated into this process.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code being formatted: Sensitivity is generally medium to high, as source code is the intellectual property and core asset of software projects. However, Prettier itself does not store or transmit this data; it processes it locally or within CI/CD environments. The risk is more about potential manipulation or exposure during processing if Prettier were compromised.
- Prettier configuration files: Sensitivity is low to medium. Configuration files might contain project-specific style preferences, but they generally do not contain sensitive data.
- Prettier package itself: Sensitivity is medium. The integrity and availability of the Prettier package are important to ensure developers can reliably use it. A compromised package could introduce vulnerabilities into user projects.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the expected scale of usage for Prettier? Is it primarily for individual developers and small teams, or is it also used extensively in large organizations and enterprise environments?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements or industry regulations that Prettier needs to adhere to (e.g., related to data processing or software supply chain)?
- Are there any performance benchmarks or scalability targets for Prettier's formatting process?
- What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in Prettier?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to improve code quality and developer productivity through automated code formatting. The project is intended for wide adoption across the software development community.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Security is important but not the absolute highest priority compared to functionality and usability. The project relies on community contributions and open-source security principles. Standard security practices for open-source Node.js projects are applicable.
- DESIGN: Prettier is designed as a CLI tool and library for local and CI/CD integration. It operates on source code files and configuration files. The deployment model is primarily focused on developer machines and CI/CD environments. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions and includes basic security checks.
