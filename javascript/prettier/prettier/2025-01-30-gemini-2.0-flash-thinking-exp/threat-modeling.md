# Threat Model Analysis for prettier/prettier

## Threat: [Threat 1: Malicious Code Modification via Prettier Bug (High Severity)](./threats/threat_1_malicious_code_modification_via_prettier_bug__high_severity_.md)

*   **Threat:** Code Modification Bug
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a bug in Prettier's core formatting logic. This bug, when triggered by specific code constructs, causes Prettier to incorrectly format code, introducing unintended and potentially malicious changes. The attacker might craft specific code that, when formatted by a vulnerable Prettier version, introduces subtle backdoors or security vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities directly into the codebase, functional defects leading to application malfunction, unexpected application behavior that could be exploited, potential data breaches if introduced vulnerabilities are exploited in production environments.
*   **Prettier Component Affected:** Core formatting engine (parser, printer, code generation modules).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Prettier to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
    *   Implement thorough and security-focused code reviews *after* Prettier formatting to specifically look for unintended logical or security changes introduced by the formatter.
    *   Utilize comprehensive unit and integration tests, including security-focused tests, to detect functional regressions and potential security issues introduced by formatting changes.
    *   Employ static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to automatically scan code for vulnerabilities, especially after automated formatting, to catch any introduced weaknesses.

## Threat: [Threat 2: Supply Chain Attack - Malicious Prettier Package (Critical Severity)](./threats/threat_2_supply_chain_attack_-_malicious_prettier_package__critical_severity_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Package Injection
*   **Description:** A sophisticated attacker compromises the Prettier package on a public package registry (like npmjs.com) or the distribution infrastructure. They replace the legitimate Prettier package with a malicious version that contains backdoors, malware, or code designed to steal credentials or compromise systems. Developers unknowingly install this compromised package as a seemingly normal dependency.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of development environment and potentially deployed applications, malware infection of developer machines and build servers, exfiltration of sensitive data (code, secrets, credentials), compromised build pipelines leading to injection of malicious code into production artifacts, potential for widespread supply chain attacks affecting all users of the compromised package.
*   **Prettier Component Affected:** Entire Prettier package distribution (npm package, yarn package, distribution infrastructure).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory dependency checksum verification:**  Strictly enforce verification of package integrity using checksums (e.g., using `npm audit` or `yarn check` with `--integrity` flag and verifying checksums against known good values).
    *   **Dependency locking and pinning:**  Utilize lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions and prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions. Pin specific versions instead of using ranges.
    *   **Continuous monitoring of dependency security advisories:**  Actively monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases specifically for Prettier and all its dependencies. Subscribe to security mailing lists and use automated vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   **Use reputable and hardened package registries:**  Prefer official and well-maintained package registries. For highly sensitive projects, consider using a private npm registry with stricter access controls and security measures.
    *   **Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools with vulnerability scanning:**  Integrate SCA tools into the development pipeline to automatically scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and malicious code patterns.
    *   **Regular security audits of dependencies:** Conduct periodic security audits of all project dependencies, including Prettier, to identify and mitigate potential risks.
    *   **Network security controls:** Implement network security controls to restrict outbound connections from development and build environments to prevent data exfiltration by compromised packages.
