# Threat Model Analysis for prettier/prettier

## Threat: [Compromised npm Package](./threats/compromised_npm_package.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control of the `prettier` npm package and publishes a malicious version. This could involve injecting code that executes on developer machines during installation or when Prettier is run. The attacker might aim to steal credentials, inject backdoors into projects, or disrupt development workflows.

**Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on developer machines and in CI/CD pipelines. Potential for data exfiltration, supply chain compromise, and introduction of vulnerabilities into the codebase.

**Affected Component:** `prettier` npm package, installation process, command-line interface (CLI), API.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use a package manager lockfile (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
*   Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
*   Verify the integrity of the installed package using checksums or signatures if available.
*   Consider using a private npm registry or repository mirror to control the source of packages.
*   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in the development pipeline.

## Threat: [Malicious Prettier Plugin](./threats/malicious_prettier_plugin.md)

**Description:** An attacker publishes a seemingly legitimate Prettier plugin with malicious code embedded. When developers install and use this plugin, the malicious code executes, potentially performing actions similar to a compromised core package.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on developer machines and in CI/CD pipelines. Potential for data exfiltration, code modification, and introduction of vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** Prettier plugin system, plugin installation process, plugin execution environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet and review the source code of any third-party Prettier plugins before installation.
*   Only install plugins from trusted sources and authors.
*   Be cautious of plugins with a small number of downloads or limited community support.
*   Monitor plugin updates and be wary of unexpected changes or permissions requests.
*   Consider using a plugin isolation mechanism if available (though Prettier doesn't have explicit sandboxing).

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration Files](./threats/malicious_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the project's codebase could introduce malicious Prettier configuration files (e.g., `.prettierrc.js`). Since these files can execute JavaScript code, an attacker could embed malicious scripts that run when Prettier is invoked.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on developer machines and in CI/CD pipelines when Prettier is run.

**Affected Component:** Prettier configuration loading mechanism, `.prettierrc.js` files.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict write access to project files, including configuration files.
*   Implement code review processes for changes to configuration files.
*   Avoid using `.prettierrc.js` if possible and opt for JSON or YAML configuration formats, which do not execute code.
*   If `.prettierrc.js` is necessary, carefully review its contents for any suspicious code.
