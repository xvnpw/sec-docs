# Attack Surface Analysis for prettier/prettier

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Input Code](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_input_code.md)

*   **Description:** Prettier's parsing logic can be vulnerable to specially crafted input, potentially leading to denial of service or other unexpected behavior.
    *   **How Prettier Contributes:** Prettier's core function is to parse and manipulate source code, making it directly susceptible to issues arising from malformed or excessively complex input designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** Providing Prettier with a JavaScript file containing deeply nested expressions or extremely long strings that trigger a bug leading to excessive memory consumption and a denial-of-service condition.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for code execution if a severe parsing vulnerability exists.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Prettier updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Implement timeouts or resource limits when running Prettier, especially in automated environments.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Prettier's direct or transitive dependencies can be exploited.
    *   **How Prettier Contributes:** By including these dependencies, Prettier inherently adopts their potential vulnerabilities, expanding the attack surface of any project using it.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a parsing library used by Prettier could be exploited if Prettier processes malicious code that triggers the vulnerable part of the dependency, potentially leading to code execution.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, information disclosure, denial of service, depending on the nature of the dependency vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit and update Prettier's dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   Use dependency management tools that provide vulnerability scanning and alerting.
        *   Investigate and patch or replace vulnerable dependencies promptly.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks via Compromised Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_via_compromised_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** A malicious actor compromises a dependency used by Prettier, injecting malicious code that gets executed when Prettier is run.
    *   **How Prettier Contributes:** Prettier's reliance on external packages makes it a potential vector for supply chain attacks if its dependencies are compromised.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor gains control of a popular Prettier dependency and injects code that steals environment variables or modifies files when Prettier is run in a CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data exfiltration, compromised development environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or signatures.
        *   Monitor dependency updates and be cautious of unexpected changes.
        *   Consider using trusted registries and mirrors for package installation.
