## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Prettier [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_prettier__critical_node_.md)

**1. Compromise Application via Prettier [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   This is the ultimate goal. Any successful exploitation of the sub-nodes will lead to the compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Formatting [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_formatting__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**2. Inject Malicious Code via Formatting [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   This path focuses on leveraging Prettier's code formatting capabilities to inject malicious code into the application's codebase.
    *   **Exploit Prettier's Code Transformation Logic [CRITICAL NODE]:** This involves manipulating Prettier's core formatting rules to introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   **Introduce Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Attackers craft input code that, when formatted by Prettier, results in output containing unescaped or improperly encoded user-controlled data. This can happen if Prettier makes incorrect assumptions about the context or fails to handle specific edge cases. The formatted code, when rendered in a browser, can execute malicious JavaScript.
        *   **Introduce Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**
            *   While marked in the full tree, if Prettier is used to format server-side template code, attackers could craft input that, after formatting, allows for the injection of malicious template directives, leading to remote code execution on the server.
        *   **Introduce Logic Flaws:**
            *   Attackers might craft code that, when formatted by Prettier, has its logic subtly altered, leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities. This is highly dependent on the specific code and Prettier's formatting rules.
        *   **Introduce Command Injection:**
            *   If Prettier is used to format code that constructs shell commands, attackers could craft input that, after formatting, allows for the injection of arbitrary commands into the shell.
    *   **Exploit Prettier's Handling of Edge Cases/Bugs [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]:** This involves exploiting flaws or unexpected behavior in Prettier's parsing or formatting logic.
        *   **Trigger Parsing Errors Leading to Unexpected Output:**
            *   Attackers can craft specific input code that causes Prettier's parser to fail or produce incorrect output. This unexpected output might introduce vulnerabilities or break the application's functionality.
        *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Prettier [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            *   Attackers can leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific versions of Prettier. These vulnerabilities might allow for arbitrary code execution or other forms of compromise when Prettier processes malicious input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Build/Deployment Pipeline via Prettier [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_builddeployment_pipeline_via_prettier__critical_node_.md)

**3. Compromise the Build/Deployment Pipeline via Prettier [CRITICAL NODE]:**

*   This path targets the infrastructure and processes used to build and deploy the application, using Prettier as an entry point.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack on Prettier Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Inject Malicious Code into Prettier's Dependencies:**
            *   Attackers compromise a dependency that Prettier relies on, injecting malicious code into that dependency. When the application installs Prettier and its dependencies, the malicious code is included in the build.
        *   **Dependency Confusion Attack:**
            *   Attackers upload a malicious package to a public repository with the same name as a private dependency used by Prettier. If the build system is misconfigured, it might download the attacker's malicious package instead of the legitimate one.
    *   **Malicious Prettier Plugin [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Install a Malicious Prettier Plugin:**
            *   Attackers trick developers into installing a malicious Prettier plugin. This plugin can then execute arbitrary code during the formatting process, potentially compromising the build environment or introducing vulnerabilities into the codebase.
        *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Prettier Plugins:**
            *   Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how Prettier handles or executes plugin code. This could allow for the execution of malicious code within the context of the Prettier plugin.
