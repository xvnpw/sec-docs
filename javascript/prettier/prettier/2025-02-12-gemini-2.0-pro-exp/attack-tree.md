## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Prettier Configuration [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_prettier_configuration__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical node because controlling Prettier's configuration allows an attacker to significantly influence its behavior, potentially leading to code execution or malicious code injection.  The configuration dictates how Prettier processes files, and a malicious configuration can exploit this.
*   **Why Critical:**  A single point of control over Prettier's behavior.  If compromised, many other attack vectors become easier.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Malicious `.prettierrc` (or equivalent config file) in Project [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_malicious___prettierrc___or_equivalent_config_file__in_project__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker introduces a malicious `.prettierrc` file (or other configuration file like `.prettierrc.js`, `prettier.config.js`) into the project's repository. This file contains settings designed to exploit Prettier or its plugins, or to directly execute arbitrary code (especially if using a JavaScript-based configuration file).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if the project accepts contributions from untrusted sources or has weak code review practices).
*   **Impact:** High (potential for arbitrary code execution).
*   **Effort:** Low (creating a malicious config file is relatively easy).
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (requires understanding of Prettier configuration and potentially JavaScript if using `.prettierrc.js`).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires careful code review; malicious code might be obfuscated).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review all changes to Prettier configuration files. Treat `.prettierrc.js` and `prettier.config.js` with extreme caution. Prefer simpler formats like JSON or YAML.
    *   **Configuration Validation:** Implement a system to validate Prettier configuration files against a known-good schema or whitelist.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run Prettier with the least necessary privileges.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Consider running Prettier in a sandboxed environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Leverage Prettier's Plugin System [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/3__leverage_prettier's_plugin_system__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical node because Prettier plugins have direct access to Prettier's core functionality and can execute arbitrary JavaScript code.  This makes them a powerful target for attackers.
*    **Why Critical:** Plugins extend Prettier's core functionality and can execute arbitrary code, making them a direct path to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 Malicious Prettier Plugin [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_malicious_prettier_plugin__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes or convinces a developer to install a malicious Prettier plugin. This plugin contains code that executes arbitrary commands or injects malicious code during the formatting process.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (if using third-party plugins).
*   **Impact:** High (potential for arbitrary code execution).
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (creating a malicious plugin is relatively easy).
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (requires understanding of Prettier plugin API and potentially JavaScript).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires careful code review of the plugin; malicious code might be obfuscated).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Plugin Verification:** Carefully vet any Prettier plugins before using them. Examine the source code, check the reputation of the author, and look for suspicious behavior.
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing:** Ideally, Prettier plugins should be run in a sandboxed environment.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run Prettier with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Social Engineering / Prettier Config [CN]](./attack_tree_paths/4__social_engineering__prettier_config__cn_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical node because it bypasses technical defenses by targeting human behavior.  Attackers can trick developers into using malicious configurations or plugins, circumventing security measures.
*   **Why Critical:** Exploits human vulnerabilities, bypassing technical controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1 Tricking a Developer into Using a Malicious Configuration [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_tricking_a_developer_into_using_a_malicious_configuration__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses social engineering techniques (e.g., phishing, impersonation, social media manipulation) to convince a developer to use a malicious Prettier configuration file or install a malicious plugin.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** High (potential for arbitrary code execution).
*   **Effort:** Low (social engineering can be relatively easy).
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (requires social engineering skills).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (requires developer awareness and vigilance).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Train developers to be aware of social engineering tactics.
    *   **Configuration Source Control:** Encourage developers to obtain configurations from trusted sources.
