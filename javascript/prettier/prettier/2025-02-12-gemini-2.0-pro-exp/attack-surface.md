# Attack Surface Analysis for prettier/prettier

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Plugins](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Execution of arbitrary code through compromised or malicious Prettier plugins.  This is the primary direct attack vector.
    *   **How Prettier Contributes:** Prettier's plugin architecture *directly* enables the execution of third-party code during the formatting process. This is inherent to its design.
    *   **Example:** A plugin named `prettier-plugin-evil` is installed. It contains code that, when Prettier runs, injects a backdoor into the formatted code or steals API keys from environment variables.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code execution on the build server or developer's machine.
        *   Data exfiltration (source code, environment variables, API keys).
        *   Introduction of vulnerabilities into the application.
        *   Compromise of the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:** *Only* install plugins from trusted sources (official Prettier plugins or well-known, reputable community plugins with a strong, verifiable history and active maintenance).  Thoroughly examine the plugin's source code and its dependencies *before* installation.
        *   **Dependency Pinning:** Use a lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) and specify *exact* versions of Prettier and *all* plugins in `package.json`.  Never use version ranges (e.g., `^1.2.3` or `~1.2.3`).
        *   **Regular Audits:** Perform frequent security audits of all plugins and their dependencies using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated SCA tools like `snyk`. Automate this process.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run Prettier in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container) with *strictly limited* privileges and *no* network access unless absolutely necessary. This isolates Prettier and its plugins from the host system and other processes.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Mandatory, thorough code reviews *must* include scrutiny of *any* changes introduced by Prettier, especially when new plugins are added or updated. Reviewers should be trained to look for suspicious code patterns.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the user account running Prettier has the *absolute minimum* necessary permissions on the system.

## Attack Surface: [2. Malicious Configuration](./attack_surfaces/2__malicious_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in Prettier itself or, more likely, in its plugins through a crafted configuration file.  This is a direct attack vector, although less common than malicious plugins.
    *   **How Prettier Contributes:** Prettier *directly* reads and interprets configuration files (e.g., `.prettierrc`, `prettier.config.js`), and these files can influence the behavior of Prettier and its plugins.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the `.prettierrc.json` file and adds a configuration option that triggers a known vulnerability in a specific, legitimately installed Prettier plugin, leading to code execution.  Alternatively, a configuration option is used that disables security-related checks within a plugin, making it easier to exploit.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Code execution (less probable than with malicious plugins, but still possible).
        *   Unexpected and potentially harmful code modifications.
        *   Increased susceptibility to other attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Treat Configuration as Code:** Store the Prettier configuration file in version control and subject it to the *same* rigorous security reviews and change control processes as application code.  Any changes to the configuration should be carefully reviewed.
        *   **Configuration Validation:** If technically feasible, validate the configuration file against a schema to prevent the use of unknown, deprecated, or demonstrably dangerous options.
        *   **Limit Configuration Complexity:** Avoid overly complex Prettier configurations, especially those involving custom parsers, rarely used features, or interactions with less-trusted plugins.  Simpler configurations are easier to audit and less likely to contain hidden vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Prettier and *all* plugins updated to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.  This is crucial for mitigating both direct vulnerabilities in Prettier and vulnerabilities in plugins that might be exploitable via configuration.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Indirect):** While you can't directly "sanitize" the configuration file in the same way you would user input, ensure that the environment where Prettier runs is secure and that attackers cannot easily modify the configuration file (e.g., through strict file permissions and access controls).
