# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for prettier/prettier

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration File Integrity and Review](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_file_integrity_and_review.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Configuration File Integrity and Review

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Locate Configuration Files:** Identify all Prettier configuration files within the project. These typically include `.prettierrc`, `.prettierrc.json`, `.prettierrc.js`, `.prettierrc.yaml`, `.prettierrc.toml`, or a `prettier` key within `package.json`.
        2.  **Version Control:** Ensure all identified configuration files are added to the project's version control system (e.g., Git).
        3.  **Code Review Process:** Integrate a mandatory code review step for *any* changes to these configuration files. This review should be performed by at least one other developer familiar with Prettier and security best practices.
        4.  **Review Checklist:** During the code review, the reviewer should specifically check for:
            *   **Unexpected Options:** Any unfamiliar or unusual Prettier options.
            *   **Plugin Changes:** Additions, removals, or version changes of Prettier plugins.
            *   **Custom Rule Modifications:** Any alterations to custom formatting rules.
            *   **Potential Injection Vectors:** Any configuration that could potentially allow the execution of arbitrary code (this is less likely with standard Prettier, but more relevant with custom plugins or configurations that involve external scripts).
        5.  **Approval and Merge:** Only merge changes to the configuration files after they have been thoroughly reviewed and approved.
        6.  **Signed Commits:** Enforce the use of GPG or SSH signed commits for all changes, especially to configuration files. This adds a layer of authentication and non-repudiation.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Malicious Configuration Injection (Severity: High):** A compromised configuration file could be used to inject malicious code or alter code behavior in ways that introduce vulnerabilities. This is the primary threat.
        *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Severity: Medium):** An unintentional error in the configuration could lead to inconsistent formatting or, in rare cases, introduce subtle code changes that could have security implications.
        *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Severity: Medium):** Someone without proper authorization could modify the configuration, potentially introducing vulnerabilities or disrupting the development workflow.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Malicious Configuration Injection:** Risk significantly reduced. Code review and version control make it much harder for malicious configurations to be introduced unnoticed. Signed commits prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Risk reduced. Code review helps catch unintentional errors.
        *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Risk significantly reduced. Version control and signed commits track changes and make unauthorized modifications easily detectable.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Version Control: Yes (all configuration files are in Git).
        *   Code Review: Partially (code reviews are performed, but not always with a specific focus on Prettier configuration).
        *   Signed Commits: No.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Dedicated Prettier Configuration Review Checklist: Needs to be formalized and added to the code review process.
        *   Signed Commits: Needs to be implemented across the development team.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management and Supply Chain Security](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_and_supply_chain_security.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Dependency Management and Supply Chain Security

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Dependency Listing:** Identify all dependencies, including Prettier itself and any Prettier plugins, used in the project. This information is typically found in `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`).
        2.  **Regular Updates:** Establish a schedule for regularly updating dependencies. This could be weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly, depending on the project's risk tolerance.  This includes Prettier and all its plugins.
        3.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate a vulnerability scanning tool (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) into the development workflow. This tool should automatically scan dependencies, *including Prettier and its plugins*, for known vulnerabilities.
        4.  **Automated Alerts:** Configure the vulnerability scanning tool to send alerts (e.g., email, Slack notifications) whenever new vulnerabilities are detected in Prettier or its plugins.
        5.  **Pinning Dependencies:** Ensure that a lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) is used and committed to version control. This locks down the exact versions of all dependencies, *including Prettier and its plugins*, preventing unexpected changes.
        6.  **Plugin Vetting:** Before adding any new Prettier plugin:
            *   **Research:** Thoroughly research the plugin's author, reputation, and community support.
            *   **Source Code Review:** If possible, review the plugin's source code for any potential security issues.
            *   **Approval Process:** Require approval from a designated security team member or lead developer before adding any new plugin.
        7. **SBOM Generation:** Use a tool to generate a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) periodically. This provides a comprehensive list of all software components and their versions, including Prettier and all of its plugins.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks (Severity: Medium):** Vulnerabilities in Prettier or its dependencies (including plugins) could be exploited.
        *   **Use of Outdated/Vulnerable Dependencies (Severity: Medium):** Using outdated versions of Prettier or its dependencies increases the risk of known vulnerabilities being exploited.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk reduced. Regular updates, vulnerability scanning, and plugin vetting minimize the likelihood of using compromised dependencies.
        *   **Use of Outdated/Vulnerable Dependencies:** Risk significantly reduced. Automated scanning and alerts ensure that known vulnerabilities are addressed promptly.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Dependency Listing: Yes (using `package.json` and `package-lock.json`).
        *   Regular Updates: Partially (updates are performed, but not on a strict schedule).
        *   Vulnerability Scanning: No.
        *   Automated Alerts: No.
        *   Pinning Dependencies: Yes (using `package-lock.json`).
        *   Plugin Vetting: Partially (informal review, but no formal process).
        *   SBOM Generation: No.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formalized Update Schedule: Needs a defined schedule for dependency updates.
        *   Vulnerability Scanning Tool Integration: Needs to be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Automated Vulnerability Alerts: Needs to be configured.
        *   Formal Plugin Vetting Process: Needs a documented approval process.
        *   SBOM Generation: Needs to be implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Consistent Formatting and Team Practices (Focusing on Prettier Execution)](./mitigation_strategies/consistent_formatting_and_team_practices__focusing_on_prettier_execution_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Consistent Formatting and Team Practices (Focusing on Prettier Execution)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate Prettier into the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This should be a mandatory step that runs automatically on every code commit or pull request.  This is a direct use of the `prettier` command.
        2.  **Formatting Check:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline to run Prettier in "check" mode (e.g., `prettier --check .`). This will report any files that are not formatted according to the defined configuration, without automatically modifying them. This is a direct use of the `prettier` command.
        3.  **Build Failure:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline to fail the build if any files fail the Prettier check. This prevents unformatted code from being merged into the main codebase.
        4.  **Pre-commit Hooks:** Set up pre-commit hooks (e.g., using Husky) to automatically run Prettier (e.g., `prettier --write .`) on staged files before they are committed. This provides immediate feedback to developers and prevents them from committing unformatted code. This is a direct use of the `prettier` command.
        5.  **Editor Integration:** Provide instructions and support for developers to integrate Prettier into their preferred code editors (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, IntelliJ). This allows for automatic formatting on save, making it easier to adhere to the formatting rules. This relies on the editor's Prettier plugin, which in turn uses the `prettier` library.
        6. **Documentation:** Clearly document the project's formatting guidelines, including the specific Prettier configuration used.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Inconsistent Formatting (Severity: Low):** Inconsistent formatting can make it harder to read and understand code, potentially masking subtle differences that could be security-relevant.
        *   **Code Review Inefficiencies (Severity: Low):** Inconsistent formatting can waste time during code reviews.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Inconsistent Formatting:** Risk significantly reduced. CI/CD integration and pre-commit hooks enforce consistent formatting.
        *   **Code Review Inefficiencies:** Risk reduced. Consistent formatting makes code reviews more efficient.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   CI/CD Integration: Partially (Prettier is run, but not in "check" mode, and builds don't always fail).
        *   Formatting Check: No.
        *   Build Failure: No.
        *   Pre-commit Hooks: No.
        *   Editor Integration: Partially (some developers have integrated Prettier, but it's not standardized).
        *   Documentation: Partially (some documentation exists, but it's not comprehensive).

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   CI/CD "Check" Mode and Build Failure: Needs to be configured to enforce formatting.
        *   Pre-commit Hooks: Needs to be implemented and enforced.
        *   Standardized Editor Integration: Needs clear instructions and support.
        *   Comprehensive Documentation: Needs to be updated.
