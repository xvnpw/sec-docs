# Attack Surface Analysis for prettier/prettier

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Input Files](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_input_files.md)

*   **Description:** Input files containing code designed to exploit vulnerabilities in Prettier's parsing or formatting logic.
    *   **How Prettier Contributes:** Prettier's core function is to parse and manipulate code. Bugs in its parsing implementation can be triggered by specific input patterns.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a specially crafted JavaScript file with deeply nested structures that overwhelms Prettier's parser, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for code execution if underlying parsing libraries have vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize input from untrusted sources before processing with Prettier.
        *   Keep Prettier updated to benefit from bug fixes.
        *   Consider implementing input size limits for Prettier processing.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Prettier Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_prettier_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting security flaws in third-party plugins used to extend Prettier's functionality.
    *   **How Prettier Contributes:** Prettier loads and executes plugin code, inheriting any vulnerabilities present in those plugins.
    *   **Example:** A malicious Prettier plugin contains code that exfiltrates sensitive data from the project's files during the formatting process.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data exfiltration, compromise of the development environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit any Prettier plugins before installation.
        *   Keep plugins updated to their latest versions.
        *   Minimize the number of plugins used.
        *   Consider using only officially maintained or highly reputable plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Attacks via Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_attacks_via_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Prettier's dependencies being exploited.
    *   **How Prettier Contributes:** Prettier relies on numerous Node.js packages. If any of these dependencies have vulnerabilities, Prettier indirectly becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in a core dependency used by Prettier for parsing. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability if Prettier is using the affected version.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, compromise of the development environment.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Prettier and all its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
