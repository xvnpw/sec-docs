# Threat Model Analysis for prettier/prettier

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Compromised Prettier Package](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_compromised_prettier_package.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the official Prettier package on a package registry (e.g., npm) or gains access to the maintainer's account. They then inject malicious code into a new version of the Prettier package. When developers install or update to this compromised version, the malicious code is executed on their machines or within the build pipeline. The attacker might aim to exfiltrate sensitive data from the developer's environment, install backdoors, or manipulate the application's code during the formatting process.

**Impact:** Critical
* Compromise of developer machines and build environments.
* Potential injection of malicious code into the final application codebase.
* Data breaches and supply chain attacks affecting downstream users.

**Affected Component:** npm package

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize dependency scanning tools that check for known vulnerabilities and malicious packages.
* Verify package integrity using checksums or signatures provided by the Prettier team (if available).
* Pin specific versions of Prettier in your project's dependency file (e.g., `package.json`) to avoid automatically installing compromised updates.
* Monitor security advisories and announcements from the Prettier team and the package registry.
* Consider using a private package registry with stricter access controls and security scanning.

## Threat: [Accidental Introduction of Vulnerabilities through Buggy Formatting Logic](./threats/accidental_introduction_of_vulnerabilities_through_buggy_formatting_logic.md)

**Description:** A bug exists within Prettier's formatting logic that, under specific circumstances, unintentionally modifies code in a way that introduces a security vulnerability. For example, it might reorder code in a security-sensitive context, leading to a logic flaw or a race condition. The attacker could then exploit this newly introduced vulnerability in the deployed application.

**Impact:** High
* Introduction of exploitable vulnerabilities into the application.
* Potential for data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Formatting logic (within various modules responsible for parsing and re-emitting code for different languages)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly review code changes introduced by Prettier, especially in security-critical sections.
* Implement comprehensive unit and integration tests that cover security-relevant scenarios.
* Utilize static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to detect potential vulnerabilities introduced by code changes.
* Stay updated with Prettier releases and bug fixes, paying attention to any reports related to incorrect code transformations.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack Targeting Prettier's Dependencies](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack_targeting_prettier's_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as one of Prettier's internal dependencies on a public package registry. If the project's build system is misconfigured or prioritizes the public registry over a private one, it might mistakenly install the attacker's malicious package instead of the legitimate internal dependency of Prettier. This could lead to the execution of malicious code within the Prettier process or the build environment.

**Impact:** High
* Potential compromise of the build environment or the Prettier process.
* Introduction of malicious code that could affect the application.

**Affected Component:** Dependency management within Prettier and the project's build system.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure package managers to prioritize private or internal registries over public ones.
* Use namespace prefixes for internal packages to avoid naming conflicts.
* Implement strict dependency management policies and review the project's dependency tree.
* Utilize tools that help detect and prevent dependency confusion attacks.
