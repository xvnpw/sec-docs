## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Malicious Input Processing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_malicious_input_processing.md)

This path focuses on manipulating the code input provided to Prettier to introduce malicious elements during the formatting process.

* **Inject Malicious Code via Formatting [HR] [CN]:** The core of this high-risk path. An attacker aims to craft input code that, when processed by Prettier, results in the introduction of executable malicious code into the application's codebase.

    * **Exploit Template Literal Handling [HR] [CN]:**
        * **Attack Vector:**  An attacker crafts input code where user-controlled data is directly embedded within template literals without proper sanitization. Prettier's formatting might not escape or neutralize malicious JavaScript within these literals, leading to its execution in the browser or server-side environment.
        * **Example:**  `const userInput = '<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS")>'; const formatted = `<div>${userInput}</div>`;`  After formatting, this could still be a valid XSS payload.

    * **Exploit String Concatenation/Interpolation [CN]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides input that, after Prettier's formatting rules are applied, results in unintended string concatenation or interpolation that constructs and executes malicious code. This often involves manipulating how strings are joined or how variables are embedded within strings.
        * **Example:**  Input like `const a = 'func'; const b = 'tion'; const c = 'alert("evil")';  a + b + c;` might be formatted in a way that makes the dynamic execution more apparent or exploitable in the target environment.

    * **Exploit Comment Handling [CN]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious code within comments, hoping that due to parsing errors or specific formatting rules within Prettier, these comments are not correctly handled and are inadvertently interpreted as executable code by the JavaScript engine or a downstream processor.
        * **Example:**  Crafting comments that, after formatting, might break out of the comment block or be interpreted as conditional execution based on specific parser behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Nodes:](./attack_tree_paths/critical_nodes.md)

* **Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities [CN]:**
    * **Utilize Malicious Prettier Plugins [CN]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** If the application uses Prettier plugins, an attacker could introduce a malicious plugin. This plugin, when invoked during the formatting process, could execute arbitrary code on the server or client, potentially compromising the entire application.
        * **Example:** A plugin designed to modify the formatted code in a way that introduces backdoors or exfiltrates data.

* **Exploit Supply Chain Vulnerabilities [CN]:**
    * **Compromise Prettier Package [CN]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises the official Prettier package on a package registry (like npm). They replace the legitimate code with a malicious version. Any application downloading this compromised package will unknowingly include the malicious code.
        * **Impact:** This is a highly impactful attack, potentially affecting a large number of applications.

    * **Compromise Prettier Dependencies [CN]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Prettier relies on other software packages (dependencies). If an attacker compromises one of these dependencies and injects malicious code, Prettier (and any application using it) could be vulnerable when that dependency's code is executed during the formatting process.
        * **Example:** A compromised dependency could be used to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary commands during Prettier's operation.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Prettier's Core Logic [CN]:**
    * **Parsing Errors [CN]:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific input code that exploits bugs or vulnerabilities in Prettier's code parsing logic. This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even the execution of arbitrary code if the parsing error can be leveraged.
        * **Example:** Providing malformed JavaScript that causes Prettier's parser to enter an unexpected state, potentially allowing for code injection.
