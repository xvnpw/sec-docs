- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Prettier Plugin
  - **Description:**  
    When using this extension in a trusted workspace, the extension loads Prettier from the project’s local dependencies and automatically registers any Prettier plugins specified in the project’s configuration (for example, via a `.prettierrc` file). An attacker can craft a repository that includes a malicious Prettier plugin. If a user opens such a repository and marks it as trusted, triggering a formatting operation will cause the malicious plugin code to be loaded and executed. The attack flow is as follows:  
    1. The attacker creates a repository with a deliberately crafted `.prettierrc` file that references a malicious plugin (e.g., `prettier-plugin-malicious`).  
    2. The repository includes this malicious plugin as a dependency.  
    3. The victim opens the repository in VS Code and accepts the workspace as trusted.  
    4. Formatting a supported file (using either “Format Document” or “Format Selection”) causes the extension to load the local Prettier and its plugins, thereby executing the malicious code.
    
  - **Impact:**  
    Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with the same privileges as the VS Code process. This can result in full system compromise, unauthorized data access or exfiltration, installation of additional malware, and other harmful actions on the victim’s machine.
    
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The extension leverages VS Code’s Workspace Trust feature. When a workspace is marked as untrusted, the extension deliberately uses only the bundled version of Prettier, and no local or global modules (including plugins) are loaded. This mechanism helps prevent the execution of arbitrary code from a repository that has not been explicitly trusted by the user.
    
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - There is no additional verification (such as integrity checking or signature validation) of the local Prettier plugins that are loaded in a trusted workspace.  
    - No sandboxing mechanism is used when executing plugin code.  
    - The extension does not prompt for explicit consent or show warnings when new plugins are loaded for the first time in a trusted workspace.
    
  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The user must open the repository and mark the workspace as trusted.  
    - The repository contains a malicious Prettier configuration (for example, a `.prettierrc` file) that references a compromised plugin.  
    - The project’s dependencies include the malicious plugin which is then loaded by the extension.
    
  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - The project documentation (in `README.md`) explains that when a local Prettier installation is detected, the extension defers to that version (including any plugins declared in the project’s configuration).  
    - In a trusted workspace, the extension bypasses the safe built-in Prettier in favor of the local module. The module resolution logic (which is invoked during formatting operations) does not incorporate any integrity or authenticity checks on the plugins being loaded.  
    - As a result, when a file is formatted, the extension calls into the local Prettier code. If that code includes a malicious plugin, the plugin logic is executed without additional verification or sandbox restrictions.
    
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Setup a Test Repository:**  
       - Create a new repository containing a basic source file (e.g., a simple JavaScript file).  
       - Add a `.prettierrc` configuration file that includes a reference to a custom plugin (for instance, `"plugins": ["prettier-plugin-malicious"]`).  
    2. **Craft a Malicious Plugin:**  
       - Develop a simple Node.js package named `prettier-plugin-malicious` whose main module executes a noticeable side effect (such as writing a marker file to the file system or launching a system command).  
       - Include this package in the repository’s `package.json` as a dependency.
    3. **Mark Workspace as Trusted:**  
       - Open the repository in Visual Studio Code and, when prompted (or via the Workspace Trust prompt), mark the workspace as trusted.
    4. **Trigger the Vulnerability:**  
       - Open the source file and trigger the format operation (using “Format Document” or the command palette’s “Format Document” command).  
       - Observe that the Prettier process loads the local configuration and, with it, the malicious plugin.
    5. **Verify Exploitation:**  
       - Check for the side effect introduced by the malicious plugin (e.g., confirm that the marker file was created or that the system command was executed).  
       - Document the results to confirm that the malicious code was indeed executed as a direct result of the formatting invocation.
