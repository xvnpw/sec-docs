## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability: Unsafe module loading via `prettier.prettierPath` setting

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unsafe module loading via `prettier.prettierPath` setting

- **Description:**
    The Prettier VS Code extension allows users to specify a custom path to the Prettier module using the `prettier.prettierPath` setting. If a user is tricked into setting this path to a directory containing a malicious Prettier module, the extension will load and execute this malicious module during code formatting. While the extension prompts for confirmation before loading a Prettier module outside the workspace, users may still inadvertently approve loading a malicious module if they are socially engineered or unaware of the security risks.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker convinces a user to set the `prettier.prettierPath` setting in VS Code to point to a directory controlled by the attacker. This could be achieved through social engineering or by exploiting another vulnerability to modify VS Code settings.
    2. The attacker places a malicious Prettier module (e.g., `index.js` inside a directory) at the path specified in `prettier.prettierPath`. This malicious module contains code that the attacker wants to execute on the user's machine.
    3. The user opens a code file in VS Code that is supported by Prettier and attempts to format it (e.g., by using "Format Document" command or format on save).
    4. The Prettier VS Code extension attempts to load the Prettier module from the path specified in `prettier.prettierPath`.
    5. VS Code shows a prompt asking the user to allow or disallow loading the Prettier module from the specified location.
    6. If the user mistakenly allows loading the module, the malicious Prettier module is loaded and its code is executed by the extension, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.

- **Impact:**
    Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine. An attacker can potentially gain full control over the user's system, steal sensitive information, or perform other malicious actions.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Prompt to confirm loading Prettier module from a custom path: When the extension attempts to load a Prettier module from a location outside the workspace (or potentially from a custom `prettierPath`), VS Code displays a prompt asking the user to explicitly allow or disallow this action. This provides a warning to the user but relies on the user's awareness and caution.
    - Workspace Trust: In untrusted workspaces, the extension restricts loading of external modules, including those specified by `prettier.prettierPath`. This significantly reduces the risk in scenarios where users open untrusted projects.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and path sanitization for `prettier.prettierPath`: The extension should validate and sanitize the path provided in `prettier.prettierPath` to ensure it points to a valid Prettier module directory and prevent path traversal or other malicious path manipulations.
    - Restricting `prettier.prettierPath` to workspace-relative paths or predefined safe locations: Instead of allowing arbitrary paths, the extension could limit `prettier.prettierPath` to paths relative to the workspace root or a set of predefined safe directories.
    - Stronger warnings and guidance in the confirmation prompt: The confirmation prompt could be enhanced with more explicit warnings about the security risks of loading external modules and guidance on how to verify the legitimacy of the module source.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the Prettier VS Code extension installed and enabled.
    - An attacker must be able to convince the user to set the `prettier.prettierPath` setting to a malicious path.
    - The user must mistakenly approve the VS Code prompt to load the Prettier module from the specified malicious path.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    (Source code not provided, analysis based on documentation and behavior)
    1. The extension reads the `prettier.prettierPath` setting from VS Code configuration.
    2. When formatting is triggered, the extension attempts to resolve and load the Prettier module from the path specified in `prettier.prettierPath`, if set.
    3. VS Code's module loading mechanism is used to load the module. VS Code likely provides a mechanism to prompt users when loading modules from paths outside the workspace for security reasons, and this extension leverages that.
    4. If the user allows loading the module, the code within the resolved Prettier module (specifically, the module's entry point, typically `index.js`) is executed as part of the formatting process.
    5. If a malicious module is placed at the specified path, its malicious code will be executed at this point.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a directory named `malicious-prettier` in a temporary location.
    2. Inside `malicious-prettier`, create a file named `index.js` with the following content:
        ```javascript
        console.error("Malicious Prettier Module Loaded!");
        require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/malicious_prettier_executed');
        module.exports = { format: (text) => text }; // Dummy format function to avoid errors
        ```
    3. Open VS Code and go to Settings (Ctrl+,).
    4. Search for "prettier path" and locate the `Prettier › Prettier Path` setting.
    5. Set the `Prettier: Prettier Path` setting to the absolute path of the `malicious-prettier` directory you created (e.g., `/tmp/malicious-prettier` if you created it in `/tmp`).
    6. Open a Javascript file (or any file Prettier can format) in VS Code.
    7. Run the "Format Document" command (Shift+Alt+F).
    8. VS Code will show a prompt asking "Do you want to allow running code from 'malicious-prettier'?". Click "Allow".
    9. Check if the file `/tmp/malicious_prettier_executed` exists. If it exists, it means the malicious code within `index.js` was executed, confirming the vulnerability.
    10. Also, check the "Prettier" output panel in VS Code for the "Malicious Prettier Module Loaded!" error message, which should be printed if the malicious module is loaded.

### Vulnerability: Unsafe configuration loading via `prettier.configPath` setting

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unsafe configuration loading via `prettier.configPath` setting

- **Description:**
    Similar to the module loading vulnerability, the Prettier VS Code extension allows users to specify a custom path to a Prettier configuration file using the `prettier.configPath` setting. If a user is tricked into setting this path to a malicious configuration file (especially if it's a Javascript configuration file like `prettier.config.js`), and if the extension executes code within these configuration files (which is possible with Javascript configuration files in Prettier), it could lead to arbitrary code execution.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. An attacker convinces a user to set the `prettier.configPath` setting in VS Code to point to a malicious configuration file. This could be achieved through social engineering or by exploiting another vulnerability to modify VS Code settings.
    2. The attacker creates a malicious Prettier configuration file (e.g., `prettier.config.js`) at the path specified in `prettier.configPath`. This malicious configuration file contains Javascript code that the attacker wants to execute on the user's machine.
    3. The user opens a code file in VS Code that is supported by Prettier and attempts to format it.
    4. The Prettier VS Code extension attempts to load the Prettier configuration from the path specified in `prettier.configPath`.
    5. If the configuration file is a Javascript file (like `prettier.config.js`), Prettier itself might execute the code within this file during configuration loading, and consequently, the extension indirectly triggers this execution.
    6. This leads to arbitrary code execution on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.

- **Impact:**
    Arbitrary code execution on the user's machine, similar to the module loading vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Workspace Trust: As with module loading, Workspace Trust likely restricts the loading of configuration files from arbitrary paths in untrusted workspaces, mitigating the risk in those scenarios.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and path sanitization for `prettier.configPath`: Similar to `prettier.prettierPath`, the extension should validate and sanitize the path provided in `prettier.configPath`.
    - Restricting `prettier.configPath` to workspace-relative paths or predefined safe locations.
    - Warning against using Javascript configuration files (`prettier.config.js`) when using custom `configPath`, or sandboxing the execution of these files if possible.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the Prettier VS Code extension installed and enabled.
    - An attacker must be able to convince the user to set the `prettier.configPath` setting to a malicious path pointing to a Javascript configuration file.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    (Source code not provided, analysis based on documentation and Prettier behavior)
    1. The extension reads the `prettier.configPath` setting from VS Code configuration.
    2. When formatting is triggered, the extension attempts to resolve and load the Prettier configuration from the path specified in `prettier.configPath`, if set.
    3. Prettier's configuration loading mechanism is used. Prettier itself supports Javascript configuration files (`prettier.config.js`) and executes them to resolve the configuration.
    4. If the user has set `prettier.configPath` to a malicious Javascript file, Prettier will execute the code within this file.
    5. This execution happens within the context of the VS Code extension, leading to potential arbitrary code execution.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a directory named `malicious-config` in a temporary location.
    2. Inside `malicious-config`, create a file named `prettier.config.js` with the following content:
        ```javascript
        console.error("Malicious Prettier Config Loaded and Executed!");
        require('child_process').execSync('touch /tmp/malicious_config_executed');
        module.exports = {}; // Empty config to avoid errors
        ```
    3. Open VS Code and go to Settings (Ctrl+,).
    4. Search for "prettier config path" and locate the `Prettier › Config Path` setting.
    5. Set the `Prettier: Config Path` setting to the absolute path of the `malicious-config/prettier.config.js` file you created (e.g., `/tmp/malicious-config/prettier.config.js` if you created it in `/tmp`).
    6. Open a Javascript file (or any file Prettier can format) in VS Code.
    7. Run the "Format Document" command (Shift+Alt+F).
    8. Check if the file `/tmp/malicious_config_executed` exists. If it exists, it means the malicious code within `prettier.config.js` was executed, confirming the vulnerability.
    9. Also, check the "Prettier" output panel in VS Code for the "Malicious Prettier Config Loaded and Executed!" error message.


### Vulnerability: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Prettier Plugin

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Prettier Plugin

- **Description:**
    When using this extension in a trusted workspace, the extension loads Prettier from the project’s local dependencies and automatically registers any Prettier plugins specified in the project’s configuration (for example, via a `.prettierrc` file). An attacker can craft a repository that includes a malicious Prettier plugin. If a user opens such a repository and marks it as trusted, triggering a formatting operation will cause the malicious plugin code to be loaded and executed. The attack flow is as follows:
    1. The attacker creates a repository with a deliberately crafted `.prettierrc` file that references a malicious plugin (e.g., `prettier-plugin-malicious`).
    2. The repository includes this malicious plugin as a dependency.
    3. The victim opens the repository in VS Code and accepts the workspace as trusted.
    4. Formatting a supported file (using either “Format Document” or “Format Selection”) causes the extension to load the local Prettier and its plugins, thereby executing the malicious code.

- **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution with the same privileges as the VS Code process. This can result in full system compromise, unauthorized data access or exfiltration, installation of additional malware, and other harmful actions on the victim’s machine.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension leverages VS Code’s Workspace Trust feature. When a workspace is marked as untrusted, the extension deliberately uses only the bundled version of Prettier, and no local or global modules (including plugins) are loaded. This mechanism helps prevent the execution of arbitrary code from a repository that has not been explicitly trusted by the user.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no additional verification (such as integrity checking or signature validation) of the local Prettier plugins that are loaded in a trusted workspace.
    - No sandboxing mechanism is used when executing plugin code.
    - The extension does not prompt for explicit consent or show warnings when new plugins are loaded for the first time in a trusted workspace.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must open the repository and mark the workspace as trusted.
    - The repository contains a malicious Prettier configuration (for example, a `.prettierrc` file) that references a compromised plugin.
    - The project’s dependencies include the malicious plugin which is then loaded by the extension.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The project documentation (in `README.md`) explains that when a local Prettier installation is detected, the extension defers to that version (including any plugins declared in the project’s configuration).
    - In a trusted workspace, the extension bypasses the safe built-in Prettier in favor of the local module. The module resolution logic (which is invoked during formatting operations) does not incorporate any integrity or authenticity checks on the plugins being loaded.
    - As a result, when a file is formatted, the extension calls into the local Prettier code. If that code includes a malicious plugin, the plugin logic is executed without additional verification or sandbox restrictions.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup a Test Repository:**
       - Create a new repository containing a basic source file (e.g., a simple JavaScript file).
       - Add a `.prettierrc` configuration file that includes a reference to a custom plugin (for instance, `"plugins": ["prettier-plugin-malicious"]`).
    2. **Craft a Malicious Plugin:**
       - Develop a simple Node.js package named `prettier-plugin-malicious` whose main module executes a noticeable side effect (such as writing a marker file to the file system or launching a system command).
       - Include this package in the repository’s `package.json` as a dependency.
    3. **Mark Workspace as Trusted:**
       - Open the repository in Visual Studio Code and, when prompted (or via the Workspace Trust prompt), mark the workspace as trusted.
    4. **Trigger the Vulnerability:**
       - Open the source file and trigger the format operation (using “Format Document” or the command palette’s “Format Document” command).
       - Observe that the Prettier process loads the local configuration and, with it, the malicious plugin.
    5. **Verify Exploitation:**
       - Check for the side effect introduced by the malicious plugin (e.g., confirm that the marker file was created or that the system command was executed).
       - Document the results to confirm that the malicious code was indeed executed as a direct result of the formatting invocation.
