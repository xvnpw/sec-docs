*   **Threat:** Denial of Service through Malicious Input
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted code snippet as input to Prettier. This input exploits a vulnerability in Prettier's parsing or formatting logic, causing the application to hang indefinitely, crash, or consume excessive resources (CPU, memory). This could occur during local development or in CI/CD pipelines.
    *   **Impact:**  Disruption of development workflows, build failures in CI/CD, and resource exhaustion on the machine running Prettier.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Prettier's core parsing logic, specific language formatters (e.g., JavaScript, CSS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Prettier to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Implement timeouts when running Prettier in automated environments (e.g., CI/CD) to prevent indefinite hangs.
        *   If accepting user-provided code for formatting (highly discouraged), implement strict input validation and sanitization *before* passing it to Prettier.
        *   Monitor resource usage when running Prettier, especially with untrusted input.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Package
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official Prettier package on npm (or other package registries). This could involve injecting malicious code into the package itself. When developers install or update Prettier, they unknowingly download and execute the malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Widespread compromise of developer machines and CI/CD environments, potentially leading to data breaches, code injection into applications, or other severe security incidents.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Prettier package distributed through package registries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use package managers with integrity checking features (e.g., `npm` with lockfiles, `yarn`).
        *   Monitor for unexpected changes in Prettier's dependencies or package checksums.
        *   Consider using a private package registry to have more control over the packages used.
        *   Implement security scanning of downloaded packages.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Prettier relies on a number of third-party JavaScript libraries (dependencies). A vulnerability in one of these dependencies could be exploited *through Prettier's code* if Prettier uses the vulnerable component in a susceptible way. An attacker could potentially leverage this to execute arbitrary code on the machine running Prettier. This is specifically when the vulnerability is exposed due to how Prettier integrates and uses the dependency.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on developer machines or CI/CD servers, potentially leading to data theft, malware installation, or compromise of the development environment.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Node modules used by Prettier, where Prettier's code interacts with the vulnerable part of the dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Prettier to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for dependency vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly audit Prettier's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.
        *   Consider using dependency management tools that provide vulnerability scanning and alerting.
        *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) in the development pipeline.
