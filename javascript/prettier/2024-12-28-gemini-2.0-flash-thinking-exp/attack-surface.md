*   **Compromised Direct Dependencies**
    *   **Description:**  One of Prettier's direct dependencies is compromised with malicious code.
    *   **How Prettier Contributes:** Prettier relies on these dependencies for various functionalities. If a dependency is compromised, the malicious code can be executed within the Prettier process.
    *   **Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the repository of a direct dependency and injects code that exfiltrates environment variables or modifies the formatting output in a harmful way.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the development environment, potential for malicious code to be injected into the codebase during formatting, supply chain attack affecting all projects using that version of Prettier.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, yarn audit, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in Prettier's dependencies.
        *   Keep Prettier and its dependencies updated to the latest versions with security patches.
        *   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) practices to track dependencies.
        *   Consider using tools that verify the integrity of downloaded packages (e.g., checking checksums).

*   **Compromised Prettier Plugin**
    *   **Description:** A Prettier plugin itself is intentionally created or modified to contain malicious code.
    *   **How Prettier Contributes:** Prettier's plugin architecture allows external code to be executed during the formatting process. A malicious plugin can leverage this to perform harmful actions.
    *   **Example:** A plugin is created that appears to offer useful formatting features but also includes code that exfiltrates sensitive data from the development environment or modifies the output to inject vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the development environment, potential for malicious code injection into the codebase, supply chain attack if the plugin is widely used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Exercise extreme caution when installing Prettier plugins. Only install plugins from trusted sources with a strong community reputation.
        *   Review the plugin's code if possible before installation.
        *   Be wary of plugins that request excessive permissions or access to sensitive data.
        *   Regularly audit installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or seem suspicious.
