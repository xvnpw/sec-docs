### Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Command Injection via `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args`
  - **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace.
    2. The attacker includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file within the workspace.
    3. In the `settings.json`, the attacker sets the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` setting to a malicious value containing shell commands. For example: `["--allow-all", "; touch /tmp/pwned ;"]`.
    4. The attacker tricks a victim user into opening this malicious workspace in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    5. The victim user opens a test file (e.g., a file containing `Deno.test`).
    6. The Deno extension displays a "Run Test" code lens above the test definition.
    7. When the victim user clicks the "Run Test" code lens, the extension executes a Deno CLI command to run the test.
    8. Due to the malicious configuration in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args`, the injected shell commands are executed by the system, in addition to the intended Deno test command.
  - **Impact:**
    Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system depending on the privileges of the user running VSCode.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** high
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None apparent from the provided documentation. It is unclear from the documentation if the extension sanitizes or validates these arguments before passing them to the Deno CLI.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization: The Deno extension should sanitize the arguments provided in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings before passing them to the Deno CLI. This should include removing or escaping shell metacharacters and command separators to prevent command injection.
    - Parameterized command execution: If possible, the extension should use parameterized command execution APIs to execute the Deno CLI commands, which can help avoid shell injection vulnerabilities.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - User must have the vscode-deno extension installed.
    - User must have Deno CLI installed.
    - User must have a workspace configured with vscode-deno enabled.
    - User or a malicious workspace configuration must have set `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` to contain malicious commands.
    - User must trigger a test run via code lens or test explorer.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```
    Unfortunately, source code for this extension is not provided in PROJECT FILES.
    To confirm this vulnerability, the source code needs to be examined, specifically:
    1. Identify the code section where the extension constructs the command to execute Deno CLI for running tests (both via code lens and test explorer).
    2. Check how the extension retrieves and handles the values of `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings.
    3. Analyze if these arguments are directly concatenated into the command string without any sanitization or escaping before being passed to the Deno CLI.

    If the code directly uses these settings as part of the command without sanitization, then the vulnerability is confirmed.

    For example, a vulnerable code snippet might look like this (pseudocode):
      ```
      function runTestCodeLens(testFile: string, testName: string): void {
          const denoExecutable = getDenoExecutablePath();
          const testArgs = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('deno').get<string[]>('codeLens.testArgs') || [];
          const command = `${denoExecutable} test ${testFile} ${testArgs.join(' ')}`; // POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE LINE
          childProcess.exec(command, ...);
      }
      ```
      In this hypothetical example, the `testArgs.join(' ')` part, if not sanitized, could allow injection of arbitrary commands.
    ```
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-workspace`.
    2. Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
       ```json
       {
         "deno.codeLens.testArgs": ["--allow-all", "; touch /tmp/pwned-by-deno-extension ;"]
       }
       ```
    4. Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a file named `test_example.ts` with the following content:
       ```typescript
       Deno.test("example test", () => {
         console.log("Running example test");
       });
       ```
    5. Open Visual Studio Code.
    6. Open the `malicious-workspace` folder in VSCode (File -> Open Folder... -> `malicious-workspace`).
    7. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace.
    8. Open the `test_example.ts` file in the editor.
    9. Observe the "Run Test" code lens appearing above the `Deno.test` definition.
    10. Click the "Run Test" code lens.
    11. After the test execution completes (or even if it fails), check if the file `/tmp/pwned-by-deno-extension` has been created.
    12. If the file `/tmp/pwned-by-deno-extension` exists, it indicates that the command injection was successful, and the vulnerability is valid.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Remote Debugger Exposure via `deno.internalInspect`
  - **Description:**
    - The extension exposes a configuration option (`deno.internalInspect`) that, when enabled, starts an inspector server for the JavaScript runtime hosting the Deno Language Server.
    - An attacker could manipulate a deployment or convince a user to enable this (or “debug”) mode.
    - If the inspector server is not explicitly bound to a secure loopback interface or protected by authentication, an external actor on the same network may be able to connect.
    - Once connected, the attacker may issue inspector commands to read memory, alter execution flow, or inject code.
  - **Impact:**
    - Potential remote code execution (RCE) or full compromise of the host running the extension.
    - Unauthorized debugging access could allow an attacker to bypass other security boundaries in the system.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The feature is gated behind an explicit configuration option (`deno.internalInspect`), which is not enabled by default.
    - The design assumes that users will only enable internal debugging in a trusted, local development environment.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No enforced network binding restrictions (e.g., ensuring the inspector only listens on localhost).
    - No authentication or access control on the inspector endpoint.
    - No runtime check to refuse debug connections unless the environment is verified as trusted.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user (or an attacker convincing the user) enables `deno.internalInspect` in the configuration.
    - The inspector server is bound in a way that makes it accessible on a network interface beyond the local loopback.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The project’s settings documentation clearly lists `deno.internalInspect` as an available option.
    - When enabled, this setting is passed directly to the Deno Language Server process.
    - There is no code in the provided files (or corresponding startup scripts) that validates that the inspector server is bound only to localhost or that enforces any form of connection authentication.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - **Step 1:** Create a test VSCode workspace and add a settings file that enables `"deno.internalInspect": true`.
    - **Step 2:** Launch the extension so it starts the language server with debugging enabled.
    - **Step 3:** From a separate machine or terminal, scan the network to identify any open inspector ports.
    - **Step 4:** Attempt to connect to the discovered port using a debugger client (such as Chrome DevTools or a Node inspector client).
    - **Step 5:** Verify whether you can issue inspector commands (e.g., pause execution, inspect variables) confirming unauthorized access.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Deno Path Execution via Workspace Settings Override
  - **Description:**
    - The extension uses the `deno.path` setting to locate the Deno CLI executable. This setting can be set in user or workspace configuration (for example, within a committed `.vscode/settings.json` file).
    - An attacker who controls a public repository may include a malicious workspace configuration file that redefines `deno.path`—pointing not to the genuine Deno binary but to a hostile executable (or script) bundled within the repository.
    - When a user opens and trusts this repository in VSCode, the extension will use the provided `deno.path` value to spawn a process.
    - If the malicious binary is executed, the attacker’s code runs in the context of the user’s machine.
  - **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user’s system.
    - Potential compromise of the user’s environment and access to sensitive information or systems.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension relies on VSCode’s built‑in workspace trust model to alert users when opening an untrusted workspace.
    - Users are expected to review settings like `deno.path` before trusting a project.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No internal validation to ensure that the configured `deno.path` points to a bona fide, system‑installed Deno executable.
    - No additional integrity checks (e.g., code signing or checksum validation) of the binary that is about to be executed.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must supply a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` (or similar configuration file) in a repository.
    - The user opens the repository and accepts or bypasses workspace trust warnings, allowing the extension to read and use the malicious `deno.path` value.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The README and configuration documentation indicate that the extension reads the `deno.path` setting directly.
    - There is no evidence in the documentation that the extension validates or sanitizes the provided path before using it to spawn the Deno CLI.
    - The assumption that users know to check workspace settings is relied upon rather than enforcing a secure mechanism within the extension.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - **Step 1:** Create a test repository with a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets `"deno.path": "./malicious-script.sh"`, where `malicious-script.sh` is a harmless script created for testing that writes a distinct log file to disk.
    - **Step 2:** Open the repository in VSCode and accept workspace trust.
    - **Step 3:** Trigger a Deno-related action in the extension that spawns the Deno CLI.
    - **Step 4:** Verify whether the malicious script executes (for example, by checking for the presence of the log file or by other observable side effects).
    - **Step 5:** Confirm that the extension used the overridden `deno.path` without validating its legitimacy.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Execution of Malicious Deno CLI Tasks from Untrusted Workspace
  - **Description:**
    - The extension supports integration of custom Deno CLI tasks via a user‑supplied `tasks.json` (as documented in the “Tasks” feature).
    - An attacker may supply a repository (or convince a user to clone one) that contains a crafted `tasks.json` defining Deno tasks with malicious commands, arguments, and environment variables.
    - When a user inadvertently runs one of these tasks from VSCode’s command palette without scrutinizing its content, the extension will spawn a Deno process using the attacker‑controlled parameters.
    - If the extension does not perform additional sanitization or sandboxing of task parameters, it may directly execute these malicious commands.
  - **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary command execution on the user’s machine.
    - The attacker can execute commands with the same privileges as the user, potentially compromising sensitive information.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension documentation cautions users to be aware of workspace configuration.
    - It leverages VSCode’s inherent trust mechanisms to warn users when opening untrusted projects.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No additional, built‑in verification or sandboxing of the commands/arguments defined in a workspace’s `tasks.json`.
    - No runtime validation to detect suspicious or anomalous task definitions before execution.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must supply a repository containing a malicious `tasks.json` with carefully crafted Deno task definitions.
    - The user must open the untrusted repository and choose to run one of the maliciously defined tasks.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The documentation in `docs/tasks.md` shows that the extension reads and uses task definitions (including command, args, cwd, and env) directly from the `tasks.json` provided by the user.
    - There is no evidence that these parameters are sanitized or validated beyond their basic schema.
    - This direct pass‑through model means that the extension will call the Deno CLI with the exact parameters provided in the workspace.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    - **Step 1:** Create a test repository with a `tasks.json` file defining a Deno task that uses a command and arguments designed to execute a controlled, identifiable action (for testing, have the task write a file or output a distinct marker string).
    - **Step 2:** Open this repository in VSCode as an untrusted workspace and bypass or accept the workspace trust warning.
    - **Step 3:** Run the defined Deno task from the VSCode command palette.
    - **Step 4:** Observe whether the task executes the malicious payload (i.e., if the controlled action occurs).
    - **Step 5:** Verify that no additional checks or warnings were raised by the extension before executing the task.
