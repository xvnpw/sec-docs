### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args`

- Description:
    If a user configures `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` with malicious arguments, the extension might naively pass these arguments to the Deno CLI when running tests via code lens or test explorer. If the extension does not sanitize these arguments, it could lead to command injection, allowing arbitrary commands to be executed on the user's machine when a test is run.

- Impact:
    Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine. An attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's system depending on the privileges of the user running VSCode.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None apparent from the provided documentation. It is unclear from the documentation if the extension sanitizes or validates these arguments before passing them to the Deno CLI.

- Missing Mitigations:
    Input sanitization and validation of `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args`. The extension should ensure that these arguments are safe to be passed to the Deno CLI and do not contain any command injection vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    - User must have the vscode-deno extension installed.
    - User must have Deno CLI installed.
    - User must have a workspace configured with vscode-deno enabled.
    - User or a malicious workspace configuration must have set `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` to contain malicious commands.
    - User must trigger a test run via code lens or test explorer.

- Source Code Analysis:
    ```
    Unfortunately, source code for this extension is not provided in PROJECT FILES.
    To confirm this vulnerability, the source code needs to be examined, specifically:
    1. Identify the code section where the extension constructs the command to execute Deno CLI for running tests (both via code lens and test explorer).
    2. Check how the extension retrieves and handles the values of `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings.
    3. Analyze if these arguments are directly concatenated into the command string without any sanitization or escaping before being passed to the Deno CLI.

    If the code directly uses these settings as part of the command without sanitization, then the vulnerability is confirmed.

    ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. Open VSCode with the vscode-deno extension installed and enabled.
    2. Create a new JavaScript or TypeScript file named `test_command_injection.ts` with a Deno test:
        ```typescript
        Deno.test("command injection test", () => {
          console.log("Test running");
        });
        ```
    3. Open VSCode settings (Ctrl+,) and navigate to Workspace Settings.
    4. Search for "deno.codeLens.testArgs".
    5. Set `deno.codeLens.testArgs` to `["--allow-all", "; touch /tmp/pwned ;"]`.
        - For Windows, set it to `["--allow-all", "& echo pwned > pwned.txt &"]`.
    6. Save the settings.
    7. Open the `test_command_injection.ts` file.
    8. Locate the "â–¶ Run Test" code lens above the `Deno.test` definition and click it.
    9. After the test runs (or fails), check for the following:
        - On Linux/macOS: Check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created using the command `ls -l /tmp/pwned`.
        - On Windows: Check if the file `pwned.txt` has been created in the workspace directory.
    10. If the file `/tmp/pwned` (or `pwned.txt`) is created, it indicates that the command injection was successful, confirming the vulnerability.
