### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Malicious Workspace Configuration in Test Arguments
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious workspace.
    2. The attacker includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file within the workspace.
    3. In the `settings.json`, the attacker sets the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` setting to a malicious value containing shell commands. For example: `["--allow-all", "; touch /tmp/pwned ;"]`.
    4. The attacker tricks a victim user into opening this malicious workspace in VSCode with the Deno extension enabled.
    5. The victim user opens a test file (e.g., a file containing `Deno.test`).
    6. The Deno extension displays a "Run Test" code lens above the test definition.
    7. When the victim user clicks the "Run Test" code lens, the extension executes a Deno CLI command to run the test.
    8. Due to the malicious configuration in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args`, the injected shell commands are executed by the system, in addition to the intended Deno test command.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine with the privileges of the VSCode process. This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, or compromise the victim's system.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently implemented mitigations: None. Based on the provided files, there is no explicit mention of sanitizing or validating the arguments provided in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args` settings.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The Deno extension should sanitize the arguments provided in `deno.codeLens.testArgs` and `deno.testing.args` settings before passing them to the Deno CLI. This should include removing or escaping shell metacharacters and command separators to prevent command injection.
    - Parameterized command execution: If possible, the extension should use parameterized command execution APIs to execute the Deno CLI commands, which can help avoid shell injection vulnerabilities.
- Preconditions:
    1. The victim user has Visual Studio Code installed with the Deno extension enabled.
    2. The victim user opens a malicious workspace crafted by the attacker.
    3. The malicious workspace contains a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets a malicious value for `deno.codeLens.testArgs` or `deno.testing.args`.
    4. The victim user opens a file in the workspace that contains Deno tests and clicks the "Run Test" code lens.
- Source code analysis:
    - Unfortunately, the provided PROJECT FILES do not include the source code of the Deno VSCode extension itself. Therefore, a precise source code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerable code location is not possible with the given information.
    - However, based on the feature description in `docs/testing.md`, the extension reads the `deno.codeLens.testArgs` setting and uses these arguments when invoking the Deno CLI for running tests via code lens.
    - Hypothetically, if the extension directly concatenates these arguments into a shell command without proper sanitization, it would be vulnerable to command injection.
    - For example, a vulnerable code snippet might look like this (pseudocode):
      ```
      function runTestCodeLens(testFile: string, testName: string): void {
          const denoExecutable = getDenoExecutablePath();
          const testArgs = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('deno').get<string[]>('codeLens.testArgs') || [];
          const command = `${denoExecutable} test ${testFile} ${testArgs.join(' ')}`; // POTENTIALLY VULNERABLE LINE
          childProcess.exec(command, ...);
      }
      ```
      In this hypothetical example, the `testArgs.join(' ')` part, if not sanitized, could allow injection of arbitrary commands.
- Security test case:
    1. Create a new directory named `malicious-workspace`.
    2. Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a subdirectory named `.vscode`.
    3. Inside `.vscode`, create a file named `settings.json` with the following content:
       ```json
       {
         "deno.codeLens.testArgs": ["--allow-all", "; touch /tmp/pwned-by-deno-extension ;"]
       }
       ```
    4. Inside `malicious-workspace`, create a file named `test_example.ts` with the following content:
       ```typescript
       Deno.test("example test", () => {
         console.log("Running example test");
       });
       ```
    5. Open Visual Studio Code.
    6. Open the `malicious-workspace` folder in VSCode (File -> Open Folder... -> `malicious-workspace`).
    7. Ensure the Deno extension is enabled for this workspace.
    8. Open the `test_example.ts` file in the editor.
    9. Observe the "Run Test" code lens appearing above the `Deno.test` definition.
    10. Click the "Run Test" code lens.
    11. After the test execution completes (or even if it fails), check if the file `/tmp/pwned-by-deno-extension` has been created.
    12. If the file `/tmp/pwned-by-deno-extension` exists, it indicates that the command injection was successful, and the vulnerability is valid.
