# BUSINESS POSTURE

Preact is a fast, lightweight alternative to React with a similar API. It aims to provide a smaller library size while maintaining compatibility with the React ecosystem. This suggests a focus on performance and efficiency, likely targeting developers and businesses prioritizing fast load times and a smooth user experience, especially on resource-constrained devices or networks.

Business Priorities:

*   Performance: Minimize library size and maximize rendering speed.
*   Compatibility: Maintain compatibility with the React ecosystem (libraries, tools, etc.).
*   Developer Experience: Provide a familiar and easy-to-use API for developers already familiar with React.
*   Adoption: Encourage widespread adoption by offering a compelling alternative to React.
*   Maintainability: Ensure the codebase is maintainable and easy to contribute to.

Business Goals:

*   Provide a viable, high-performance alternative to React for front-end development.
*   Reduce the overhead of JavaScript libraries in web applications.
*   Enable developers to build fast and interactive user interfaces.
*   Foster a community around Preact and its ecosystem.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Compatibility Drift: Failing to keep up with changes in the React ecosystem, leading to compatibility issues.
*   Performance Degradation: Introducing changes that negatively impact performance, undermining the core value proposition.
*   Security Vulnerabilities: Introducing security flaws that could be exploited in applications built with Preact.
*   Lack of Adoption: Failing to attract a sufficient number of users and contributors, hindering long-term sustainability.
*   Community Fragmentation: Splitting the community with incompatible forks or extensions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code Reviews: The project uses pull requests on GitHub, implying that code reviews are part of the development process. (Described in contribution guidelines).
*   security control: Testing: The project has a comprehensive test suite, including unit tests and integration tests. (Described in the repository structure and contribution guidelines).
*   security control: Linting: The project uses ESLint to enforce code style and identify potential issues. (Described in package.json and configuration files).
*   security control: Dependency Management: The project uses npm/yarn to manage dependencies, allowing for updates and security patches. (Described in package.json).
*   security control: Continuous Integration: The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration, automating builds and tests. (Described in .github/workflows).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on Community Contributions: The project relies on community contributions, which may introduce varying levels of code quality and security awareness.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies: The project depends on third-party libraries, which may have their own security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: XSS Vulnerabilities: While Preact likely mitigates common XSS vectors, the ultimate responsibility for preventing XSS lies with the application developer using Preact.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits, both manual and automated, to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Program: Establish a clear process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Provide guidance and examples for implementing CSP in applications built with Preact.
*   security control: Supply Chain Security: Implement measures to secure the software supply chain, such as signing releases and verifying dependencies.
*   security control: SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Integrate SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan for vulnerabilities.
*   security control: DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing): Perform regular DAST scans on demo applications or test environments.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to Preact itself, as it's a front-end library. Authentication is the responsibility of the application using Preact.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to Preact itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the application using Preact.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Preact should provide mechanisms for sanitizing user input to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Developers using Preact should be educated on the importance of input validation and sanitization.
    *   Preact should escape output by default to prevent XSS.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Not directly applicable to Preact itself, as it's a front-end library. Cryptographic operations should be handled on the server-side or using appropriate web APIs.
*   Data Protection:
    *   Preact should not store or handle sensitive data directly. Sensitive data management is the responsibility of the application using Preact.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible deployment solutions:

1.  Static Hosting (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, AWS S3 + CloudFront, Google Cloud Storage + CDN): Preact applications are typically built into static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) that can be served directly from a CDN or static hosting provider.
2.  Server-Side Rendering (SSR) (e.g., Node.js server with Express, Next.js, custom server): For applications requiring SSR, a server environment is needed to render the initial HTML on the server.
3.  Containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes): Preact applications can be containerized for deployment in various environments, including cloud platforms and on-premise servers.

Chosen solution (Static Hosting with Netlify):

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Rendering the user interface efficiently and responsively.
    *   Maintaining compatibility with the React ecosystem.
    *   Providing a smooth developer experience.
    *   Ensuring the stability and maintainability of the codebase.

*   Data:
    *   Preact itself does not handle sensitive data directly. However, applications built with Preact may handle various types of data, depending on their purpose.
    *   Data Sensitivity:
        *   User Input: Potentially sensitive, depending on the application. Could include personal information, credentials, or financial data.
        *   Application State: May contain data relevant to the application's functionality, but not necessarily sensitive.
        *   Configuration Data: May contain API keys or other secrets, which should be protected.
