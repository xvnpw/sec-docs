# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for preactjs/preact

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strictly Avoid Manual DOM Manipulation](./mitigation_strategies/strictly_avoid_manual_dom_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Coding Standard:** Create a clear, documented coding standard that explicitly prohibits direct DOM manipulation using methods like `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `insertAdjacentHTML`, etc., *within Preact components*. This is crucial because Preact relies on its virtual DOM for efficient and secure rendering.
    2.  **Code Review Enforcement:** Implement mandatory code reviews. Reviewers should specifically check for any violations of the "no direct DOM manipulation" rule *within component logic*.
    3.  **Education and Training:** Train developers on the dangers of bypassing Preact's rendering and the benefits of using JSX and the component lifecycle.
    4.  **Use of Linting Tools:** Integrate ESLint with rules like `react/no-danger` (adaptable for Preact) and `no-unsanitized/method` to automatically detect and flag potential violations *during Preact component development*.
    5.  **Refactoring Existing Code:** If direct DOM manipulation is found *within existing Preact components*, prioritize refactoring it to use Preact's JSX and component structure.
    6. **Exception Handling (Rare and Justified Cases):** If direct DOM manipulation is *absolutely unavoidable* within a Preact context (e.g., integrating with a legacy library that *requires* it and cannot be wrapped), create a dedicated, isolated Preact component for this interaction.  Within this *specific Preact component*, implement rigorous input sanitization using a library like `DOMPurify` *before* any DOM interaction. Document the reason for this exception clearly and ensure it's isolated from the rest of the Preact application.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Component Injection (XSS - Preact Specific):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code by bypassing Preact's virtual DOM and rendering process. This is a *Preact-specific* threat because it exploits the framework's rendering mechanism.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior (Preact Specific):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces conflicts between Preact's virtual DOM and manual DOM changes, ensuring consistent rendering.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Component Injection (XSS):** Risk reduction: Very High. This is the *primary* defense against this Preact-specific XSS vector.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior:** Risk reduction: High. Improves Preact component stability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Coding standards (section 3.2) prohibit direct DOM manipulation within Preact components. ESLint rule `react/no-danger` is enabled. Code reviews are mandatory."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Refactoring of `LegacyPreactWidget.js` is required; it uses `innerHTML` within its `render` method."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prop Type Validation and Enforcement (Preact's `propTypes`)](./mitigation_strategies/prop_type_validation_and_enforcement__preact's__proptypes__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Prop Types:** For every *Preact component*, define `propTypes` to specify the expected data type for each prop. Use specific types and custom validators where possible.
    2.  **Custom Validators:** For props requiring specific formats, create custom validator functions *within Preact's `propTypes`*.
    3.  **Runtime Enforcement (Development Mode):** Ensure that `propTypes` validation is enabled in development mode. *Preact* will log warnings if prop types are violated.
    4. **Regular Audits:** Periodically review the `propTypes` definitions to ensure they are up-to-date.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Component Injection (Indirectly - Preact Specific):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the chance of unexpected data types leading to vulnerabilities *within Preact's rendering*.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior (Preact Specific):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents errors caused by incorrect prop values passed to *Preact components*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Component Injection (Indirectly):** Risk reduction: Medium. Strengthens Preact component robustness.
    *   **Unexpected Application Behavior:** Risk reduction: High. Improves Preact component reliability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "All Preact components have `propTypes` defined. Custom validators are used for email and URL props in `UserForm.js`."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Legacy Preact components need `propTypes` added."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize and Sanitize `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (Preact Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_and_sanitize__dangerouslysetinnerhtml___preact_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoidance as Primary Strategy:** *Avoid* using Preact's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` whenever possible. Explore alternatives like parsing HTML into a *Preact-compatible structure* or using *Preact components* for rendering.
    2.  **Strict Sanitization (If Unavoidable within Preact):** If `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is *absolutely necessary within a Preact component*, use `DOMPurify`.
        *   **Configuration:** Configure `DOMPurify` strictly.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep `DOMPurify` updated.
    3.  **Input Validation (Before Preact Rendering):** Validate data *before* it's considered for use with Preact's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
    4. **Code Review and Documentation:** Any use of Preact's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` should be documented and scrutinized during code reviews.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (Preact Specific):** (Severity: High) - Directly mitigates XSS through malicious HTML *within Preact's rendering context*.
    *   **Bypass of Sanitization:** (Severity: High)

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`:** Risk reduction: Very High (with sanitization). Avoidance is best.
    *   **Bypass of Sanitization:** Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Preact's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is not currently used. A policy prohibits its use."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "If a future requirement necessitates its use, a detailed plan, including sanitization, must be created."

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Context API Usage (Preact Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_context_api_usage__preact_specific_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Context Scope Limitation:**  Identify the *Preact components* that need access to data.  Create a context provider *only* at the highest level in the *Preact component tree* where all those components are descendants.
    2.  **Multiple Contexts:**  Create separate *Preact contexts* for different data categories.
    3.  **Data Minimization:**  Store only the *minimum* necessary data within each *Preact context*.
    4.  **Read-Only Context (If Possible):** If a *Preact context* only needs to provide data, consider making it read-only.
    5.  **Code Reviews:**  Examine how *Preact's Context API* is being used during code reviews.
    6. **Documentation:** Clearly document the purpose and scope of each *Preact context*.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unintentional Data Exposure (Preact Specific):** (Severity: Medium to High) - Prevents sensitive data from being accidentally accessed by *Preact components* that shouldn't have access.
    *   **Debugging-Related Leaks:** (Severity: Low to Medium)
    * **Component Injection (Indirectly - Preact Specific):** (Severity: Low) If a malicious component is injected, limiting *Preact context* access reduces data exposure.

* **Impact:**
    *   **Unintentional Data Exposure:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Debugging-Related Leaks:** Risk reduction: Medium.
    * **Component Injection (Indirectly):** Risk Reduction: Low.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: "Separate *Preact contexts* are used for authentication (`AuthContext`) and UI theme (`ThemeContext`). `AuthContext` only provides a user ID."

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: "Code review needed to ensure all *Preact context* providers are at the appropriate level. Documentation for `AnalyticsContext` needs clarification."
