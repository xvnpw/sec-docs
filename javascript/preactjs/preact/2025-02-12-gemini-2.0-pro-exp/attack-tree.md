## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Preact Core](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_preact_core.md)

*   **1.1 Unpatched CVEs in Preact**
    *   **1.1.1 Identify and exploit a known, unpatched vulnerability in the specific Preact version used. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  The attacker identifies a publicly disclosed vulnerability (CVE) in the specific version of Preact used by the application. They then craft an exploit targeting this vulnerability, typically resulting in XSS.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low / Very Low (Dependent on update frequency)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Full XSS, potential account takeover, data exfiltration)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Depends on the complexity of the CVE)
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (May be detected by intrusion detection systems or security audits)
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep Preact updated to the latest version.

*   **1.2 Misuse of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` or Similar Features [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **1.2.1 Application improperly sanitizes user input before passing it to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** The application takes user-provided input and directly injects it into the DOM using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without proper sanitization.  This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Full XSS)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by code review or dynamic analysis)
        *   **Mitigation:** Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` if possible. If unavoidable, use a robust sanitization library like DOMPurify *before* passing any user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Preact Components [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_preact_components__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Unpatched CVEs in Third-Party Components**
    *   **2.1.1 Identify and exploit a known vulnerability in a third-party Preact component used by the application. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Similar to 1.1.1, but the vulnerability exists in a third-party Preact component rather than Preact itself.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on component popularity and update frequency)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (Depends on the vulnerability and component's role)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (May be detected by vulnerability scanners)
        *   **Mitigation:** Keep all third-party components updated. Vet components before use.

*   **2.2 Improper Input Sanitization in Third-Party Components**
    *   **2.2.1 A third-party component fails to sanitize user input before rendering it, leading to XSS. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** A third-party component takes user input (directly or indirectly) and renders it without proper sanitization, creating an XSS vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on the component's quality)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Full XSS)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires understanding the component's internals)
        *   **Mitigation:** Vet components thoroughly.  Consider sandboxing or isolating third-party components.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Preact-Specific Development Mistakes [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_preact-specific_development_mistakes__high_risk_.md)

*   **3.1 Incorrect Usage of Hooks**
    *   **3.1.1 Improperly handling user input within `useEffect` or other hooks. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  User input is used within a hook (like `useEffect`, `useState`, etc.) in a way that allows for XSS or other vulnerabilities.  This often involves directly rendering user input or using it to construct HTML without sanitization.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common mistake with complex state management)
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the specific vulnerability)
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by code review or dynamic analysis)
        *   **Mitigation:**  Carefully review hook usage. Sanitize user input *before* using it in any rendering logic within hooks.

*   **3.2 Misunderstanding of Preact's Rendering Model**
    *   **3.2.1 Assuming that Preact automatically sanitizes all input, leading to XSS vulnerabilities. [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:** Developers incorrectly believe that Preact provides automatic XSS protection, leading them to omit necessary input sanitization.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common misconception)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Full XSS)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be detected by code review or dynamic analysis)
        *   **Mitigation:** Developer education. Emphasize that Preact *does not* automatically sanitize input and that developers are responsible for this.
