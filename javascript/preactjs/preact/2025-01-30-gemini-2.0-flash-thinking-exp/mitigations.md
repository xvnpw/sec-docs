# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for preactjs/preact

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User Input Rendered in JSX](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user_input_rendered_in_jsx.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User Input Rendered in JSX
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all locations in your Preact application where user-provided data is rendered within JSX.** Focus on how data flows into your Preact components and where JSX is used to display it.
    2.  **Leverage Preact's default JSX escaping.** Ensure you are rendering dynamic data within JSX expressions `{}`. Preact automatically escapes HTML entities in these expressions, providing a baseline level of protection against XSS.
    3.  **Exercise extreme caution with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.** This Preact prop bypasses JSX's built-in escaping and renders raw HTML.
        *   **Avoid `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` whenever possible.** Refactor components to use standard JSX rendering and component composition to construct HTML structures.
        *   **If `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is unavoidable:**
            *   **Sanitize the HTML string *before* passing it to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.** Use a robust HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify or similar) specifically designed for this purpose.
            *   **Configure the sanitization library to allow only necessary HTML tags and attributes.**  Strictly control what HTML is permitted to be rendered to minimize the attack surface.
            *   **Implement both server-side and client-side sanitization for defense-in-depth.** Sanitize data on the server before sending it to the Preact application, and sanitize again on the client-side before using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
    4.  **Regularly review and update sanitization practices in your Preact components.** Stay informed about new XSS vectors and ensure your sanitization logic remains effective.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (High Severity):** Prevents reflected XSS attacks by ensuring user input is properly escaped when rendered by Preact.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored (High Severity):** Prevents stored XSS attacks by sanitizing user input before it's rendered by Preact, even if the data originates from a database.

*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities in Preact applications by leveraging JSX's escaping and providing guidance for safe use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**  Default JSX escaping is inherently used in Preact components. However, awareness and consistent application of sanitization practices, especially around `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, might be inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Formal guidelines and code reviews focused on sanitization within Preact components. Consistent implementation of sanitization libraries when `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used.  Training for developers on secure JSX rendering practices in Preact.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Component Design and Prop Handling in Preact](./mitigation_strategies/secure_component_design_and_prop_handling_in_preact.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Component Design and Prop Handling in Preact
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize PropTypes (or TypeScript types) for all Preact component props.** Define clear type expectations for props to ensure data integrity and catch unexpected data types during development.
    2.  **Implement prop validation logic within Preact components.**  Beyond type checking, add validation to ensure props conform to expected formats, ranges, or specific values relevant to the component's functionality. This is crucial for data received by Preact components.
    3.  **Be mindful of data exposure through Preact component props.** Avoid passing sensitive data as props unnecessarily deep down the component tree. Consider alternative data management patterns if prop drilling becomes a security concern.
    4.  **When handling user-provided data as props in Preact components:**
        *   **Validate and sanitize data *within the component* upon receiving it as a prop.**  Even if data is sanitized elsewhere, perform validation and sanitization again within the Preact component to ensure data integrity and security at the point of use.
        *   **Avoid directly using unsanitized user-provided props in security-sensitive operations within the component.**

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Reduces unintentional exposure of sensitive data through insecure prop handling in Preact components.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Prop validation in Preact components helps ensure data integrity within the component logic and UI rendering.
    *   **Logic Bugs and Unexpected Behavior (Medium Severity):** Strong prop typing and validation in Preact components prevent logic errors caused by components receiving incorrect or malicious data via props.

*   **Impact:** Moderately reduces risks related to data handling within Preact components by promoting secure prop usage and validation.

*   **Currently Implemented:** PropTypes or TypeScript might be used in some Preact components. Prop validation logic beyond basic type checking is likely inconsistent. Awareness of secure prop handling practices in Preact might vary among developers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Consistent use of PropTypes/TypeScript across all Preact components.  Implementation of comprehensive prop validation logic within components.  Code reviews focused on secure prop handling in Preact components.  Development guidelines for secure component design and prop usage in Preact.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Dependency Management for Preact Ecosystem](./mitigation_strategies/dependency_management_for_preact_ecosystem.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Dependency Management for Preact Ecosystem
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly update Preact and its related dependencies.**  This includes Preact core, Preact CLI (if used), Preact Router (if used), and any other libraries specifically used within your Preact application's ecosystem.
    2.  **Utilize dependency vulnerability scanning tools specifically for your Preact project.** Integrate tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated security scanners into your development and CI/CD pipelines to detect vulnerabilities in Preact and its dependencies.
    3.  **Prioritize updates for Preact and its core dependencies when vulnerabilities are reported.**  Pay special attention to security advisories related to Preact itself and its commonly used libraries.
    4.  **Carefully vet third-party Preact components and libraries before incorporating them.**  When choosing external components for your Preact application, assess their security posture, maintainership, and reputation within the Preact community.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Preact and its Ecosystem (High Severity):** Mitigates vulnerabilities present in Preact core, Preact libraries, or their dependencies, which could directly impact your Preact application.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Preact Ecosystem (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the risk of supply chain attacks specifically targeting the Preact ecosystem through compromised dependencies.

*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of vulnerabilities originating from Preact and its ecosystem by promoting proactive dependency management and vulnerability scanning.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Dependency updates might be performed periodically. `npm audit`/`yarn audit` might be used occasionally. However, automated vulnerability scanning specifically focused on the Preact project and a formal process for addressing Preact-related dependency vulnerabilities might be lacking.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated dependency vulnerability scanning integrated into CI/CD pipelines, specifically configured for Preact project dependencies.  Formal process for reviewing and addressing vulnerability reports related to Preact and its ecosystem.  Dedicated vetting process for third-party Preact components and libraries.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Security Considerations for Preact (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/server-side_rendering__ssr__security_considerations_for_preact__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Security Considerations for Preact
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Ensure consistent rendering between Preact SSR and client-side rendering.**  Thoroughly test your Preact SSR implementation to prevent hydration mismatches, which can lead to XSS vulnerabilities if client-side rendering incorrectly interprets server-rendered HTML. Pay close attention to Preact component lifecycle and data handling in SSR context.
    2.  **Sanitize data on the server-side *before* Preact SSR renders it.** Apply robust sanitization to any data rendered by Preact on the server, especially user-generated content or data from external sources. This is critical as server-rendered HTML is directly sent to the client.
    3.  **Be aware of Preact SSR-specific hydration issues and potential XSS vectors.** Research and understand how hydration works in Preact SSR and potential security implications of inconsistencies between server and client rendering.
    4.  **Secure the server environment used for Preact SSR.** Follow general server security best practices to protect the server environment where Preact SSR is executed.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Preact SSR Hydration Mismatches (High Severity):** Mitigates XSS vulnerabilities that can arise specifically from inconsistencies in Preact SSR hydration.
    *   **Server-Side Vulnerabilities related to Preact SSR Environment (High Severity):** Securing the SSR server environment protects against general server-side vulnerabilities that could impact the Preact SSR process.

*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the risk of SSR-specific vulnerabilities in Preact applications, particularly those related to hydration and server-side rendering processes.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Implementation status depends on SSR usage. If SSR is used, basic testing for rendering consistency might be present. Server-side sanitization for SSR might be partially implemented. Awareness of Preact SSR-specific security considerations might be limited.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Dedicated testing and validation of Preact SSR hydration consistency.  Comprehensive server-side sanitization specifically for Preact SSR rendering.  Security training and awareness regarding Preact SSR-specific vulnerabilities for the development team.  Formal server hardening procedures for Preact SSR environments.
