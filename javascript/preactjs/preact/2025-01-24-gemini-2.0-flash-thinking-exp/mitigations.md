# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for preactjs/preact

## Mitigation Strategy: [`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` Usage Control and Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/_dangerouslysetinnerhtml__usage_control_and_sanitization.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize usage:**  Actively avoid using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in Preact components unless absolutely necessary.  Explore alternative Preact rendering approaches that utilize JSX and text interpolation for safer content rendering.
    2.  **Justification and documentation:** If `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is deemed unavoidable for a specific use case, thoroughly document the reason for its use and the security considerations involved. Clearly justify why safer alternatives are not feasible.
    3.  **Strict sanitization:** When `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` *must* be used, *always* sanitize the HTML content *before* passing it to the prop. Utilize a robust and well-vetted HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify or sanitize-html) within your Preact component to process the HTML string.
    4.  **Contextual sanitization:** Ensure the sanitization library is configured appropriately for the context of your application and the expected HTML content. Tailor sanitization rules to allow necessary HTML elements and attributes while blocking potentially harmful ones.
    5.  **Regular review:** Periodically review all instances of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in your Preact codebase. Re-evaluate if their usage is still necessary and if the sanitization measures are still adequate.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (High Severity):**  Directly prevents XSS vulnerabilities that arise from injecting unsanitized HTML into the DOM using Preact's `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prop. This is a critical vulnerability as it bypasses Preact's default escaping mechanisms.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS attacks originating from the misuse of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is generally discouraged within the development team.
        *   Basic awareness of the risks associated with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` exists.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Establish a formal policy against the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` unless explicitly justified and approved.
        *   Implement code review processes that specifically flag and scrutinize any usage of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
        *   Integrate automated linting rules (if possible) to detect and warn against `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage without proper sanitization.
        *   Provide clear guidelines and code examples for developers on how to use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` securely when absolutely necessary, including mandatory sanitization library usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [JSX and Component-Based Sanitization Practices](./mitigation_strategies/jsx_and_component-based_sanitization_practices.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage JSX for default escaping:**  Educate developers on how Preact's JSX syntax inherently provides default escaping of text content. Emphasize using JSX expressions `{}` for rendering dynamic text data, as this automatically escapes HTML entities, mitigating basic XSS risks.
    2.  **Component encapsulation for sanitization:**  Encourage the creation of reusable Preact components that encapsulate sanitization logic. For example, create a `<SafeHTML>` component that takes an HTML string as a prop, sanitizes it internally using a library, and then renders the sanitized HTML (potentially using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` *internally* and safely within the component). This promotes code reusability and consistent sanitization practices.
    3.  **Component prop validation:**  Utilize Preact's prop validation mechanisms (or TypeScript if used) to enforce expected data types for component props that handle user-provided data. While not directly sanitization, type checking can help prevent unexpected data being passed to components, reducing potential vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Review component rendering logic:**  Regularly review Preact component rendering logic, especially in components that handle user input or display data from external sources. Ensure that data is being rendered safely, using JSX expressions for text and appropriate sanitization techniques when HTML rendering is required.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Components (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents XSS vulnerabilities that can occur within Preact components if user-provided data is not properly handled during rendering. This includes both direct injection into HTML and more subtle forms of XSS.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Components (Medium to High Reduction):**  Reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities within Preact components by promoting safe rendering practices and providing reusable sanitization mechanisms.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Developers generally use JSX expressions for rendering dynamic text.
        *   Basic component structure is used to encapsulate logic, but not specifically for sanitization.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Develop and promote reusable "safe rendering" components like `<SafeHTML>` to standardize sanitization.
        *   Provide training and guidelines to developers on secure component development practices in Preact, emphasizing JSX escaping and sanitization techniques.
        *   Incorporate component-level security reviews as part of the development process, focusing on data handling and rendering logic.
