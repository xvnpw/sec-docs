# Attack Surface Analysis for preactjs/preact

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Improperly Sanitized Data in JSX](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_improperly_sanitized_data_in_jsx.md)

**Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into the application's UI when user-provided or untrusted data is directly rendered without proper sanitization.

**How Preact Contributes:** Preact's JSX syntax allows embedding JavaScript expressions directly into the rendered output. If these expressions contain unsanitized data, Preact will render it as executable code.

**Example:**  A component renders `<h1>Hello, {user.name}</h1>`, where `user.name` comes directly from an API response without sanitization, and the API response contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.

**Impact:** Stealing user cookies, session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious websites, defacing the website, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Sanitize user-provided data using a library like DOMPurify before rendering it in JSX.
- Utilize Preact's built-in JSX escaping for simple text content, ensuring data is treated as text and not executable code.
- Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Attack Surface: [Rehydration Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/rehydration_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Inconsistencies between server-rendered HTML and client-side rendered DOM can be exploited if the server-rendered content is manipulated.

**How Preact Contributes:** Preact's rehydration process takes the server-rendered HTML and makes it interactive on the client. If the initial HTML is compromised, the rehydration process might inadvertently execute malicious code or introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An attacker intercepts the server response and injects malicious HTML before it reaches the client. Preact's rehydration process then attaches event listeners to this malicious HTML.

**Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities, unexpected application behavior, potential for privilege escalation if the manipulated HTML interacts with sensitive client-side logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure the server-side rendering process is secure and free from injection vulnerabilities.
- Implement integrity checks or signatures for server-rendered content to detect tampering.
- Sanitize data on the server-side before rendering to minimize the risk of injecting malicious content.

## Attack Surface: [Inefficient Component Updates Leading to Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_surfaces/inefficient_component_updates_leading_to_denial_of_service__dos_.md)

**Description:**  Poorly optimized Preact components trigger excessive re-renders or perform computationally expensive operations, potentially leading to a denial of service on the client-side.

**How Preact Contributes:**  Preact's reactivity system can cause components to re-render frequently if not implemented efficiently. Attackers can craft inputs or interactions that exploit these inefficiencies.

**Example:** A component re-renders on every keystroke in an input field, performing a complex calculation on each render. An attacker could rapidly input characters, overwhelming the browser.

**Impact:**  Application becomes unresponsive, leading to a degraded user experience or complete denial of service for the client.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Optimize component rendering by using techniques like `React.memo` (or Preact's equivalent `memo`), `shouldComponentUpdate`, or using immutable data structures.
- Debounce or throttle event handlers that trigger expensive operations.
- Implement pagination or virtualization for large lists to avoid rendering excessive DOM elements.

## Attack Surface: [Event Handler Injection (Less common but possible)](./attack_surfaces/event_handler_injection__less_common_but_possible_.md)

**Description:**  Event handlers are dynamically generated based on untrusted input without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript.

**How Preact Contributes:** While Preact's event handling generally provides a layer of abstraction, improper dynamic generation of event handlers based on external data can bypass these protections.

**Example:**  A component dynamically creates an event handler like `<button onclick={userProvidedFunction}>Click Me</button>` where `userProvidedFunction` comes from an untrusted source.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid dynamically generating event handlers based on untrusted input.
- If dynamic event handling is necessary, carefully sanitize and validate the input to ensure it only contains safe code.
- Prefer declarative event binding over dynamically generated inline handlers.
