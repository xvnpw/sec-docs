## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Preact Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_preact_core_vulnerabilities.md)

This represents a broad category of attacks targeting inherent weaknesses within the Preact library's code. Successful exploitation could lead to significant control over the application's behavior and user data.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Virtual DOM Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_virtual_dom_manipulation.md)

This path focuses on manipulating Preact's virtual DOM implementation to inject malicious content or bypass security measures.
        * **Bypass Sanitization/Escaping in VDOM Updates:**
            * Attack Vector: Injecting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into data that is used to update the DOM. If Preact fails to properly sanitize or escape this input during the VDOM diffing or patching process, the malicious code will be rendered and executed in the user's browser (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
            * Preact Relevance: Preact's lightweight nature might have less robust or different sanitization mechanisms compared to larger frameworks, potentially creating edge cases.
        * **Forceful Re-rendering with Malicious Payloads:**
            * Attack Vector: Manipulating application state or props in a way that forces Preact to re-render components with attacker-controlled data. This can bypass intended security measures if the re-rendered content contains malicious scripts or links.
            * Preact Relevance: Preact's reactivity system, while powerful, needs careful management to prevent unintended or malicious re-renders.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Preact Ecosystem/Integrations](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_preact_ecosystemintegrations.md)

This path targets vulnerabilities in the broader Preact ecosystem, including add-ons, libraries, and integrations with other JavaScript libraries.
    * **Vulnerabilities in Preact Add-ons/Libraries:**
        * Utilizing Security Flaws in Preact-Specific Libraries:
            * Attack Vector: Exploiting known security vulnerabilities (like XSS, SQL Injection if the library interacts with a database, etc.) in third-party Preact components, utilities, or libraries that the application uses.
            * Preact Relevance: Applications often rely on community-developed libraries to extend Preact's functionality. The security of these dependencies directly impacts the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** [CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Developer Misuse of Preact](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__critical_node__exploit_developer_misuse_of_preact.md)

This path highlights vulnerabilities introduced by developers not using Preact securely.

## Attack Tree Path: [***HIGH-RISK PATH*** Insecure Component Design](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_insecure_component_design.md)

Creating Components Vulnerable to Injection:
            * Attack Vector: Developers create Preact components that directly render user-provided data without proper sanitization or escaping. This is a classic and common source of XSS vulnerabilities.
            * Preact Relevance: While Preact provides tools for safe rendering, developers must consciously use them. The flexibility of the framework can allow for insecure practices if developers are not careful.
