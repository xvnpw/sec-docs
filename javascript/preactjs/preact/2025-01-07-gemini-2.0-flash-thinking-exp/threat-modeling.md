# Threat Model Analysis for preactjs/preact

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Insecure Component Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_insecure_component_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application by providing unsanitized user input that is then rendered by a Preact component. The attacker manipulates input data, leading Preact's rendering process to inject the malicious script into the DOM, which is then executed by the browser.

**Impact:** Successful XSS attacks can allow attackers to steal user credentials, session tokens, inject further malware, redirect users to malicious websites, or deface the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Always sanitize user-provided data before rendering it within Preact components.
- Utilize browser APIs like `textContent` for displaying plain text or dedicated sanitization libraries (e.g., DOMPurify) for more complex scenarios.
- Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution via Unsafe Component Property Handling](./threats/prototype_pollution_via_unsafe_component_property_handling.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate component properties, leveraging how Preact passes and components handle `props`, to pollute the JavaScript prototype chain. By crafting specific property names (e.g., `__proto__`, `constructor`) in data passed to components, and if component logic naively assigns these properties, it can modify the behavior of all objects inheriting from that prototype.

**Impact:** Prototype pollution can lead to unexpected application behavior, security vulnerabilities, and potentially allow attackers to execute arbitrary code or bypass security checks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid directly assigning component props to objects without validation.
- Use object destructuring with explicitly defined properties.
- Create new objects with only the necessary properties from the props object.
- Employ static analysis tools to detect potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Inefficient Component Rendering](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_inefficient_component_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trigger excessive and unnecessary re-renders of Preact components by manipulating application state or data in a way that exploits Preact's virtual DOM reconciliation process. This involves causing rapid or complex updates that overwhelm the client's browser, leading to unresponsiveness or crashes due to Preact's rendering overhead.

**Impact:** The application becomes unusable for legitimate users due to performance degradation or crashes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Optimize component rendering using `useMemo` and `useCallback` hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
- Implement efficient state management to avoid cascading updates that trigger excessive re-renders.
- Profile application performance to identify and address rendering bottlenecks within Preact components.

## Threat: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Mismatches Leading to Information Disclosure or Manipulation](./threats/server-side_rendering__ssr__mismatches_leading_to_information_disclosure_or_manipulation.md)

**Description:** When using Preact for server-side rendering, inconsistencies between the server-rendered HTML and the client-side rendered DOM (during hydration) can occur due to discrepancies in data or rendering logic. An attacker could potentially exploit these mismatches to observe data intended only for the server or client, or manipulate the application state based on the initial server-rendered content before the client-side Preact fully takes over.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, manipulation of the application's initial state leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities arising from Preact's hydration process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Ensure strict consistency between server and client-side rendering logic, particularly regarding data fetching and component rendering.
- Carefully manage data flow during SSR and avoid including sensitive information in the initial HTML unless absolutely necessary and properly secured.
- Implement robust mechanisms to detect and handle SSR mismatches gracefully, potentially triggering a full client-side re-render if discrepancies are detected.
