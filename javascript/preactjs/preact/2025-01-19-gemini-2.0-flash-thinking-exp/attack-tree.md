## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Attributes via Props (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_attributes_via_props__critical_node_.md)

* **Supply Crafted Props Leading to Event Handler Injection (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`) (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Preact uses props to pass data to components. If an attacker can control the props passed to a component, they might inject attributes like `onload` or `onerror` with malicious JavaScript.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Requires understanding of component structure and prop handling.
    * **Impact:** High - Arbitrary JavaScript execution.
    * **Effort:** Medium - Requires some experimentation and knowledge of HTML attributes.
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring prop values or CSP violations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Component Lifecycle Abuse (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/component_lifecycle_abuse__critical_node_.md)

* **Inject Malicious Code via Unsafe Lifecycle Methods (HIGH-RISK PATH):** Lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate` execute JavaScript. If server-side data or unsanitized user input is used within these methods, it could lead to vulnerabilities.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Common mistake when integrating with backend data.
    * **Impact:** High - Arbitrary JavaScript execution.
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium - Depends on the complexity of data flow.
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by analyzing network traffic or server-side logs.

## Attack Tree Path: [JSX/Hyperscript Injection (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/jsxhyperscript_injection__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Inject Unsanitized User Input into JSX Expressions:** Directly embedding user-controlled data within JSX expressions without proper escaping is a classic XSS vulnerability.
    * **Likelihood:** High - Common developer error, especially with dynamic content.
    * **Impact:** High - Arbitrary JavaScript execution (XSS).
    * **Effort:** Low - Requires finding input points that are not properly sanitized.
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by security scanners and careful code review.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Preact Add-ons/Plugins (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_preact_add-onsplugins__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Target Known Vulnerabilities in Commonly Used Preact Libraries:** Many applications use Preact with additional libraries and plugins. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium - Depends on the popularity and security of the used libraries.
    * **Impact:** High - Can range from XSS to more severe vulnerabilities depending on the library.
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium - Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available.
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by vulnerability scanners and monitoring network traffic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Misconfiguration/Improper Use of Preact (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_misconfigurationimproper_use_of_preact__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This category encompasses several critical misconfigurations that can lead to vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Failure to Sanitize User Input Before Passing to Preact (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/failure_to_sanitize_user_input_before_passing_to_preact__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Pass Unsanitized Data to Preact Components Leading to XSS:** Even if Preact itself is secure, if the application doesn't sanitize user input before passing it to Preact components, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    * **Likelihood:** High - Fundamental web security vulnerability.
    * **Impact:** High - Arbitrary JavaScript execution.
    * **Effort:** Low - Requires finding input points that are not sanitized.
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner.
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by security scanners and careful code review.
