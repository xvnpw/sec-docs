## Vulnerability List for Night Owl VS Code Theme

After analyzing the provided project files for the Night Owl VS Code theme, no high-rank security vulnerabilities were identified that meet the specified criteria for inclusion in this list.

As stated in the initial assessment, VS Code themes are primarily focused on visual styling and operate within the sandboxed environment of VS Code. They do not typically handle external input or interact with system resources in a way that would introduce high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker.

Therefore, based on the nature of a VS Code theme and the provided project files, there are no vulnerabilities to list according to your instructions to exclude certain types and include only high-rank vulnerabilities.
