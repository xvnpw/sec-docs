## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, which consist of documentation and metadata for the "Vue VSCode Snippets" VSCode extension, no vulnerabilities of high rank or above, exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance, were identified.

**Reasoning:**

The project "Vue VSCode Snippets" is a VSCode extension designed to enhance developer workflow by providing code snippets for Vue.js development within the VSCode editor. The provided files (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/FUNDING.yml`) are documentation, changelog, and funding information for this extension.

VSCode extensions operate within the user's local VSCode environment and are not exposed as publicly accessible web applications.  Therefore, the typical attack vectors for web applications (like cross-site scripting, SQL injection, etc.) are not applicable in this context.

The prompt explicitly excludes vulnerabilities:
- Caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using the project (snippets).
- That are only missing documentation to mitigate.
- That are denial of service vulnerabilities.

The remaining criteria for inclusion are vulnerabilities that:
- Are valid and not already mitigated.
- Have a vulnerability rank of at least: high
- Are introduced by the project.
- Are triggerable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance.

Given the nature of a VSCode extension and the provided documentation files, there is no attack surface exposed to external attackers in a public instance.  The extension's functionality is limited to providing code snippets within the VSCode editor.

It is possible that the *snippets themselves* could encourage insecure coding practices if they contained vulnerable code patterns. However, the prompt explicitly excludes vulnerabilities caused by developers using insecure code patterns *when using the project*.  This implies the focus is on vulnerabilities in the extension's distribution or infrastructure, not the generated code snippets.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the provided files and the nature of the "Vue VSCode Snippets" project as a VSCode extension, there are no identifiable high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance.  The project's scope and the provided files do not present such attack vectors.

**Therefore, the vulnerability list is empty.**
