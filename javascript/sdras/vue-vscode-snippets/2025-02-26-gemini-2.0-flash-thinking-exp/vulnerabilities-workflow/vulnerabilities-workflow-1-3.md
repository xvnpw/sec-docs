## Vulnerability List for Vue VSCode Snippets

Based on the analysis of the provided project files and the defined criteria, no high or critical security vulnerabilities were identified in the Vue VSCode Snippets extension that meet the requirements for inclusion in this list.

This assessment considers the perspective of an external attacker targeting a publicly available instance (the VSCode extension marketplace) and excludes vulnerabilities as per the instructions (insecure code patterns by developers using snippets, missing documentation, and DoS).

Therefore, there are no vulnerabilities to list that are valid, unmitigated, ranked high or critical, and exploitable by an external attacker in the context of this VSCode extension.

It is important to note that this conclusion is based on the understanding of the extension's functionality as a code snippet provider and the exclusion criteria provided. A more in-depth security audit would require a review of the actual source code of the extension, which was not provided for this analysis.
