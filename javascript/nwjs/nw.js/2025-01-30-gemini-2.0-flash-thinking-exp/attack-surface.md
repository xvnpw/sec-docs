# Attack Surface Analysis for nwjs/nw.js

## Attack Surface: [1. Node.js Integration in Web Context - Unrestricted API Access](./attack_surfaces/1__node_js_integration_in_web_context_-_unrestricted_api_access.md)

*   **Description:** NW.js's core feature allows web pages to access Node.js APIs. When not properly restricted, this grants excessive power to web content.
*   **NW.js Contribution:** NW.js *introduces* this attack surface by design, bridging the web and system layers in a way standard browsers do not.
*   **Example:** A cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web application allows an attacker to inject JavaScript code. This code uses `require('child_process').exec('malicious_command')` to execute arbitrary system commands on the user's machine.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Full system compromise, remote code execution, data theft, malware installation, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strictly Limit Node.js API Exposure:**  **Critically important.**  Minimize the Node.js APIs accessible from the web context.  Whitelist only absolutely necessary APIs.  Consider using context isolation techniques if available and applicable in NW.js.
        *   **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement rigorous input validation and sanitization for *all* data received from the web context before using it in Node.js APIs. Assume all web content is potentially malicious.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the application to operate with the minimum Node.js privileges required. Avoid running with elevated privileges if possible.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Install Applications from Highly Trusted Sources:** Only install NW.js applications from developers with a strong security reputation and proven track record.
        *   **Keep Applications Updated:** Ensure the NW.js application is updated promptly to benefit from any security patches released by the developer.

## Attack Surface: [2. `node-remote` Feature - Remote Code Execution via Node.js](./attack_surfaces/2___node-remote__feature_-_remote_code_execution_via_node_js.md)

*   **Description:** The `node-remote` feature in NW.js allows remotely loaded web pages to gain full access to Node.js APIs.
*   **NW.js Contribution:** NW.js *provides* this feature, which directly and drastically increases the attack surface by extending Node.js capabilities to remote, potentially untrusted content.
*   **Example:** An NW.js application is configured with `node-remote` enabled and loads a seemingly harmless website. The website is compromised, and the attacker injects code that uses `require('fs').readFile('/etc/shadow', 'utf8', ...)` to read sensitive system files and exfiltrate them.
*   **Impact:** **Critical**. Complete system compromise, remote code execution, full control of the user's system by a remote attacker, massive data breach.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Absolutely Avoid `node-remote` in Production:** **Critical.**  Do not enable `node-remote` for production applications under any circumstances. The security risks are almost always unacceptable.
        *   **Remove `node-remote` Feature Entirely (if possible):** If your application design allows, consider if the `node-remote` feature can be removed or disabled at the NW.js build level to eliminate this risk completely.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Avoid Applications Using `node-remote`:** If you can determine that an application uses `node-remote` (often difficult), avoid using it unless you have an extremely high level of trust in *all* remote sources it interacts with. This is generally not recommended.

## Attack Surface: [3. Chromium Vulnerabilities - Exploitation via Web Content](./attack_surfaces/3__chromium_vulnerabilities_-_exploitation_via_web_content.md)

*   **Description:** NW.js relies on Chromium, inheriting its vulnerabilities. Exploits targeting Chromium can compromise NW.js applications through malicious web content.
*   **NW.js Contribution:** NW.js *embeds* Chromium, making it directly vulnerable to Chromium's security flaws. While not *introduced* by NW.js code, the dependency is a core aspect of NW.js's architecture and attack surface.
*   **Example:** A specially crafted website loaded in an NW.js application exploits a zero-day vulnerability in Chromium's V8 JavaScript engine. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the NW.js application's process, potentially escaping the sandbox due to Node.js integration.
*   **Impact:** **High** to **Critical**. Arbitrary code execution, sandbox escape (leading to system compromise due to Node.js access), application crash, denial of service. Severity depends on the specific Chromium vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Regularly Update NW.js:** **Critical.**  Maintain NW.js at the latest stable version. This is the primary defense against Chromium vulnerabilities, as updates include security patches.
        *   **Implement Strong Web Security Practices:** Follow general web security best practices (CSP, input sanitization, secure coding) to reduce the likelihood of triggering or being vulnerable to Chromium exploits.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Keep Applications Updated:** Ensure NW.js applications are updated to benefit from Chromium security updates.
        *   **Maintain a Secure System:** Keep your operating system and other software updated to reduce the overall attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [4. Native UI and System Integration - Insecure Native Modules](./attack_surfaces/4__native_ui_and_system_integration_-_insecure_native_modules.md)

*   **Description:** NW.js allows developers to create native modules for deeper system integration. Vulnerabilities in these custom native modules can be highly critical.
*   **NW.js Contribution:** NW.js *facilitates* native module integration, enabling developers to extend functionality but also introducing the risk of vulnerabilities in custom native code.
*   **Example:** A native module designed to handle file operations has a buffer overflow vulnerability. An attacker crafts malicious input from the web context that triggers this overflow, allowing them to execute arbitrary code at the native module's privilege level, which can be system level due to Node.js context.
*   **Impact:** **High** to **Critical**. Privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution at a potentially high privilege level, system instability, data corruption. Severity depends on the vulnerability and the privileges of the native module.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Secure Native Module Development Practices:** **Critical.**  Employ secure coding practices for native module development. Conduct thorough security audits and penetration testing of native modules.
        *   **Minimize Native Code Complexity:** Keep native modules as simple and minimal as possible. Avoid unnecessary complexity that can introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   **Rigorous Input Validation in Native Modules:** Validate all input received from the web/Node.js context within native modules to prevent injection and other vulnerabilities. Use safe memory management practices in native code.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Native Modules:** Design native modules to operate with the minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Users:**
        *   **Trust Reputable Developers:** Rely on applications from developers known for secure development practices, especially when native modules are involved.
        *   **Monitor Application Permissions:** Be aware of any unusual permission requests or system behavior of NW.js applications, especially those with native integrations.
