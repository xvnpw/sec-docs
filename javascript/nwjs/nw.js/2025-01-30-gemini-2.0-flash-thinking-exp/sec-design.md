# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable developers to build cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
  - Provide a runtime environment that bridges web application capabilities with native desktop functionalities.
  - Offer a faster development cycle for desktop applications by leveraging web development skills and ecosystems.
  - Support a wide range of operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) with a single codebase.
  - Allow web applications to access native system resources and APIs through Node.js integration.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities inherent in web technologies (e.g., XSS, CSRF) can be introduced into desktop applications.
  - Compatibility issues across different operating systems and hardware configurations.
  - Performance limitations compared to native desktop applications, especially for resource-intensive tasks.
  - Dependency on Chromium and Node.js projects, including their release cycles and security updates.
  - Potential for misuse of Node.js APIs to create applications with excessive system privileges or malicious functionalities.
  - Open source project sustainability and community support impacting long-term project viability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Chromium Security Model: nw.js leverages the security features of the embedded Chromium browser, including sandboxing and process isolation for web content. (Implemented within Chromium engine)
  - security control: Node.js Security Features: nw.js integrates Node.js, which has its own set of security considerations and best practices. (Implemented within Node.js runtime)
  - security control: Regular Updates: nw.js project aims to keep Chromium and Node.js components updated to address known security vulnerabilities. (Described in project release notes and update mechanisms)
  - accepted risk: Web Application Security Risks: Applications built with nw.js are susceptible to common web application vulnerabilities if not developed securely.
  - accepted risk: Node.js API Security Risks: Uncontrolled access to Node.js APIs from web content can introduce security risks if not managed properly by application developers.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities: Vulnerabilities in Chromium, Node.js, or other dependencies can affect nw.js applications.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Secure Development Guidelines: Provide comprehensive guidelines and best practices for developers to build secure nw.js applications, covering topics like input validation, output encoding, and secure API usage.
  - security control: Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the nw.js codebase and its dependencies to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Vulnerability Scanning: Integrate automated vulnerability scanning tools into the development and build process to detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies and application code.
  - security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Encourage and provide guidance for developers to implement Content Security Policy in their nw.js applications to mitigate XSS attacks.
  - security control: Subresource Integrity (SRI): Promote the use of Subresource Integrity for external resources loaded by nw.js applications to prevent tampering.
  - security control: Secure Update Mechanism: Implement a secure and reliable mechanism for updating nw.js runtime and applications to patch security vulnerabilities and deliver new features.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Applications may need to implement their own authentication mechanisms if user identity verification is required. nw.js itself does not enforce specific authentication methods.
    - Implementation: Application-level implementation using web technologies (e.g., forms-based authentication, OAuth) or Node.js modules for native authentication.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Applications must implement authorization controls to manage user access to resources and functionalities within the application.
    - Implementation: Application-level implementation based on user roles, permissions, or policies, potentially leveraging Node.js for backend authorization logic.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: All user inputs and external data must be validated to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection if using databases within the application).
    - Implementation: Input validation should be performed both on the client-side (JavaScript) and server-side (Node.js) where applicable. Utilize input sanitization and validation libraries.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Applications that handle sensitive data must use appropriate cryptographic measures to protect data in transit and at rest.
    - Implementation: Leverage Web Crypto API for client-side cryptography and Node.js crypto module for server-side or application-level cryptography. Ensure proper key management and secure storage of cryptographic keys.

  - Enabling developers to leverage web development skills for desktop application creation.
  - Providing a runtime environment for executing web-based desktop applications.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Application Code: High sensitivity. Intellectual property, source of application functionality, vulnerabilities in code can be exploited.
  - User Data within Applications: Sensitivity depends on the application. Could range from low (application settings) to high (personal identifiable information, financial data). Sensitivity is defined by the purpose and functionality of each application built with NW.js.
  - Build Artifacts (Executables): Medium sensitivity. Integrity is crucial to prevent distribution of compromised applications.
  - Development Environment: Medium sensitivity. Access to development environment can lead to unauthorized code changes or data breaches.
