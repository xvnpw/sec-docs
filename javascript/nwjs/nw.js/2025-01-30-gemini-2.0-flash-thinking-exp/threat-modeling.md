# Threat Model Analysis for nwjs/nw.js

## Threat: [Node.js API Abuse via Web Context](./threats/node_js_api_abuse_via_web_context.md)

* **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., XSS) in the web application part of nw.js. This allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the Chromium rendering engine. Due to nw.js exposing Node.js APIs to this context, the attacker can use these APIs to interact with the operating system. This includes reading/writing files, executing system commands, and network operations beyond typical browser limits.
    * **Impact:** Full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, remote control of the user's machine, denial of service.
    * **Affected nw.js Component:** `node-remote` functionality, Node.js API bridge.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Strict Input Validation and Output Encoding to prevent XSS.
        * Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).
        * Minimize or eliminate `node-remote` usage if possible.
        * Apply the principle of least privilege for Node.js API access in the web context.
        * Regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Bypassing CORS and Browser Security Policies](./threats/bypassing_cors_and_browser_security_policies.md)

* **Description:** nw.js intentionally relaxes or bypasses standard browser security features like CORS and CSP. Attackers can exploit this to bypass intended security boundaries. For example, malicious web content could bypass CORS to access sensitive data from other origins or leverage a less strict CSP environment to inject more powerful malicious scripts.
    * **Impact:** Data theft from unintended origins, increased severity of XSS vulnerabilities, potential for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks against internal application components.
    * **Affected nw.js Component:** Chromium security policy enforcement relaxation, CORS bypass, CSP relaxation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strong server-side security, even with relaxed CORS.
        * Implement the strictest possible CSP for application functionality.
        * Carefully handle origins and validate data from different origins.
        * Regular security audits of application security configurations.

## Threat: [Native Module Vulnerabilities](./threats/native_module_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** nw.js applications can utilize Node.js native modules (C/C++). Vulnerabilities in these modules (buffer overflows, memory corruption) can be exploited. Attackers can achieve arbitrary code execution at the native level, bypassing JavaScript security and gaining direct system access. This can occur through malicious npm packages or vulnerabilities in custom native modules.
    * **Impact:** System compromise, arbitrary code execution at the native level, denial of service, application crashes, privilege escalation.
    * **Affected nw.js Component:** Node.js native module loading and execution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use reputable and well-maintained native modules.
        * Regularly update native modules to patch vulnerabilities.
        * Conduct security audits of native modules, especially custom ones.
        * Explore sandboxing or isolation mechanisms for native modules if feasible.

## Threat: [nw.js Specific API Vulnerabilities](./threats/nw_js_specific_api_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** nw.js provides its own APIs bridging Chromium and Node.js. Vulnerabilities in these APIs can be exploited to gain unauthorized Node.js functionality access from the web context or bypass nw.js runtime security checks.
    * **Impact:** Potentially system compromise, application instability, information disclosure, privilege escalation within the nw.js environment.
    * **Affected nw.js Component:** nw.js specific APIs (e.g., `nw.Window`, `nw.App`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep nw.js updated to the latest stable version.
        * Monitor nw.js security advisories.
        * Report potential vulnerabilities to the nw.js development team.
        * Focus code reviews on secure usage of nw.js APIs.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Node.js Packages (npm)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_node_js_packages__npm_.md)

* **Description:** nw.js applications rely on Node.js packages (npm modules). Vulnerabilities in these packages can be exploited to achieve remote code execution within the Node.js context of the nw.js application. This can be through direct or transitive dependencies.
    * **Impact:** System compromise, remote code execution, data theft, denial of service, application instability.
    * **Affected nw.js Component:** Node.js package manager (npm), Node.js module loading.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly audit and update dependencies using tools like `npm audit`.
        * Integrate dependency scanning into CI/CD pipelines.
        * Use dependency management tools and consider dependency pinning/locking.
        * Minimize the number of dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Inter-Process Communication (IPC) leading to Node.js API Access](./threats/insecure_inter-process_communication__ipc__leading_to_node_js_api_access.md)

* **Description:** Insecure IPC implementations in nw.js applications (e.g., using `evalJS` or `postMessage` without proper validation) can be exploited. Attackers might inject malicious code into other application parts via IPC. If this leads to a context with Node.js API access, it can escalate to system-level compromise.
    * **Impact:** Cross-context scripting leading to Node.js API abuse, privilege escalation, potential system compromise, information disclosure.
    * **Affected nw.js Component:** IPC mechanisms provided by nw.js, application's IPC implementation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Design IPC mechanisms with security in mind, minimizing data exchange.
        * Implement strict input validation and output encoding for IPC messages.
        * Apply the principle of least privilege for IPC communication between contexts.
        * Utilize context isolation to limit the impact of IPC vulnerabilities.
        * Thorough code reviews focusing on IPC implementation security.
