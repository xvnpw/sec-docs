# Threat Model Analysis for nwjs/nw.js

## Threat: [File System Manipulation via `nw.Shell.openItem()`](./threats/file_system_manipulation_via__nw_shell_openitem___.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate user-controlled input passed to the `nw.Shell.openItem()` function, a specific NW.js API, to open or execute arbitrary files or directories on the user's system. This could be achieved by crafting malicious links or exploiting input fields that are directly passed to this function without proper sanitization.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive files, execution of malicious executables, or denial-of-service by opening excessive files.

**Affected Component:** `nw.Shell.openItem()` function within the `nw.Shell` module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize any user input before passing it to `nw.Shell.openItem()`.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided paths with this function.
*   Consider using alternative methods for opening specific files or directories with more controlled parameters.

## Threat: [Remote Code Injection via Insecure `node-remote` Usage](./threats/remote_code_injection_via_insecure__node-remote__usage.md)

**Description:** If the `node-remote` option, a specific NW.js configuration, is enabled without proper access controls, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the Node.js context of the application by manipulating network requests or responses. This is especially risky if the application interacts with untrusted remote resources.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the application and potentially the user's system, including data theft, installation of malware, and system disruption.

**Affected Component:** NW.js configuration, specifically the `node-remote` option.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using the `node-remote` option in production environments if possible.
*   If `node-remote` is necessary, implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for remote access.
*   Restrict the origins allowed to access the Node.js context.
*   Carefully validate and sanitize any data received from remote sources.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Local Context via `<webview>`](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_local_context_via__webview_.md)

**Description:** If the `<webview>` tag, a specific NW.js feature, is used to embed untrusted content or if the communication between the main application and the embedded content is not properly secured, an attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute within the context of the embedded page. Due to NW.js's environment, this can have more severe consequences than traditional browser-based XSS.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the `<webview>`, potentially allowing access to application data or functionalities, or even interaction with the local file system if `nodeIntegration` is enabled for the `<webview>`.

**Affected Component:** The `<webview>` tag and its associated attributes and event handlers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only embed content from trusted sources within `<webview>` tags.
*   Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) for the embedded content.
*   Sanitize any data passed between the main application and the `<webview>`.
*   Avoid enabling `nodeIntegration` for `<webview>` unless absolutely necessary for trusted content and with careful consideration of the security implications.
*   Use the `partition` attribute to isolate different `<webview>` instances.
