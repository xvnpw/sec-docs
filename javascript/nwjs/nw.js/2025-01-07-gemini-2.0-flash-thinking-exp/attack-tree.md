Description: Injecting malicious scripts into a vulnerable website loaded within a `webview`, potentially allowing access to the main application's context if `nodeIntegration` is enabled for the `webview`.

Example: A vulnerable external website embedded in a `webview` is compromised, and the injected script uses `require('nw.gui')` to interact with the OS.

Likelihood: Medium

Impact: High (If `nodeIntegration` is enabled)

Effort: Low to Medium

Skill Level: Intermediate

Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Native Node.js Modules (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_native_node_js_modules__critical_node_.md)

Effort: Medium to High

Skill Level: Expert

Detection Difficulty: Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured package.json](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_package_json.md)

This highlights the risks associated with improper configuration within the `package.json` file, a central configuration file for NW.js applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure node-remote Configuration (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_node-remote_configuration__critical_node_.md)

Description: Allowing `node-remote` for untrusted origins, enabling remote code execution (leading to the "Remote Code Execution via node-remote" path).

Likelihood: Medium

Impact: High

Effort: Low

Skill Level: Novice

Detection Difficulty: Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Underlying Technologies (Specific to NW.js Context) (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_underlying_technologies__specific_to_nw_js_context___critical_node_.md)
