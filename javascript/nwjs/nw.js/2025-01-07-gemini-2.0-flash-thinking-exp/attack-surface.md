# Attack Surface Analysis for nwjs/nw.js

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Usage of `nw.require()`](./attack_surfaces/insecure_usage_of__nw_require___.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Usage of `nw.require()`**
    *   **Description:**  Using user-controlled input or data from untrusted sources to determine the path passed to `nw.require()`.
    *   **How nw.js Contributes:** `nw.require()` allows the renderer process (Chromium) to directly load and execute Node.js modules. This powerful feature becomes a vulnerability if the path is not carefully controlled, allowing arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a user-provided filename and uses it directly in `nw.require(userInput)`. An attacker could provide a path to a malicious Node.js module, which would then be executed with the application's privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Never use user-provided input directly in `nw.require()`. Sanitize and validate input rigorously. Use whitelists of allowed modules or predefined paths instead of relying on user input.
        *   **Developers:** Employ code review and static analysis tools to identify potential insecure uses of `nw.require()`.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of `nw.Shell` APIs](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of__nw_shell__apis.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Abuse of `nw.Shell` APIs**
    *   **Description:** Improperly sanitized arguments passed to `nw.Shell` APIs like `openExternal()`, `openItem()`, and `showItemInFolder()`.
    *   **How nw.js Contributes:** These APIs allow the application to interact with the operating system shell. If user-controlled input is used without proper sanitization, attackers can execute arbitrary commands or open malicious files.
    *   **Example:** An application uses `nw.Shell.openExternal(userProvidedURL)` without validating the URL. An attacker could provide a `file://` URL pointing to a local executable, causing it to run.
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate all input used with `nw.Shell` APIs. Use whitelists for allowed protocols and file paths. Avoid directly using user-provided input.
        *   **Developers:**  Consider the security implications of each `nw.Shell` API and whether its use is absolutely necessary.

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution via `node-remote`](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution_via__node-remote_.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Arbitrary Code Execution via `node-remote`**
    *   **Description:** Enabling `node-remote` for untrusted or partially trusted websites.
    *   **How nw.js Contributes:** `node-remote` allows websites loaded within the nw.js application to directly execute Node.js code in the application's context. This bypasses standard browser security and grants significant privileges to the remote content.
    *   **Example:** An application loads a third-party advertisement using `node-remote`. A malicious actor compromises the ad network and injects code that uses Node.js APIs to steal local files or execute system commands.
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  **Never enable `node-remote` for untrusted or partially trusted content.** Only enable it for content you fully control and trust.
        *   **Developers:** If `node-remote` is absolutely necessary, implement strict content security policies (CSP) and other security measures to limit the capabilities of the remote content.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Browser Engine Vulnerabilities Amplified by Node.js Integration](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_browser_engine_vulnerabilities_amplified_by_node_js_integration.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Exploiting Browser Engine Vulnerabilities Amplified by Node.js Integration**
    *   **Description:** Leveraging standard browser engine vulnerabilities (like XSS) to gain access to Node.js functionalities.
    *   **How nw.js Contributes:**  In a standard browser, XSS is typically limited to the browser sandbox. However, in nw.js, a successful XSS attack can be escalated to execute arbitrary code on the user's system by using the exposed Node.js APIs.
    *   **Example:** An application has an XSS vulnerability. An attacker injects JavaScript that uses `nw.require('child_process').exec('malicious_command')` to execute commands on the user's machine.
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Follow secure web development practices to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS. This includes input sanitization, output encoding, and using secure coding frameworks.
        *   **Developers:** Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Updates](./attack_surfaces/insecure_updates.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Updates**
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the application's update mechanism allowing attackers to push malicious updates.
    *   **How nw.js Contributes:** If the application implements its own update mechanism, it needs to be carefully designed and secured to prevent attackers from distributing compromised versions.
    *   **Example:** An application fetches updates from an insecure HTTP endpoint. An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack and replaces the legitimate update with a malicious one.
    *   **Impact:** Critical
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Use secure channels (HTTPS) for update downloads. Verify the authenticity and integrity of updates using digital signatures.
        *   **Developers:** Consider using established and secure update frameworks.
