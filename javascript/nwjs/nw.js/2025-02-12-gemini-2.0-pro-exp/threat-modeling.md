# Threat Model Analysis for nwjs/nw.js

## Threat: [Node.js API Exposure in Renderer Process](./threats/node_js_api_exposure_in_renderer_process.md)

*   **Threat:** Node.js API Exposure in Renderer Process

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability (e.g., XSS, insecure IPC) in the renderer process (Chromium) to gain access to Node.js APIs that were not intended to be exposed.  This is the core NW.js-specific risk. The attacker leverages the *intended* bridging of Chromium and Node.js in an *unintended* way.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker can read/write files, execute system commands, access network resources, install malware, and steal sensitive data.  Full control of the user's machine.
    *   **Affected Component:** `node-remote` (if misused), lack of `context-isolation`, improperly configured preload scripts, insecure inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms *specifically bridging Node.js and Chromium*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable `node-remote` entirely if possible. If required, restrict it to *specific, trusted* origins (not `"*"`).
        *   Ensure `context-isolation` is enabled (default in recent NW.js versions). This is a *direct* NW.js mitigation.
        *   Use a carefully designed preload script to expose *only* the necessary, well-vetted APIs to the renderer process. Avoid exposing entire modules. This is a *direct* NW.js mitigation.
        *   Implement secure IPC using `window.postMessage` with origin checks and structured cloning. Avoid passing raw functions or objects.  Focus on the *bridge* between Node.js and the renderer.
        *   Sanitize all user input and data received from external sources to prevent XSS vulnerabilities *that could be used to access the Node.js bridge*.

## Threat: [`webview` Tag with Node.js Integration](./threats/_webview__tag_with_node_js_integration.md)

*   **Threat:** `webview` Tag with Node.js Integration

    *   **Description:** The application uses the NW.js-provided `<webview>` tag with the `nodeintegration` attribute enabled. If the content loaded in the `webview` is compromised (e.g., via XSS or a malicious website), it gains access to Node.js APIs *because of this NW.js-specific feature*.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to direct Node.js API exposure, this can lead to complete system compromise if the attacker can control the content within the `webview`.
    *   **Affected Component:** `<webview>` tag *specifically* with the `nodeintegration` attribute (an NW.js feature).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using `nodeintegration` within `<webview>` tags whenever possible.** This is the most crucial mitigation, and it directly addresses the NW.js-specific risk.
        *   If absolutely necessary, load *only* trusted content into the `webview`.
        *   Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) within the `webview` to limit its capabilities. This is important because the `webview` is a Chromium component *within* the NW.js context.
        *   Use a separate process for the `webview` (if possible) to further isolate it. This leverages NW.js's process management.
        *   Implement robust communication mechanisms between the main process and the `webview` process, avoiding direct API exposure. Again, focus on the *bridge* provided by NW.js.

## Threat: [Outdated Chromium Vulnerability (Impacting NW.js)](./threats/outdated_chromium_vulnerability__impacting_nw_js_.md)

*   **Threat:** Outdated Chromium Vulnerability (Impacting NW.js)

    *   **Description:** The NW.js application uses an outdated version of Chromium *that is bundled within NW.js*. An attacker exploits a known browser vulnerability *in this bundled version* to gain control of the renderer process. This is distinct from a general browser vulnerability because it's tied to the specific Chromium version *shipped with NW.js*.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution within the renderer process, potentially leading to further exploitation if Node.js integration is also vulnerable (especially relevant due to the close coupling in NW.js).
    *   **Affected Component:** The *bundled* Chromium version within NW.js.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use the latest stable release of NW.js. This is the primary mitigation, directly addressing the NW.js component.
        *   Monitor NW.js release notes for security updates and apply them promptly. This is specific to NW.js, not general browser updates.
        *   If a critical vulnerability is disclosed and a patch is not immediately available, consider temporarily disabling affected features or using a custom NW.js build with a patched Chromium (a more advanced, NW.js-specific mitigation).

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability (Node.js Module within NW.js context)](./threats/dependency_vulnerability__node_js_module_within_nw_js_context_.md)

* **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerability (Node.js Module within NW.js context)
  *  **Description:** The application uses a third-party Node.js module with a known vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code within the Node.js context *provided by NW.js*. The key here is that the vulnerable module is running within the privileged Node.js environment *integrated into the application by NW.js*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the module and vulnerability, but the tight integration with the desktop environment via NW.js significantly increases the potential impact, often leading to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any vulnerable third-party Node.js module included in the application's dependencies, *specifically within the NW.js runtime environment*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly run `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Update all Node.js modules to their latest patched versions.
        *   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool for deeper dependency analysis and vulnerability detection.
        *   Carefully vet third-party modules before including them, prioritizing well-maintained and widely-used packages.
        *   Consider forking and patching critical modules if updates are not available. The key is to ensure the *Node.js environment within NW.js* is secure.
