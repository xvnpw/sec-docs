# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for nwjs/nw.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Node.js Usage in Renderers](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_node_js_usage_in_renderers.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Restrict Node.js API access within renderer processes (web pages).

**Description:**
1.  **Review `package.json`:** Examine the `package.json` file.  Look for the `node-remote` field.  If it's present, it should only list *specific* Node.js modules that *absolutely must* be accessible from *specific* renderer processes.  Ideally, `node-remote` should be avoided entirely.
2.  **Check Window Configuration:**  In your main JavaScript file (where you create your main NW.js window), ensure that the `window` options *do not* include `nodeIntegration: true` or `webviewTag: true` without also having `contextIsolation: true`.  These options, if misused, can enable Node.js in renderers.
3.  **Audit Renderer Code:**  Thoroughly review all HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files that are loaded as part of your application's UI.  Search for any direct calls to Node.js APIs (e.g., `require('fs')`, `process.env`, etc.).  If found, refactor the code to use message passing (see strategy #3).
4.  **Remove `nodeIntegration` from `<webview>` tags:** If you are using `<webview>` tags, ensure they do not have the `nodeintegration` attribute.
5. **Remove `nwdisable` and `nwfaketop` from `<webview>` tags:** If you are using `<webview>` tags, ensure they do not have the `nwdisable` and `nwfaketop` attributes.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):**  If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into your renderer (e.g., via XSS), they could directly execute Node.js code, gaining full control over the user's system.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High, becomes Critical with Node.js access):**  XSS alone is a serious threat, but with Node.js access, it escalates to RCE.
*   **Data Exfiltration (High):**  Node.js access allows attackers to read and potentially exfiltrate sensitive files from the user's system.
*   **System Modification (High):**  Attackers could modify system files, install malware, or otherwise compromise the user's system.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:** Risk reduced from Critical to (ideally) Negligible.  The primary attack vector is eliminated.
*   **XSS:**  Severity reduced from Critical (potential RCE) to High (still a serious threat, but limited to the renderer context).
*   **Data Exfiltration/System Modification:** Risk significantly reduced, as direct access to system resources is removed.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `package.json`:  `node-remote` is *not* used.  `nodeIntegration` is set to `false` globally. `contextIsolation` is set to `true` globally.
*   Main Window Configuration:  `nodeIntegration: false`, `contextIsolation: true` are explicitly set.
*   Renderer Code:  A preliminary review has been done, but a full audit is pending.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Renderer Code:  A complete audit of all renderer code is required to definitively confirm that *no* direct Node.js calls are present.  This is a high-priority task.
*   `<webview>` tags: Need to check all instances of `<webview>` tags.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Context Isolation](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_context_isolation.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Ensure `contextIsolation` is enabled.

**Description:**
1.  **Verify `package.json`:**  Check your `package.json` file.  `contextIsolation` should be set to `true` (or not explicitly set to `false`, as it's `true` by default in recent NW.js versions).  It's best to explicitly set it to `true` for clarity.
2.  **Window Configuration:**  In your main window creation code, double-check that `contextIsolation: true` is set in the window options.
3.  **Testing:**  Attempt to access Node.js APIs directly from your renderer code (e.g., in the browser's developer console).  If `contextIsolation` is working, these attempts should fail.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **RCE (Critical):**  Even if an attacker manages to inject code that *tries* to use Node.js, `contextIsolation` prevents direct access, significantly mitigating RCE.
*   **XSS (High, becomes Critical without context isolation):**  Similar to the previous strategy, it reduces the impact of XSS.
*   **Bypass of Message Passing Security (High):**  If your message passing system (see #3) has vulnerabilities, `contextIsolation` provides a second layer of defense, preventing direct access even if the messaging system is compromised.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:** Risk significantly reduced, acting as a crucial second layer of defense even if other mitigations fail.
*   **XSS:**  Severity reduced from Critical to High.
*   **Bypass of Message Passing:**  Provides significant protection against vulnerabilities in the message passing system.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `package.json`:  `contextIsolation: true` is explicitly set.
*   Main Window Configuration:  `contextIsolation: true` is explicitly set.
*   Basic Testing:  Initial tests confirm that Node.js APIs are not directly accessible from the renderer.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   More comprehensive testing is needed to ensure that there are no edge cases or bypasses of `contextIsolation`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Strict Message Passing (Preload Scripts)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_strict_message_passing__preload_scripts_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Use a well-defined message passing system via preload scripts.

**Description:**
1.  **Create Preload Scripts:**  Create JavaScript files that will act as intermediaries.  These scripts will be loaded into a context that *can* access Node.js.  These are NW.js specific, as they leverage the NW.js runtime's ability to bridge Node.js and the browser.
2.  **Define Allowed Messages:**  Create a strict protocol for the messages that can be exchanged between the renderer and the preload script (and, by extension, the main process).  This should be a whitelist of allowed message types and data structures.
3.  **Implement Message Handlers:**
    *   **Preload Script:**  Use `chrome.runtime.onMessage.addListener` (or a similar mechanism) to listen for messages from the renderer.  Validate *every* message against the allowed protocol.  If a message is valid, perform the requested action (using Node.js APIs if necessary) and send a response back to the renderer.
    *   **Renderer:**  Use `window.postMessage` to send messages to the preload script.  Listen for responses using `window.addEventListener('message', ...)` and validate the responses.
    *   **Main Process (Optional):**  If your preload script needs to communicate with the main Node.js process, use `ipcRenderer.send` and `ipcMain.on` (from the `electron` module, which is available in NW.js) for communication.  Apply the same strict validation to these messages.
4.  **Expose Limited API:**  In your preload script, use `contextBridge.exposeInMainWorld` to expose *only* the necessary functions to the renderer.  These functions should be simple wrappers that send messages to the preload script's message handler. This is a key NW.js/Electron feature.
5.  **Validate All Input:**  Treat *all* data received from the renderer as untrusted.  Validate data types, lengths, and formats *before* using them in any Node.js operations.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **RCE (Critical):**  By controlling the communication between the renderer and Node.js, you prevent arbitrary code execution.
*   **Data Exfiltration/System Modification (High):**  Limits the actions that can be performed via Node.js, reducing the risk of unauthorized access to system resources.
*   **Injection Attacks (High):**  Strict message validation prevents attackers from injecting malicious data that could be misinterpreted by the Node.js side.

**Impact:**
*   **RCE:**  Risk significantly reduced, as the attack surface is limited to the defined message protocol.
*   **Data Exfiltration/System Modification:**  Risk reduced by limiting the available Node.js operations.
*   **Injection Attacks:**  Risk significantly reduced through strict message validation.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic Preload Script:  A basic preload script exists, but it's not fully implemented.
*   Message Handlers:  Skeleton message handlers are in place, but they lack robust validation.
*   `contextBridge`:  `contextBridge` is being used, but the exposed API needs to be reviewed and minimized.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   **Strict Message Protocol:**  A formal, documented message protocol is needed.
*   **Robust Validation:**  All message handlers need to implement thorough input validation.
*   **API Minimization:**  The API exposed by `contextBridge` needs to be carefully reviewed and reduced to the absolute minimum.
*   **Main Process Communication:**  If communication with the main process is required, it needs to be implemented with the same security considerations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Chromium Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_chromium_features.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:**  Use Chromium command-line switches to disable unneeded features.

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Unnecessary Features:**  Review the list of Chromium command-line switches (available online).  Determine which features your application *does not* need.  Examples include plugins, extensions, WebRTC, remote fonts, etc.
2.  **Modify `package.json`:**  Add the `"chromium-args"` field to your `package.json`.  Set its value to a string containing the desired command-line switches, separated by spaces.  For example: `"chromium-args": "--disable-plugins --disable-extensions"`. This is NW.js specific, as it leverages the underlying Chromium engine.
3.  **Testing:**  Test your application thoroughly after disabling features to ensure that functionality is not broken.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Vulnerabilities in Chromium Components (Variable Severity):**  Reduces the attack surface by removing potential vulnerabilities in unused Chromium features.  The severity depends on the specific features disabled and the vulnerabilities they might contain.
*   **Resource Consumption (Low):**  Disabling unnecessary features can slightly improve performance and reduce memory usage.

**Impact:**
*   **Vulnerabilities:**  Risk reduction is variable, but generally beneficial.  It's a defense-in-depth measure.
*   **Resource Consumption:**  Minor positive impact.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   `package.json`:  `"chromium-args": "--disable-plugins"` is currently set.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   A comprehensive review of Chromium features is needed to identify other features that can be safely disabled.  This should be based on a thorough understanding of the application's requirements.
