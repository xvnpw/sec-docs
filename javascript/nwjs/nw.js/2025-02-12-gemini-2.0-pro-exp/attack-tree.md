## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Node.js Integration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_node_js_integration.md)

1.  **(Exploit Node.js Integration) -> [[Node.js Module Vulns]] -> (Outdated/Unpatched) or (Known Vulns)**

    *   **Description:** This attack path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in Node.js modules that are either outdated/unpatched or have publicly known vulnerabilities. NW.js applications often bundle or rely on numerous Node.js modules, increasing the likelihood of including vulnerable components.
    *   **[[Node.js Module Vulns]] (Critical Node):** This is the central point of this attack path. Vulnerabilities in Node.js modules, especially native modules, can directly lead to arbitrary code execution.
        *   **[[Native Modules]] (Critical Node):** Native modules, written in C/C++, are particularly dangerous because vulnerabilities like buffer overflows can lead to direct memory manipulation and code execution.
        *   **[[3rd Party]] (Critical Node):** The vast ecosystem of third-party Node.js modules introduces a significant risk. Many applications rely on dozens or even hundreds of these modules, increasing the attack surface.
    *   **(Outdated/Unpatched):** The application bundles or uses Node.js modules that have not been updated to address known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can leverage publicly available exploits for these vulnerabilities.
    *   **(Known Vulns):** The application uses Node.js modules with known vulnerabilities, even if they are not necessarily outdated. Attackers can use vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, Snyk, npm audit) to identify and exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  The attacker identifies the NW.js application and its dependencies.
        2.  The attacker scans the application's dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or vulnerability databases.
        3.  The attacker finds a vulnerable Node.js module (either native or third-party) that is used by the application.
        4.  The attacker crafts an exploit targeting the specific vulnerability. This might involve sending specially crafted input to the application or triggering a specific code path.
        5.  The attacker executes the exploit, achieving arbitrary code execution within the NW.js application's context.
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   Regularly update all Node.js modules (including native modules) to the latest versions.
        *   Use vulnerability scanners (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot) to automatically identify and remediate vulnerable dependencies.
        *   Carefully vet third-party modules before including them in the application.
        *   Implement a secure build process that includes dependency analysis.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse NW.js Specific Features - Shell Command Injection](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_nw_js_specific_features_-_shell_command_injection.md)

2.  **(Abuse NW.js Specific Features) -> (Shell Command) -> (Unsafe Eval) or (Dynamic Code) -> (User Input)**

    *   **Description:** This attack path exploits command injection vulnerabilities arising from the unsafe use of dynamic code execution functions (like `eval()`, `new Function()`) with user-supplied input. NW.js's ability to execute shell commands makes this a particularly high-risk area.
    *   **(Shell Command):** NW.js allows direct execution of shell commands through Node.js APIs (e.g., `child_process.exec`, `child_process.spawn`). If user input is not properly sanitized, this can lead to command injection.
    *   **(Unsafe Eval) or (Dynamic Code):** The application uses `eval()` or similar functions to execute code that is constructed, at least in part, from user-supplied input. This is a highly dangerous practice.
    *   **(User Input):** The vulnerability is triggered by user-supplied input that is not properly validated or sanitized before being used in a dynamic code execution context.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  The attacker identifies an input field or parameter in the NW.js application that is used in a shell command or dynamic code execution function.
        2.  The attacker crafts malicious input that includes shell commands or JavaScript code. For example, if the application uses `eval("var x = " + userInput)`, the attacker might provide input like `"1; console.log(process.env); //"`.
        3.  The attacker submits the malicious input to the application.
        4.  The application executes the attacker's code, leading to arbitrary command execution or JavaScript code execution within the NW.js context.
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   **Avoid `eval()` and similar functions whenever possible.** Use safer alternatives for parsing data or constructing dynamic logic.
        *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* user input, especially data used in shell commands or dynamic code execution. Use well-established libraries for input validation and escaping.
        *   **Use parameterized queries or APIs:** If interacting with databases or external systems, use parameterized queries or APIs that prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the NW.js application runs with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse NW.js Specific Features - File System Access](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_nw_js_specific_features_-_file_system_access.md)

3.  **(Abuse NW.js Specific Features) -> (File System) -> (Unfiltered Paths) -> (User Input) -> [[Read/Write Anywhere]]**

    *   **Description:** This attack path exploits path traversal vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to read, write, or delete arbitrary files on the system. NW.js's extensive file system access, combined with insufficient input validation, creates this risk.
    *   **(File System):** NW.js provides extensive file system access through Node.js APIs (e.g., `fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile`).
    *   **(Unfiltered Paths):** The application uses user-supplied input to construct file paths without proper validation or sanitization. This allows attackers to inject path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
    *   **(User Input):** The vulnerability is triggered by user-supplied input that is used to construct a file path.
    *   **[[Read/Write Anywhere]] (Critical Node):** The application has overly permissive file system access, or the path traversal vulnerability allows the attacker to escape the intended directory and access arbitrary files on the system.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  The attacker identifies an input field or parameter in the NW.js application that is used to construct a file path.
        2.  The attacker crafts malicious input that includes path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\System32\config\SAM`).
        3.  The attacker submits the malicious input to the application.
        4.  The application uses the attacker-supplied path to access a file outside the intended directory.
        5.  The attacker can read sensitive files, overwrite critical system files, or delete files, potentially leading to system compromise or data loss.
    *   **Mitigations:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input used to construct file paths. Reject any input containing path traversal sequences (`..`, `/`, `\`).
        *   **Use a Whitelist:** If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed file paths or directories and reject any input that does not match the whitelist.
        *   **Normalize Paths:** Before using a file path, normalize it to remove any redundant or potentially malicious components. Use a library function like `path.normalize()` in Node.js.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the NW.js application only the minimum necessary file system permissions. Avoid granting write access to sensitive directories.
        *   **Chroot Jail (Advanced):** Consider using a chroot jail to confine the NW.js application to a specific directory, preventing it from accessing files outside that directory. This is a more complex mitigation but provides strong isolation.
