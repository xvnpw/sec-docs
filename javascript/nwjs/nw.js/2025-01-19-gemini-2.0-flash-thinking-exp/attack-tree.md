## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Node.js Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_node_js_vulnerabilities.md)

- Exploit Outdated Node.js Version ***CRITICAL NODE***
  - Leverage Known Node.js Vulnerabilities for that Version ***CRITICAL NODE***
- Exploit Vulnerable Node.js Modules ***CRITICAL NODE***
  - Trigger Vulnerability in the Package ***CRITICAL NODE***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Exploit Node.js Vulnerabilities:**
- **Exploit Outdated Node.js Version:**
  - **Leverage Known Node.js Vulnerabilities for that Version:** Attackers identify the specific outdated Node.js version bundled with the nw.js application and utilize publicly known exploits targeting vulnerabilities present in that version to achieve arbitrary code execution within the Node.js environment.
- **Exploit Vulnerable Node.js Modules:**
  - **Trigger Vulnerability in the Package:** Attackers identify vulnerable npm packages used by the application and trigger known vulnerabilities within those packages. This can be achieved by crafting specific inputs or exploiting API endpoints in a way that triggers the vulnerability, leading to arbitrary code execution within the Node.js environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Chromium Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_chromium_vulnerabilities.md)

- Exploit Outdated Chromium Version ***CRITICAL NODE***
  - Leverage Known Chromium Vulnerabilities for that Version ***CRITICAL NODE***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Exploit Chromium Vulnerabilities:**
- **Exploit Outdated Chromium Version:**
  - **Leverage Known Chromium Vulnerabilities for that Version:** Attackers identify the outdated Chromium version used by nw.js and exploit known browser vulnerabilities (e.g., in the rendering engine, JavaScript engine) to achieve code execution. This can potentially lead to sandbox escape, allowing access beyond the application's intended boundaries.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse nw.js Specific APIs](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_nw_js_specific_apis.md)

- Exploit `nw.Shell` API ***CRITICAL NODE***
- Exploit `nw.App` API
  - Exploit `nw.App.dataPath` or other file system access ***CRITICAL NODE***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Abuse nw.js Specific APIs:**
- **Exploit `nw.Shell` API:** Attackers leverage the `nw.Shell` API to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system. This can involve injecting malicious commands into functions like `nw.Shell.openItem()` or `nw.Shell.exec()`, if the application uses these functions with unsanitized user input or in a vulnerable manner.
- **Exploit `nw.App.dataPath` or other file system access:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in how the application handles file paths, particularly when using `nw.App.dataPath` or the Node.js `fs` module. By manipulating file paths provided by users or through other means, attackers can potentially read, write, or execute arbitrary files on the system, leading to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Logic via nw.js Features](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_logic_via_nw_js_features.md)

- Insecure Handling of `node-remote` ***CRITICAL NODE***
  - Execute arbitrary Node.js code from the remote origin ***CRITICAL NODE***
- Insecure File System Access via nw.js APIs ***CRITICAL NODE***
  - Manipulate file paths or content to achieve code execution ***CRITICAL NODE***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Exploit Application Logic via nw.js Features:**
- **Insecure Handling of `node-remote`:**
  - **Execute arbitrary Node.js code from the remote origin:** If `node-remote` is enabled for untrusted origins, attackers can host malicious content on a remote server. When the nw.js application loads this content (e.g., in a frame or window), the remote content gains the ability to execute arbitrary Node.js code within the application's context, effectively compromising the application.
- **Insecure File System Access via nw.js APIs:**
  - **Manipulate file paths or content to achieve code execution:** Attackers exploit flaws in the application's logic that involve file system operations. By manipulating file paths or the content of files accessed by the application (e.g., configuration files, scripts), attackers can inject malicious code that gets executed by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise the Build/Distribution Process](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_the_builddistribution_process.md)

- Inject Malicious Code into the Application Package ***CRITICAL NODE***
  - Compromise the build environment ***CRITICAL NODE***
  - Inject malicious code into the final application package ***CRITICAL NODE***
- Tamper with the Application Installer ***CRITICAL NODE***
  - Compromise the installer creation process ***CRITICAL NODE***
  - Modify the installer to execute malicious code on installation ***CRITICAL NODE***

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Compromise the Build/Distribution Process:**
- **Inject Malicious Code into the Application Package:**
  - **Compromise the build environment:** Attackers compromise the development or build infrastructure (e.g., developer machines, CI/CD servers). This allows them to inject malicious code directly into the application's source code or build artifacts before the application is packaged.
  - **Inject malicious code into the final application package:** Attackers directly modify the application package after it has been built but before distribution. This could involve adding malicious files, modifying existing executables, or altering configuration files to execute malicious code upon application launch.
- **Tamper with the Application Installer:**
  - **Compromise the installer creation process:** Attackers compromise the process used to create the application's installer (e.g., by modifying scripts or tools used for installer generation). This allows them to embed malicious code within the installer itself.
  - **Modify the installer to execute malicious code on installation:** Attackers directly modify the application's installer package to execute malicious code on the user's system during the installation process. This could involve adding custom scripts or executables that run with elevated privileges during installation.
