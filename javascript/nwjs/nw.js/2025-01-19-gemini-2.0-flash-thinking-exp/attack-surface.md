# Attack Surface Analysis for nwjs/nw.js

## Attack Surface: [Arbitrary Code Execution via `require()`](./attack_surfaces/arbitrary_code_execution_via__require___.md)

**Description:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the user's system by manipulating paths passed to the Node.js `require()` function.

**How nw.js Contributes:** nw.js provides direct access to Node.js APIs within the application's JavaScript context, making `require()` available. If the application dynamically constructs paths based on user input or external data without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data theft, malware installation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted Node.js API Access](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_node_js_api_access.md)

**Description:** The full suite of Node.js APIs (e.g., `fs`, `child_process`, `net`) is accessible from the application's JavaScript. Vulnerabilities in the application logic can be exploited to call these APIs for malicious purposes.

**How nw.js Contributes:** This is a core feature of nw.js, bridging the web and native environments. It grants web developers powerful system-level capabilities.

**Impact:** File system manipulation, execution of arbitrary commands, network attacks, data exfiltration.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Chromium Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_chromium_version.md)

**Description:** The nw.js application bundles a specific version of Chromium. If this version is outdated, the application inherits all the known vulnerabilities present in that Chromium version.

**How nw.js Contributes:** nw.js is built on top of Chromium. The security of the application is directly tied to the security of the bundled Chromium version.

**Impact:** Depends on the Chromium vulnerability, but can include remote code execution, information disclosure, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

## Attack Surface: [`node-remote` Enabled (or Improperly Isolated Contexts)](./attack_surfaces/_node-remote__enabled__or_improperly_isolated_contexts_.md)

**Description:** When `node-remote` is enabled, Node.js integration is available in remote web pages loaded by the application. This significantly expands the attack surface, as a compromised website could directly execute Node.js code within the application's context. Even without `node-remote`, insufficient context isolation can lead to similar issues.

**How nw.js Contributes:** nw.js provides the `node-remote` option and manages the context isolation between the web and Node.js environments. Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in this isolation can be exploited.

**Impact:** Full system compromise, data theft, malware installation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Application Packaging and Distribution](./attack_surfaces/insecure_application_packaging_and_distribution.md)

**Description:** If the application package is not properly signed or protected, attackers could tamper with it to inject malicious code. Insecure update mechanisms can also be exploited to deliver malicious updates.

**How nw.js Contributes:** nw.js applications are typically packaged as standalone executables. The integrity of this package is crucial.

**Impact:** Installation of malware, data theft, complete control over the user's system.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical
