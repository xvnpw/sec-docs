### Key Attack Surface List for `minimist` (High & Critical - Direct Involvement)

Here's a filtered list of key attack surfaces where `minimist` is directly involved, focusing on high and critical severity risks:

* **Prototype Pollution:**
    * **Description:** Attackers can inject properties into the `Object.prototype` by crafting specific command-line arguments. This can globally impact the application and potentially other libraries.
    * **How `minimist` contributes to the attack surface:** `minimist`'s parsing logic, by default, allows for the creation of object properties based on the provided argument keys, including special properties like `__proto__` and `constructor.prototype`.
    * **Example:**  `node app.js --__proto__.polluted=true`
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, arbitrary code execution (if the polluted property is used in a sensitive context), information disclosure, and unexpected application behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid using `minimist` if possible:** Consider using more secure argument parsing libraries that have addressed prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
        * **Sanitize or filter input:** Before processing the parsed arguments, remove or sanitize any keys that could be used for prototype pollution (e.g., `__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`).
        * **Freeze the prototype:**  While not always feasible or desirable, freezing `Object.prototype` can prevent modification. However, this can break compatibility with other code.
        * **Use a deep clone:**  Create a deep clone of the parsed arguments object to isolate it from the global prototype.
        * **Utilize a security-focused wrapper:** Employ a wrapper around `minimist` that sanitizes input or prevents prototype pollution.

* **Argument Injection/Manipulation:**
    * **Description:** Attackers can manipulate command-line arguments to influence the application's behavior in unintended ways, potentially leading to indirect vulnerabilities.
    * **How `minimist` contributes to the attack surface:** `minimist` parses the command-line arguments and makes them readily available to the application, which might then use these arguments in insecure ways.
    * **Example:** `node app.js --file="../sensitive_data.txt"` (potential path traversal if `--file` is used to open files).
    * **Impact:** Path traversal, indirect command injection, indirect SQL injection, logic errors, and information disclosure, depending on how the arguments are used by the application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input validation:** Thoroughly validate all parsed arguments against expected formats, types, and values before using them.
        * **Sanitization:** Sanitize arguments to remove potentially harmful characters or sequences before using them in sensitive operations (e.g., file paths, database queries, system commands).
        * **Avoid constructing commands or paths directly from user input:** Use safe APIs and parameterized queries where possible.
