Threat Model: Compromising Application via Chart.js - High-Risk Sub-Tree

Objective: Compromise application using Chart.js by exploiting its weaknesses.

High-Risk Sub-Tree:
├── OR: Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities
│   └── AND: Inject Malicious Data into Chart Configuration
│       └── OR: Inject Malicious Labels/Tooltips ** (CRITICAL NODE)** --> HIGH RISK
├── OR: Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities
│   └── AND: Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities (if using plugins)
│       └── OR: Use Known Vulnerable Plugins ** (CRITICAL NODE)** --> HIGH RISK
├── OR: Exploit Vulnerabilities within Chart.js Library Itself
│   └── AND: Leverage Known Chart.js Vulnerabilities ** (CRITICAL NODE)** --> HIGH RISK

Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

1. Inject Malicious Labels/Tooltips ** (CRITICAL NODE)** --> HIGH RISK
   * **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious code (typically JavaScript) into the data used for chart labels or tooltips. If the application doesn't properly sanitize this input before passing it to Chart.js, the library will render the malicious code as part of the chart.
   * **Likelihood:** Medium - This is a common web application vulnerability, especially if developers are not aware of the risks of unsanitized input in client-side rendering libraries.
   * **Impact:** Critical - Successful exploitation leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the context of the application. Consequences include:
      * **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the user's session cookies to gain unauthorized access.
      * **Account Takeover:** Performing actions on behalf of the user.
      * **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page.
      * **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
      * **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the web page.
   * **Mitigation:**
      * **Robust Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all data used for labels and tooltips on the server-side or using a trusted client-side library before passing it to Chart.js. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding).
      * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources and execute scripts, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.
      * **Secure Templating:** Use templating engines that automatically escape output by default.

2. Use Known Vulnerable Plugins ** (CRITICAL NODE)** --> HIGH RISK
   * **Attack Vector:** The application uses a Chart.js plugin that has known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
   * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends on the popularity and maintenance status of the plugins used. Less popular or unmaintained plugins are more likely to have unpatched vulnerabilities.
   * **Impact:** Critical - The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the plugin. Common consequences include:
      * **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In severe cases, attackers might be able to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
      * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Plugins might introduce their own XSS vulnerabilities.
      * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Vulnerabilities could allow attackers to crash the browser.
      * **Data Manipulation:** Plugins might have vulnerabilities that allow attackers to alter chart data or behavior.
   * **Mitigation:**
      * **Regularly Update Plugins:** Keep all Chart.js plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
      * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies, including Chart.js plugins.
      * **Plugin Auditing:** Carefully vet and audit plugins before using them, especially those from untrusted sources. Consider the plugin's popularity, maintenance activity, and security track record.
      * **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** If using plugins from CDNs, use SRI tags to ensure the integrity of the plugin files.

3. Leverage Known Chart.js Vulnerabilities ** (CRITICAL NODE)** --> HIGH RISK
   * **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities within the Chart.js library itself.
   * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium - Depends on the age and severity of the vulnerability and how quickly the development team applies updates. Widely known and easily exploitable vulnerabilities are more likely to be targeted.
   * **Impact:** Significant to Critical - The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. Common consequences include:
      * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Vulnerabilities in how Chart.js handles certain inputs or configurations could lead to XSS.
      * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Maliciously crafted input could crash the browser or cause performance issues.
      * **Client-Side Logic Manipulation:** Vulnerabilities might allow attackers to alter the behavior of the chart or the application's client-side logic.
   * **Mitigation:**
      * **Keep Chart.js Updated:** Regularly update Chart.js to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
      * **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for Chart.js to stay informed about new vulnerabilities and updates.
      * **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI tags when including Chart.js from a CDN to ensure the integrity of the library file.
      * **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can potentially detect and block attempts to exploit known vulnerabilities.

This high-risk sub-tree highlights the most critical areas to focus on when securing an application that uses Chart.js. Prioritizing mitigations for these attack vectors will significantly reduce the overall risk of compromise.
