# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Hapi.js is an open-source, high-quality, configuration-centric framework for building web applications and services.
  - The primary goal is to provide a robust, reliable, and extensible platform that simplifies the development of scalable and maintainable backend systems.
  - Key priorities include developer experience, performance, security, and community support.
  - Hapi.js aims to be a framework of choice for developers building mission-critical applications, emphasizing stability and predictability.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to widespread application security breaches, damaging the reputation and trust in hapi.js.
  - Lack of community support or maintainership could lead to stagnation and eventual obsolescence of the framework.
  - Performance issues or scalability limitations could hinder the adoption of hapi.js for large-scale applications.
  - Breaking changes in new versions without proper migration paths could frustrate developers and reduce adoption.
  - Dependency on vulnerable or unmaintained third-party libraries could introduce security and stability risks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are likely performed by maintainers and community contributors as part of the open-source development process. (Location: GitHub Pull Request reviews)
  - security control: Static code analysis and linters are likely used to enforce code quality and identify potential issues. (Location: Project's development workflow, potentially CI/CD pipelines)
  - security control: Dependency scanning is likely performed to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Location: Project's development workflow, potentially CI/CD pipelines)
  - security control: Regular updates to dependencies are likely performed to address known vulnerabilities. (Location: Project's maintenance practices)
  - security control: Public vulnerability reporting process is in place, allowing security researchers to report issues. (Location: GitHub repository, security policy if available)
  - accepted risk: Open-source nature means vulnerabilities might be publicly disclosed before a patch is available.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security fixes might lead to delays in patching vulnerabilities.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline, including SAST and DAST tools.
  - security control: Establish a formal security incident response plan to handle reported vulnerabilities efficiently.
  - security control: Conduct periodic security audits and penetration testing by external security experts.
  - security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using hapi.js to build secure applications.
  - security control: Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies and facilitate vulnerability management.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Hapi.js should provide mechanisms and best practices for implementing various authentication strategies (e.g., session-based, token-based, OAuth).
    - Requirement: The framework should not enforce any specific authentication mechanism, allowing developers flexibility in choosing the most appropriate method for their application.
    - Requirement: Hapi.js should offer plugins or middleware to simplify the integration of authentication libraries and services.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Hapi.js should provide mechanisms and best practices for implementing fine-grained authorization controls.
    - Requirement: The framework should allow developers to define roles and permissions and enforce access control policies based on user roles or attributes.
    - Requirement: Hapi.js should offer plugins or middleware to simplify the integration of authorization libraries and services (e.g., RBAC, ABAC).
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Hapi.js should encourage and facilitate robust input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks (SQL injection, XSS, command injection).
    - Requirement: The framework should provide tools or libraries for defining input schemas and validating request data.
    - Requirement: Hapi.js should offer built-in protection against common web attacks, such as preventing directory traversal or path manipulation.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Hapi.js should provide secure and easy-to-use APIs for cryptographic operations when needed (e.g., hashing passwords, encrypting sensitive data).
    - Requirement: The framework should recommend and integrate with well-vetted and secure cryptographic libraries.
    - Requirement: Hapi.js should avoid implementing custom cryptography and rely on established standards and libraries.
    - Requirement: Hapi.js should provide guidance on secure storage of sensitive data, including encryption at rest and in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For hapi.js itself, the critical business process is maintaining the framework's integrity, security, and availability to ensure its continued adoption and trust within the developer community.
  - For applications built with hapi.js, critical business processes will vary depending on the application's purpose. Examples include e-commerce transactions, data processing, content delivery, API services, etc. The security of hapi.js directly impacts the security of these downstream business processes.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - Hapi.js framework itself does not directly handle sensitive data. However, applications built using hapi.js will likely handle various types of data, including:
    - User credentials (passwords, API keys) - Highly sensitive, requiring strong protection.
    - Personal Identifiable Information (PII) - Sensitive, requiring protection according to privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
    - Business-critical data - Sensitivity depends on the nature of the business and data.
    - Application configuration data - May contain sensitive information like database credentials, API keys.
