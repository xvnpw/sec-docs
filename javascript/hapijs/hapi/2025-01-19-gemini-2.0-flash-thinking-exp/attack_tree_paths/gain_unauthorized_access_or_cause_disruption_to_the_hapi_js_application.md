**High-Risk Paths (Examples - This is where the provided attack tree would expand):**

* **Exploit Authentication and Authorization Flaws:**
    * **Description:** Attackers bypass authentication mechanisms or exploit authorization vulnerabilities to gain access to resources they are not permitted to access.
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate to High, depending on the complexity and security of the implemented authentication and authorization.
    * **Impact:**  Full access to user accounts, sensitive data, and administrative functionalities.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., multi-factor authentication).
        * Use secure password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
        * Enforce principle of least privilege for authorization.
        * Regularly review and audit access control rules.
        * Utilize Hapi.js plugins like `hapi-auth-jwt2` or `bell` for secure authentication.
        * Avoid storing sensitive information in cookies or local storage without proper encryption.
    * **Hapi.js Specific Considerations:**  Carefully configure authentication strategies and authorization policies within Hapi.js routes and handlers. Leverage Hapi.js's built-in authentication features and plugin ecosystem.

* **Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious data into application inputs, leading to unintended consequences like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), or command injection.
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate to High, especially if input validation is not implemented rigorously.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, code execution, session hijacking, defacement.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict input validation on all user-provided data.
        * Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent SQL injection.
        * Sanitize and encode output to prevent XSS attacks.
        * Avoid executing arbitrary commands based on user input.
        * Utilize Hapi.js's built-in validation features through libraries like `joi`.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers.
    * **Hapi.js Specific Considerations:**  Leverage `joi` for defining data schemas and validating request payloads and parameters within Hapi.js route handlers. Be mindful of how data is processed and rendered in templates or API responses.

* **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:**
    * **Description:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities in the Node.js packages and libraries used by the Hapi.js application.
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate, as new vulnerabilities are constantly discovered.
    * **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update all dependencies to the latest secure versions.
        * Use dependency management tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities.
        * Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools in the development pipeline.
        * Consider using a vulnerability scanning service.
    * **Hapi.js Specific Considerations:**  Pay close attention to the security advisories for Hapi.js itself and its commonly used plugins.

* **Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:**
    * **Description:** Attackers overwhelm the application with requests, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    * **Likelihood:** Moderate, especially if the application lacks proper rate limiting and resource management.
    * **Impact:**  Application downtime, loss of revenue, damage to reputation.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single source.
        * Use load balancers to distribute traffic across multiple servers.
        * Implement input validation to prevent resource-intensive operations based on malicious input.
        * Consider using a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to absorb some traffic.
        * Utilize Hapi.js plugins for rate limiting, such as `hapi-rate-limit`.
    * **Hapi.js Specific Considerations:**  Configure Hapi.js server options to handle potential overload scenarios. Be mindful of resource consumption in route handlers.

* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**
    * **Description:** Attackers trick the server into making requests to unintended locations, potentially accessing internal resources or external services.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Moderate, depending on how the application handles external requests.
    * **Impact:** Access to internal systems, data breaches, launching attacks on other systems.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate URLs used in server-side requests.
