# Threat Model Analysis for hapijs/hapi

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection](./threats/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters (e.g., `/users/{id}`) by injecting malicious input. This could involve providing unexpected data types, excessively long strings, or special characters. The attacker might attempt to bypass validation logic, access unintended resources by crafting specific IDs, or trigger errors leading to denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to data or functionality, potential for application crashes or denial of service, bypassing security checks.
    *   **Affected Hapi Component:** `hapi` core routing mechanism, specifically how route parameters are extracted and passed to handlers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Hapi's built-in validation with `joi` to strictly define and validate the format and type of route parameters.
        *   Sanitize route parameter input within handler functions before using it in database queries or other sensitive operations.
        *   Implement proper error handling to prevent application crashes due to invalid parameter inputs.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the application by installing a malicious third-party Hapi plugin or exploiting a known vulnerability in an existing plugin. Malicious plugins can execute arbitrary code within the application's context, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or complete system compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Full application compromise, data breaches, unauthorized access, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Hapi Component:** `hapi` plugin system (`server.register`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet all third-party plugins before installation, checking their source code, maintainership, and community reputation.
        *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
        *   Regularly update all installed plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Plugin Configuration Issues](./threats/plugin_configuration_issues.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations in Hapi plugins to bypass security controls or gain unauthorized access. For example, an authentication plugin might be configured with weak default credentials or an authorization plugin might have overly permissive rules.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access, privilege escalation, data breaches.
    *   **Affected Hapi Component:** Configuration mechanisms of individual Hapi plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly understand the configuration options of each plugin and their security implications.
        *   Follow security best practices when configuring plugins, especially those related to authentication, authorization, and data handling.
        *   Avoid using default or weak credentials for plugin configurations.

## Threat: [Insecure Authentication Schemes](./threats/insecure_authentication_schemes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or compromises authentication credentials due to the use of weak or outdated authentication schemes within the Hapi application. This could involve using basic authentication over HTTP, storing passwords in plain text, or using insecure hashing algorithms.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Hapi Component:** `hapi` authentication strategies and plugins (e.g., `hapi-auth-basic`, `hapi-auth-jwt2`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize secure authentication mechanisms like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or OAuth 2.0.
        *   Enforce HTTPS to protect credentials in transit.
        *   Use strong and salted hashing algorithms for storing passwords.

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass due to Hapi's Extensibility](./threats/authorization_bypass_due_to_hapi's_extensibility.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in custom authorization logic implemented using Hapi's extension points (e.g., `onPreAuth`, `onPostAuth`). Incorrectly implemented authorization checks or vulnerabilities in custom logic can allow attackers to bypass intended access controls and access resources they should not.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources and functionality, privilege escalation.
    *   **Affected Hapi Component:** `hapi` extension points and custom authorization logic implemented by developers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test and review custom authorization logic for potential flaws.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when implementing authorization rules.
        *   Ensure that authorization checks are consistently applied across all relevant routes and handlers.

## Threat: [Insecure Cookie Configuration](./threats/insecure_cookie_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts or manipulates cookies used for session management or other sensitive data due to insecure cookie configurations in the Hapi application. This includes missing `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, or `SameSite` attributes, making cookies vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access, cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Hapi Component:** `hapi` state management features (cookies/sessions), often managed through plugins like `hapi-auth-cookie`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure cookies with the `HttpOnly` attribute to prevent client-side JavaScript access, mitigating XSS risks.
        *   Configure cookies with the `Secure` attribute to ensure they are only transmitted over HTTPS.
        *   Set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` or `Lax` to mitigate CSRF attacks.
