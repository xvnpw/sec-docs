## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access or Cause Disruption to the Hapi.js Application](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_or_cause_disruption_to_the_hapi_js_application.md)

* This is the overarching goal of the attacker. All subsequent high-risk paths aim to achieve this.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Request Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_request_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Attackers target the way the Hapi.js application processes incoming HTTP requests.
    * This includes manipulating request parameters, headers, and the request body (payload).
    * Vulnerabilities in request handling can allow attackers to bypass security checks, inject malicious code, or cause the application to behave unexpectedly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Input Validation](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_input_validation.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Attackers attempt to send data that the application does not properly validate.
    * This can involve sending unexpected data types, overly long strings, or data containing malicious characters or code.
    * Successful bypass allows malicious data to be processed by the application, potentially leading to further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Inadequate Input Validation in Route Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_inadequate_input_validation_in_route_handlers.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Route handlers are the specific functions in the Hapi.js application that process requests for particular routes.
    * If these handlers do not properly validate the input they receive (via `request.payload` or `request.params`), they become vulnerable.
    * Attackers can craft malicious input designed to exploit weaknesses in the handler's logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send Malicious Payloads (e.g., script injection, command injection fragments) via request.payload or request.params](./attack_tree_paths/send_malicious_payloads__e_g___script_injection__command_injection_fragments__via_request_payload_or_b217304a.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Attackers embed malicious code (e.g., JavaScript for script injection, operating system commands for command injection) within the request payload or URL parameters.
    * If input validation is inadequate, this malicious code can be processed by the application.
    * Script injection can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, while command injection can allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Hapi.js relies on plugins to extend its functionality.
    * Vulnerabilities in these plugins, whether third-party or custom-developed, can be exploited.
    * Attackers may target known vulnerabilities in popular plugins or attempt to discover flaws in less common ones.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_plugins.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Third-party plugins are developed and maintained by external parties, and their security can vary.
    * Attackers often focus on widely used plugins, as a single vulnerability can affect many applications.
    * Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available, making these attacks easier to execute.

## Attack Tree Path: [Use known vulnerabilities in popular Hapi plugins](./attack_tree_paths/use_known_vulnerabilities_in_popular_hapi_plugins.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Attackers leverage publicly disclosed security flaws in commonly used Hapi.js plugins.
    * This often involves using readily available exploit code or tools.
    * Applications that do not regularly update their plugins are particularly vulnerable to this type of attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server Configuration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server_configuration_issues.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Misconfigurations in the Hapi.js server or the underlying infrastructure can create security loopholes.
    * This includes issues like exposing sensitive configuration files, using insecure default settings, or having lax cookie configurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Sensitive Information via Exposed Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_information_via_exposed_configuration.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Attackers attempt to access configuration files or environment variables that contain sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets.
    * This can occur due to misconfigured web servers, insecure file permissions, or accidental inclusion of sensitive data in publicly accessible locations.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access configuration files or environment variables containing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) if not properly secured](./attack_tree_paths/access_configuration_files_or_environment_variables_containing_sensitive_information__e_g___api_keys_3eb7111e.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Attackers directly target configuration files (e.g., `.env` files, `config.js`) or attempt to read environment variables.
    * If these are not properly protected, attackers can gain access to critical secrets that allow them to compromise other systems or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Cookie Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_cookie_configuration.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Cookies are used to maintain session state and store user information.
    * Insecure cookie configurations, such as missing `HttpOnly` or `Secure` flags, or overly broad `Domain` or `Path` attributes, can be exploited.
    * This allows attackers to intercept or manipulate cookies, potentially leading to session hijacking or unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate or intercept cookies due to insecure settings (e.g., missing `HttpOnly`, `Secure` flags, overly broad `Domain` or `Path`)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_or_intercept_cookies_due_to_insecure_settings__e_g___missing__httponly____secure__flags___d2330cef.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Attackers use techniques like man-in-the-middle attacks or Cross-Site Scripting (if `HttpOnly` is missing) to steal or modify cookies.
    * By manipulating cookies, they can impersonate legitimate users or gain unauthorized access to their accounts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Denial-of-Service via Large Payloads](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_denial-of-service_via_large_payloads.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Attackers send excessively large HTTP request payloads to the Hapi.js server.
    * This can overwhelm the server's resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth), causing it to slow down or become unresponsive.
    * While not directly leading to data breaches, it can disrupt service availability.
