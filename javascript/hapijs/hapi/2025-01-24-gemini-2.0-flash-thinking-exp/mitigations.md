# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hapijs/hapi

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation with Joi](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_with_joi.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all route handlers** that accept user input (request payloads, query parameters, path parameters).
    2.  **Define Joi schemas** for each input source for these route handlers. Schemas should precisely describe the expected data type, format, and constraints using Joi's validation rules.
    3.  **Integrate Joi validation into route definitions** using Hapi's `validate` option within `server.route()` configuration.
    4.  **Implement robust error handling** for Joi validation failures, customizing error responses to be user-friendly and avoid exposing sensitive server-side details using Hapi's error handling mechanisms.
    5.  **Log validation errors** for monitoring and debugging.
    6.  **Regularly review and update Joi schemas** to align with application requirements and security best practices.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Injection Attacks (SQL, NoSQL, Command Injection) - Severity: High
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: Medium
    *   Application Logic Errors due to Malformed Input - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Injection Attacks: High
    *   XSS: Medium
    *   Application Logic Errors: High
*   **Currently Implemented:** Input validation using Joi is currently implemented for user registration and login routes in `src/routes/auth.js` and for product creation and update routes in `src/routes/product.js`.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Input validation is missing for user profile update routes in `src/routes/user.js`, all routes under the `/api/admin` namespace (except product routes), and for file upload endpoints across the application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Authentication and Authorization Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/secure_authentication_and_authorization_implementation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Choose appropriate Hapi authentication strategies** (e.g., `hapi-auth-jwt2`, `hapi-auth-cookie`, `bell`).
    2.  **Register and configure the chosen authentication strategy** with your Hapi server using `server.auth.strategy()`.
    3.  **Set a default authentication strategy** for your server using `server.auth.default()`.
    4.  **Implement route-level authentication enforcement** using the `auth` option in `server.route()`.
    5.  **Implement fine-grained authorization** using scopes or custom policies within Hapi's authorization framework.
    6.  **Securely manage user credentials** (password hashing, token management, API key management).
    7.  **Regularly audit authentication and authorization logic** to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the Hapi application.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access - Severity: High
    *   Privilege Escalation - Severity: High
    *   Data Breaches - Severity: High
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access: High
    *   Privilege Escalation: High
    *   Data Breaches: High
*   **Currently Implemented:** JWT authentication using `hapi-auth-jwt2` is implemented for API routes under `/api`. Role-based authorization using scopes is implemented for admin routes in `src/routes/admin.js`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  Authorization is not consistently enforced across all API endpoints. Some routes under `/api/user` lack proper authorization checks.  No rate limiting is implemented for authentication endpoints (login, registration).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Security Vetting and Management](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_security_vetting_and_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a plugin vetting process** before using any Hapi plugin, evaluating source, reputation, maintenance, dependencies, and potentially performing code reviews.
    2.  **Implement dependency management for plugins.** Regularly update plugins and their dependencies.
    3.  **Utilize dependency scanning tools** to identify vulnerable dependencies in your project, including plugin dependencies.
    4.  **Apply the principle of least privilege to plugins.** Grant plugins only necessary permissions and access.
    5.  **Regularly review and audit used plugins.** Reassess plugin security posture and check for updates and vulnerabilities.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Vulnerabilities Introduced by Third-Party Code - Severity: High
    *   Supply Chain Attacks - Severity: Medium
    *   Compromised Plugin Functionality - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   Vulnerabilities Introduced by Third-Party Code: High
    *   Supply Chain Attacks: Medium
    *   Compromised Plugin Functionality: Medium
*   **Currently Implemented:** We are using `npm audit` as part of our CI/CD pipeline to scan for vulnerable dependencies. We generally prefer plugins from the official Hapi organization.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  No formal plugin vetting process is documented or consistently followed.  We don't perform code reviews or security audits of plugins, even for critical ones like authentication or database connectors.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Error Handling and Logging](./mitigation_strategies/secure_error_handling_and_logging.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement custom error handlers** in Hapi using `server.ext('onPreResponse', ...)` to control error responses.
    2.  **Prevent leakage of sensitive information in error responses.** Return generic error messages to clients in production.
    3.  **Implement comprehensive and secure logging.** Log relevant security events and sufficient detail.
    4.  **Utilize a centralized and secure logging system.**
    5.  **Avoid logging sensitive data.** Implement data masking or redaction if necessary.
    6.  **Regularly monitor logs** for security incidents and anomalies.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Information Disclosure through Error Messages - Severity: Medium
    *   Insufficient Logging for Security Monitoring - Severity: Medium
    *   Data Breaches through Log Exposure - Severity: Low (if logs are not properly secured)
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure through Error Messages: Medium
    *   Insufficient Logging for Security Monitoring: Medium
    *   Data Breaches through Log Exposure: Low
*   **Currently Implemented:** We have basic error logging using `console.error()` for unhandled exceptions. We are using Winston for structured logging in some parts of the application.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Custom error handlers are not implemented to prevent information leakage in production. Centralized logging is not set up. Security-specific logging (authentication failures, authorization denials) is not consistently implemented. Log rotation and secure log storage are not configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and DoS Protection](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_dos_protection.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement rate limiting** at the Hapi application level, potentially using Hapi plugins like `hapi-rate-limit` or custom logic.
    2.  **Configure appropriate rate limits** based on application capacity and security considerations.
    3.  **Apply rate limiting based on IP address or user identifier.**
    4.  **Implement different rate limiting strategies** as needed.
    5.  **Return informative rate limit exceeded responses** (429 status code).
    6.  **Combine Hapi-level rate limiting with other DoS protection mechanisms** at different infrastructure layers.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks - Severity: High
    *   Brute-Force Attacks (e.g., password guessing) - Severity: Medium
    *   Resource Exhaustion - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS Attacks: Medium
    *   Brute-Force Attacks: Medium
    *   Resource Exhaustion: Medium
*   **Currently Implemented:** No rate limiting is currently implemented at the application level.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Rate limiting is missing for all routes, including authentication endpoints, API endpoints, and public routes. We need to implement rate limiting using a Hapi plugin or custom logic.

## Mitigation Strategy: [CORS Policy Hardening](./mitigation_strategies/cors_policy_hardening.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure CORS policies** using Hapi's `cors` plugin or custom middleware.
    2.  **Restrict allowed origins.** Explicitly specify allowed origins, avoiding wildcard `*` in production.
    3.  **Apply the principle of least privilege for CORS.** Restrict allowed methods, headers, and control credentials as needed.
    4.  **Test CORS configuration thoroughly.**
    5.  **Regularly review and update CORS policies.**
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities - Severity: Medium
    *   Data Theft through Cross-Origin Requests - Severity: Medium
    *   Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (indirectly mitigated by proper CORS) - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   CORS Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities: Medium
    *   Data Theft through Cross-Origin Requests: Medium
    *   CSRF: Medium
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic CORS configuration is enabled using the `hapi-cors` plugin, allowing requests from our frontend domain `example.com`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  CORS configuration is not hardened. Wildcard origin (`*`) is used for development. Allowed methods and headers are not explicitly restricted and are set to defaults which might be overly permissive.  CORS policies are not regularly reviewed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Security Headers Implementation](./mitigation_strategies/security_headers_implementation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement security headers** using Hapi plugins like `inert` and `blankie` or custom middleware within the Hapi application.
    2.  **Set essential security headers:** HSTS, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, CSP, Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy. Configure CSP carefully and consider using CSP reporting.
    3.  **Test security header implementation.**
    4.  **Monitor CSP reports.**
    5.  **Regularly review and update security headers.**
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: Medium (CSP)
    *   Clickjacking - Severity: Medium (X-Frame-Options)
    *   MIME-Sniffing Attacks - Severity: Low (X-Content-Type-Options)
    *   Insecure HTTP Connections - Severity: Medium (HSTS)
    *   Information Leakage via Referrer - Severity: Low (Referrer-Policy)
    *   Unnecessary Feature Exposure - Severity: Low (Permissions-Policy)
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: Medium
    *   Clickjacking: Medium
    *   MIME-Sniffing Attacks: Low
    *   Insecure HTTP Connections: Medium
    *   Information Leakage via Referrer: Low
    *   Unnecessary Feature Exposure: Low
*   **Currently Implemented:**  HSTS header is set in our Nginx configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy, and Permissions-Policy headers are not implemented in the Hapi application or Nginx configuration. CSP reporting is not set up.
