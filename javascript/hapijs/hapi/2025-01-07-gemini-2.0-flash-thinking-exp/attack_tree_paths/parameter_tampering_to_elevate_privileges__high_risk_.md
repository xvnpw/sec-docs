## Deep Analysis: Parameter Tampering to Elevate Privileges in a Hapi.js Application

This analysis delves into the "Parameter Tampering to Elevate Privileges" attack path within a Hapi.js application. We will explore the mechanics of this attack, its potential impact, and most importantly, how to mitigate this risk in your Hapi.js codebase.

**Understanding the Attack Vector:**

The core vulnerability lies in trusting client-provided data for making critical authorization decisions. When the application relies on parameters sent in the request (e.g., query parameters, request body data, headers) to determine a user's privileges or access rights, attackers can manipulate these parameters to bypass security controls.

**How it Manifests in a Hapi.js Application:**

In a Hapi.js application, this vulnerability can manifest in several ways:

* **Query Parameters:**  Imagine a route like `/admin/deleteUser?userId=123&isAdmin=false`. If the server-side logic simply checks the `isAdmin` parameter without proper authentication and authorization, an attacker could change `isAdmin` to `true` to gain administrative privileges.

* **Request Body (Payload):**  Consider an API endpoint for updating user profiles: `/api/updateProfile`. The request body might include fields like `role`, `permissions`, or `accountType`. If the server directly uses these values to update the user's privileges without verification against the authenticated user's actual roles, an attacker could elevate their own privileges.

* **Custom Headers:** While less common for direct authorization, custom headers could be misused. For example, a header like `X-User-Role: guest` could be tampered with if the server relies on it without proper validation against the authenticated user.

**Specific Scenarios in Hapi.js:**

Let's illustrate with concrete examples within a Hapi.js context:

**Scenario 1: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) via Query Parameter:**

```javascript
// Vulnerable Hapi.js route handler
server.route({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/admin/sensitiveData',
  handler: (request, h) => {
    const isAdmin = request.query.isAdmin === 'true';
    if (isAdmin) {
      // Access granted - potential vulnerability
      return { data: 'Highly confidential information' };
    }
    return h.response('Unauthorized').code(403);
  }
});
```

**Attack:** An attacker could send a request like `/admin/sensitiveData?isAdmin=true` to bypass the intended authorization and access sensitive data.

**Scenario 2: Privilege Elevation via Request Body Parameter:**

```javascript
// Vulnerable Hapi.js route handler
server.route({
  method: 'PUT',
  path: '/api/updateUser/{userId}',
  handler: async (request, h) => {
    const userId = request.params.userId;
    const payload = request.payload;

    // Directly using payload.role without proper authorization check
    await User.update({ role: payload.role }, { where: { id: userId } });
    return { message: 'User updated successfully' };
  }
});
```

**Attack:** An attacker could send a PUT request to `/api/updateUser/theirUserId` with a payload like `{ "role": "admin" }` to elevate their own privileges.

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

The consequences of a successful "Parameter Tampering to Elevate Privileges" attack can be severe:

* **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** Attackers can gain access to confidential information they are not authorized to view.
* **Data Modification or Deletion:**  Elevated privileges can allow attackers to modify or delete critical data.
* **Account Takeover:** Attackers could manipulate parameters to gain control of other user accounts.
* **System Compromise:** In the worst-case scenario, attackers could gain administrative access and compromise the entire application or underlying system.
* **Reputational Damage:** Security breaches can significantly damage the reputation and trust of the application and the organization.
* **Legal and Financial Ramifications:** Depending on the nature of the data and the industry, breaches can lead to legal penalties and financial losses.

**Mitigation Strategies in Hapi.js:**

To effectively defend against this attack, implement the following strategies in your Hapi.js application:

1. **Robust Server-Side Authentication and Authorization:**

   * **Don't rely solely on client-provided parameters for authorization decisions.**  Instead, establish a secure authentication mechanism (e.g., JWT, sessions) to identify the user and then implement a robust authorization system based on the authenticated user's roles and permissions stored securely on the server-side.
   * **Utilize Hapi.js Authentication Plugins:** Leverage plugins like `hapi-auth-jwt2` or `scooter` to implement secure authentication and extract user information from tokens or sessions.
   * **Implement Authorization Middleware/Handlers:** Create middleware or handler functions that check the authenticated user's permissions against the required permissions for the requested resource or action.

2. **Strict Input Validation using Joi:**

   * **Define Schemas for Request Parameters and Payloads:** Use Joi to create strict schemas that define the expected data types, formats, and allowed values for all request parameters and payloads.
   * **Validate All Input:**  Apply these schemas to validate incoming data before processing it. This prevents attackers from injecting unexpected or malicious values.
   * **Sanitize Input (with Caution):** While validation is the primary defense, consider sanitizing input to remove potentially harmful characters, but be cautious not to inadvertently break legitimate data.

3. **Principle of Least Privilege:**

   * **Grant Only Necessary Permissions:** Design your authorization system so that users and roles are granted only the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks. Avoid overly permissive roles.

4. **Centralized Authorization Logic:**

   * **Avoid Scattered Authorization Checks:** Consolidate your authorization logic into reusable functions or middleware. This makes it easier to maintain and audit your security controls.

5. **Immutable User Data for Authorization:**

   * **Don't Trust Client-Provided Data for Critical Decisions:**  Avoid relying on parameters sent in the request to determine a user's roles or permissions. Instead, fetch this information from a trusted source (e.g., database) based on the authenticated user's identity.

6. **Auditing and Logging:**

   * **Log Authentication and Authorization Attempts:**  Record successful and failed authentication and authorization attempts, including the user involved, the action attempted, and the result. This helps in detecting and investigating suspicious activity.

7. **Security Headers:**

   * **Implement Relevant Security Headers:** While not directly preventing parameter tampering, headers like `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) and `Content-Security-Policy` (CSP) can contribute to a more secure application environment.

**Code Examples of Mitigation:**

**Scenario 1 (Mitigated): Role-Based Access Control with Authentication and Authorization:**

```javascript
const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');
const Joi = require('joi');

const start = async function() {
  const server = Hapi.server({
    port: 3000,
    host: 'localhost'
  });

  // Assume an authentication plugin is configured and provides request.auth.credentials

  server.route({
    method: 'GET',
    path: '/admin/sensitiveData',
    handler: (request, h) => {
      const user = request.auth.credentials;
      if (user && user.role === 'admin') {
        return { data: 'Highly confidential information' };
      }
      return h.response('Unauthorized').code(403);
    },
    options: {
      auth: 'jwt' // Assuming JWT authentication is configured
    }
  });

  await server.start();
  console.log('Server running on %s', server.info.uri);
};

start();
```

**Scenario 2 (Mitigated): Privilege Elevation Prevention with Validation and Authorization:**

```javascript
const Hapi = require('@hapi/hapi');
const Joi = require('joi');

const start = async function() {
  const server = Hapi.server({
    port: 3000,
    host: 'localhost'
  });

  // Assume an authentication plugin is configured and provides request.auth.credentials

  server.route({
    method: 'PUT',
    path: '/api/updateUser/{userId}',
    handler: async (request, h) => {
      const userId = request.params.userId;
      const payload = request.payload;
      const authenticatedUser = request.auth.credentials;

      // 1. Validate the payload
      const { error } = Joi.object({
        role: Joi.string().valid('user', 'editor').optional() // Only allow specific roles
      }).validate(payload);

      if (error) {
        return h.response(error.details).code(400);
      }

      // 2. Authorize the action - only admins can change roles
      if (payload.role && authenticatedUser.role !== 'admin') {
        return h.response('Unauthorized to change roles').code(403);
      }

      // 3. Update the user (ensure you are only updating authorized fields)
      const updateData = {};
      if (payload.role) {
        updateData.role = payload.role;
      }
      // ... other authorized fields

      await User.update(updateData, { where: { id: userId } });
      return { message: 'User updated successfully' };
    },
    options: {
      auth: 'jwt', // Assuming JWT authentication is configured
      validate: {
        params: Joi.object({
          userId: Joi.number().integer().required()
        }),
        payload: Joi.object({
          role: Joi.string().optional()
          // ... other allowed fields
        })
      }
    }
  });

  await server.start();
  console.log('Server running on %s', server.info.uri);
};

start();
```
