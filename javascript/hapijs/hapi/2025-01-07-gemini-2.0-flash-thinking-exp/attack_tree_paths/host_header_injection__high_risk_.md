## Deep Analysis: Host Header Injection Attack Path in a hapi.js Application

**ATTACK TREE PATH:** Host Header Injection [HIGH RISK]

**Introduction:**

This document provides a deep analysis of the "Host Header Injection" attack path within a hapi.js application. This vulnerability, categorized as high risk, stems from the application's reliance on the `Host` header provided in HTTP requests without proper validation and sanitization. Exploiting this can lead to significant security breaches, impacting user trust and application integrity.

**Detailed Explanation of the Attack Vector:**

The `Host` header in an HTTP request is intended to specify the domain name of the server the client is trying to access. While seemingly benign, this header is often used by web applications for various purposes, including:

* **Generating Absolute URLs:** When sending emails (e.g., password resets, account confirmations), the application needs to construct full URLs, often using the `Host` header as the base domain.
* **Serving Content Based on Domain:** In multi-tenant applications or those with multiple subdomains, the `Host` header might be used to determine which content or configuration to serve.
* **Cache Poisoning:** Downstream caches (like CDNs or reverse proxies) might use the `Host` header as part of the cache key. An attacker injecting a malicious host can poison the cache with incorrect content.
* **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Prerequisite:** In some cases, manipulating the `Host` header can be a precursor to a more complex SSRF attack if the application makes internal requests based on this header.

**How the Attack Works:**

An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request, specifically manipulating the `Host` header to an attacker-controlled domain. If the hapi.js application uses this header directly without proper validation in any of the aforementioned scenarios, the following can occur:

1. **Password Reset Link Manipulation:**
   - The application uses `request.headers.host` to construct the password reset link.
   - The attacker injects their domain (e.g., `attacker.com`).
   - The user receives an email with a password reset link pointing to `https://attacker.com/reset?token=...`.
   - The user, believing it's legitimate, clicks the link and potentially enters their new password on the attacker's site.

2. **Cache Poisoning:**
   - A malicious `Host` header is sent to the server.
   - The server, or an intermediary cache, stores content associated with this malicious host.
   - Subsequent legitimate users accessing the application might be served the cached content intended for the attacker's domain.

3. **Other Exploitations:**
   - Depending on the application's logic, other vulnerabilities might arise. For example, if the application uses the `Host` header to determine the location of static assets, an attacker could redirect users to malicious resources.

**Impact of a Successful Host Header Injection Attack:**

The consequences of a successful Host Header Injection attack can be severe:

* **Account Takeover:**  Manipulation of password reset links directly leads to account compromise.
* **Data Breach:**  If the attacker gains access to user accounts, they can potentially access sensitive personal or financial information.
* **Reputation Damage:** Users losing trust in the application due to successful attacks.
* **Financial Loss:**  Costs associated with incident response, legal ramifications, and loss of business.
* **Malware Distribution:**  Attackers can redirect users to sites hosting malware.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Cache poisoning can disrupt the normal functioning of the application.

**Vulnerable Areas within a hapi.js Application:**

To identify potential vulnerabilities, the development team should focus on areas where the `request.headers.host` property is used:

* **Email Sending Logic:**  Any code responsible for generating and sending emails, especially those containing links.
* **URL Generation Utilities:**  Custom helper functions or libraries used to construct absolute URLs within the application.
* **Multi-Tenancy or Subdomain Handling:**  Logic that uses the `Host` header to differentiate between different tenants or subdomains.
* **Caching Mechanisms:**  If the application implements custom caching logic that utilizes the `Host` header as part of the cache key.
* **Middleware and Plugins:**  Third-party middleware or hapi plugins that might rely on the `Host` header without proper sanitization.
* **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** If the application uses SSR, the `Host` header might be used to generate URLs in the rendered HTML.

**Mitigation Strategies for hapi.js Applications:**

The development team should implement the following mitigation strategies to prevent Host Header Injection attacks:

1. **Explicitly Define Allowed Hosts:** Instead of relying on the `request.headers.host`, configure a list of allowed and trusted hostnames for your application.

2. **Use `X-Forwarded-Host` with Caution:** If your application is behind a trusted proxy or load balancer, you might consider using the `X-Forwarded-Host` header. However, ensure that the proxy itself is configured to prevent header injection. **Never directly trust `X-Forwarded-Host` from untrusted sources.**

3. **Sanitize and Validate Input:** If you absolutely need to use the `request.headers.host`, rigorously sanitize and validate it against the list of allowed hosts. This includes:
   - **Whitelisting:**  Only allow specific, known-good hostnames.
   - **Regular Expression Matching:**  Use regular expressions to enforce the expected format of the hostname.
   - **Canonicalization:**  Convert the hostname to a consistent format (e.g., lowercase) before validation.

4. **Generate Absolute URLs Programmatically:**  Instead of directly using `request.headers.host`, construct absolute URLs using the configured allowed hostname. hapi.js provides access to the request object, which can be used to determine the protocol and other relevant information.

   ```javascript
   // Example using a configured allowed host
   const allowedHost = 'yourdomain.com';
   const protocol = request.connection.info.protocol;
   const resetLink = `${protocol}://${allowedHost}/reset?token=${token}`;
   ```

5. **Utilize hapi.js Security Features:** Explore hapi.js plugins or built-in features that might offer protection against header manipulation.

6. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** While not a direct solution to Host Header Injection, a well-configured CSP can mitigate the impact of certain exploitation scenarios by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load.

7. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential vulnerabilities, including Host Header Injection.

8. **Code Reviews:**  Implement thorough code reviews to ensure that developers are handling the `Host` header securely.

**Detection Methods:**

Identifying potential Host Header Injection attempts can be challenging, but the following methods can be employed:

* **Web Application Firewalls (WAFs):** WAFs can be configured to detect and block requests with suspicious `Host` headers.
* **Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):**  IDS can monitor network traffic for patterns indicative of Host Header Injection attacks.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:**  SIEM systems can aggregate logs from various sources and correlate events to identify potential attacks.
* **Log Analysis:**  Monitor application logs for unusual `Host` header values. Look for discrepancies or unexpected domains.
* **Penetration Testing:**  Simulate attacks to identify if the application is vulnerable.

**Example Vulnerable Code Snippet (Illustrative):**

```javascript
// Potentially vulnerable code in a hapi.js route handler

server.route({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/password-reset/{token}',
  handler: async (request, h) => {
    const token = request.params.token;
    const user = await findUserByResetToken(token);

    if (user) {
      const resetLink = `https://${request.headers.host}/reset-password-confirm?token=${token}`;
      // Send email with resetLink
      console.log(`Sending password reset link to ${user.email}: ${resetLink}`);
      return h.response('Password reset link sent.').code(200);
    }

    return h.response('Invalid reset token.').code(400);
  }
});
```

**Example Corrected Code Snippet (Illustrative):**

```javascript
// Corrected code using a configured allowed host

const allowedHost = 'yourdomain.com'; // Configure this value

server.route({
  method: 'GET',
  path: '/password-reset/{token}',
  handler: async (request, h) => {
    const token = request.params.token;
    const user = await findUserByResetToken(token);

    if (user) {
      const protocol = request.connection.info.protocol;
      const resetLink = `${protocol}://${allowedHost}/reset-password-confirm?token=${token}`;
      // Send email with resetLink
      console.log(`Sending password reset link to ${user.email}: ${resetLink}`);
      return h.response('Password reset link sent.').code(200);
    }

    return h.response('Invalid reset token.').code(400);
  }
});
```

**Conclusion:**

Host Header Injection is a significant security risk that can have severe consequences for hapi.js applications. By understanding the attack vector, identifying vulnerable areas, and implementing robust mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of exploitation. Prioritizing secure coding practices, regular security assessments, and staying updated on the latest security threats are crucial for maintaining a secure application. The development team should immediately review all code that utilizes the `request.headers.host` property and implement the recommended mitigation techniques.
