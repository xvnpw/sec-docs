# Threat Model Analysis for hapijs/hapi

## Threat: [Route Parameter Injection](./threats/route_parameter_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters (e.g., `/users/{id}`) by injecting malicious code or unexpected values. This could involve accessing unauthorized resources, modifying data, or even executing arbitrary code depending on how the application handles these parameters.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, potential remote code execution, application crash.
*   **Affected Hapi Component:** `hapi`'s routing mechanism, specifically how route parameters are extracted and used within route handlers (`server.route()`, request parameters).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize Hapi's built-in validation using Joi to strictly define the expected format and type of route parameters.
    *   Sanitize route parameters before using them in database queries or other sensitive operations.
    *   Avoid directly using raw route parameters in critical logic without validation.

## Threat: [Payload Parsing Issues due to Hapi Configuration](./threats/payload_parsing_issues_due_to_hapi_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious payloads that exploit vulnerabilities in Hapi's payload parsing mechanisms (e.g., buffer overflows, resource exhaustion) due to incorrect configuration or lack of validation.
*   **Impact:** Application crash, potential remote code execution (depending on the underlying vulnerability), service disruption.
*   **Affected Hapi Component:** `hapi`'s payload parsing functionality (`request.payload`, `server.route()` configuration options for payload parsing).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure payload parsing limits (e.g., `payload.maxBytes`).
    *   Use appropriate payload parsing strategies and validate the structure and content of incoming payloads using Joi.
    *   Be aware of potential vulnerabilities in the underlying payload parsing libraries used by Hapi.

## Threat: [Vulnerable or Malicious Plugins](./threats/vulnerable_or_malicious_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities present in third-party Hapi plugins or introduces a malicious plugin to compromise the application. This could involve arbitrary code execution, data theft, or other malicious activities.
*   **Impact:** Full application compromise, data breach, unauthorized access.
*   **Affected Hapi Component:** `hapi`'s plugin system (`server.register()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet third-party plugins before using them, checking for security audits and community reputation.
    *   Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement a process for reviewing and auditing the code of plugins used in the application.
    *   Consider using dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in plugin dependencies.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Authentication Strategies](./threats/misconfigured_authentication_strategies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker bypasses authentication or gains unauthorized access due to misconfiguration of Hapi's authentication strategies (e.g., JWT verification, OAuth settings).
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts and sensitive data, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Hapi Component:** `hapi`'s authentication framework (`server.auth.scheme()`, `server.auth.strategy()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure authentication schemes and strategies according to security best practices for the chosen method.
    *   Use strong and properly managed secrets for authentication mechanisms.
    *   Regularly review authentication configurations and ensure they are correctly implemented.

## Threat: [Insecure Cookie Configuration](./threats/insecure_cookie_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits missing or incorrect security flags on cookies (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`) to perform attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) or cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, account takeover, unauthorized actions on behalf of a user.
*   **Affected Hapi Component:** `hapi`'s cookie handling mechanisms (`h.state()`, `h.unstate()`, response headers).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always set the `HttpOnly` flag for session cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access.
    *   Set the `Secure` flag to ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
    *   Configure the `SameSite` attribute to protect against CSRF attacks.
