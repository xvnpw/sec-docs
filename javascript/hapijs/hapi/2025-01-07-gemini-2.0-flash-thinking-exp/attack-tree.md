## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Hapi.js Application [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_hapi_js_application__critical_.md)

- This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigured Route Ordering [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigured_route_ordering__high_risk___critical_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Developers might define routes in an order where a less secure, more general route is processed before a more specific, secured route. An attacker can craft requests intended for the protected route but matching the earlier, less secure one, bypassing authentication or authorization checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Content-Type Confusion [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/content-type_confusion__high_risk_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** An attacker sends a request with a `Content-Type` header that doesn't match the actual payload format. This can trick the server into using an incorrect parser, potentially leading to vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the payload is interpreted as HTML, or allowing malicious data to bypass validation checks designed for a different content type.

## Attack Tree Path: [Host Header Injection [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/host_header_injection__high_risk_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** The `Host` header in an HTTP request specifies the domain the client is trying to reach. Attackers can manipulate this header to exploit vulnerabilities in features that rely on it, such as password reset emails or generating absolute URLs. By injecting a malicious host, they can redirect password reset links to their own server or poison caches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Payload Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_payload_parsing_vulnerabilities__high_risk___critical_.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  Custom route handlers or plugins might have vulnerabilities in how they parse incoming request payloads (e.g., JSON, XML, form data). Attackers can craft specially malformed or oversized payloads that exploit these weaknesses, potentially leading to denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unrestricted File Upload [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/unrestricted_file_upload__high_risk___critical_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to upload files without proper validation of the file type, attackers can upload malicious executable files (e.g., PHP, Python scripts, executables). If these files are placed in a publicly accessible directory and the server is configured to execute them, the attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal in File Upload [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_in_file_upload__high_risk_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** When handling file uploads, if the application doesn't properly sanitize filenames, attackers can manipulate the filename to include path traversal characters (e.g., `../`). This allows them to upload files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system, potentially overwriting critical files or placing malicious files in sensitive areas.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Used Plugins [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_used_plugins__high_risk___critical_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Hapi.js relies heavily on plugins. If the application uses plugins with known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit these weaknesses to compromise the application. This often involves using readily available exploits or tools targeting the specific plugin vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks on Plugins [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_on_plugins__high_risk___critical_.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  Vulnerabilities can exist not just in the direct Hapi.js plugins but also in their dependencies. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities in the plugin's supply chain, which can be harder to detect and mitigate as developers might not be directly aware of these transitive dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured Plugin Permissions [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured_plugin_permissions__high_risk_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Hapi.js plugins can have permissions to access various parts of the application or server. If these permissions are misconfigured (e.g., a plugin has overly broad access), attackers who manage to compromise the plugin (through its own vulnerabilities) can leverage these excessive permissions to further compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Default Credentials [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/default_credentials__high_risk___critical_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** If the application uses authentication plugins or features that come with default usernames and passwords, and these defaults are not changed during deployment, attackers can easily gain unauthorized access by simply using these well-known credentials.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Imperfect Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Plugins [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_imperfect_role-based_access_control__rbac__in_plugins__high_risk_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** If the application uses plugins for implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), vulnerabilities in the plugin's RBAC implementation can allow attackers to bypass authorization checks. This could involve manipulating user roles or permissions, or exploiting flaws in how the plugin enforces access controls, allowing them to access resources they shouldn't.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Tampering to Elevate Privileges [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_tampering_to_elevate_privileges__high_risk_.md)

- **Attack Vector:**  If authorization decisions are based on parameters sent in the request (e.g., user roles, permissions), and these parameters are not properly validated on the server-side, attackers can tamper with these parameters to elevate their privileges and gain access to restricted resources or functionalities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Reflected Input [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_reflected_input__high_risk_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** If the application takes user input and directly includes it in the HTML response without proper sanitization or encoding, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into the input. When other users visit the page, this injected script will execute in their browsers, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection__high_risk___critical_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** If the application constructs SQL queries dynamically using user-provided input without proper sanitization or using parameterized queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL code into the input. This injected code can manipulate the database queries, allowing the attacker to access, modify, or delete sensitive data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection__high_risk___critical_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** If the application executes system commands based on user-provided input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands into the input. This allows them to execute arbitrary commands on the server's operating system, potentially gaining full control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Logic Flaws in Validation Schemas [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_logic_flaws_in_validation_schemas__high_risk_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Even when using validation libraries like Joi, developers can make mistakes in defining the validation schemas. Attackers can analyze these schemas and find logic flaws or edge cases that allow them to bypass the intended validation rules, sending invalid or malicious data that the application then processes incorrectly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Debug Mode Enabled in Production [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/debug_mode_enabled_in_production__high_risk___critical_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** Leaving debug mode enabled in a production environment exposes sensitive information through logs, error messages, and debugging interfaces. This information can include API keys, database credentials, internal server paths, and other details that can be used to further compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing `HttpOnly` or `Secure` Flags [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/missing__httponly__or__secure__flags__high_risk_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** When setting cookies, the `HttpOnly` flag prevents client-side JavaScript from accessing the cookie, mitigating the risk of cookie theft through XSS attacks. The `Secure` flag ensures the cookie is only transmitted over HTTPS, preventing interception in man-in-the-middle attacks. Missing these flags makes session cookies vulnerable to theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Predictable Session IDs [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/predictable_session_ids__high_risk___critical_.md)

- **Attack Vector:** If the application uses a weak or predictable method for generating session IDs, attackers can potentially guess valid session IDs of other users. Once they have a valid session ID, they can impersonate that user and gain unauthorized access to their account and data.
