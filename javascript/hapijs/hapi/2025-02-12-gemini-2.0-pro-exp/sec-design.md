Okay, let's create a design document for the Hapi.js framework, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Hapi.js is a rich framework for building applications and services. It's designed to enable developers to focus on writing reusable application logic instead of spending time building infrastructure.  Given its nature as a web framework, the primary business goals and priorities revolve around:

*   Reliability:  Ensuring the framework itself is stable and dependable, minimizing crashes and unexpected behavior.  Applications built with Hapi.js should be able to handle expected and unexpected loads gracefully.
*   Maintainability:  The framework's codebase should be easy to understand, modify, and extend.  This is crucial for long-term viability and community contributions.
*   Developer Productivity:  Hapi.js aims to simplify web application development, allowing developers to build features quickly and efficiently.
*   Security:  Providing built-in mechanisms and encouraging secure coding practices to protect applications built with the framework from common web vulnerabilities.
*   Scalability: Allowing applications built with it to scale to handle increasing traffic and data volumes.
*   Extensibility: Providing a robust plugin system to allow developers to easily add or customize functionality.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

*   Framework Vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities within Hapi.js itself could expose all applications built using it to attacks. This is the most critical risk.
*   Supply Chain Attacks:  Dependencies of Hapi.js could be compromised, leading to vulnerabilities in the framework.
*   Improper Use:  Developers might misuse Hapi.js features or fail to implement proper security measures in their applications, leading to vulnerabilities.
*   Lack of Adoption: If the framework is perceived as insecure or difficult to use, it may lose adoption, impacting its long-term viability.
*   Outdated Dependencies: Failure to keep dependencies up-to-date could introduce known vulnerabilities.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls and accepted risks (based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of web frameworks):

*   security control: Input Validation: Hapi.js uses Joi for input validation. This is a core feature and helps prevent many common vulnerabilities like injection attacks. (Described in documentation and implemented in the core framework).
*   security control: Plugin System: Hapi.js's plugin architecture allows for modular security features. Security-focused plugins can be added as needed. (Described in documentation and implemented in the core framework).
*   security control: Route Configuration: Security-related settings can be configured at the route level, allowing for granular control over authentication, authorization, and other security aspects. (Described in documentation and implemented in the core framework).
*   security control: Community Scrutiny: Being an open-source project, Hapi.js benefits from community scrutiny, which can help identify and address security issues. (Implicit in the open-source nature of the project).
*   security control: Regular Updates: The Hapi.js team releases updates to address bugs and security vulnerabilities. (Evidenced by the release history on GitHub).
*   security control: Documentation: Hapi.js provides extensive documentation, including security best practices. (Available on the official website and GitHub).
*   security control: Secure development lifecycle: Hapi project use GitHub features to manage project, including security features. (Described in GitHub project).
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Plugin Risks: While the plugin system is a strength, it also introduces the risk of vulnerabilities in third-party plugins. The core Hapi.js team may not have control over the security of these plugins.
*   accepted risk: Developer Error: Despite the framework's features, developers can still introduce vulnerabilities through improper implementation or configuration.
*   accepted risk: Zero-Day Vulnerabilities: Like any software, Hapi.js is susceptible to zero-day vulnerabilities that are unknown and unpatched.

Recommended security controls (high priority):

*   Implement a robust Security Development Lifecycle (SDL) process, including regular security audits, penetration testing, and threat modeling.
*   Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   Provide more detailed security guidance and examples in the documentation, covering common web application vulnerabilities and how to mitigate them using Hapi.js.
*   Consider integrating automated security scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities early in the development process.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) by default or provide easy configuration options for developers to enable CSP.
*   Provide built-in protection against Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
*   Offer guidance and tools for secure session management, including the use of HttpOnly and Secure cookies.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   The framework should support various authentication mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth, JWT).
    *   Authentication mechanisms should be configurable and extensible.
    *   Sensitive credentials should never be stored in plain text.
*   Authorization:
    *   The framework should provide mechanisms for controlling access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
    *   Authorization should be enforced consistently across all routes and resources.
    *   Support for both role-based access control (RBAC) and attribute-based access control (ABAC) is desirable.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input should be validated using a strict whitelist approach.
    *   Validation rules should be configurable and extensible.
    *   The framework should provide built-in validation for common data types.
    *   Input validation should occur as early as possible in the request processing pipeline.
*   Cryptography:
    *   The framework should use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms for all security-sensitive operations.
    *   Cryptographic keys should be managed securely.
    *   The framework should provide utilities for common cryptographic tasks (e.g., hashing, encryption, signing).
*   Output Encoding:
    *   The framework should provide mechanisms for encoding output to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   Output encoding should be context-aware (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).

## DEPLOYMENT

Hapi.js applications, being Node.js applications, can be deployed in various ways:

1.  **Bare Metal Servers:**  Directly on physical or virtual servers.
2.  **Virtual Machines (VMs):**  On cloud providers like AWS EC2, Google Compute Engine, Azure VMs.
3.  **Containers (Docker):**  Packaged as Docker containers and deployed on container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, or cloud services like AWS ECS, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS).
4.  **Platform as a Service (PaaS):**  On platforms like Heroku, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Google App Engine.
5.  **Serverless Functions:**  Specific parts of the application can be deployed as serverless functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Azure Functions), especially for event-driven or API-based workloads.

We'll describe a **containerized deployment using Docker and Kubernetes**, as it's a common and robust approach.

## BUILD

The build process for a Hapi.js application typically involves the following steps:

1.  **Code Checkout:** The CI/CD pipeline checks out the source code from the Git repository.
2.  **Dependency Installation:**  Dependencies are installed using npm or yarn (e.g., `npm install`).
3.  **Linting:**  Code is linted using tools like ESLint to enforce coding standards and identify potential errors.
4.  **Testing:**  Unit tests, integration tests, and potentially end-to-end tests are executed.
5.  **Building (if necessary):**  If the application uses a transpiler like Babel or TypeScript, the code is compiled into JavaScript.
6.  **Packaging:** The application and its dependencies are packaged into a Docker image.
7.  **Image Scanning:** The Docker image is scanned for vulnerabilities using tools like Trivy, Clair, or Anchore.
8.  **Image Pushing:** The Docker image is pushed to a container registry.

    DockerImage -- "Image Scanning (Trivy, Clair)" --> ScannedImage["Scanned Docker Image"];
    ScannedImage -- "Push" --> ContainerRegistry["Container Registry (e.g., Docker Hub, ECR, GCR)"];

```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   **Dependency Management:**  Using npm or yarn with package-lock.json or yarn.lock to ensure consistent and reproducible builds. Regularly auditing dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
*   **Linting:**  Enforcing coding standards and identifying potential security issues using linters.
*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):**  Integrating SAST tools into the CI/CD pipeline to scan the code for vulnerabilities.
*   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Using tools to identify and manage open-source dependencies and their associated vulnerabilities.
*   **Image Scanning:**  Scanning Docker images for vulnerabilities before pushing them to a registry.
*   **Secure Build Environment:**  Ensuring the CI/CD pipeline itself is secure, with appropriate access controls and secrets management.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   **Critical Business Processes:**
    *   Serving web requests and API calls reliably.
    *   Protecting user data and ensuring privacy.
    *   Maintaining the integrity of application data and functionality.
    *   Ensuring the availability of the application.

*   **Data Sensitivity:**
    *   **User Data (PII):**  Names, email addresses, passwords (hashed), addresses, phone numbers, etc. (High Sensitivity)
    *   **Financial Data:**  Payment card information, transaction details (if applicable). (High Sensitivity)
    *   **Session Data:**  User session tokens, authentication state. (High Sensitivity)
    *   **Application Data:**  Data specific to the application's functionality (variable sensitivity depending on the application).
    *   **Configuration Data:** API keys, database credentials, other secrets. (High Sensitivity)
    *   **Logs:** Application logs may contain sensitive information if not properly configured. (Medium to High Sensitivity)
