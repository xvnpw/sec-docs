## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Hapi.js Plugins [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_hapi_js_plugins__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Unpatched CVEs in Plugins [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in installed Hapi.js plugins that haven't been patched by the application.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **2.1.1 Identify installed plugins and versions:** Determine which plugins are used and their specific versions. This can be done through various methods, including examining `package.json`, analyzing server responses, or exploiting error messages that reveal plugin information.
        *   **2.1.2 Find public exploit for a plugin CVE:** Search vulnerability databases (NVD, CVE Mitre) and exploit repositories (Exploit-DB, GitHub) for publicly available exploits targeting the identified plugin and version.
        *   **2.1.3 Craft and send malicious payload:** Adapt the public exploit or create a custom payload based on the CVE details to target the specific application instance.
        *   **2.1.4 Achieve RCE/Data Exfiltration/DoS [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successfully exploiting the vulnerability leads to the attacker's goal, which could be remote code execution (RCE), data exfiltration, or denial of service (DoS).

*   **2.3 Misconfigured Plugins [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit plugins that are installed and functional but have been configured insecurely, leaving them vulnerable.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **2.3.1 Identify misconfigured plugin settings:** Discover insecure configurations, such as overly permissive CORS settings, disabled authentication, weak encryption keys, or exposed debugging endpoints.
        *   **2.3.2 Exploit the misconfiguration:** Leverage the identified misconfiguration to bypass security controls. For example, a misconfigured CORS policy could allow cross-origin requests to steal sensitive data.
        *   **2.3.3 Gain unauthorized access or cause DoS [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker successfully gains access to restricted resources, data, or functionality, or disrupts the application's service.

*   **2.4 Weakly Implemented Custom Plugins [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within custom-built Hapi.js plugins, which often receive less security scrutiny than well-established, publicly available plugins.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **2.4.1 Identify custom plugins:** Determine if the application uses any custom plugins, often indicated by unique names or functionality not found in public plugins.
        *   **2.4.2 Analyze plugin code for vulnerabilities:** Review the source code of the custom plugin (if available) for common web vulnerabilities like input validation flaws, insecure data handling, improper authentication/authorization, or insecure direct object references.
        *   **2.4.3 Craft input to exploit the vulnerability:** Develop a malicious input that triggers the identified vulnerability in the custom plugin.
        *   **2.4.4 Achieve RCE/Data Exfiltration/DoS [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successfully exploiting the vulnerability leads to the attacker's goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Hapi.js Features (If Misused)](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_hapi_js_features__if_misused_.md)

*   **3.1 Request Validation Bypass (Joi) [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers bypass input validation implemented using the Joi library by crafting inputs that exploit weaknesses in the validation schema.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **3.1.1 Identify poorly defined Joi schemas:** Analyze the Joi validation schemas (if available) or use dynamic analysis techniques (e.g., fuzzing) to identify weaknesses, such as missing required fields, weak type validation, or insufficient length restrictions.
        *   **3.1.2 Craft input that bypasses the validation rules:** Create a malicious input that satisfies the weak validation rules but contains harmful data.
        *   **3.1.3 Submit malicious data [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker successfully submits data that should have been rejected by the validation, potentially leading to further exploitation.

*   **3.2 Improper Route Configuration [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers access restricted resources or functionality due to misconfigured route definitions in the Hapi.js application.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **3.2.1 Identify routes with overly permissive access controls:** Analyze the route configurations (if available) or use testing techniques to find routes that lack proper authentication or authorization checks.
        *   **3.2.2 Access restricted resources or endpoints:** Directly access the identified routes without providing the required credentials or permissions.
        *   **3.2.3 Gain unauthorized access [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker successfully accesses data or functionality they should not have access to.

*   **3.5 Insecure use of `h.response()` options [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit insecure configurations of the `h.response()` method in Hapi.js, particularly options like `variety: 'file'`, to gain unauthorized access to files or potentially execute code.
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **3.5.1 Identify places where `h.response()` is used:** Review the application code to find instances where `h.response()` is used, paying close attention to the options passed to the method.
        *   **3.5.2 Exploit options like `variety: 'file'`:** If `variety: 'file'` is used without proper sanitization of user-supplied input (e.g., a filename), craft a malicious input (e.g., a path traversal attack) to read arbitrary files from the server.
        *   **3.5.3 Achieve data exfiltration/RCE [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker successfully exfiltrates sensitive data or, in some cases (e.g., if combined with a file upload vulnerability), achieves remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Dependency-Related Issues [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/4__dependency-related_issues__high_risk_.md)

*   **4.1 Vulnerable Dependencies of Hapi.js or Plugins [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the dependencies of Hapi.js itself or its plugins. These dependencies can be direct or transitive (dependencies of dependencies).
    *   **Steps:**
        *   **4.1.1 Identify all dependencies:** Use tools like `npm ls` or dependency analysis tools to create a complete list of all dependencies and their versions.
        *   **4.1.2 Check for known vulnerabilities:** Use vulnerability scanners (e.g., `npm audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) to identify known vulnerabilities in the listed dependencies.
        *   **4.1.3 Exploit a vulnerable dependency:** If a vulnerable dependency is found and an exploit is available, the attacker crafts a payload to target that specific vulnerability.
        *   **4.1.4 Achieve RCE/Data Exfiltration/DoS [CRITICAL NODE]:** Successfully exploiting the dependency vulnerability leads to the attacker's goal.
