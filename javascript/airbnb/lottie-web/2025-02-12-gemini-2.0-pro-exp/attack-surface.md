# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/lottie-web

## Attack Surface: [1. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_surfaces/1__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Lottie JSON file designed to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory) when parsed and rendered by `lottie-web`, leading to application slowdown or crashes.
    *   **How Lottie-Web Contributes:** `lottie-web` is the direct target; it parses the malicious JSON and performs the resource-intensive rendering.
    *   **Example:** A JSON file with millions of layers, extremely high frame rates, deeply nested objects, or embedded base64-encoded images that are gigabytes in size.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application unresponsiveness.
        *   Browser tab freezing or crashing.
        *   Potential server-side resource exhaustion (if pre-processing Lottie files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict size limits on the Lottie JSON file. Validate structure (max nesting depth, layers). Reject files exceeding thresholds.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Set limits within `lottie-web` configuration (if available) or application-level code to restrict animation complexity (max frame rate, elements).
        *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts for rendering. Terminate animations that take too long.
        *   **Server-Side Validation:** If possible, validate on the server *before* sending to the client.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Limit the number of Lottie files processed per user/time period.

## Attack Surface: [2. Code Injection (Extremely Unlikely, but Theoretically Possible)](./attack_surfaces/2__code_injection__extremely_unlikely__but_theoretically_possible_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a *hypothetical* vulnerability in `lottie-web`'s parsing or event handling to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript.  This is highly improbable with proper coding but is a theoretical worst-case scenario.
    *   **How Lottie-Web Contributes:** A vulnerability *within* `lottie-web`'s code would be the direct cause, allowing the attacker to leverage the library for code execution.
    *   **Example:** A crafted JSON file exploiting a hypothetical flaw in how `lottie-web` handles animation events or interacts with potentially dangerous JavaScript functions (extremely unlikely in a well-maintained library).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete application compromise.
        *   Data theft.
        *   Redirection to malicious sites.
        *   Malware installation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (but very low probability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Lottie-Web Updated:** The *primary* mitigation is using the latest `lottie-web` version, which should include patches for any discovered vulnerabilities.
        *   **Avoid Custom Modifications:** Do not modify `lottie-web`'s source code unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
        *   **Strict CSP:** Implement a very strict Content Security Policy (CSP) disallowing inline scripts and restricting script sources. This makes injected code execution much harder.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Indirect):** While direct injection is unlikely, sanitizing input JSON to remove potentially dangerous characters can add a layer of defense.
        *   **Security Audits:** Regular security audits, including `lottie-web` usage, can help identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [3. Malicious Resource Substitution (If External Resources are Used AND `lottie-web` has a vulnerability related to loading them)](./attack_surfaces/3__malicious_resource_substitution__if_external_resources_are_used_and__lottie-web__has_a_vulnerabil_5b61d175.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the source of external resources (e.g., a CDN), replacing legitimate resources with malicious ones, *and* `lottie-web` has a vulnerability that allows this substitution to lead to a security issue (e.g., bypassing security checks).
    *   **How Lottie-Web Contributes:** `lottie-web` loads and renders these resources.  A vulnerability in *how* it loads them would be necessary for this to be a *direct* `lottie-web` issue.  Without a specific `lottie-web` vulnerability, this is more of a general web security concern.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a CDN, replaces a legitimate image with a malicious one, *and* a hypothetical `lottie-web` bug bypasses integrity checks, allowing the malicious image to be loaded and potentially exploited.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Potential code execution (if the malicious resource is exploitable).
        *   Display of unwanted content.
        *   Data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Contingent on a `lottie-web` vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Embed Resources:** Embed resources within the Lottie JSON as base64 data, eliminating external dependencies.
        *   **Use a Trusted CDN:** Use a reputable and well-secured CDN.
        *   **Proxy Resources:** Proxy external resources through your server, allowing you to scan them for malware.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restrict resource loading domains via CSP.
        *   **Keep Lottie-Web Updated:**  Ensure you are using the latest version of `lottie-web` to benefit from any security patches related to resource loading.
        *  **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** If possible use SRI.
