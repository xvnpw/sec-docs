# Attack Tree Analysis for airbnb/lottie-web

Objective: To execute arbitrary code (JavaScript) or manipulate the application's behavior/UI through malicious Lottie animations, leading to XSS, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Visualization

*   **Compromise Application via Lottie-Web (***Critical Node***)**
    *   **Malicious Animation File (**)
        *   XSS via JavaScript Injection (**)

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Lottie-Web (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_lottie-web__critical_node_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  This represents the overall likelihood of *any* successful attack leveraging Lottie-web, considering the high-risk paths.  It's medium because while vulnerabilities exist, successful exploitation depends on application-specific implementation and user interaction.
    *   **Impact:** High to Critical.  Successful exploitation can range from stealing user data (High) to complete server compromise (Critical), depending on the application's functionality and the attacker's goals.
    *   **Effort:** Variable.  The effort required depends heavily on the specific vulnerability exploited and the security measures in place.
    *   **Skill Level:** Variable.  Ranges from Low (using pre-made malicious animations) to High (discovering and exploiting 0-day vulnerabilities).
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable.  Depends on the sophistication of the attack and the monitoring/logging capabilities of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Animation File (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_animation_file__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  This reflects the probability of an attacker successfully delivering a malicious Lottie file to the application.  This could be through user uploads, compromised third-party libraries, or other injection methods.  It's not "High" because many applications have some form of input validation, but "Medium" because social engineering or other vulnerabilities can often bypass these.
    *   **Impact:** High to Critical.  A malicious file is the *primary* delivery mechanism for most Lottie-based attacks.  The impact is directly tied to what the malicious code within the animation does.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Creating a basic malicious Lottie file is relatively easy using tools like Adobe After Effects and the Bodymovin plugin.  However, crafting a sophisticated exploit that bypasses security measures may require more effort.
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium.  Basic JSON and JavaScript knowledge is sufficient for simple attacks.  More advanced attacks require a deeper understanding of Lottie's internals and web security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High.  Simple malicious code might be detected by signature-based scanners or basic input validation.  However, obfuscated or polymorphic code, or exploits targeting subtle logic flaws, are much harder to detect.  Behavioral analysis of the animation's runtime behavior is more effective but resource-intensive.

## Attack Tree Path: [XSS via JavaScript Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/xss_via_javascript_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium.  Lottie animations use JavaScript for interactivity.  If the application doesn't properly sanitize the animation data or uses insecure methods to execute the animation's code (e.g., `eval()`, insecurely configured `Function()` constructor), an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.  The likelihood is medium because many developers are aware of XSS risks, but mistakes are still common.
    *   **Impact:** High.  Successful XSS can lead to:
        *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user cookies and impersonating them.
        *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data displayed on the page or stored in the user's browser (e.g., local storage, cookies).
        *   **Defacement:** Modifying the appearance or content of the website.
        *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms.
        *   **Client-Side Attacks:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the user's browser or plugins.
        *   **Keylogging:** Capturing user keystrokes.
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium.  Simple XSS payloads are readily available.  Bypassing more robust sanitization or escaping mechanisms requires more effort and knowledge.
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium.  Requires a good understanding of JavaScript and how XSS vulnerabilities work.  Knowledge of common XSS evasion techniques is beneficial.
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.  WAFs and browser-based XSS filters can detect some attacks, but sophisticated payloads can often bypass them.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are crucial.  Content Security Policy (CSP), if properly configured, can significantly mitigate this risk.
      *   **Specific Lottie-Web Considerations:**
          *   **`expression` properties:** Lottie allows JavaScript expressions within animation data. These are prime targets for injection.
          *   **Event Handlers:** If the application uses Lottie's event handling system (e.g., `addEventListener`), attackers might try to inject malicious code into event handlers.
          *   **External Resources:** If the animation loads external resources (e.g., images, fonts), these could be manipulated to inject malicious code.
          *   **Text Layers:** Malicious code could be hidden within text layers, especially if the application dynamically processes or displays this text.
          * **Data-driven animations:** If external data is used to control the animation, that data must be sanitized.
