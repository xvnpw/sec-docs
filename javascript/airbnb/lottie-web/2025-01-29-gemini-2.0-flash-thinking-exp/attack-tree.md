## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using Lottie-web (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using_lottie-web__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the overarching goal and represents the starting point for all high-risk attack paths.
*   Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective of compromising the application through Lottie-web.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Lottie-web Library (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_lottie-web_library__critical_node_.md)

*   This node highlights that vulnerabilities within the Lottie-web library itself are a primary attack vector.
*   Attackers will focus on finding and exploiting weaknesses in Lottie-web's code to compromise applications using it.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Maliciously Crafted JSON Animation Data (Bodymovin) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/3__maliciously_crafted_json_animation_data__bodymovin___critical_node_.md)

*   This node emphasizes that the JSON animation data (Bodymovin format) is the primary input and a critical point of vulnerability.
*   Attackers will craft malicious JSON data to exploit weaknesses in how Lottie-web processes and renders animations.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Parser Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path: DoS via Parser Crash)](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_parser_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_dos_via_parser_crash_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Send excessively large or deeply nested JSON (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers send animation JSON that is extremely large in size or has deeply nested structures.
        *   This can overwhelm the JSON parser, causing it to crash or consume excessive resources, leading to Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Send JSON with unexpected data types or formats (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers send animation JSON that deviates from the expected Bodymovin schema, using incorrect data types or unexpected formats.
        *   This can trigger errors in the parser, potentially leading to crashes, unexpected behavior, or in rare cases, exploitable vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Rendering Engine Logic Flaws (Critical Node & High-Risk Path: DoS via Resource Exhaustion, XSS via Animation Properties)](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_rendering_engine_logic_flaws__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_dos_via_resource_exhaustion__3cffdf22.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Cause Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Create animations with excessive complexity (High-Risk Path):**
            *   Attackers create animations with a very large number of shapes, layers, keyframes, or complex expressions.
            *   Rendering these complex animations can consume excessive CPU and memory resources on the client-side, leading to browser unresponsiveness or crashes (DoS).
        *   **Trigger computationally expensive features within Lottie-web (High-Risk Path):**
            *   Attackers utilize specific Lottie-web features known to be computationally intensive, such as certain effects, masks, or mattes, within their animations.
            *   This can similarly lead to client-side resource exhaustion and DoS.
    *   **Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Animation Properties (If improperly handled) (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Inject malicious JavaScript code within animation properties that are rendered into the DOM without proper sanitization (High-Risk Path):**
            *   Attackers embed malicious JavaScript code within animation properties, such as text layers, dynamic expressions, or potentially custom data attributes if used insecurely.
            *   If the application or Lottie-web does not properly sanitize these properties before rendering them into the Document Object Model (DOM), the malicious JavaScript code can be executed in the user's browser, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Dependency Vulnerabilities (Critical Node & High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Lottie-web's Dependencies)](./attack_tree_paths/6__dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_lottie-web'_43f98fb0.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Lottie-web's Dependencies (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Lottie-web relies on other JavaScript libraries (dependencies).
        *   If any of these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them through Lottie-web.
        *   This could lead to various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability, ranging from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Phishing Attacks with Malicious Animations (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/7__phishing_attacks_with_malicious_animations__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Embed malicious animations in phishing emails or websites that exploit Lottie-web vulnerabilities or simply appear legitimate to trick users (High-Risk Path):**
        *   Attackers embed malicious Lottie animations within phishing emails or on fake websites designed to mimic legitimate applications.
        *   These animations can be used to:
            *   Exploit known vulnerabilities in Lottie-web if the user's browser is vulnerable.
            *   Appear legitimate and trustworthy, tricking users into interacting with the phishing content (e.g., clicking links, entering credentials).
            *   Potentially deliver a payload or redirect users to malicious sites after interaction with the animation.
