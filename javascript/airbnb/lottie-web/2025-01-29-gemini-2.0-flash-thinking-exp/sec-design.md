# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Lottie-web project is a Javascript library that renders After Effects animations natively on Web, Android, iOS, and React Native. It uses JSON files exported from After Effects with Bodymovin/Lottie.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Enhance user interface and user experience of web and mobile applications by enabling the use of high-quality vector animations.
- Improve user engagement and visual appeal of digital products.
- Provide a cross-platform solution for animation rendering, reducing development effort and ensuring consistency across different platforms.
- Enable designers to create complex animations using familiar tools (After Effects) and easily integrate them into applications.
- Improve website and application performance compared to traditional animation methods (e.g., GIFs, videos) due to vector-based rendering and smaller file sizes.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Performance impact: Incorrectly implemented or overly complex animations could negatively impact application performance, leading to a poor user experience.
- Compatibility issues: The library might not be compatible with all browsers or devices, leading to inconsistent animation rendering or application crashes.
- Dependency vulnerabilities: The library relies on Javascript and potentially other dependencies, which could introduce security vulnerabilities if not properly managed and updated.
- Supply chain risks: Compromised build or distribution processes could lead to the delivery of a malicious version of the library.
- Input validation vulnerabilities: Processing maliciously crafted animation files could lead to client-side vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the library is not robust against malicious inputs.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Use of GitHub for version control and collaboration, providing transparency and history of changes. (Implemented in: GitHub repository)
- security control: Open-source nature of the project allows for community review and contribution, potentially leading to faster identification and resolution of security issues. (Implemented in: Open GitHub repository)
- security control: Standard web security practices applied by developers using the library in their applications (e.g., Content Security Policy, input sanitization in application code). (Implemented in: Dependent applications)

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on client-side security measures, as the library operates within the user's browser environment.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies, which require ongoing monitoring and updates.
- accepted risk: Risk of misuse by developers who might not implement animations securely or efficiently, leading to performance or security issues in their applications.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST and dependency scanning) in the build process to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
- security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using the library, focusing on secure animation creation and integration.
- security control: Regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement input validation within the library to handle potentially malicious animation files and prevent client-side vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the library itself, as it's a client-side rendering engine. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications using the library.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to the library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications using the library to control access to animations and application features.
- Input Validation: Critical for the library. The library must validate the structure and content of animation JSON files to prevent processing of malicious or malformed data that could lead to vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, denial of service). Input validation should focus on:
    - JSON schema validation to ensure the animation file conforms to the expected structure.
    - Range checks and sanitization of animation data to prevent unexpected behavior or exploits.
    - Handling of potentially malicious data within animation properties (e.g., embedded scripts or URLs).
- Cryptography: Not directly required for the core functionality of the library, which is animation rendering. However, if future features involve handling sensitive data or secure communication, cryptographic measures might be necessary. For now, it's not a primary security requirement for the library itself.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment Architecture: Client-Side Deployment

Lottie-web is primarily a client-side library, so its deployment is focused on how it's integrated and delivered to web browsers. The typical deployment scenario involves:

1. **Hosting Lottie-web Library Files**: The Lottie-web Javascript files (lottie.js or similar) are hosted on a web server or CDN.
2. **Embedding in Web Application**: Web application developers include the Lottie-web library in their HTML pages using `<script>` tags.
3. **Hosting Animation JSON Files**: Animation JSON files are hosted on a web server or CDN, accessible via URLs.
4. **Fetching and Rendering**: When a user accesses the web application, the browser downloads the Lottie-web library and animation JSON files. The web application's Javascript code uses Lottie-web to fetch the animation files and render them in the browser.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Rendering animations in web and mobile applications to enhance user experience and engagement.
- Delivery of animation content to users without performance degradation or security vulnerabilities.
- Maintaining the Lottie-web library as a reliable and secure animation rendering solution.

Data Sensitivity:
- Animation JSON files themselves are generally not considered highly sensitive data. They are typically visual assets and do not contain personal or confidential information.
- However, the integrity and availability of animation files are important for maintaining the intended user experience and application functionality.
- Compromised animation files could potentially be used to deliver malicious content or disrupt application functionality, making integrity a key security concern.
- The Lottie-web library code itself is publicly available and open-source, so confidentiality is not a primary concern. Integrity and availability of the library are more important.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended audience and use case for this design document? Is it primarily for threat modeling, or will it also be used for development and operations?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements or security standards that the Lottie-web project needs to adhere to?
- What is the organization's risk appetite regarding client-side vulnerabilities and supply chain security?
- Are there any existing security tools or processes in place that can be leveraged for the Lottie-web project (e.g., security scanning tools, incident response procedures)?
- What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by the community or identified through internal testing?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to enhance user experience through animations, and performance and cross-platform compatibility are key priorities. Security is important but balanced with development velocity and ease of use.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Currently, security controls are primarily focused on standard open-source development practices and client-side web security measures implemented by applications using the library. There is an opportunity to enhance security controls in the build process and within the library itself (input validation).
- DESIGN: The deployment model is primarily client-side, with the library and animation files delivered via CDN. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions. The focus of security within the design should be on input validation in the library, supply chain security in the build process, and secure delivery of library and animation files.
