# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/lottie-web

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted JSON Input (High Severity)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_json_input__high_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in `lottie-web`'s JSON parsing or rendering logic by providing specially crafted JSON animation data designed to cause significant harm.
*   **How lottie-web contributes to the attack surface:** `lottie-web` is responsible for parsing and processing JSON animation files.  Vulnerabilities within its parsing or rendering engine can be directly triggered by malicious JSON.
*   **Example:** An attacker crafts a JSON file that exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in `lottie-web`'s JSON parser. When `lottie-web` attempts to parse this file, it leads to a crash or potentially allows for arbitrary code execution on the client-side.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) - potentially severe if parsing is a critical path, Client-Side Vulnerabilities - including potential Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if parsing errors can be leveraged to inject script, or in more severe cases, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if memory corruption vulnerabilities are present in the parsing or rendering engine (though less likely in typical web context, but theoretically possible).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Validation:** Implement strict schema validation for all incoming JSON animation data before it is processed by `lottie-web`. Validate against a well-defined and restrictive schema.
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep `lottie-web` updated to the latest version. Updates often include critical security patches for parsing and rendering vulnerabilities.
    *   **Fuzzing and Security Testing:** Conduct fuzzing and security testing specifically targeting `lottie-web`'s JSON parsing and rendering capabilities to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.
    *   **Sandboxing (Browser Provided):** Rely on browser's built-in sandboxing to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities. Ensure browser is also up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Library Version with Known Critical Vulnerabilities (High to Critical Severity)](./attack_surfaces/outdated_library_version_with_known_critical_vulnerabilities__high_to_critical_severity_.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of `lottie-web` that is known to contain publicly disclosed and critical security vulnerabilities.
*   **How lottie-web contributes to the attack surface:**  The outdated version *itself* contains the vulnerability. By using it, the application directly inherits this vulnerability.
*   **Example:** A critical Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is discovered and publicly disclosed in `lottie-web` version 5.0.0. An application still using version 5.0.0 is now directly vulnerable to this known XSS attack. An attacker can craft a malicious Lottie animation that, when rendered by the outdated `lottie-web`, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the application's context.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts, steal user credentials, deface websites, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the vulnerable application. In severe cases, other vulnerabilities like Remote Code Execution (RCE) could be present in outdated versions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (Critical if the known vulnerability is easily exploitable and has a high impact like RCE or XSS in a sensitive context, High if the vulnerability is less easily exploited or has a slightly lower impact, but still significant like DoS or less impactful XSS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Updates:**  As soon as a security advisory is released for `lottie-web` indicating a critical vulnerability, update to the patched version immediately.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring and Alerts:** Implement systems to monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for `lottie-web` and its dependencies. Set up alerts to be notified of new vulnerabilities.
    *   **Automated Dependency Management:** Use automated dependency management tools that can help identify outdated libraries and facilitate rapid updates.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application's frontend dependencies, including `lottie-web`, to ensure they are up-to-date and free of known vulnerabilities.
