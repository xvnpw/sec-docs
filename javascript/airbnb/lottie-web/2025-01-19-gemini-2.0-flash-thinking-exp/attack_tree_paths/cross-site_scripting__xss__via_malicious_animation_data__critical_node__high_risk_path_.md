## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Animation Data

**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Animation Data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]**

This top-level node highlights a critical vulnerability where attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code into Lottie animation data. When this animation is rendered by Lottie-web in a user's browser, the injected script executes within the context of the user's session. This can have severe consequences, allowing attackers to:

* **Session Hijacking:** Steal session cookies, gaining unauthorized access to the user's account.
* **Cookie Theft:** Obtain sensitive information stored in cookies.
* **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Redirect users to phishing pages or websites hosting malware.
* **Data Exfiltration:** Steal sensitive data displayed on the page or accessible through the user's session.
* **Defacement:** Modify the content of the web page.
* **Keylogging:** Capture user keystrokes.

The "HIGH RISK PATH" designation underscores the severity and likelihood of this attack vector, especially given the potential for widespread impact on users interacting with applications using Lottie-web.

### Inject Malicious Script within Animation Data [HIGH RISK PATH]

This node describes the core technique of embedding malicious scripts directly within the Lottie JSON data. This can be achieved through various means, focusing on leveraging features designed for dynamic animation control.

#### Leverage Expression Features for Script Execution [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Description:** Lottie's expression feature allows animators to use JavaScript-like expressions to dynamically control animation properties based on various factors (e.g., time, other layer properties). Attackers can exploit this by injecting malicious JavaScript code within these expressions. When Lottie-web renders the animation, it evaluates these expressions, leading to the execution of the attacker's script within the user's browser. This is a particularly dangerous vector because expressions are designed for dynamic behavior, making it a natural place to embed code that will be executed during rendering.

* **Example:** The provided example, `eval(String.fromCharCode(97, 108, 101, 114, 116, 40, 39, 88, 83, 83, 39, 41))`, demonstrates a simple yet effective injection. This expression, when evaluated, decodes to `alert('XSS')`. More sophisticated attacks could involve:
    * **Accessing and exfiltrating cookies:** `document.cookie`
    * **Redirecting the user:** `window.location.href = 'https://attacker.com/malicious'`
    * **Making API calls on behalf of the user:** `fetch('/api/sensitive-data')`
    * **Injecting iframes to load malicious content.**

* **Vulnerable Components:** The expression evaluation engine within Lottie-web is the primary vulnerable component. If it doesn't properly sanitize or sandbox the expressions before evaluation, it becomes a direct execution vector for malicious code.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Disable or Restrict Expression Functionality:** If the application doesn't heavily rely on expressions, consider disabling this feature entirely. If it's necessary, implement strict controls over which properties can be controlled by expressions and the complexity of allowed expressions.
    * **Sandboxing Expression Evaluation:** Implement a secure sandbox environment for evaluating expressions. This would limit the capabilities of the executed code, preventing access to sensitive browser APIs and the DOM.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevents inline script execution. This can significantly limit the impact of injected scripts.
    * **Input Sanitization (Server-Side):** If Lottie animations are uploaded or generated based on user input, rigorously sanitize the input on the server-side to remove or escape potentially malicious expression syntax.
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the handling of Lottie animations and expression evaluation.

#### Abuse External Asset Loading to Inject Script [HIGH RISK PATH]

* **Description:** Lottie-web might allow loading external assets like images, fonts, or potentially even other data files referenced within the animation data. If this functionality is not properly secured, attackers can host malicious JavaScript files on their own servers and craft Lottie animations that reference these files as if they were legitimate assets. When Lottie-web attempts to load these "assets," the malicious script is executed in the user's browser. This attack vector relies on the assumption that Lottie-web might process certain external assets in a way that allows script execution (e.g., within SVG images or through other mechanisms).

* **Example:** The provided example, `<image href="https://attacker.com/malicious.js" />`, illustrates this vulnerability. If Lottie-web attempts to load and process this "image" and the processing involves executing JavaScript (which can happen in certain SVG contexts or if the loading mechanism is flawed), the malicious script hosted on `attacker.com` will be executed. Other potential scenarios include:
    * Referencing malicious SVG files containing `<script>` tags.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Lottie-web handles external data files (if supported).

* **Vulnerable Components:** The asset loading and processing mechanisms within Lottie-web are the vulnerable components here. Lack of proper validation and sanitization of external asset URLs and the way these assets are handled during rendering can lead to script execution.

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Restrict External Asset Loading:**  Ideally, restrict Lottie-web to only load assets from trusted and controlled sources. Consider bundling all necessary assets with the application.
    * **Strict URL Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of URLs for external assets. Use allowlists of trusted domains and protocols. Block potentially malicious protocols like `javascript:`.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure CSP directives to restrict the sources from which images, scripts, and other assets can be loaded. This can prevent the browser from loading malicious assets from attacker-controlled domains.
    * **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** If loading external assets is unavoidable, use SRI to ensure that the loaded assets haven't been tampered with. This involves verifying the cryptographic hash of the loaded resource.
    * **Secure Asset Handling:** Ensure that the mechanisms used to process loaded assets (e.g., SVG parsing) are secure and do not introduce new XSS vulnerabilities. Avoid executing scripts embedded within loaded assets.
    * **Input Sanitization (Server-Side):** If Lottie animations are generated based on user input that includes asset URLs, sanitize these URLs on the server-side to prevent the inclusion of malicious links.

### General Mitigation Strategies for Lottie-web XSS

Beyond the specific mitigations for each sub-path, consider these general strategies:

* **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  While the primary attack vector is within the Lottie data itself, ensure that any user input that influences the rendering of Lottie animations (e.g., data used to generate animations) is properly validated and that any output displayed based on Lottie data is properly encoded to prevent other forms of XSS.
* **Regular Security Updates:** Keep Lottie-web updated to the latest version. Security vulnerabilities are often discovered and patched, so staying up-to-date is crucial.
* **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Regularly conduct security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the integration of Lottie-web within your application.
* **Developer Training:** Educate developers about the risks of XSS and secure coding practices related to handling external data and dynamic content.
* **Consider Alternatives:** If the security risks associated with Lottie-web's expression or external asset loading features are too high, consider alternative animation libraries or methods that offer better security controls.

### Conclusion

The "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Animation Data" attack path in Lottie-web presents a significant security risk. The ability to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript through animation expressions or by abusing external asset loading can have severe consequences for users. Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, focusing on restricting or securing expression evaluation and external asset handling, is crucial to protect applications utilizing Lottie-web. A defense-in-depth approach, combining multiple layers of security, will provide the most robust protection against these types of attacks. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are essential to identify and address any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
