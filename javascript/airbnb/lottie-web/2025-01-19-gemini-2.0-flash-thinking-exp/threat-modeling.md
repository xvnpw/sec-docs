# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/lottie-web

## Threat: [Malicious Animation Data Injection](./threats/malicious_animation_data_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted Lottie JSON file to the application. This directly targets `lottie-web`'s ability to parse and render animation data. The attacker aims to exploit vulnerabilities within `lottie-web`'s JSON parsing logic or create animation structures that cause excessive resource consumption during rendering by `lottie-web`.

**Impact:**
*   Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS): `lottie-web` attempts to render an excessively complex or infinitely looping animation, causing the user's browser to freeze or become unresponsive.
*   Resource Exhaustion: `lottie-web` consumes excessive CPU or memory resources while processing and rendering the malicious animation, degrading the user's experience.
*   Exploitation of Parsing Vulnerabilities: The malicious JSON exploits flaws in `lottie-web`'s JSON parsing, potentially leading to unexpected behavior within the library or, theoretically, client-side code execution (though less likely in modern browsers).

**Affected Component:**
*   `lottie.loadAnimation()` function
*   JSON parsing module within `lottie-web`
*   Renderer (SVG, Canvas, HTML) within `lottie-web`

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Validate and sanitize animation data before passing it to `lottie.loadAnimation()`.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the application can load animation data, reducing the risk of loading malicious files.
*   Regularly update `lottie-web` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address parsing vulnerabilities.
*   Consider setting timeouts or resource limits for animation rendering to prevent excessive resource consumption by `lottie-web`.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on `lottie-web`](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on__lottie-web_.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the `lottie-web` library itself. This could involve injecting malicious code into the library's files at its source, during the build process, or during distribution (e.g., through a compromised CDN). The compromised library then directly introduces vulnerabilities into any application using it.

**Impact:**
*   Client-Side Code Execution: Malicious code within the compromised `lottie-web` library executes arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
*   Data Exfiltration: The compromised `lottie-web` library could silently send user data or application data to an attacker-controlled server.
*   Backdoors: Malicious code within `lottie-web` could introduce backdoors, allowing attackers to remotely control aspects of the application's behavior on the client-side.

**Affected Component:**
*   Entire `lottie-web` library codebase.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities and potential compromises in `lottie-web`.
*   Verify the integrity of the `lottie-web` library using checksums or Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes when loading it from a CDN.
*   Pin specific versions of `lottie-web` in your project's dependencies to avoid automatically pulling in compromised versions.
*   Consider hosting `lottie-web` files on your own infrastructure instead of relying solely on CDNs.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Dependency Vulnerabilities (Directly Triggered via `lottie-web`)](./threats/exploitation_of_dependency_vulnerabilities__directly_triggered_via__lottie-web__.md)

**Description:** `lottie-web` relies on other JavaScript libraries. If these dependencies have vulnerabilities, and `lottie-web`'s code directly interacts with the vulnerable part of the dependency in a way that exposes the vulnerability, it becomes a threat directly involving `lottie-web`. An attacker could craft malicious animation data or manipulate `lottie-web`'s API calls to trigger these underlying vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**
*   Inherited Vulnerabilities: The application becomes vulnerable to known security flaws in `lottie-web`'s dependencies, potentially leading to various impacts depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., code execution, data breaches).

**Affected Component:**
*   The specific vulnerable dependency used by `lottie-web`.
*   The specific parts of `lottie-web`'s code that interact with the vulnerable dependency.

**Risk Severity:** High (if the dependency vulnerability is high severity)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update `lottie-web` to benefit from updates that may address vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
*   Use a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify vulnerabilities in `lottie-web`'s dependencies.
*   If a critical vulnerability is found in a dependency and `lottie-web` hasn't been updated, consider alternative animation libraries or patching `lottie-web` locally (with caution).
*   Carefully review `lottie-web`'s release notes and changelogs for information about dependency updates and security fixes.
