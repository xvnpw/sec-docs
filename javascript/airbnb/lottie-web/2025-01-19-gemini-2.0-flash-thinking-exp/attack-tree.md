## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Animation Data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_animation_data__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious Lottie JSON files containing JavaScript code that executes when the animation is rendered in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and other client-side attacks.

    * **Inject Malicious Script within Animation Data [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Leverage Expression Features for Script Execution [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Description:** Lottie supports expressions, which are JavaScript-like snippets used to dynamically control animation properties. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code within these expressions. When the animation is rendered, Lottie-web evaluates these expressions, leading to the execution of the injected script.
            * **Example:** An attacker might inject an expression like `eval(String.fromCharCode(97, 108, 101, 114, 116, 40, 39, 88, 83, 83, 39, 41))`, which decodes to `alert('XSS')`.
        * **Abuse External Asset Loading to Inject Script [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Description:** If Lottie-web allows loading external assets (like images or fonts) and this functionality is not properly secured, attackers can host malicious JavaScript files on their own servers. They can then craft Lottie animation data that references these malicious JavaScript files as if they were legitimate assets. When Lottie-web attempts to load these "assets," the malicious script is executed in the user's browser.
            * **Example:** An attacker could create a Lottie file referencing `<image href="https://attacker.com/malicious.js" />`. If Lottie-web executes JavaScript within loaded SVG images or similar assets, this could lead to XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Less Likely, but Consider Indirect Paths) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce___less_likely__but_consider_indirect_paths___critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** While direct RCE vulnerabilities within Lottie-web itself are less common in browser environments, attackers might attempt to exploit underlying vulnerabilities in the browser's rendering engine (e.g., related to WebGL or other graphics libraries) through carefully crafted Lottie animation data.
* **Description:** This involves creating specific animation data that triggers a memory corruption or other exploitable bug in the browser's rendering process. If successful, this could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
* **Note:** This path is considered less likely due to the complexity of exploiting browser-level vulnerabilities, but the potential impact is critical, warranting its inclusion as a critical node.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Misuse of Lottie-web Leading to Exploitation [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/application_misuse_of_lottie-web_leading_to_exploitation__critical_node__high_risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities can arise not just from flaws within Lottie-web itself, but also from how the application integrates and uses the library. Insecure practices in handling Lottie animation data can create significant security risks.

    * **Insecure Handling of User-Provided Animation Data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Application Directly Loads Untrusted Lottie Files [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Description:** If the application allows users to upload or provide Lottie files directly (e.g., through file uploads or by specifying URLs to Lottie files) and then renders these files without proper sanitization or validation, the application becomes vulnerable to any malicious content embedded within those files. This includes the XSS vulnerabilities described above, as well as potential DoS attacks or other exploits.
            * **Example:** An attacker uploads a Lottie file containing malicious JavaScript within an expression. The application directly loads and renders this file, leading to the execution of the attacker's script in other users' browsers.
