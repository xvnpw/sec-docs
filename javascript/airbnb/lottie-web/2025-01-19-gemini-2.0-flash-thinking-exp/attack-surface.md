# Attack Surface Analysis for airbnb/lottie-web

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Lottie JSON](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_lottie_json.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted Lottie JSON file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the parsing or rendering process of `lottie-web`.

**How Lottie-web Contributes:** `lottie-web` is directly responsible for parsing and interpreting the JSON data to render the animation. Flaws in its parsing logic or rendering engine can be exploited.

**Example:** A Lottie JSON file with extremely deep nesting causing a stack overflow during parsing, or a file with a very large number of elements causing excessive memory consumption during rendering.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) on the client-side, causing the application to freeze or crash. Potential for unexpected behavior or errors that could be chained with other vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation on Lottie JSON files before passing them to `lottie-web`. This includes size limits, complexity checks (e.g., maximum number of layers, shapes), and validating the structure against expected schemas.
* Regularly update `lottie-web` to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* Consider using a sandboxed environment or worker thread to render Lottie animations, limiting the impact of potential crashes.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via DOM Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_dom_manipulation.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in `lottie-web`'s rendering logic could lead to the injection of malicious scripts into the Document Object Model (DOM) of the application.

**How Lottie-web Contributes:** `lottie-web` directly manipulates the DOM to render the animation. If this manipulation is not done securely, it could introduce XSS vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A crafted Lottie animation containing specific properties or values that, when rendered by `lottie-web`, inject malicious `<script>` tags or event handlers into the DOM.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure that the application's Content Security Policy (CSP) is properly configured to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
* Regularly review the release notes and changelogs of `lottie-web` for any reported XSS vulnerabilities and update accordingly.
* If possible, sanitize or escape any user-provided data that influences the Lottie animation or its rendering context, although this is less directly applicable to the Lottie JSON itself.
