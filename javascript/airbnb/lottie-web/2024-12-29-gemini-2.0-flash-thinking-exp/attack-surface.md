*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious JSON Payload
    *   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted JSON animation file that exploits vulnerabilities in `lottie-web`'s parsing or rendering logic.
    *   **How Lottie-web Contributes:** `lottie-web` directly processes and interprets the provided JSON data to render the animation. Flaws in this processing can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A JSON file with extremely deep nesting or excessively large numerical values that cause the JavaScript engine to crash or become unresponsive while `lottie-web` attempts to parse it.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (client-side), unexpected behavior, potential for triggering browser vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement size limits on uploaded or processed animation files.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment or worker thread to process animations, limiting the impact of crashes.
        *   Regularly update `lottie-web` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   If possible, pre-process or validate animation files on the server-side before they reach the client and `lottie-web`.

*   **Attack Surface:** External Animation URL Loading from Untrusted Sources
    *   **Description:** The application allows loading animations from arbitrary external URLs, potentially controlled by malicious actors.
    *   **How Lottie-web Contributes:** `lottie-web` can be instructed to fetch and render animations from URLs, making it a conduit for potentially harmful content.
    *   **Example:** An attacker hosts a malicious JSON animation on their server and tricks a user into loading it through the application. This animation could be designed to cause a client-side DoS or exploit a vulnerability in `lottie-web`.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side denial of service, exposure to malicious content, potential for triggering browser vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only allow loading animations from trusted and known sources.
        *   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) that restricts the sources from which scripts and other resources can be loaded.
        *   If external URLs are necessary, validate and sanitize the URLs before passing them to `lottie-web`.
        *   Consider proxying external animation requests through your own server to have more control over the fetched content.

*   **Attack Surface:** Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in `lottie-web`
    *   **Description:** Attackers leverage publicly known security vulnerabilities within specific versions of the `lottie-web` library.
    *   **How Lottie-web Contributes:** The library itself contains the vulnerable code that can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A known vulnerability in an older version of `lottie-web` allows for arbitrary code execution when processing a specific type of malformed animation data.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side denial of service, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) if the vulnerability allows for injecting malicious scripts, or other unexpected and potentially harmful behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediately update `lottie-web` to the latest stable version.** This is the most crucial mitigation.
        *   Monitor security advisories and changelogs for `lottie-web` to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
