* **Threat:** Maliciously Crafted JSON Leading to Code Execution
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a Lottie JSON file with specific properties or structures that exploit vulnerabilities within the `lottie-web` parsing or rendering engine. This could involve overflowing buffers, triggering unexpected function calls, or manipulating internal state in a way that allows execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
    * **Impact:** If successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session. This could lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, injecting malware, or performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
    * **Affected Lottie-web Component:** JSON Parser, Renderer (specifically the parts responsible for interpreting and executing expressions or handling specific animation features).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep `lottie-web` updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        * Implement robust server-side validation of Lottie JSON files before they are served to the client. This validation should go beyond basic JSON syntax and check for potentially dangerous constructs or excessive complexity.
        * Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed and to mitigate the impact of any successful code injection.

* **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion
    * **Description:** An attacker provides a Lottie JSON file that is excessively complex or contains elements that consume significant client-side resources (CPU, memory) during rendering. This could cause the user's browser to become unresponsive or crash, effectively denying them access to the application. The attacker might achieve this by creating animations with a very high number of layers, shapes, or complex expressions.
    * **Impact:** The user experience is severely degraded, potentially leading to browser crashes and the inability to use the application. This can damage the application's reputation and frustrate users.
    * **Affected Lottie-web Component:** Renderer (specifically the parts responsible for processing and drawing animation frames).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement limits on the size and complexity of animation files that can be loaded.
        * Consider server-side pre-processing or analysis of animation files to identify potentially resource-intensive animations before serving them to the client.
        * Implement client-side timeouts or resource monitoring to prevent runaway animations from completely freezing the browser.
        * Provide feedback to users if an animation is taking an unusually long time to load or render.

* **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious JSON Data
    * **Description:** While less likely due to the nature of JSON, vulnerabilities in `lottie-web`'s rendering logic could potentially allow for the injection of malicious scripts through carefully crafted animation data. This could occur if the library improperly handles certain data within the JSON and renders it in a way that executes JavaScript. The attacker could inject malicious code that gets executed when the animation is rendered on a vulnerable page.
    * **Impact:** Successful XSS can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Affected Lottie-web Component:** Renderer (specifically the parts responsible for interpreting and rendering text or other dynamic content within the animation).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep `lottie-web` updated.
        * Ensure strict output encoding when handling any data derived from the animation that is displayed on the page outside of the Lottie canvas.
        * Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of any potential XSS vulnerabilities.
