## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL Execute Malicious Actions via Lottie Animation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_execute_malicious_actions_via_lottie_animation.md)

**1. CRITICAL Execute Malicious Actions via Lottie Animation:**

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. All subsequent paths aim to achieve this objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL Exploit Malicious Animation Data](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical_exploit_malicious_animation_data.md)

**2. HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL Exploit Malicious Animation Data:**

*   This node represents a broad category of attacks where the attacker manipulates the animation data itself to cause harm. It's critical because successfully exploiting the animation data can directly lead to high-impact consequences.

    *   **HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL Inject Malicious Script/Code:**
        *   Embed JavaScript within animation data (via expressions or other features) **HIGH-RISK**
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Full XSS, potential for account takeover, data theft)
            *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of Lottie expressions and potential injection points)
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be obfuscated within animation data)
            *   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a Lottie animation JSON file that contains embedded JavaScript code within expressions or other animation properties. When the application renders this animation using `lottie-web`, the embedded script could be executed in the user's browser context.

    *   **HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL Trigger Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via DOM manipulation:**
        *   Craft animation to manipulate DOM elements in a way that injects scripts **HIGH-RISK**
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High (Full XSS)
            *   **Effort:** Medium (Requires some understanding of Lottie-web's rendering process)
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Can be subtle and hard to distinguish from legitimate DOM changes)
            *   **Attack Vector:** A carefully crafted animation could manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) in a way that injects malicious scripts. This might involve manipulating element attributes or creating new elements with embedded scripts, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

    *   Reference malicious external resources (images, fonts, etc.) **HIGH-RISK**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium (Display of malicious content, potential for further attacks if the resource is a script)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Easy to change URLs in JSON)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Network traffic to unusual domains)
        *   **Attack Vector:** If the application or Lottie-web configuration allows loading external resources (like images or fonts) from URLs specified in the animation data, an attacker could provide URLs pointing to malicious resources. This could lead to the execution of malicious scripts (if the resource is a JavaScript file) or the display of inappropriate content.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL Leverage Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical_leverage_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**3. HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL Leverage Known Vulnerabilities:**

*   This node highlights the risk of using outdated versions of the `lottie-web` library. It's critical because exploiting known vulnerabilities is often straightforward if the application is not kept up-to-date.

    *   Exploit publicly disclosed security flaws in specific Lottie-web versions **HIGH-RISK**
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (If application uses outdated version)
        *   **Impact:** High (Depends on the specific vulnerability - could be RCE, XSS, etc.)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Exploits are often publicly available)
        *   **Skill Level:** Low to Intermediate (Depending on the complexity of the exploit)
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Security scanners can often detect outdated libraries)
        *   **Attack Vector:** Like any software library, Lottie-web might have known vulnerabilities in specific versions. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses an outdated version of the library.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk__critical_exploit_integration_vulnerabilities.md)

**4. HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL Exploit Integration Vulnerabilities:**

*   This node represents a category of attacks that exploit weaknesses in how the application integrates and uses the `lottie-web` library. It's critical because improper integration can create significant security holes.

    *   **HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL Supply Malicious Animation Source:**
        *   **HIGH-RISK, CRITICAL Inject malicious animation URL/data through application input **HIGH-RISK**
            *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (If application doesn't properly sanitize input)
            *   **Impact:** High (Can lead to any of the "Exploit Malicious Animation Data" attacks)
            *   **Effort:** Low (Simple injection)
            *   **Skill Level:** Low
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium (Depends on logging and input validation)
            *   **Attack Vector:** If the application allows users to provide the source of the Lottie animation (e.g., through a URL or file upload), an attacker can supply a malicious animation file or URL, leading to any of the attacks described under "Exploit Malicious Animation Data". This is especially dangerous if user-provided input is directly used without proper validation and sanitization.
