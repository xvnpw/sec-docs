# Threat Model Analysis for airbnb/lottie-web

## Threat: [Script Injection via SVG in Animation Data](./threats/script_injection_via_svg_in_animation_data.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious animation data containing SVG elements with embedded JavaScript (e.g., within `<script>` tags or event handlers like `onload`). When `lottie-web` renders this animation, the embedded script executes within the user's browser.
    * **Impact:** This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing the attacker to:
        * Steal session cookies and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
        * Redirect users to malicious websites.
        * Inject arbitrary HTML content into the page.
        * Perform actions on behalf of the user.
        * Potentially compromise the user's machine if browser vulnerabilities are present.
    * **Affected Component:** `lottie-web`'s SVG rendering functionality, specifically the part that processes and renders SVG elements within the animation data.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) that restricts the execution of inline scripts and the loading of resources from untrusted origins.
        * Sanitize animation data received from untrusted sources before rendering it with `lottie-web`. This might involve stripping out potentially malicious SVG elements or attributes.

## Threat: [Malicious Data URIs in Animation Data](./threats/malicious_data_uris_in_animation_data.md)

* **Description:** An attacker embeds malicious content within `data:` URIs referenced in the animation data. `lottie-web` might attempt to load and process these URIs, potentially leading to harmful outcomes. For example, a `data:text/html` URI could contain malicious HTML that gets rendered within the application's context.
    * **Impact:**
        * Similar to script injection, this can lead to XSS if the data URI contains executable content.
        * It could potentially trigger browser vulnerabilities if the data URI contains specific types of content.
    * **Affected Component:** `lottie-web`'s resource loading mechanism, specifically how it handles and processes `data:` URIs within the animation data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement a strict CSP that restricts the types of `data:` URIs that are allowed.
        * Sanitize or block `data:` URIs entirely if the application does not require them.

## Threat: [Exploiting Potential Bugs in `lottie-web`](./threats/exploiting_potential_bugs_in__lottie-web_.md)

* **Description:** Like any software library, `lottie-web` might contain undiscovered bugs or vulnerabilities. An attacker could craft specific animation data that triggers these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or crashes, and in some scenarios, potentially leading to more severe security issues.
    * **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from rendering issues to more significant security breaches.
    * **Affected Component:** Any module or function within the `lottie-web` library that contains the specific bug.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (potential for Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep `lottie-web` updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues in `lottie-web`.
