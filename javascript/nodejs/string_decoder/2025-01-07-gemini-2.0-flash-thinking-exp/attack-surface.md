# Attack Surface Analysis for nodejs/string_decoder

## Attack Surface: [Encoding Confusion and Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/encoding_confusion_and_manipulation.md)

* **Description:**  Exploiting discrepancies or vulnerabilities arising from the decoder being used with an incorrect or attacker-controlled encoding.
    * **How `string_decoder` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The `StringDecoder` relies on the provided encoding parameter. If an attacker can influence this parameter, they can force the decoder to interpret the same byte sequence in different ways.
    * **Example:** An application receives data with an encoding specified by the user. An attacker provides data encoded in one format but specifies a different encoding to the `StringDecoder`, leading to misinterpretation.
    * **Impact:**  Data corruption, information disclosure (interpreting data as a different type or content), potential for bypassing security checks that rely on specific encoding assumptions.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Enforce Encoding:**  Strictly define and control the encoding used for decoding. Avoid relying on user-provided or dynamically determined encodings unless absolutely necessary and rigorously validated.
        * **Content-Type Verification:** If dealing with network requests, verify the `Content-Type` header and ensure the encoding matches expectations.
        * **Security Audits:** Regularly audit the codebase to ensure encoding parameters are handled securely and are not vulnerable to manipulation.
