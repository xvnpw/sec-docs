# Threat Model Analysis for nodejs/string_decoder

## Threat: [Encoding Mismatch Exploitation](./threats/encoding_mismatch_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker might manipulate the encoding information provided to the `StringDecoder` constructor (or lack thereof if defaults are used) so that it doesn't match the actual encoding of the input byte stream. This leads to the `string_decoder` producing a string that is interpreted differently by downstream components. This could be achieved by manipulating HTTP headers, file metadata, or other sources of encoding information.

**Impact:** Data corruption, application logic errors, potential for security vulnerabilities such as cross-site scripting (XSS) if the incorrectly decoded string is used in web output, or command injection if used in system commands.

**Affected Component:** `StringDecoder` constructor and the overall module's decoding process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Explicitly specify the correct encoding when creating a `StringDecoder` instance.
* Validate and sanitize input data after decoding to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious characters based on potential encoding mismatches.
* Implement mechanisms to reliably determine the encoding of the input data and ensure consistency throughout the application.
