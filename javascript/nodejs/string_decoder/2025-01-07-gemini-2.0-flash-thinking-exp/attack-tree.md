## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Application via `string_decoder`](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_application_via__string_decoder_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success at this level means the attacker has achieved a significant breach by leveraging vulnerabilities related to the `string_decoder`.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Malformed Input Handling](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_malformed_input_handling.md)

*   This node represents a category of attacks where the attacker sends data that is not valid according to the expected character encoding. This can lead to various issues within the `string_decoder` and the application processing its output.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Cause Memory Corruption leading to Crash](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_cause_memory_corruption_leading_to_crash.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts specific sequences of malformed input that exploit vulnerabilities within the `string_decoder`'s code, leading to memory corruption. This corruption can destabilize the application and cause it to crash.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** High (Service interruption, potential security vulnerabilities if memory is exploitable)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Security Vulnerabilities in Downstream Processing](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_security_vulnerabilities_in_downstream_processing.md)

*   This node highlights the risk that even if the `string_decoder` itself doesn't have a direct vulnerability, its output (potentially incorrectly decoded due to malformed input) can be exploited by other parts of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Functions Assuming Correctly Decoded Input](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_functions_assuming_correctly_decoded_input.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends malformed input that is processed by the `string_decoder`. This malformed input results in an incorrectly decoded string. This incorrectly decoded string is then passed to other functions within the application that assume the input is valid and correctly formatted. This mismatch can be exploited to trigger vulnerabilities like SQL injection, command injection, or other logic flaws.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (Data breach, remote code execution)
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Bypass Security Checks Based on Partial Character Matching](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_bypass_security_checks_based_on_partial_character_matching.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker sends incomplete multi-byte sequences to the `string_decoder`. The application's security checks might rely on matching specific complete character sequences. By sending partial characters, the attacker can potentially bypass these checks if the decoder handles and outputs these partial characters in a way that doesn't trigger the initial security check but might form the complete, malicious character later in processing.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Circumventing security measures)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High
