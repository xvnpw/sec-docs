# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Ensuring correct and secure string processing within Node.js applications is critical for all applications that handle text data, which is a vast majority of Node.js applications. Incorrect string decoding can lead to data corruption, misinterpretation of data, and security vulnerabilities.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The `string_decoder` module itself processes byte streams and converts them to strings. The sensitivity of the data depends entirely on the context of the application using this module. It can range from publicly available text data to highly sensitive personal or financial information. If `string_decoder` fails to correctly decode sensitive data, it could lead to information disclosure or other security breaches in the application. The module itself does not inherently handle sensitive data, but its correct functioning is crucial for applications that do.
