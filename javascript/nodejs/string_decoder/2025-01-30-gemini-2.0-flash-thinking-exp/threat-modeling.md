# Threat Model Analysis for nodejs/string_decoder

## Threat: [Memory Resource Exhaustion due to Large Input](./threats/memory_resource_exhaustion_due_to_large_input.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends extremely large byte streams to be decoded. The `string_decoder` or the application processing the decoded output consumes excessive memory to handle this large input, leading to memory exhaustion and potential application crashes. The attacker aims to cause Denial of Service by exhausting application memory.
*   **Impact:** Application crashes, Denial of Service due to memory exhaustion, potential impact on other services on the same system.
*   **Affected Component:** `string_decoder.write()` method, internal buffer management, application's data handling logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Size Limits:** Implement strict limits on the size of input byte streams processed by `string_decoder`.
    *   **Streaming Processing:** Ensure proper streaming of data to avoid loading entire large inputs into memory at once. Utilize `string_decoder`'s streaming capabilities.
    *   **Memory Monitoring:** Monitor application memory usage to detect potential leaks or excessive allocation.
    *   **Resource Limits (Containerization):** In containerized environments, set memory limits for the application container.
