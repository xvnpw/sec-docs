## Attack Tree Path: [!!!1.1!!! Resource Exhaustion (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/!!!1_1!!!_resource_exhaustion__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents attacks that aim to deplete the application's resources (memory, CPU, etc.), leading to a Denial of Service. It's a critical node because resource exhaustion is a common and effective attack vector.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Overall category)
*   **Impact:** High (Can completely halt the application)
*   **Effort:** Varies (Depends on the specific sub-attack)
*   **Skill Level:** Varies (Depends on the specific sub-attack)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring resource usage)

    *   ***1.1.1*** **Uncontrolled Data Flow (High Volume) (High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends a large volume of data to the stream faster than the consumer can process it. This overwhelms the buffering mechanisms and leads to resource exhaustion. This is often due to a lack of proper backpressure implementation.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (Common if backpressure isn't handled)
        *   **Impact:** High (Can completely halt the application)
        *   **Effort:** Low (Easy to send a lot of data)
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring resource usage)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Implement proper flow control using `highWaterMark`.
            *   Use `readable.push(null)` when the consumer is overwhelmed.
            *   Monitor memory and CPU usage.
            *   Consider rate limiting at the input source.
            *   Use `pipeline` or `pipe` with error handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [!!!3.1!!! Prototype Pollution via `_transform` or `_construct` (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/!!!3_1!!!_prototype_pollution_via___transform__or___construct___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in how `Transform` or `Writable` streams handle input data, specifically targeting the `_transform` or `_construct` methods. Successful prototype pollution can lead to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Overall category)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full code execution)
*   **Effort:** Varies (Depends on the specific sub-attack)
*   **Skill Level:** Varies (Depends on the specific sub-attack)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires static analysis or specific testing)

    *   ***3.1.1*** **Injecting Malicious Properties (High-Risk Path)**
        *   **Description:** The attacker provides input data containing specially crafted objects with properties like `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`. If the `_transform` or `_construct` methods don't properly sanitize this input, these properties can pollute the object prototype, leading to unexpected behavior and, ultimately, arbitrary code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium (If input isn't sanitized)
        *   **Impact:** Very High (Full code execution)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard (Requires static analysis or specific testing)
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   *Crucially*, sanitize all input data before using it within `_transform` and `_construct`.
            *   Use safe object creation methods (e.g., `Object.create(null)`).
            *   Avoid using user-supplied data directly as object keys without validation.
            *   Use a linter that detects potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
