## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Input Rate Limiting on Streams](./mitigation_strategies/implement_input_rate_limiting_on_streams.md)

### 1. Implement Input Rate Limiting on Streams

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Rate Limiting on Streams
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify `readable-stream` Entry Points:** Pinpoint where `readable-stream` instances are created to consume external data (e.g., `http.IncomingMessage` which is a `readable-stream`, `net.Socket` streams, file streams created with `fs.createReadStream`).
    *   **Step 2: Apply Rate Limiting to `readable-stream` Consumption:** Implement logic to control the rate at which data is read from these `readable-stream` instances. This can be done by:
        *   Using libraries that provide stream-based rate limiting.
        *   Manually using `stream.pause()` and `stream.resume()` in conjunction with timers or counters to regulate data flow from the `readable-stream`.
    *   **Step 3: Handle Backpressure and Rate Limit Events:** Ensure proper handling of backpressure signals from consumers and implement error handling or appropriate responses when rate limits are exceeded on the `readable-stream`.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Malicious actors can overwhelm the application by sending data at an excessive rate through `readable-stream` entry points, leading to resource exhaustion.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Mitigation - High Reduction:** Directly reduces the risk of DoS attacks by controlling the data intake rate at the `readable-stream` level.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Rate limiting might be implemented at a higher level (e.g., API request level), but might not be specifically applied to the consumption of individual `readable-stream` instances.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Fine-grained rate limiting directly on `readable-stream` consumption might be missing, especially for streams handling large file uploads, WebSocket data, or other high-volume data sources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Maximum Stream Data Size Limits](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_maximum_stream_data_size_limits.md)

### 2. Enforce Maximum Stream Data Size Limits

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Maximum Stream Data Size Limits
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify `readable-stream` Data Sources:** Determine which `readable-stream` instances are used to receive data where size limits are necessary (e.g., file upload streams, request body streams).
    *   **Step 2: Implement Size Tracking for `readable-stream`:**  Integrate logic to track the amount of data read from the `readable-stream`. This can be achieved by:
        *   Using `Transform` streams in the pipeline to count bytes passing through.
        *   Manually tracking bytes read in `readable-stream` `data` event handlers.
    *   **Step 3: Terminate `readable-stream` on Limit Exceeded:** When the tracked data size exceeds the defined limit, immediately destroy the `readable-stream` using `stream.destroy()` and handle the error appropriately.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - High Severity:** Attackers can send excessively large data streams through `readable-stream` instances, exhausting server resources like memory or disk space.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion - High Severity:** Unbounded `readable-stream` data can lead to memory exhaustion and application instability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Mitigation - High Reduction:** Prevents DoS attacks by limiting the amount of data processed from a single `readable-stream`.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion Mitigation - High Reduction:** Protects against resource exhaustion caused by unbounded data intake via `readable-stream`.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Size limits might be implemented for file uploads using higher-level libraries, but direct size limiting on generic `readable-stream` instances might be absent.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit size limiting applied directly to `readable-stream` instances might be missing, especially for streams used in internal data processing pipelines or for handling request bodies in custom stream handling scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Employ Backpressure Mechanisms Correctly within `readable-stream` Pipelines](./mitigation_strategies/employ_backpressure_mechanisms_correctly_within__readable-stream__pipelines.md)

### 3. Employ Backpressure Mechanisms Correctly within `readable-stream` Pipelines

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Correct Backpressure Implementation in `readable-stream` Pipelines
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Understand `readable-stream` Backpressure:** Ensure developers understand how backpressure works within `readable-stream` pipelines, involving `readable.pipe()`, `writable.write()`, `readable.pause()`, `readable.resume()`, and the `drain` event.
    *   **Step 2: Implement Backpressure Handling in Custom Writable Streams:** When creating custom `Writable` streams that consume data from `readable-stream` instances, correctly handle backpressure by:
        *   Checking the return value of `writable.write()`.
        *   Pausing the upstream `readable-stream` using `readable.pause()` if `writable.write()` returns `false`.
        *   Resuming the `readable-stream` using `readable.resume()` when the `drain` event is emitted by the `Writable` stream.
    *   **Step 3: Verify Backpressure Propagation in `pipe()` Chains:** When using `stream.pipe()` to create pipelines, ensure backpressure is correctly propagated automatically. However, for complex pipelines, explicitly verify backpressure behavior.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium Severity:** Incorrect backpressure handling in `readable-stream` pipelines can lead to buffering and memory exhaustion if fast producers overwhelm slow consumers.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion - Medium Severity:**  Improper backpressure can cause excessive memory usage due to uncontrolled buffering within `readable-stream` pipelines.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Mitigation - Moderate Reduction:** Reduces DoS risk by preventing memory exhaustion due to stream processing imbalances within `readable-stream` pipelines.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion Mitigation - Moderate Reduction:** Prevents resource exhaustion by ensuring controlled data flow in `readable-stream` pipelines.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic backpressure handling might be implicitly present if relying solely on `stream.pipe()`.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit and robust backpressure handling might be missing in custom `Writable` streams or complex stream processing logic that deviates from simple `pipe()` chains. Developers might not fully understand or correctly implement manual backpressure control using `pause()` and `resume()`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Set Timeouts for `readable-stream` Operations](./mitigation_strategies/set_timeouts_for__readable-stream__operations.md)

### 4. Set Timeouts for `readable-stream` Operations

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** `readable-stream` Operation Timeouts
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify Potentially Hanging `readable-stream` Operations:** Determine `readable-stream` operations that could potentially hang indefinitely, such as `stream.pipe()`, `stream.read()`, waiting for `readable-stream` events (`data`, `end`, `error`).
    *   **Step 2: Implement Timeouts for `readable-stream` Operations:** Use `setTimeout` or stream-specific timeout mechanisms to set time limits for these operations. For example:
        *   Wrap `stream.pipe()` with a timeout.
        *   Implement timeouts around `stream.read()` calls.
        *   Use `Promise.race` with `setTimeout` for waiting on stream events.
    *   **Step 3: Handle `readable-stream` Timeout Events:** Implement error handling for timeout events. Destroy the `readable-stream` using `stream.destroy()`, release associated resources, and log the timeout.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium Severity:** Slow or unresponsive `readable-stream` sources can cause operations to hang, tying up resources and potentially leading to DoS.
    *   **Resource Leaks - Medium Severity:** Hanging `readable-stream` operations can lead to resource leaks if resources are not released when operations stall.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS Mitigation - Moderate Reduction:** Prevents DoS caused by hanging `readable-stream` operations.
    *   **Resource Leaks Mitigation - Moderate Reduction:** Reduces resource leaks associated with stalled `readable-stream` operations.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Timeouts might be implemented at a higher level (e.g., request timeouts), but not specifically for individual `readable-stream` operations within the application's stream processing logic.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Timeouts are likely missing for `stream.pipe()` operations, `stream.read()` calls, or event listeners on `readable-stream` instances, especially when dealing with external or unreliable stream sources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `readable-stream` Transformation Logic](./mitigation_strategies/secure__readable-stream__transformation_logic.md)

### 5. Secure `readable-stream` Transformation Logic

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure `readable-stream` Transformation Logic
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Review Custom `Transform` Stream Functions:** Carefully review the functions implemented within custom `Transform` streams that are part of `readable-stream` pipelines.
    *   **Step 2: Apply Secure Coding Practices in `Transform` Streams:**  Apply secure coding practices within `Transform` stream logic:
        *   Buffer Management: Ensure correct buffer handling within `_transform` and `_flush` methods to prevent overflows.
        *   Input Validation and Sanitization: If `Transform` streams process or manipulate data, implement input validation and sanitization within these transformations.
        *   Error Handling: Implement robust error handling within `Transform` streams to prevent unexpected errors from propagating and potentially disrupting stream pipelines.
    *   **Step 3: Unit Test `Transform` Stream Logic:** Thoroughly unit test custom `Transform` streams to ensure they function correctly and securely, especially regarding buffer handling and input processing.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Buffer Overflows - High Severity:** Vulnerable logic in `Transform` streams can lead to buffer overflows during data transformation within `readable-stream` pipelines.
    *   **Code Injection (via Format String Bugs) - High Severity:** Although less common in stream transformations, ensure no format string vulnerabilities are introduced in `Transform` stream logic.
    *   **Logic Errors Leading to Data Manipulation - Medium Severity:** Flaws in `Transform` stream logic can lead to unintended data corruption or manipulation within `readable-stream` pipelines.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Buffer Overflow Mitigation - High Reduction:** Prevents buffer overflow vulnerabilities in `readable-stream` transformations.
    *   **Code Injection Mitigation - High Reduction:** Prevents code injection vulnerabilities in `readable-stream` transformations.
    *   **Data Manipulation Mitigation - Moderate Reduction:** Reduces data manipulation risks due to logic errors in `readable-stream` transformations.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Secure coding practices are generally applied, but might not be specifically focused on the security aspects of custom `Transform` streams within `readable-stream` pipelines.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Specific security reviews and unit tests focused on the security of custom `Transform` streams might be lacking. Developers might not fully consider the security implications of transformation logic within `readable-stream` pipelines.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement `readable-stream` Resource Cleanup](./mitigation_strategies/implement__readable-stream__resource_cleanup.md)

### 6. Implement `readable-stream` Resource Cleanup

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** `readable-stream` Resource Cleanup
*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify `readable-stream` Resources:** Determine resources associated with `readable-stream` instances (e.g., file descriptors for file streams, network connections for socket streams, memory buffers used internally by streams).
    *   **Step 2: Handle `readable-stream` `error` and `close` Events:** Attach event listeners for `error` and `close` events on all `readable-stream` and `Writable` stream instances in your application.
    *   **Step 3: Release Resources in `readable-stream` Event Handlers:** Within `error` and `close` event handlers, implement logic to explicitly release resources associated with the `readable-stream`. This often involves calling `stream.destroy()` to ensure underlying resources are released.
    *   **Step 4: Test `readable-stream` Resource Cleanup:** Thoroughly test stream processing logic, including error scenarios and stream termination, to verify that `readable-stream` resources are properly cleaned up in all cases.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Resource Leaks - High Severity:** Failure to cleanup `readable-stream` resources can lead to file descriptor leaks, memory leaks, or unclosed network connections, eventually causing application crashes or instability.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Medium Severity:** Resource leaks from `readable-stream` instances can gradually exhaust server resources, leading to performance degradation and eventually DoS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Resource Leaks Mitigation - High Reduction:** Prevents resource leaks associated with `readable-stream` operations.
    *   **DoS Mitigation - Moderate Reduction:** Reduces DoS risk caused by resource exhaustion due to `readable-stream` leaks.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic resource cleanup might be implicitly handled by Node.js garbage collection for some resources, but explicit cleanup for `readable-stream` instances might be missing.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit `error` and `close` event handlers for `readable-stream` instances with resource cleanup logic might be missing. Developers might rely on garbage collection without ensuring timely and complete release of stream-related resources, especially file descriptors and network connections managed by `readable-stream`.
