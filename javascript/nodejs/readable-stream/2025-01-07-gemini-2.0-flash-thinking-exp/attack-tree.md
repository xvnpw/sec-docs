# Attack Tree Analysis for nodejs/readable-stream

Objective: Compromise application using `readable-stream` by exploiting its weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   Compromise Application via readable-stream [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   Inject Malicious Payload into Stream [CRITICAL NODE]
            *   Send crafted data that exploits parsing logic [CRITICAL NODE]
        *   Exploit Backpressure Mechanisms [CRITICAL NODE]
            *   Cause excessive backpressure leading to resource exhaustion
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via readable-stream [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_readable-stream__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. It signifies any successful exploitation of `readable-stream` that leads to a compromise of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_data_handling_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

This category of attacks focuses on manipulating the data flowing through the `readable-stream`. Attackers aim to inject malicious data or cause data processing errors that can lead to security breaches or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payload into Stream [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payload_into_stream__critical_node_.md)

Attackers attempt to insert harmful data into the stream that will be processed by the application. This could involve various techniques depending on the expected data format and the application's processing logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Send crafted data that exploits parsing logic [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/send_crafted_data_that_exploits_parsing_logic__critical_node_.md)

Attackers carefully design data inputs to trigger vulnerabilities in how the application parses the stream data. This could exploit flaws in libraries used for parsing (like JSON or XML parsers) or in the application's own data handling routines. Successful exploitation can lead to code execution, where the attacker can run arbitrary commands on the server, or data breaches, where sensitive information is exposed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Backpressure Mechanisms [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_backpressure_mechanisms__critical_node_.md)

This attack vector targets the mechanism by which `readable-stream` manages the flow of data between the producer and consumer. Attackers aim to disrupt this flow to cause resource exhaustion or other denial-of-service conditions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause excessive backpressure leading to resource exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/cause_excessive_backpressure_leading_to_resource_exhaustion.md)

Attackers send data to the stream at a rate faster than the application can process it. This overwhelms the consumer, leading to a buildup of data in buffers and ultimately consuming excessive memory or CPU resources. This can result in the application becoming unresponsive or crashing, causing a denial of service.
