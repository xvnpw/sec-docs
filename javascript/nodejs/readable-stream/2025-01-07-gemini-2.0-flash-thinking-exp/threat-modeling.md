# Threat Model Analysis for nodejs/readable-stream

## Threat: [Malicious Data Injection through Transformation Functions](./threats/malicious_data_injection_through_transformation_functions.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious data that, when processed by a custom transformation function within a `pipe` or `transform` stream (provided by `readable-stream`), leads to unintended code execution, data corruption, or other harmful actions. The attacker might control the data source feeding into the stream.

**Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, data corruption, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** `stream.pipe()` (from `readable-stream`), `Transform` stream implementations (extending `readable-stream`'s `Transform`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data within custom transformation functions before processing.
*   Avoid using `eval()` or similar dynamic code execution within transformation functions based on stream data.
*   Implement input validation at the earliest possible stage of the stream pipeline.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in Object Mode Streams](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_object_mode_streams.md)

**Description:** If a stream operating in object mode (using `readable-stream`'s object mode features) deserializes data, an attacker can inject malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, trigger code execution or other vulnerabilities. The attacker controls the data source.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data exfiltration, privilege escalation.

**Affected Component:** `Readable` stream implementations (extending `readable-stream`'s `Readable` in object mode).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources if possible.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use secure deserialization methods and validate the structure and content of deserialized objects.
*   Consider using alternative data formats that do not involve arbitrary code execution during deserialization.

## Threat: [File Descriptor Exhaustion](./threats/file_descriptor_exhaustion.md)

**Description:** If streams (potentially created using `readable-stream`'s API or extensions) are used to interact with files or network connections and are not closed correctly, it can lead to file descriptor exhaustion, preventing the application from opening new files or connections. An attacker might trigger actions that rapidly create and fail to close streams connected to resources.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application failure to access resources.

**Affected Component:** `Readable`, `Writable`, and `Duplex` stream instances (provided by `readable-stream` or its extensions) interacting with file or network resources.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure streams associated with file or network resources are always closed properly using `stream.destroy()` or by piping to a destination that handles closure.
*   Set appropriate limits on the number of open files or connections at the operating system level.
*   Implement resource pooling or connection reuse strategies where applicable.

## Threat: [Unhandled Errors Causing Crashes](./threats/unhandled_errors_causing_crashes.md)

**Description:** Errors emitted by streams (using `stream.emit('error', err)` from `readable-stream`'s API) are not caught and handled appropriately by the application. This can lead to uncaught exceptions and application crashes. An attacker might trigger error conditions within the stream processing pipeline.

**Impact:** Denial of service due to application crashes.

**Affected Component:** Error handling mechanisms within `Readable`, `Writable`, and `Transform` streams (provided by `readable-stream`), `stream.emit('error')` (from `readable-stream`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Attach error handlers to all relevant streams using `stream.on('error', ...)`.
*   Implement global error handling mechanisms to catch unhandled stream errors.
*   Log error details for debugging and monitoring.
