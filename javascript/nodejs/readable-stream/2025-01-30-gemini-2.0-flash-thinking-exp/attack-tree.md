## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Input Data Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_input_data_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target vulnerabilities arising from processing untrusted input data within the `readable-stream` pipeline. This path encompasses injecting malicious data, causing unexpected stream behavior, and exploiting buffer handling issues.

    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Malicious Data Injection**
        *   **Description:** Injecting crafted data into the stream to cause harm when processed by the application.
