# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Reliable and performant data streaming within Node.js applications. This is critical for various functionalities like web servers, file processing, data pipelines, and real-time applications built on Node.js.
 - Stability and compatibility of the Node.js platform itself, as `readable-stream` is a foundational component.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - The primary data to protect is the integrity and availability of the `readable-stream` library code itself.
 - Sensitivity of data processed by streams depends entirely on the applications using `readable-stream`. The library itself is data-agnostic. If applications use streams to process sensitive data (e.g., user data, financial data), then vulnerabilities in `readable-stream` could potentially expose this sensitive data.
 - Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) of stream data are all important depending on the application context. For core library itself, integrity and availability are paramount.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the specific scope of threat modeling exercise for `readable-stream`? Is it focused on specific attack vectors or general security posture?
 - Are there any specific compliance requirements or industry standards that `readable-stream` needs to adhere to?
 - What is the risk appetite of the Node.js project and the organization maintaining it regarding security vulnerabilities in core modules like `readable-stream`?

- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to maintain a secure, stable, and performant stream API for the Node.js ecosystem. Security is a high priority due to the widespread use of `readable-stream`.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: Existing security controls are in place within the Node.js project, including code review and CI testing. However, there is room for improvement in proactive security measures like fuzzing and dependency scanning.
 - DESIGN: The design is relatively simple from a container perspective, as `readable-stream` is a library. The focus is on the build and deployment process of Node.js and its core modules, and the security considerations within those processes. The deployment context is assumed to be varied, ranging from on-premise to cloud and containerized environments.
