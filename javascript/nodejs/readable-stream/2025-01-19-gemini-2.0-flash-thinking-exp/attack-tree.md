# Attack Tree Analysis for nodejs/readable-stream

Objective: To compromise the application utilizing `readable-stream` by causing Denial of Service (DoS) or data corruption through manipulation of the stream processing logic.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
* Compromise Application via readable-stream **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    * Cause Denial of Service (DoS) **[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * Resource Exhaustion **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * Exploit Backpressure Mechanism **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                * Send data faster than the consumer can process, leading to excessive buffering and memory consumption. **[HIGH-RISK LEAF]**
            * Infinite Data Emission **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                * Craft a malicious Readable stream that emits data indefinitely, overwhelming the consumer. **[HIGH-RISK LEAF]**
        * Unhandled Errors Leading to Process Termination **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * Inject Malicious Data Causing Parsing Errors **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                * Send data that, when processed by a downstream parser within the stream pipeline, throws an unhandled exception. **[HIGH-RISK LEAF]**
    * Cause Data Corruption or Manipulation **[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        * Inject Malicious Data into the Stream **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
            * Control the Source Readable Stream **[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                * If the application receives data from an external source represented as a Readable stream, compromise that source to inject malicious data. **[HIGH-RISK LEAF]**
            * Manipulate Data within a Transform Stream **[HIGH-RISK PATH]**
                * If using a custom Transform stream, exploit vulnerabilities in its transformation logic to alter data in transit.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via readable-stream [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_readable-stream__critical_node_.md)

This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker and encompasses all the high-risk paths detailed below. Successful compromise can lead to various negative consequences depending on the specific attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos___critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's goal of making the application unavailable to legitimate users. The high-risk paths leading to DoS involve either exhausting resources or causing the application to crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Backpressure Mechanism [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_backpressure_mechanism__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Send data faster than the consumer can process, leading to excessive buffering and memory consumption. [HIGH-RISK LEAF]](./attack_tree_paths/send_data_faster_than_the_consumer_can_process__leading_to_excessive_buffering_and_memory_consumptio_df8d9e35.md)

An attacker sends data at a rate exceeding the consumer's processing capacity. If the application doesn't handle backpressure correctly, this leads to excessive buffering, memory leaks, and eventually application crashes or freezes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Infinite Data Emission [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/infinite_data_emission__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Craft a malicious Readable stream that emits data indefinitely, overwhelming the consumer. [HIGH-RISK LEAF]](./attack_tree_paths/craft_a_malicious_readable_stream_that_emits_data_indefinitely__overwhelming_the_consumer___high-ris_f83a0c2b.md)

The attacker provides a source stream that continuously emits data without signaling the end. This can overwhelm the application's processing pipeline, leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unhandled Errors Leading to Process Termination [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/unhandled_errors_leading_to_process_termination__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data Causing Parsing Errors [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_causing_parsing_errors__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Send data that, when processed by a downstream parser within the stream pipeline, throws an unhandled exception. [HIGH-RISK LEAF]](./attack_tree_paths/send_data_that__when_processed_by_a_downstream_parser_within_the_stream_pipeline__throws_an_unhandle_54ce84e3.md)

The attacker injects malformed or unexpected data that causes errors during parsing by downstream components (e.g., JSON.parse). If these errors are not caught and handled properly, they can lead to unhandled exceptions and application crashes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Data Corruption or Manipulation [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_data_corruption_or_manipulation__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's goal of altering or damaging the data processed by the application. This can lead to incorrect application behavior, security vulnerabilities, or data integrity issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into the Stream [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_the_stream__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Control the Source Readable Stream [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/control_the_source_readable_stream__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [If the application receives data from an external source represented as a Readable stream, compromise that source to inject malicious data. [HIGH-RISK LEAF]](./attack_tree_paths/if_the_application_receives_data_from_an_external_source_represented_as_a_readable_stream__compromis_4f9c97e5.md)

If the attacker can compromise the source of the data stream (e.g., a network socket, a file), they can inject arbitrary malicious data into the application's processing pipeline. This allows for direct manipulation of the data being processed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data within a Transform Stream [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_within_a_transform_stream__high-risk_path_.md)

If the application uses custom `Transform` streams to modify data, vulnerabilities in the transformation logic can be exploited to alter the data as it flows through the stream. This could involve injecting malicious content, modifying sensitive information, or corrupting data structures.
