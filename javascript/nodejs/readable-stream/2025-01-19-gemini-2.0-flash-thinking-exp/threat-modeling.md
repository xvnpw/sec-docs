# Threat Model Analysis for nodejs/readable-stream

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Stream Exploiting Buffer Management](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_large_stream_exploiting_buffer_management.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large volume of data through a readable stream, exploiting potential inefficiencies or vulnerabilities in `readable-stream`'s internal buffer management. This could lead to excessive memory allocation within the `readable-stream` implementation itself, causing the Node.js process to crash due to out-of-memory errors or become unresponsive due to excessive garbage collection. The attacker doesn't necessarily need to overwhelm the application's processing logic, but rather the stream library's internal handling of large amounts of data.
*   **Impact:** Node.js process crash, application downtime, service disruption for all users.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `Readable` class: Specifically the internal buffer management within the `Readable` stream implementation.
    *   Potentially the `push()` method if vulnerabilities exist in how it handles large data chunks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure you are using the latest stable version of `readable-stream` as updates may contain fixes for buffer management issues.
    *   If possible, implement safeguards at the network level to limit the size of incoming data streams.
    *   Consider using alternative streaming libraries or techniques if `readable-stream`'s buffer management proves to be a bottleneck or vulnerability.
    *   Monitor the memory usage of the Node.js process and implement alerts for unusual spikes.

## Threat: [Stream Hijacking/Interruption via Malicious Control Signals](./threats/stream_hijackinginterruption_via_malicious_control_signals.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker controlling the source of a readable stream sends malicious or unexpected control signals (e.g., premature `close` or `error` events) that exploit vulnerabilities in how `readable-stream` handles these signals. This could cause the stream to terminate unexpectedly, leading to incomplete data processing or application errors. The vulnerability lies in the library's handling of these control signals initiated from an untrusted source.
*   **Impact:** Incomplete data processing, application errors, potential for denial of service if critical operations are interrupted.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `Readable` class: Specifically the event handling logic for `close` and `error` events.
    *   Internal state management within the `Readable` stream related to stream termination.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure you are using the latest stable version of `readable-stream` as updates may contain fixes for control signal handling vulnerabilities.
    *   If the stream source is untrusted, implement checks or validation on the control signals received (though this might be difficult to implement reliably).
    *   Design application logic to be resilient to unexpected stream terminations and handle potential data inconsistencies.
    *   Consider using alternative mechanisms for signaling the end of a stream if the standard `close` event is susceptible to manipulation.
