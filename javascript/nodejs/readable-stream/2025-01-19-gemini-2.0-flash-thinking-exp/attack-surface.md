# Attack Surface Analysis for nodejs/readable-stream

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Injection via `push()` or `unshift()`](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_injection_via__push____or__unshift___.md)

* **Description:** An attacker can influence the data pushed into a Readable stream, potentially injecting malicious content.
    * **How `readable-stream` Contributes:** The `push()` and `unshift()` methods, core functionalities of `readable-stream`, are the direct interfaces for feeding data into the stream. If the data source is compromised or lacks proper sanitization before being passed to these methods, malicious injection becomes possible.
    * **Example:** A custom Readable stream fetches data from an external, untrusted source. This data, without validation, is then pushed into the stream using `push()`. If the external source is malicious, it could inject JavaScript code that gets executed when the stream is processed on the client-side in a web application.
    * **Impact:** Code execution, cross-site scripting (XSS) if the data is used in a web context, data corruption, or denial of service depending on the nature of the injected data and how it's processed downstream.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement rigorous validation and sanitization of all data *before* it is passed to the `push()` or `unshift()` methods.
        * **Secure Data Sources:** Ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of the sources providing data to the stream. Treat external data sources as potentially hostile.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** For web applications, implement a strong Content Security Policy to mitigate the impact of injected scripts.
        * **Secure Output Handling:** Sanitize data again before it is consumed or displayed to prevent further exploitation.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Custom `_read()` Implementation](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_custom___read____implementation.md)

* **Description:** Security flaws within a developer's custom `_read()` method, which is a core requirement for implementing a custom Readable stream, can be exploited.
    * **How `readable-stream` Contributes:** `readable-stream` mandates the implementation of the `_read()` method for creating custom Readable sources. This makes the security of the `_read()` implementation directly tied to the security of any stream built using `readable-stream`'s custom interface.
    * **Example:** A custom `_read()` method fetches data from a database using user-supplied input without proper sanitization. This could lead to SQL injection vulnerabilities, allowing an attacker to read or modify sensitive data in the database.
    * **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, data manipulation, and potentially remote code execution depending on the nature of the vulnerability within the `_read()` implementation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Secure Coding Practices:** Adhere to secure coding principles when implementing the `_read()` method, including input validation, output encoding, and avoiding known vulnerable patterns.
        * **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** When interacting with databases, always use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the code within the `_read()` method operates with the minimum necessary privileges to access resources.
        * **Regular Security Audits and Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews of custom stream implementations to identify potential vulnerabilities.
