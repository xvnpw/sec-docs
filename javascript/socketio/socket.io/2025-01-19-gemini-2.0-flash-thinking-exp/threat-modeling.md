# Threat Model Analysis for socketio/socket.io

## Threat: [Malicious Event Payloads](./threats/malicious_event_payloads.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted event payloads with malicious data through a Socket.IO connection. This could involve injecting script tags intended for other clients or attempting to exploit server-side vulnerabilities by sending unexpected data types or formats.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** If the client-side application renders the malicious payload received via a Socket.IO event without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS attacks, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
        *   **Server-Side Code Injection:** If the server-side application processes the malicious payload received via a Socket.IO event without proper validation and uses it in dynamic code execution (e.g., `eval()`), it could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Sending excessively large or complex payloads through Socket.IO events could overwhelm the server's processing capabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `socket.on()` (server-side): The function used to listen for and handle incoming Socket.IO events.
        *   `socket.emit()` (client-side and server-side): The function used to send Socket.IO events.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Input Validation:** Implement robust server-side input validation and sanitization for all data received through `socket.on()` event handlers. Use schema validation libraries to enforce expected data structures.
        *   **Client-Side Output Encoding:** Sanitize data received through Socket.IO events before rendering it on the client-side to prevent XSS. Use appropriate encoding techniques for the rendering context.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on incoming Socket.IO events to prevent attackers from overwhelming the server with malicious payloads.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Namespace/Room Access](./threats/unauthorized_namespaceroom_access.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to join Socket.IO namespaces or rooms they are not authorized to access. This could be done by manipulating client-side code or by crafting specific join requests to the Socket.IO server.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** The attacker could eavesdrop on communications within the unauthorized Socket.IO namespace or room, gaining access to sensitive information exchanged via Socket.IO.
        *   **Unauthorized Actions:** The attacker might be able to send messages or trigger actions within the unauthorized Socket.IO context, potentially disrupting the application's functionality or affecting other users within that namespace or room.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `io.of()` (server-side): Used to create and manage Socket.IO namespaces.
        *   `socket.join()` (server-side and client-side): Used to join Socket.IO rooms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Authorization Checks:** Implement strict server-side authorization checks within the `connection` event handler for namespaces and before allowing clients to join specific rooms using `socket.join()`. Verify user identity and permissions based on your application's logic.
        *   **Avoid Relying on Client-Side Logic for Authorization:** Do not solely rely on client-side code to enforce access controls for Socket.IO namespaces or rooms, as this can be easily bypassed.

## Threat: [Connection Exhaustion (DoS)](./threats/connection_exhaustion__dos_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker opens a large number of Socket.IO connections to the server, exceeding its capacity and preventing legitimate users from connecting or using the application's real-time features provided by Socket.IO.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Denial of Service:** The application's real-time features become unavailable to legitimate users due to the overloaded Socket.IO server.
        *   **Resource Exhaustion:** The server's resources (memory, CPU, file descriptors) are exhausted by managing the excessive number of Socket.IO connections.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `io.on('connection')` (server-side): The event handler in Socket.IO for new incoming connections.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Connection Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on incoming Socket.IO connection requests to prevent a single attacker from opening too many connections in a short period.
        *   **Maximum Connection Limits:** Configure maximum connection limits on the Socket.IO server to prevent resource exhaustion.
        *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Monitor server resources and set up alerts to detect and respond to potential connection exhaustion attacks targeting the Socket.IO server.

## Threat: [Client-Side Secret Exposure](./threats/client-side_secret_exposure.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as authentication tokens or API keys used for establishing or maintaining Socket.IO connections, is exposed in the client-side code or local storage.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Account Takeover:** Exposed authentication tokens used with Socket.IO could allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users and interact with the Socket.IO server on their behalf.
        *   **Unauthorized Access to Resources:** Exposed API keys used in conjunction with Socket.IO could grant attackers unauthorized access to backend services or data that the Socket.IO application interacts with.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Client-side JavaScript code where Socket.IO connection logic and potentially authentication details are handled.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Storing Secrets Directly in Client-Side Code:** Do not embed sensitive information directly in the client-side JavaScript code used for Socket.IO connections.
        *   **Use Secure Token Handling:** Implement secure token handling mechanisms for Socket.IO authentication, such as using short-lived tokens obtained through a secure authentication flow.
        *   **HTTPS Only:** Ensure all communication, including the initial Socket.IO handshake, is done over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping on sensitive information.

## Threat: [Server-Side Vulnerabilities in Event Handlers](./threats/server-side_vulnerabilities_in_event_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the server-side code that handles specific Socket.IO events. This could include issues like SQL injection if data received from Socket.IO events is used in database queries without proper sanitization, or command injection if event data is used in system commands.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could potentially execute arbitrary code on the server by sending crafted payloads through Socket.IO events that exploit vulnerabilities in the event handlers.
        *   **Data Breach:** Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in the application's database by exploiting vulnerabilities in Socket.IO event handlers that interact with the database.
        *   **System Compromise:** In severe cases, attackers could compromise the entire server by exploiting vulnerabilities in Socket.IO event handlers that allow for command execution.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Specific event handlers defined using `socket.on()` on the server-side that process data received through Socket.IO.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when implementing Socket.IO event handlers, including thorough input validation, output encoding, and avoiding dynamic code execution with untrusted data received through Socket.IO events.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases within Socket.IO event handlers to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Avoid Executing System Commands with Untrusted Data:** Carefully sanitize any data received through Socket.IO events before using it in system commands to prevent command injection.
        *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on the security of your Socket.IO event handlers and how they process incoming data.
