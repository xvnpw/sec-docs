## Attack Tree Path: [Connection Hijacking/Spoofing](./attack_tree_paths/connection_hijackingspoofing.md)

An attacker aims to impersonate a legitimate client by obtaining or guessing valid session identifiers. This could be achieved through brute-forcing, social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities in session management. If successful, the attacker can perform actions as the compromised user.
    * **Critical Node:** Exploiting weak session management is a key enabler for this path. Weak session IDs, predictable generation, or insecure storage make it easier for attackers to compromise sessions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Event Injection leading to privileged actions](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_event_injection_leading_to_privileged_actions.md)

An attacker crafts malicious Socket.IO events with specific names and payloads designed to trigger privileged actions on the server. This relies on the server-side application not properly validating the event data and the user's authorization to perform the action.
    * **Critical Node:** Exploiting the lack of input validation on event data is crucial here. Without proper validation, the server blindly processes potentially harmful data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Socket.IO](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_socket_io.md)

An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into Socket.IO messages. If the client-side application doesn't properly encode the received data before rendering it, the injected script will execute in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
    * **Critical Node:** Exploiting the lack of output encoding on client-side rendering is the direct cause of this vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Injection via Socket.IO leading to RCE](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_injection_via_socket_io_leading_to_rce.md)

An attacker sends malicious data through Socket.IO messages that are processed by the server-side application without proper sanitization. This can lead to the execution of arbitrary code on the server, granting the attacker full control.
    * **Critical Node:** Exploiting the lack of sanitization in server-side event handlers is the critical vulnerability that allows for code injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Leakage via Socket.IO](./attack_tree_paths/data_leakage_via_socket_io.md)

An attacker intercepts or gains unauthorized access to sensitive data transmitted through Socket.IO. This can occur if sensitive data is not encrypted (even over HTTPS) or if the application broadcasts sensitive information too broadly.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass.md)

An attacker circumvents the authentication process to access protected Socket.IO functionality without proper credentials. This can be due to missing authentication checks or inconsistencies between web application and Socket.IO authentication.
        * **Critical Node:** Exploiting missing or flawed authentication mechanisms within Socket.IO event handlers directly allows bypassing authentication.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authorization_bypass.md)

An attacker performs actions via Socket.IO that they are not authorized to perform. This happens when the server-side application doesn't properly check the user's permissions before executing actions.
        * **Critical Node:** Exploiting the lack of proper authorization checks in Socket.IO event handlers allows attackers to perform unauthorized actions.
    * **Manipulate user roles or permissions via Socket.IO messages:**  An attacker sends crafted messages to directly alter user roles or permissions, granting themselves or others elevated privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Room Takeover](./attack_tree_paths/room_takeover.md)

An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the application's room management logic to gain control over a specific communication room. This allows them to eavesdrop, inject messages, or disrupt communication within that room.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Errors in Event Handlers](./attack_tree_paths/logic_errors_in_event_handlers.md)

An attacker identifies and exploits flaws in the server-side event handling logic. By sending specific sequences of events or data, they can trigger unintended application behavior, bypass security checks, or cause other vulnerabilities to manifest.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Dependencies (Indirect)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_dependencies__indirect_.md)

An attacker exploits known security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the server-side application in conjunction with Socket.IO. While not a direct Socket.IO vulnerability, it's a significant risk when using external dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit weak session management](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_session_management.md)

A fundamental flaw in how user sessions are handled, making it easier for attackers to impersonate legitimate users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit lack of input validation on event data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_input_validation_on_event_data.md)

A core security principle violation, allowing attackers to send malicious data that the server processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit lack of output encoding on client-side rendering of Socket.IO data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_output_encoding_on_client-side_rendering_of_socket_io_data.md)

The direct cause of XSS vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit lack of sanitization in server-side event handlers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_sanitization_in_server-side_event_handlers.md)

A critical flaw that can lead to server-side injection and remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit missing or flawed authentication mechanisms within Socket.IO event handlers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_missing_or_flawed_authentication_mechanisms_within_socket_io_event_handlers.md)

A direct path to bypassing authentication and gaining unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit lack of proper authorization checks in Socket.IO event handlers](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_lack_of_proper_authorization_checks_in_socket_io_event_handlers.md)

Allows attackers to perform actions they are not permitted to.
