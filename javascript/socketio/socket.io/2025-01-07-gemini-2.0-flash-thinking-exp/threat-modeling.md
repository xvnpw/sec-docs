# Threat Model Analysis for socketio/socket.io

## Threat: [Unauthorized Connection](./threats/unauthorized_connection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker attempts to establish a Socket.IO connection to the server without proper authentication or authorization, exploiting potential weaknesses in Socket.IO's connection handling or the application's integration with it.
    *   **Impact:** Server resource exhaustion leading to Denial of Service (DoS), potential access to sensitive data if authorization is bypassed within the Socket.IO context, and the ability to send unauthorized messages through the Socket.IO channel.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Module: `socket.io` server instance
        *   Function: `io.on('connection', ...)` event handler (the core of Socket.IO's connection management)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a robust authentication mechanism within the `connection` event handler, leveraging Socket.IO's connection lifecycle.
        *   Verify user credentials before allowing access to specific namespaces or rooms, using Socket.IO's room and namespace features for access control.
        *   Implement rate limiting on connection attempts directly at the Socket.IO level or using middleware that integrates with Socket.IO.

## Threat: [Malicious Message Injection](./threats/malicious_message_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted messages through the Socket.IO connection with the intention of causing harm by exploiting how Socket.IO handles and routes messages. This could involve sending data that, if not properly handled by the application, leads to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  While the direct impact often depends on the application's handling, the threat originates from the ability to send arbitrary messages through Socket.IO. This can lead to server-side issues if the application logic processing these messages is flawed.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Module: `socket.io` server and client instances (as they are responsible for message transmission and reception)
        *   Function: `socket.on('message', ...)` or custom event handlers (how Socket.IO delivers messages)
        *   Function: `socket.emit(...)` (how messages are sent via Socket.IO)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on the server-side for all incoming messages received through Socket.IO event handlers.
        *   Avoid directly interpreting message content as commands without thorough validation, especially within Socket.IO event handlers.
        *   Focus on secure coding practices within the application logic that processes Socket.IO messages.

## Threat: [Connection Hijacking](./threats/connection_hijacking.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts and takes over an existing legitimate Socket.IO connection by exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying transport or weaknesses in how Socket.IO manages connections.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can impersonate the legitimate user within the Socket.IO communication, send malicious messages on their behalf, and potentially gain access to sensitive information being exchanged through the Socket.IO channel.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Module: Underlying transport used by Socket.IO (WebSocket, HTTP long-polling) - While not strictly Socket.IO code, it's integral to its operation.
        *   Module: `socket.io` connection management (how Socket.IO maintains session state)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use secure WebSocket connections (WSS), which is a configuration aspect affecting Socket.IO's security.
        *   Enforce HTTPS for the initial handshake, which is crucial for establishing secure Socket.IO connections.
        *   Implement mechanisms to detect and terminate suspicious connection activity at the Socket.IO level or within the application logic managing Socket.IO sessions.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Connection Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_connection_flooding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker floods the Socket.IO server with a large number of connection requests, overwhelming its resources and preventing legitimate users from connecting or communicating via Socket.IO.
    *   **Impact:** The Socket.IO server becomes unresponsive, disrupting the real-time functionality of the application and potentially causing broader application issues.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Module: `socket.io` server instance (as it handles connection requests)
        *   Function: `io.on('connection', ...)` event handler (the entry point for new Socket.IO connections)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement rate limiting on connection attempts directly within the Socket.IO setup or using middleware that integrates with Socket.IO's connection lifecycle.
        *   Configure server resources adequately to handle expected peak loads for Socket.IO connections.
        *   Implement connection timeouts within the Socket.IO configuration to prevent indefinite resource consumption.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure through Message Interception](./threats/information_disclosure_through_message_interception.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker intercepts Socket.IO messages in transit, potentially revealing sensitive data being exchanged between the client and server via the Socket.IO channel. This is a direct consequence of not using secure connections with Socket.IO.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential information transmitted through Socket.IO, such as user-specific data or application-specific secrets.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Module: Underlying transport used by Socket.IO (WebSocket, HTTP long-polling) - The security of the transport directly impacts Socket.IO's security.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use secure WebSocket connections (WSS) when configuring the Socket.IO server.
        *   Avoid transmitting highly sensitive information directly through unencrypted Socket.IO messages. Consider encryption at the application layer even with WSS.
