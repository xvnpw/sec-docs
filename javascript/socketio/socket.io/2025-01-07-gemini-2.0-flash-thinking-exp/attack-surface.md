# Attack Surface Analysis for socketio/socket.io

## Attack Surface: [Unvalidated Input in Event Handlers](./attack_surfaces/unvalidated_input_in_event_handlers.md)

**Description:** Server-side event handlers process data received from clients. If this data is not properly validated and sanitized, it can lead to various vulnerabilities.

**How Socket.IO Contributes:** Socket.IO facilitates real-time communication, making it easy for clients to send arbitrary data through defined events. The server-side logic handling these events is directly exposed to client input.

**Example:** A chat application's `sendMessage` event handler directly uses the received message in a database query without sanitization, leading to potential NoSQL injection.

**Impact:** Server-side command injection, database manipulation, cross-site scripting (if data is echoed back to other clients), denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement server-side input validation and sanitization for all data received from clients through Socket.IO events.
*   Use parameterized queries or ORM features to prevent injection vulnerabilities when interacting with databases.
*   Apply context-aware output encoding when displaying user-generated content to prevent XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Message Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/message_injectionmanipulation.md)

**Description:** Malicious clients can send crafted or unexpected messages to the server, potentially triggering unintended actions or exploiting vulnerabilities in message processing logic.

**How Socket.IO Contributes:** Socket.IO allows clients to emit custom events with arbitrary data. If the server doesn't expect or properly handle certain message structures or content, it can be vulnerable.

**Example:** A client sends a specially crafted message to an event handler that manages user roles, bypassing authorization checks and granting themselves admin privileges.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, data manipulation, privilege escalation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define and enforce expected message formats and data types for each event.
*   Implement robust server-side logic to validate the structure and content of incoming messages.
*   Use schema validation libraries to ensure messages adhere to predefined structures.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Description:** Weak or missing authentication and authorization mechanisms for Socket.IO connections and event handlers can allow unauthorized access and actions.

**How Socket.IO Contributes:** Socket.IO requires developers to implement their own authentication and authorization logic. Mistakes in this implementation directly expose the application.

**Example:** An application relies on a client-provided token for authentication without proper server-side verification, allowing an attacker to forge tokens and impersonate users.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access, data breaches, manipulation of user accounts, privilege escalation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust server-side authentication mechanisms (e.g., using JWTs, session cookies).
*   Verify user identity and permissions before processing any client-initiated events.
*   Avoid relying solely on client-side information for authentication or authorization decisions.
*   Regularly review and audit authentication and authorization logic.
