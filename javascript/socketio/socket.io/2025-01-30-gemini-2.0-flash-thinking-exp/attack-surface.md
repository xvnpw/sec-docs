# Attack Surface Analysis for socketio/socket.io

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) during Connection Establishment](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__during_connection_establishment.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers flood the Socket.IO server with connection requests, overwhelming resources and causing service disruption.
*   **Socket.IO Contribution:** Socket.IO manages persistent connections, making it a target for connection-based DoS attacks. The handshake process can be resource-intensive if not properly managed.
*   **Example:** A botnet sends a massive number of connection requests to the Socket.IO server, exhausting server resources and preventing legitimate users from connecting.
*   **Impact:** Service unavailability, degraded performance for legitimate users.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement connection rate limiting at the application or infrastructure level.
    *   Set connection limits per client IP address.
    *   Optimize the handshake process to minimize resource consumption.
    *   Utilize DDoS protection services.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Message Broadcasting](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_message_broadcasting.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious users inject scripts into messages sent via Socket.IO, which are then broadcasted to other connected clients and executed in their browsers.
*   **Socket.IO Contribution:** Socket.IO's real-time broadcasting functionality can propagate XSS payloads to multiple users simultaneously if messages are not properly sanitized.
*   **Example:** A user sends a chat message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. The server broadcasts this message, and when other clients receive it, the script executes in their browsers.
*   **Impact:** Client-side code execution, session hijacking, defacement, data theft, redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate all user input on the server before broadcasting messages.
    *   **Client-Side Output Encoding:** Encode data received from Socket.IO events before displaying it in the client-side DOM.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).

## Attack Surface: [Injection Vulnerabilities in Message Handlers (Server-Side)](./attack_surfaces/injection_vulnerabilities_in_message_handlers__server-side_.md)

*   **Description:** Server-side code processing Socket.IO messages is vulnerable to injection attacks (e.g., command injection, SQL injection, NoSQL injection) if user-provided data is not properly validated and sanitized.
*   **Socket.IO Contribution:** Socket.IO events trigger server-side handlers that process data received from clients. If these handlers are not securely coded, they can become injection points.
*   **Example:** A Socket.IO event handler constructs a database query using unsanitized data from a message, leading to SQL injection when a malicious message is sent.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized data modification, server compromise, remote code execution (in severe cases like command injection).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user input received via Socket.IO messages on the server-side.
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant the application minimal necessary permissions.
    *   Avoid constructing system commands directly from user input.

## Attack Surface: [Authorization and Authentication Bypass in Socket.IO Events](./attack_surfaces/authorization_and_authentication_bypass_in_socket_io_events.md)

*   **Description:** Lack of proper authentication and authorization checks for Socket.IO events allows attackers to bypass access controls and perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Socket.IO Contribution:** Socket.IO applications rely on developers to implement authorization logic for events. Weak or missing authorization checks can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker calls a Socket.IO event intended for administrators without proper authentication, gaining access to administrative functionalities.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to features and data, privilege escalation, data manipulation, disruption of application functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Authentication:** Authenticate users connecting via Socket.IO.
    *   **Implement Authorization:** Enforce authorization checks for all sensitive Socket.IO events.
    *   Use role-based access control (RBAC) or attribute-based access control (ABAC).
    *   Validate user roles and permissions on the server-side for each Socket.IO event.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Socket.IO Library and Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_socket_io_library_and_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Known security vulnerabilities in the Socket.IO library itself or its dependencies (e.g., `engine.io`) can be exploited by attackers.
*   **Socket.IO Contribution:** Using Socket.IO introduces a dependency on the library and its ecosystem, which may contain vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A publicly disclosed CVE in a specific version of Socket.IO allows remote code execution. An attacker exploits this vulnerability to compromise the server.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, remote code execution, data breach, denial of service, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Socket.IO Updated:** Regularly update Socket.IO and its dependencies.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and vulnerability databases.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use automated vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   Implement a robust dependency management process.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks during Handshake (if not using TLS/HTTPS)](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_during_handshake__if_not_using_tlshttps_.md)

*   **Description:** If Socket.IO communication is not encrypted using HTTPS/WSS, attackers can intercept and potentially manipulate the initial handshake and subsequent data exchange.
*   **Socket.IO Contribution:** Socket.IO can be configured to run over HTTP or HTTPS. If HTTP is used, it becomes vulnerable to MitM attacks.
*   **Example:** An attacker on the network intercepts the Socket.IO handshake, eavesdrops on messages, or injects malicious data into the communication stream.
*   **Impact:** Eavesdropping, data interception, data manipulation, session hijacking, injection of malicious content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always Use HTTPS/WSS:** Configure Socket.IO to use HTTPS and WSS in production.
    *   **Enforce TLS/SSL:** Ensure that TLS/SSL is properly configured.
    *   Educate users to only connect over secure networks (HTTPS).

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side XSS Vulnerabilities in Socket.IO Event Handlers](./attack_surfaces/client-side_xss_vulnerabilities_in_socket_io_event_handlers.md)

*   **Description:** Client-side JavaScript code that handles Socket.IO events might be vulnerable to XSS if it improperly handles data received from the server.
*   **Socket.IO Contribution:** Client-side event handlers process data pushed from the server via Socket.IO. If this data is rendered into the DOM without proper encoding, it can lead to XSS.
*   **Example:** Client-side JavaScript directly uses `innerHTML` to display a message received from a Socket.IO event, without encoding HTML entities.
*   **Impact:** Client-side code execution, session hijacking, defacement, data theft, redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Client-Side Output Encoding:** Encode data received from Socket.IO events before rendering it in the client-side DOM.
    *   **Avoid `innerHTML` with User Data:** Avoid using `innerHTML` to render user-provided data directly.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement CSP.
