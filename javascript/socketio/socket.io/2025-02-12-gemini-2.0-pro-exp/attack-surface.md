# Attack Surface Analysis for socketio/socket.io

## Attack Surface: [1. Unauthorized Connection & Event Access](./attack_surfaces/1__unauthorized_connection_&_event_access.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers connect to the Socket.IO server without proper authentication or authorization, gaining access to events and data they shouldn't see.
*   **How Socket.IO Contributes:** Socket.IO's event-driven nature *requires* careful management of who can connect and which events they can receive.  Socket.IO's handshake process and event emission/reception mechanisms are the direct points of vulnerability if authentication/authorization is weak or misplaced.
*   **Example:** An attacker connects to the server without providing valid credentials and listens to a "private-chat" namespace, intercepting messages.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized actions, privacy violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement authentication *during* the Socket.IO handshake (e.g., using `socket.io-auth` or custom middleware). Validate credentials (JWTs, session tokens) *before* accepting the connection (within the handshake). Use Socket.IO's namespaces and rooms to restrict access based on user roles, *enforcing these restrictions on the server-side*. Reject unauthenticated connections.

## Attack Surface: [2. Event Spoofing/Injection](./attack_surfaces/2__event_spoofinginjection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers send crafted events that mimic legitimate user actions or inject malicious data, potentially triggering unintended server-side behavior.
*   **How Socket.IO Contributes:** Socket.IO's core functionality is *based on* sending and receiving events.  The `socket.emit` and event listener mechanisms are the direct attack vectors.  The server's handling of these Socket.IO events is the critical point.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a forged "transferFunds" event with their account as the recipient, bypassing client-side validation, directly through the Socket.IO connection.
*   **Impact:** Data corruption, unauthorized transactions, system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement strict server-side input validation for *all* incoming Socket.IO events. Validate data types, lengths, and formats *specifically within the event handlers*. Sanitize data before use. Associate events with authenticated user IDs (obtained from the authenticated Socket.IO connection). Avoid using `socket.emit` to send sensitive data directly to other clients without authorization checks *within the Socket.IO logic*.

## Attack Surface: [3. Event Eavesdropping](./attack_surfaces/3__event_eavesdropping.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers gain access to Socket.IO rooms or namespaces they are not authorized to join, allowing them to listen to sensitive data.
*   **How Socket.IO Contributes:** Socket.IO's room and namespace features are *directly* involved.  The vulnerability lies in the server-side logic that controls access to these Socket.IO constructs.
*   **Example:** An attacker guesses a Socket.IO room name used for private communication and joins it (using `socket.join`), intercepting messages.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, privacy violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:** Implement strict authorization checks *before* allowing a client to join a Socket.IO room or subscribe to a Socket.IO namespace (using `socket.join` and related methods). Use dynamically generated room names (e.g., based on user/session IDs) within the Socket.IO server logic. Ensure sensitive data is only sent to authorized clients *within the context of Socket.IO rooms and namespaces*.

## Attack Surface: [4.  Broadcasting Sensitive Information (Unintentional Disclosure)](./attack_surfaces/4___broadcasting_sensitive_information__unintentional_disclosure_.md)

*   **Description:**  Using `io.emit` (broadcast to all connected Socket.IO clients) without proper consideration can expose sensitive data to unauthorized users.
*   **How Socket.IO Contributes:**  Socket.IO's `io.emit` function is the *direct* mechanism of this vulnerability.  The misuse of this *specific Socket.IO function* is the core issue.
*   **Example:**  A developer uses `io.emit` to send a "userUpdated" event containing the user's full profile data, including their password hash (a very bad practice, but illustrative).
*   **Impact:**  Data breaches, privacy violations.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Avoid using `io.emit` for sensitive data. Use `socket.to(roomName).emit` or `socket.emit` (to send only to the current socket) instead. Carefully design the Socket.IO event architecture to ensure data is only sent to intended recipients, using Socket.IO's room and namespace features appropriately.
