# Threat Model Analysis for socketio/socket.io

## Threat: [Client Impersonation](./threats/client_impersonation.md)

*   **Threat:** Client Impersonation

    *   **Description:** An attacker successfully impersonates another connected client, sending messages and performing actions *as if* they were that user. This leverages weaknesses in how the application uses Socket.IO for user identification and authorization *within the Socket.IO context*. The attacker might exploit predictable or improperly validated session identifiers *associated with* the Socket.IO connection.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to data and functionality, potentially performing actions on behalf of the impersonated user. This can lead to data breaches, data modification, or service disruption for the legitimate user.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `socket.join()` (if room access is not properly controlled based on *authenticated* user identity).
        *   `socket.to()` and `io.to()` (if used to send messages to unauthorized recipients based on flawed logic).
        *   Custom event handlers (`socket.on(...)`) that don't properly validate the sender's identity *using server-side, authenticated user information*.  This is the core issue.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if sensitive data or actions are involved)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never rely solely on `socket.id`.**  Associate each Socket.IO connection with a unique, authenticated user ID from your application's *separate* authentication system (database ID, JWT, session ID). This association must happen *after* standard authentication.
        *   **Server-Side Validation:** On *every* received Socket.IO event, the server *must* validate that the claimed user ID (from your authentication system) matches the user ID associated with the originating `socket`. Reject any messages where there's a mismatch. This is the most critical mitigation.
        *   **Strict Room/Namespace Management:** Ensure users are only joined to Socket.IO rooms/namespaces they are authorized to access *based on their authenticated identity*. Implement server-side checks before allowing a `socket.join()`.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__-_connection_flooding.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) - Connection Flooding

    *   **Description:** An attacker establishes a large number of Socket.IO connections (either WebSocket or long-polling) to the server, directly exhausting server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, file descriptors). This is a direct attack on the Socket.IO server's ability to handle connections.
    *   **Impact:** The Socket.IO server becomes unresponsive, preventing legitimate users from connecting or using the application's real-time features.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   The Socket.IO server instance (`io`).
        *   The underlying transport mechanism (WebSockets or long-polling) *as managed by Socket.IO*.
        *   Server resources (CPU, memory, network) directly consumed by Socket.IO connection handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Connection Limits:** Limit the number of concurrent Socket.IO connections per user and per IP address *within the Socket.IO configuration*.
        *   **WebSockets Preference:** Favor WebSockets over long-polling (when possible), as WebSockets are generally more efficient. Configure Socket.IO to prefer WebSockets.
        *   **Inactive Connection Timeouts:** Configure Socket.IO to automatically disconnect clients that have been inactive for a defined period.
        *   **Load Balancing (for Socket.IO):** Distribute Socket.IO connections across multiple server instances using a load balancer *specifically configured for Socket.IO*.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Message Flooding](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__-_message_flooding.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) - Message Flooding

    *   **Description:** An attacker, with a *valid* Socket.IO connection, sends a high volume of Socket.IO messages (events) to the server, overwhelming the server's ability to *process* those Socket.IO events. This directly targets the Socket.IO event handling mechanism.
    *   **Impact:** The Socket.IO server becomes slow or unresponsive, impacting the real-time functionality for legitimate users. Specific Socket.IO event handlers might become bottlenecks.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Custom event handlers (`socket.on(...)`) on the server *within the Socket.IO implementation*.
        *   The Socket.IO server's event processing loop itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting (within Socket.IO):** Implement rate limiting *specifically for Socket.IO events*, per event type, per user, and globally. This is a crucial Socket.IO-specific mitigation.
        *   **Message Size Limits (within Socket.IO):** Enforce maximum sizes for Socket.IO message payloads *within the Socket.IO configuration*.
        *   **Asynchronous Processing (for Socket.IO Handlers):** Use asynchronous operations and worker threads/processes to handle computationally expensive Socket.IO event handlers, preventing them from blocking the main Socket.IO event loop.

## Threat: [Elevation of Privilege - Unauthorized Action Execution *via Socket.IO*](./threats/elevation_of_privilege_-_unauthorized_action_execution_via_socket_io.md)

*   **Threat:** Elevation of Privilege - Unauthorized Action Execution *via Socket.IO*

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends crafted Socket.IO events to trigger server-side actions or access data they are *not authorized* to access. This exploits weaknesses in the server's authorization checks *specifically within the context of Socket.IO event handlers*.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can perform actions they shouldn't be able to, potentially modifying data, accessing restricted resources, or escalating their privileges *through the Socket.IO communication channel*.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Custom event handlers (`socket.on(...)`) on the server that don't properly enforce authorization *before performing actions triggered by the Socket.IO event*. This is the core vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Authorization Checks (within Socket.IO Handlers):** Before executing *any* server-side action triggered by a Socket.IO event, *always* verify that the *authenticated user* associated with the `socket` (not just the `socket.id`) has the necessary permissions to perform that action. This check must be done *within the Socket.IO event handler*.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Event Names (If Possible):** Prefer a predefined set of Socket.IO event names. If dynamic names are absolutely necessary, use strict whitelisting and validation *within the Socket.IO event handling logic*.
