- **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    - **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in Hexo's npm dependencies (direct or transitive). This could be done by crafting specific inputs or exploiting flaws in the dependency's code during the Hexo build process.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server running the Hexo build process, potentially leading to data breaches, website defacement, or denial of service.
    - **Affected Component:** `npm` dependencies managed by `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (or `yarn.lock`).
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Regularly update Hexo and its dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
        - Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
        - Implement a process for monitoring dependency vulnerabilities.
        - Consider using a dependency management tool that provides security scanning.

- **Threat:** Hexo CLI Vulnerabilities
    - **Description:** An attacker could leverage vulnerabilities within the Hexo command-line interface itself. This might involve providing specially crafted commands or exploiting flaws in how the CLI handles input or processes data.
    - **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on the server running the Hexo CLI, potentially leading to the same impacts as dependency vulnerabilities.
    - **Affected Component:** The `hexo` npm package and its associated command-line interface.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Keep Hexo updated to the latest stable version.
        - Be cautious about running Hexo commands from untrusted sources or with untrusted input.
        - Review Hexo release notes for security-related updates.

- **Threat:** Configuration File Exposure (`_config.yml`)
    - **Description:** An attacker gains access to the `_config.yml` file, which might contain sensitive information like API keys, deployment credentials, or database connection strings. This could happen through misconfigured version control, server vulnerabilities, or accidental exposure.
    - **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, compromised deployment pipelines, or access to sensitive data.
    - **Affected Component:** The `_config.yml` file in the root of the Hexo project.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Avoid storing sensitive information directly in `_config.yml`.
        - Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions to handle sensitive data.
        - Ensure the `.gitignore` file properly excludes `_config.yml` from version control if it contains sensitive information (though ideally, it shouldn't).
        - Implement proper access controls on the server where the Hexo project resides.

- **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks on Hexo Plugins
    - **Description:** An attacker compromises the development or distribution infrastructure of a popular Hexo plugin, injecting malicious code that is then distributed to all users of that plugin.
    - **Impact:** Widespread compromise of websites using the affected plugin, potentially leading to large-scale attacks.
    - **Affected Component:** The compromised plugin package and its distribution channels (e.g., npm).
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Be aware of the risk of supply chain attacks.
        - Monitor security news and advisories related to Hexo plugins.
        - Consider using tools that can detect anomalies in plugin updates.
        - If a compromise is suspected, immediately remove the affected plugin and investigate.

- **Threat:** Theme Backdoors
    - **Description:** A malicious theme could contain hidden code that allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access or control over the generated website or the server where it's built.
    - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the website and potentially the server.
    - **Affected Component:** The active Hexo theme's files.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Only use themes from trusted sources.
        - Thoroughly review the theme's code before using it.
        - Be wary of themes that request unusual permissions or access to sensitive data.

- **Threat:** Manipulation of Generated Output
    - **Description:** If the build environment is compromised (e.g., through compromised credentials or vulnerabilities in the build server), an attacker could directly manipulate the generated static files, injecting malicious content or altering the website's functionality.
    - **Impact:** Complete compromise of the website, potentially serving malware or phishing attacks to visitors.
    - **Affected Component:** The entire Hexo build environment and the generated output files.
    - **Risk Severity:** Critical
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Secure the build environment with strong access controls and regular security updates.
        - Implement integrity checks on the generated files before deployment.
        - Use secure deployment methods.

- **Threat:** Insecure Handling of User-Provided Content (during build)
    - **Description:** If plugins or theme features process user-provided content (e.g., data files, configuration), vulnerabilities in this processing could lead to issues like path traversal or code injection during the build process.
    - **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution during the build process, potentially leading to website compromise.
    - **Affected Component:** Hexo plugins or theme features that process external data.
    - **Risk Severity:** High
    - **Mitigation Strategies:**
        - Sanitize and validate all user-provided content before processing it.
        - Avoid using user-provided content directly in code execution contexts.
        - Follow secure coding practices when developing plugins or theme features that handle external data.
