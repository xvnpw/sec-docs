# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hexojs/hexo

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Dependency Auditing and Updates (Hexo, Themes, Plugins)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_dependency_auditing_and_updates__hexo__themes__plugins_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regular Dependency Auditing and Updates (Hexo, Themes, Plugins)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Automated Scanning (Hexo-Specific):** Integrate `npm audit` (or `yarn audit`) into the Hexo build process. This ensures that Hexo itself, and all installed themes and plugins, are checked for known vulnerabilities *every time the site is built*. This can be done via a pre-commit hook, a CI/CD pipeline step, or a scheduled task. Use `npm audit --audit-level=high`.
        2.  **Alerting:** Configure the audit process to send alerts if vulnerabilities are found in Hexo, themes, or plugins.
        3.  **Update Process (Hexo-Specific):** Establish a clear process for updating vulnerable Hexo versions, themes, and plugins. This involves:
            *   Testing updates in a development environment *before* deploying.
            *   Reviewing changelogs for breaking changes (especially for major version updates of Hexo or themes).
            *   Using `npm update hexo` (or `yarn upgrade hexo`) to update Hexo.
            *   Using `npm update <theme-name>` or `npm update <plugin-name>` to update themes and plugins.
            *   Updating the `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file.
        4.  **Regular Manual Review:** Periodically manually review the list of installed Hexo themes and plugins, and the Hexo version itself. Check for updates even if `npm audit` doesn't report vulnerabilities.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (Themes and Plugins):** (Severity: **High to Critical**) - This is the *primary* threat for Hexo sites.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Hexo Core:** (Severity: **Medium to High**) - Ensures the core Hexo framework is patched.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** Reduces risk significantly (70-90%).
        *   **Vulnerabilities in Hexo Core:** Reduces risk significantly (60-80%).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Partially Implemented:** `npm audit` is run manually; `package-lock.json` is used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Automated Scanning (Hexo Build Integration):**  `npm audit` is *not* part of the Hexo build process.
        *   **Alerting:** No automated alerts.
        *   **Formal Update Process (Hexo-Specific):**  No documented process for updating Hexo, themes, and plugins.
        *   **Regular Manual Review:**  No scheduled review.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Sensitive Information (Hexo Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_sensitive_information__hexo_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Handling of Sensitive Information (Hexo Configuration)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Environment Variables (Hexo Context):**  Store *all* sensitive data used by Hexo (API keys, deployment credentials used by Hexo plugins, etc.) in *environment variables*.  Do *not* store them directly in `_config.yml` or any other file within the Hexo project.
        2.  **Access Environment Variables (Hexo Config):**  Within `_config.yml`, access the environment variables using `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.  For example:  `deploy:  api_key: <%= process.env.DEPLOY_API_KEY %>`. This is crucial for any Hexo deployment plugins that require credentials.
        3.  **.gitignore (Hexo Project):**  Ensure that `.gitignore` *explicitly* excludes any files or directories that might contain sensitive information, even if they are not currently used by Hexo. This includes `.env` files, backup files of `_config.yml`, etc.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information in the Git Repository (Hexo Config):** (Severity: **Critical**) - Prevents accidental exposure of credentials used by Hexo.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** Reduces risk dramatically (90-95%).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **.gitignore:**  `.gitignore` excludes `node_modules`.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Environment Variables (Hexo Config):**  Sensitive data is currently in `_config.yml`.
        *   **.gitignore (Comprehensive):** `.gitignore` does not explicitly exclude `.env` or other potential secret files.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Theme and Plugin Selection and Management (Hexo Ecosystem)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_theme_and_plugin_selection_and_management__hexo_ecosystem_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Strict Theme and Plugin Selection and Management (Hexo Ecosystem)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Vetting Process (Hexo Themes/Plugins):** Before installing a Hexo theme or plugin:
            *   Check the last commit date on GitHub. Avoid abandoned projects.
            *   Review the issue tracker for open security issues.
            *   Examine the number of stars/forks.
            *   Briefly review the source code (if feasible) for obvious flaws.
        2.  **Minimalism (Hexo Plugins):**  Only install *absolutely essential* Hexo plugins. Each plugin increases the attack surface.
        3.  **Forking (Hexo Themes/Plugins - Optional):** For critical Hexo themes or plugins, consider forking the repository and maintaining your own version.
        4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Hexo Theme Configuration):** If the Hexo *theme* supports it, configure a strict CSP in the theme's configuration or header files. This is a theme-specific setting, not a general web server configuration.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies (Themes and Plugins):** (Severity: **High to Critical**)
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Theme-Specific):** (Severity: **Medium to High**) - CSP, if supported by the theme, mitigates XSS.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Vulnerable Dependencies:** Reduces risk moderately (30-50%).
        *   **XSS:** Reduces risk significantly (60-80%) if a strict CSP is implemented *and the theme supports it*.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Minimalism:** A relatively small number of plugins are used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   **Formal Vetting Process:** No documented process.
        *   **Forking:** No forking.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Theme-Level):** No CSP is configured at the theme level.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid/Secure Admin Panel Plugins (Hexo Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/avoidsecure_admin_panel_plugins__hexo_specific_.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid/Secure Admin Panel Plugins (Hexo Specific)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Avoidance (Hexo Recommendation):** The strongly recommended approach is to *not* use any Hexo admin panel plugins. Manage the Hexo site through the command line and Git. This eliminates a significant attack vector.
        2.  **Strong Authentication (If Unavoidable):** If a Hexo admin panel plugin *must* be used:
            *   Enforce strong, unique passwords.
            *   Implement MFA if the plugin supports it.
        3.  **Network Restrictions (Less Hexo-Specific, but relevant):** Restrict access to the admin panel's URL (often `/admin`) using firewall rules or web server configuration. This is less directly related to Hexo itself, but important if an admin plugin is used.
        4.  **Regular Updates (Plugin-Specific):** Keep the Hexo admin panel plugin updated.
        5.  **Audit Logging (Plugin-Specific):** Enable and review audit logs if the plugin provides them.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Admin panel plugins (Hexo Specific):** (Severity: **High to Critical**)

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Admin panel plugins:** Reduces risk significantly (70-90%).

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **Avoidance:** No admin panel plugin is currently used.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   N/A (avoidance is the strategy)

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Custom Generator Tags and Helpers (Hexo Development)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_custom_generator_tags_and_helpers__hexo_development_.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Custom Generator Tags and Helpers (Hexo Development)

    * **Description:**
        1. **Code Review (Hexo Context):** Carefully review the code of any custom Hexo generator tags or helpers.  Focus on how they handle data, especially any form of input.
        2. **Input Validation and Sanitization (Hexo Development):** If a tag or helper accepts any input, validate and sanitize it thoroughly. Use appropriate escaping functions provided by Hexo or Node.js to prevent XSS.
        3. **Avoid Exposing Sensitive Data (Hexo Output):** Ensure that custom tags and helpers do *not* inadvertently expose sensitive data in the generated Hexo output.
        4. **Testing (Hexo-Specific Scenarios):** Thoroughly test custom tags and helpers with various inputs, including malicious ones, within the context of Hexo's build process.

    * **Threats Mitigated:**
        * **Data Leakage through Generator Tags and Helpers (Hexo Specific):** (Severity: **Medium**)
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Custom Hexo Code):** (Severity: **Medium to High**)

    * **Impact:**
        * **Data Leakage:** Reduces risk significantly (70-90%).
        * **XSS:** Reduces risk significantly (70-90%).

    * **Currently Implemented:**
        *   **No Custom Tags/Helpers:** No custom generator tags or helpers are currently used.

    * **Missing Implementation:**
        *   N/A (no custom code)
