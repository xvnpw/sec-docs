# Attack Surface Analysis for hexojs/hexo

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within third-party Hexo plugins that allow for code execution or other significant compromises.
*   **How Hexo Contributes:** Hexo's plugin architecture provides the *direct mechanism* for arbitrary Node.js code execution during the site generation process. This is a core feature of Hexo that creates the vulnerability pathway.
*   **Example:** A plugin with a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability in an outdated dependency.  An attacker uploads a crafted file that triggers the RCE, taking control of the build server.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of the build environment, potentially leading to server compromise, data theft, or website defacement.  Could lead to client-side attacks if the plugin injects malicious code.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical (if RCE is possible) to High (for other significant vulnerabilities).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Plugin Vetting:** Only install plugins from *highly trusted* sources (official Hexo plugins, extremely well-vetted community plugins with a proven track record).
    *   **Mandatory Code Review:**  *Always* review the plugin's source code before installation, focusing on dependencies and security-sensitive operations.  This is crucial.
    *   **Aggressive Dependency Management:**  Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` *before every build* to identify and update vulnerable dependencies.  Automate this process.
    *   **Sandboxed Build Environment:**  Run `hexo generate` in a *strictly isolated* environment (e.g., a dedicated, minimal Docker container).  Never run as root.
    *   **Input Validation (Plugin Devs):** Plugin developers *must* rigorously validate and sanitize all input.

## Attack Surface: [Hexo Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/hexo_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws within the core Hexo codebase itself, allowing for code execution or other severe compromises.
*   **How Hexo Contributes:** This is a *direct* vulnerability in Hexo's own code, representing a flaw in the core application logic.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in Hexo's Markdown parsing engine that allows a crafted Markdown file to trigger a buffer overflow and achieve remote code execution during `hexo generate`.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially severe, ranging from denial of service to remote code execution (compromising the build server).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (for RCE) to High (for other vulnerabilities that could lead to significant data breaches or system compromise).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Updates:**  Update Hexo to the latest stable version *immediately* upon release, especially if security patches are included.  Monitor security advisories closely.
    *   **Sandboxed Build Environment:**  Run the build process in a strictly isolated environment (e.g., a dedicated Docker container) to limit the impact of any potential exploit.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure the build process runs with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Data Handling in Custom Code (Directly Using Hexo APIs)](./attack_surfaces/data_handling_in_custom_code__directly_using_hexo_apis_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced by custom generators, scripts, or helpers *specifically using Hexo's provided APIs* in an insecure manner.
*   **How Hexo Contributes:** Hexo provides the APIs that, if misused, create the vulnerability. This is distinct from general bad coding practices; it's about incorrect usage of *Hexo's extension points*.
*   **Example:** A custom generator script uses Hexo's `hexo.route.register` API with unsanitized user input to define a route, potentially leading to a denial-of-service or unexpected behavior.  Another example: a custom helper function uses Hexo's file I/O APIs with improperly validated paths, leading to a path traversal vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Varies, but could include command injection (if shell commands are constructed unsafely), path traversal, or other code execution vulnerabilities *within the context of the Hexo build process*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Rigorous Input Validation:** *Always* validate and sanitize any data used within custom code that interacts with Hexo APIs, especially if the data comes from external sources or user configurations.
    *   **Safe API Usage:** Carefully review Hexo's API documentation and use the APIs as intended, avoiding any patterns that could lead to vulnerabilities.  Prefer built-in Hexo features over custom code whenever possible.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review any custom code that interacts with Hexo APIs for potential security flaws.
    * **Least Privilege:** Ensure that any custom scripts run with the minimum necessary privileges.
