## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 2: Exploit Hexo Plugins/Themes](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_2_exploit_hexo_pluginsthemes.md)

Description: This sub-goal represents the attacker's strategy of targeting vulnerabilities within third-party plugins or themes installed in the Hexo environment. This is a high-risk area because:
    *   Plugins and themes are often developed by a wide range of individuals and organizations, with varying levels of security expertise.
    *   The sheer number of available plugins and themes increases the attack surface.
    *   Users may not always keep their plugins and themes updated, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits.
Mitigation:
    *   Carefully vet plugins and themes before installation.
    *   Regularly update all plugins and themes.
    *   Minimize the number of installed plugins and themes.
    *   Monitor for security advisories related to installed plugins and themes.

## Attack Tree Path: [[***B1: Vulnerable Plugin/Theme***]](./attack_tree_paths/_b1_vulnerable_plugintheme_.md)

Description: This node represents the existence of a vulnerability within a plugin or theme. This vulnerability could be a coding error, a design flaw, or an insecure configuration. This is a critical node because it's the entry point for many successful attacks.
Types of Vulnerabilities:
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   SQL Injection
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    *   Authentication Bypass
    *   Information Disclosure
Mitigation:
    *   Choose plugins and themes from reputable sources.
    *   Review the code of plugins and themes (if possible) for potential vulnerabilities.
    *   Keep plugins and themes updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [[***B1.1: Known CVE in Plugin***]](./attack_tree_paths/_b1_1_known_cve_in_plugin_.md)

Description: This node represents a specific, publicly disclosed vulnerability (with a CVE identifier) in a plugin. This is a critical node and part of the high-risk path because:
    *   Ease of Exploitation: Exploit code for known CVEs is often publicly available, making it easy for attackers to exploit these vulnerabilities.
    *   High Likelihood: Attackers actively scan for known vulnerabilities.
    *   High Impact: Successful exploitation can lead to complete website compromise.
Mitigation:
    *   Use a dependency management tool that automatically checks for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `npm audit`).
    *   Immediately update any plugins with known CVEs.
    *   Consider removing plugins with known, unpatched vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[A2.2: Exposed Admin Interface]](./attack_tree_paths/_a2_2_exposed_admin_interface_.md)

Description: This node represents a situation where a plugin or a misconfiguration of core Hexo functionality exposes an administrative interface without adequate protection. This is critical because it provides a direct path to high-privilege access.
Vulnerabilities:
    *   Weak or Default Credentials: The interface uses easily guessable or default passwords.
    *   Missing Authentication: The interface is accessible without any authentication.
    *   Authentication Bypass: Vulnerabilities in the authentication mechanism allow attackers to bypass it.
Mitigation:
    *   Ensure all administrative interfaces require strong, unique passwords.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) where possible.
    *   Regularly review the Hexo configuration and plugin settings to ensure no unintended administrative interfaces are exposed.
    *   Use a web application firewall (WAF) to protect against attacks targeting the administrative interface.
    *   If a plugin provides an admin interface, ensure it is absolutely necessary and follows best security practices. If not needed, disable or remove the plugin.
