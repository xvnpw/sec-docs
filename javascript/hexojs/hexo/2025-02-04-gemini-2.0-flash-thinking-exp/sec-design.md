# BUSINESS POSTURE

Hexo is a static site generator designed to simplify blog creation. Its primary business priority is to provide a user-friendly, efficient, and customizable platform for individuals and organizations to publish content online.

Business Goals:
- Provide a simple and fast way to create static blogs.
- Offer a customizable and extensible platform through themes and plugins.
- Maintain an active and supportive community.
- Ensure the software is reliable and performs well.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the core framework or plugins could damage user websites and reputation.
- Lack of maintenance and updates could lead to software becoming outdated and insecure.
- Poor performance or complexity could drive users to alternative solutions.
- Community fragmentation or lack of support could hinder adoption and growth.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Dependency management using `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent dependency versions. (Implemented in repository)
- security control: Regular updates to dependencies to address known vulnerabilities. (Practiced by maintainers, visible in commit history)
- security control: Input sanitization of user-provided content within themes and plugins (Responsibility of theme and plugin developers, not explicitly enforced by core).
- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities in user-installed themes and plugins are the responsibility of the user.
- accepted risk: Server security where the generated static site is hosted is the responsibility of the user.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for core Hexo framework.
- security control: Provide security guidelines for theme and plugin developers to encourage secure coding practices.
- security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in Hexo and its ecosystem.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable for core Hexo as it's a static site generator. Authentication is relevant for any administrative interfaces for managing Hexo configurations or plugins, which are outside the scope of the core framework itself.
- Authorization: Not applicable for core Hexo. Authorization is relevant for any administrative interfaces, which are outside the scope of the core framework itself.
- Input Validation: Hexo needs to handle various input formats (Markdown, YAML, etc.). Input validation is crucial in themes and plugins to prevent XSS and other injection attacks when rendering user-provided content. Core Hexo should ensure safe parsing of configuration and content files.
- Cryptography: Not explicitly required for core functionality of static site generation. Cryptography might be relevant for features like encrypted configuration files or secure plugin updates, which are not core features currently. HTTPS should be enforced for websites generated by Hexo, but this is deployment responsibility.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Publishing new blog posts and updating existing content.
- Maintaining website availability and performance.
- Ensuring website security and preventing defacement or data breaches.

Data Sensitivity:
- Blog content (Markdown files): Low to Medium sensitivity. Publicly available content, but integrity is important.
- Hexo configuration files (YAML): Medium sensitivity. May contain site settings and potentially secrets if not properly managed.
- Generated static website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript): Low sensitivity. Publicly available content.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS) that Hexo needs to adhere to? (Assumption: No specific compliance requirements beyond general security best practices for a static website generator.)
- Are there any plans to introduce user authentication or administrative interfaces to Hexo core in the future? (Assumption: Core Hexo remains a static site generator without built-in authentication.)
- What is the process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in Hexo and its ecosystem? (Assumption: Standard open-source vulnerability reporting process through GitHub issues and security advisories.)

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a simple and efficient static site generator for blogging. Security is important for user trust and platform reliability.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Users are responsible for securing their themes, plugins, and deployment environments. Core Hexo focuses on framework security and secure dependency management. Security controls are primarily focused on preventing common web vulnerabilities in the generated static sites.
- DESIGN: Hexo follows a modular design with core, themes, and plugins. Deployment is typically to static website hosting platforms. Build process can be automated using CI/CD pipelines.
