    *   **Prioritize Code Reviews:** Focus code reviews on plugins/themes that handle sensitive data, are critical to site functionality, or come from less reputable sources.
    *   **Focus on Key Areas:**  During code review, prioritize areas that commonly introduce vulnerabilities (user input handling, external service interactions, core Hexo modifications, authentication/authorization).
    *   **Utilize Code Review Tools:**  Employ static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to automate parts of the code review process and identify common vulnerability patterns.
    *   **Consider Community Code Reviews:**  If feasible, contribute to or leverage community code reviews for popular Hexo plugins/themes.

##### 4.1.4. Security-focused Search for Hexo plugins/themes

*   **Analysis:**  Proactively searching for known vulnerabilities associated with specific plugins/themes is a crucial step.  Leveraging vulnerability databases, security advisories, and Hexo-specific forums can reveal pre-existing security issues.  This step helps avoid using plugins/themes with publicly known vulnerabilities.
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Identifies Known Vulnerabilities:**  Directly targets known security weaknesses.
    *   **Relatively Easy to Implement:**  Involves searching online resources.
    *   **Prevents Reintroduction of Known Issues:**  Avoids using components with already documented vulnerabilities.
