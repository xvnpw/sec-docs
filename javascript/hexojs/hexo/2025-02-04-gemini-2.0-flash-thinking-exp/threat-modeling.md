# Threat Model Analysis for hexojs/hexo

## Threat: [Vulnerable Theme Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_theme_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker identifies and exploits vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, code injection) within a Hexo theme used by the website. This is possible due to insecure coding practices in the theme itself.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting attacks on website visitors, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, potential for more severe attacks depending on the vulnerability.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo theme engine, theme templates (e.g., EJS, Pug), generated HTML.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Choose themes from reputable and actively maintained sources.
    *   Review theme code for potential vulnerabilities before use.
    *   Keep themes updated to the latest versions.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS impact.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan theme code for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Theme Injection](./threats/malicious_theme_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker tricks user into using a malicious Hexo theme containing backdoors or malicious scripts. This theme is designed to harm the website or its visitors.
*   **Impact:** Backdoor access to the website, malicious scripts executed on visitor browsers, website compromise.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo theme engine, theme installation process, generated website files.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only download themes from trusted and official sources.
    *   Carefully inspect theme code before installation.
    *   Be wary of themes from unknown or unverified developers.
    *   Use a sandboxed environment to test themes before deploying to production.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Hexo plugins during site generation or in the generated website output. This is due to insecure coding within the plugin.
*   **Impact:** Code execution during Hexo generation, vulnerabilities in the generated website (e.g., XSS), data theft, site malfunction.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo plugin system, plugin code, generated website files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use plugins from reputable and actively maintained sources.
    *   Review plugin code for potential vulnerabilities before use.
    *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
    *   Minimize the number of plugins used.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan plugin code for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Theme/Plugin Update](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_themeplugin_update.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker compromises a legitimate theme or plugin repository and injects malicious code into updates, affecting users who update. This exploits Hexo's dependency on external themes and plugins.
*   **Impact:** Backdoor or malware injected through theme/plugin updates, website compromise after seemingly safe updates, difficult to detect.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Theme/plugin update mechanism, dependency management, generated website files.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Monitor theme and plugin updates closely.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories for themes and plugins.
    *   Test updates in a staging environment before production deployment.
    *   Consider dependency pinning to control updates more tightly.

## Threat: [XSS via Markdown Content Injection](./threats/xss_via_markdown_content_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into Markdown content, which is then rendered by Hexo and executed in users' browsers. This exploits Hexo's Markdown rendering process if not properly sanitized.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting attacks, stealing user cookies, website defacement, redirection, keylogging.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo Markdown rendering engine, generated HTML, user browsers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and escape user-provided content if incorporated into Markdown.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   Educate content creators about XSS risks.
    *   Regularly review Markdown content for suspicious code.

## Threat: [Code Execution during Hexo Generation](./threats/code_execution_during_hexo_generation.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Hexo core or plugins are exploited to execute arbitrary code on the server during the `hexo generate` process. This directly targets Hexo's core functionality or plugin execution.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, data theft from server, website defacement, denial of service.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo core, plugin execution environment, Node.js runtime.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Hexo and dependencies updated.
    *   Carefully vet plugins and themes.
    *   Run Hexo generation in a sandboxed environment.
    *   Monitor server resources during generation for anomalies.

## Threat: [Output Directory Traversal](./threats/output_directory_traversal.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguration or vulnerabilities allow writing generated files outside the intended output directory, potentially overwriting sensitive system files. This exploits Hexo's file output mechanism.
*   **Impact:** Overwriting critical system files, server compromise, website malfunction.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo output path configuration, file system operations during generation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure output paths in `_config.yml`.
    *   Review plugin/theme code for path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   Run Hexo generation with restricted file system permissions.
    *   Regularly audit output directory configurations.
