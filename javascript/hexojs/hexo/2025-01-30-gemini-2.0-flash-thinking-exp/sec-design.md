# BUSINESS POSTURE

Hexo is a static site generator designed to simplify blog creation for developers and writers. Its primary business goal is to provide a fast, efficient, and customizable platform for generating static websites, particularly blogs.

Business Priorities:
- Ease of use and setup for developers.
- Performance and speed of website generation.
- Customizability through themes and plugins.
- Extensibility and active community support.
- Stability and reliability of the core framework.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in core framework, themes, or plugins could lead to website defacement or data breaches (if sensitive data is inadvertently included in the static site generation process).
- Lack of updates or community support could lead to stagnation and decreased adoption.
- Performance issues or complexity in customization could deter users.
- Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies used by Hexo or its plugins.
- Misconfiguration by users leading to insecure websites.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Dependency management using `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent and reproducible builds. (Implemented in repository and build process)
- security control: Usage of npm ecosystem for package management, which includes community-driven security scanning and reporting (npm audit). (Implemented in build process and dependency management)
- security control: Static site generation inherently reduces attack surface compared to dynamic websites with databases and server-side scripting. (Design principle)
- accepted risk: Reliance on third-party themes and plugins introduces potential security vulnerabilities. (Implicitly accepted by design, user responsibility)
- accepted risk: Security of the generated website is largely dependent on the user's configuration and hosting environment. (Implicitly accepted by design, user responsibility)

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) for the core Hexo framework in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices documentation for users, especially regarding theme and plugin selection and website configuration.
- security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in the core framework and potentially in officially maintained plugins/themes.
- security control: Encourage and potentially enforce (for core and official plugins/themes) dependency vulnerability scanning and updates.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Hexo core as it's a static site generator. Authentication is relevant for any administrative interfaces or services built around Hexo (e.g., a CMS or plugin management dashboard, if any). For the core framework, focus is on secure development practices and supply chain security.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to Hexo core. Authorization would be relevant in the context of administrative interfaces or services built around Hexo. For the core framework, focus is on preventing unauthorized modifications to the framework itself through secure development practices and access control to the repository.
- Input Validation: Input validation is crucial during static site generation. Hexo needs to properly handle and sanitize user-provided content (Markdown, configuration files, theme templates) to prevent injection vulnerabilities (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting - XSS) in the generated static website. This should be implemented in the rendering engine and content processing modules.
- Cryptography: Cryptography might be relevant for features like password hashing (if Hexo were to manage user accounts, which it currently doesn't in its core functionality) or secure communication (HTTPS for documentation website, secure download of dependencies). For static site generation, ensuring no accidental inclusion of sensitive cryptographic keys or data in generated output is important.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Website generation and publishing: Ensuring the process is reliable, efficient, and secure to maintain website availability and integrity.
- Content creation and management: Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of user-generated content (although typically not highly sensitive in public blogs, accidental exposure of drafts or private information is a risk).
- Plugin and theme ecosystem: Maintaining a secure and trustworthy ecosystem of plugins and themes to prevent supply chain attacks and vulnerabilities in user websites.

Data Sensitivity:
- User-generated content (Markdown files, configuration): Low to medium sensitivity. Public blog content is generally not sensitive, but drafts or configuration files might contain some non-public information.
- Hexo framework code: Medium sensitivity. Protecting the integrity of the core framework code is important to prevent widespread vulnerabilities.
- Website visitor data: Low sensitivity for static sites. Hexo itself doesn't directly collect visitor data, but deployed websites might use analytics or other third-party services that collect visitor data.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- Are there any administrative interfaces or services planned around Hexo that would require authentication and authorization? (Assumption: No core administrative interface in Hexo itself, but plugins or external services might add this functionality).
- What is the process for users to report security vulnerabilities in Hexo, themes, or plugins? (Assumption: Community-driven reporting, potentially through GitHub issues or a dedicated security channel).
- Are there any specific compliance requirements or industry regulations that Hexo or websites generated by Hexo need to adhere to? (Assumption: General web security best practices are sufficient for most use cases, specific compliance depends on the website's content and target audience).

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a user-friendly and efficient static site generator for developers and writers, with a focus on ease of use, performance, and customizability. Security is important but balanced with usability and development speed.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Security is primarily focused on preventing vulnerabilities in the core framework and providing guidance to users for secure website configuration and plugin/theme selection. Users are responsible for the security of their deployed websites and content.
- DESIGN: Hexo follows a modular design with clear separation of concerns between CLI, configuration, content processing, themes, plugins, and rendering. Deployment is typically to static site hosting platforms. Build process is automated using CI/CD systems.
