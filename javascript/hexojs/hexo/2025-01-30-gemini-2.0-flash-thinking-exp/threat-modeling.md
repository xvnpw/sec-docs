# Threat Model Analysis for hexojs/hexo

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Hexo Core](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__in_hexo_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Hexo Core
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Hexo core during site generation. They can execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting malicious input in configuration, theme files, or plugin code processed by Hexo.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo Core (parsing engine, core functionalities)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Hexo core updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Monitor Hexo project security advisories and apply patches promptly.
    *   Use official Hexo releases only.
    *   Implement input validation in custom Hexo extensions.
    *   Run Hexo generation in a sandboxed environment.

## Threat: [XSS in Generated Site due to Core Bugs](./threats/xss_in_generated_site_due_to_core_bugs.md)

*   **Threat:** XSS in Generated Site due to Core Bugs
*   **Description:** A bug in Hexo's core rendering engine generates static HTML files with XSS vulnerabilities. Attackers can inject malicious scripts into user content or exploit flaws in Hexo's output encoding, affecting users visiting the generated site.
*   **Impact:** User account compromise, session hijacking, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft from users.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo Core (rendering engine, output generation)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Hexo core updated to the latest stable version.
    *   Report suspected XSS vulnerabilities to the Hexo project.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on the web server.
    *   Regularly test generated sites for XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [XSS Vulnerabilities in Themes](./threats/xss_vulnerabilities_in_themes.md)

*   **Threat:** XSS Vulnerabilities in Themes
*   **Description:** Theme code, handling user content or dynamic elements, contains XSS vulnerabilities. Attackers inject malicious scripts through comments or post content, which the theme fails to sanitize, leading to XSS in the generated site.
*   **Impact:** User account compromise, session hijacking, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft from users.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo Themes (template files, JavaScript code within themes)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Choose themes from reputable sources.
    *   Review theme code for XSS vulnerabilities before use.
    *   Keep themes updated to the latest versions.
    *   Implement output encoding and sanitization in theme templates if modifying them.
    *   Use CSP headers on the web server.

## Threat: [Theme Backdoors or Malicious Code](./threats/theme_backdoors_or_malicious_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Theme Backdoors or Malicious Code
*   **Description:** A theme from an untrusted source contains malicious code. This code can steal data during site generation, inject backdoors, or perform other malicious actions, compromising user websites.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise (if executed during build), data theft, website defacement, malware distribution, backdoors in website.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo Themes (theme files, JavaScript code within themes)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Download themes only from official Hexo theme repository or highly trusted sources.
    *   Avoid nulled or pirated themes.
    *   Review theme code for suspicious or obfuscated code before use.
    *   Use a sandboxed environment for Hexo site generation.

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Plugins](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__in_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Plugins
*   **Description:** A vulnerability in a Hexo plugin allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server during `hexo generate`. This can be triggered by malicious input processed by the plugin or flaws in its logic.
*   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, website defacement, malware distribution, denial of service.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo Plugins (plugin code)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Choose plugins from reputable sources.
    *   Review plugin code for vulnerabilities before use.
    *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
    *   Monitor plugin project security advisories and apply patches promptly.
    *   Use a sandboxed environment for Hexo site generation.

## Threat: [XSS Vulnerabilities Introduced by Plugins](./threats/xss_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** XSS Vulnerabilities Introduced by Plugins
*   **Description:** A plugin processing user content or generating dynamic HTML introduces XSS vulnerabilities. The plugin fails to sanitize input/output, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts into the generated site.
*   **Impact:** User account compromise, session hijacking, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft from users.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo Plugins (plugin code, output generation by plugins)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Choose plugins known for secure input handling.
    *   Review plugin code for XSS vulnerabilities, especially in input/output handling.
    *   Implement output encoding and sanitization in custom plugins.
    *   Test plugins for XSS vulnerabilities before deployment.
    *   Use CSP headers on the web server.

## Threat: [Content Injection through Theme or Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/content_injection_through_theme_or_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Content Injection through Theme or Plugin Vulnerabilities
*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in themes or plugins are exploited to inject malicious content into the generated static site during build. This can deface the website or be used for phishing or malware distribution.
*   **Impact:** Website defacement, phishing attacks, malware distribution, redirection to malicious sites.
*   **Hexo Component Affected:** Hexo Themes, Hexo Plugins (vulnerable code in themes or plugins)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Refer to mitigations for Theme and Plugin vulnerabilities (sections 3 and 6).
    *   Implement content validation and sanitization in custom plugins or theme modifications.
    *   Regularly audit theme and plugin code for potential injection vulnerabilities.
