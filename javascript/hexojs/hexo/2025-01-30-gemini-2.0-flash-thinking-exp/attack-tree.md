## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Hexo Application](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_hexo_application.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control over the Hexo application, leading to various negative impacts like content defacement, malware distribution, data exfiltration, DoS, or backdoor installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Hexo Build Process](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_hexo_build_process.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Compromising any part of the build process allows attackers to inject malicious content or code into the generated static site. This can be achieved through various sub-paths detailed below.
    *   **Risk:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to widespread compromise of the deployed website, affecting all visitors.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Hexo Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__exploit_hexo_plugins.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Hexo Plugins:** Attackers first identify plugins used by the Hexo application. This can be done by analyzing public website information or guessing common plugins.
    *   **Research Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Once plugins are identified, attackers research known vulnerabilities in those plugins using CVE databases, security advisories, and GitHub issues.
    *   **Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities:** Attackers then exploit identified vulnerabilities. Common vulnerabilities in plugins include:
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Plugin Output:** Injecting malicious JavaScript through plugin output that is not properly sanitized.
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) in Plugin Logic:** Exploiting flaws in plugin code to execute arbitrary code on the server during the build process. This can be due to input validation flaws or deserialization vulnerabilities.
        *   **Path Traversal in Plugin File Handling:** Exploiting flaws in how plugins handle files to access or modify sensitive files outside the intended scope.
    *   **Risk:** Critical and High-Risk. Plugins are a major attack surface due to their community-driven nature and potential lack of rigorous security audits. Exploiting plugin vulnerabilities is a highly likely and impactful attack path.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__supply_chain_attack_via_malicious_plugin.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Install Backdoored or Malicious Plugin:** Attackers trick users into installing a malicious plugin. This could be a plugin with a backdoor, malware, or designed to steal data. This can be achieved by compromising plugin repositories, typosquatting, or using compromised developer accounts.
    *   **Risk:** High. While potentially lower likelihood than exploiting existing vulnerabilities, a successful supply chain attack can have a very high impact as the malicious plugin is directly integrated into the application. Detection is also difficult.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Hexo Themes](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_hexo_themes.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Hexo Theme:** Attackers identify the theme used by the Hexo application, often easily determined from website source code.
    *   **Research Theme Vulnerabilities:** Attackers research known vulnerabilities in the identified theme, looking at theme repositories and security reports.
    *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Theme Vulnerabilities:** Attackers exploit identified vulnerabilities in the theme. Common theme vulnerabilities include:
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Theme Templates:** Injecting malicious JavaScript through theme templates that are not properly secured. This can be done via theme configuration or content.
        *   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (Less Likely):** While less common in static site generators, theoretically possible if the theme has custom server-side logic, allowing code execution on the build server.
    *   **Risk:** High. Themes, like plugins, are often community-developed and can contain vulnerabilities, especially client-side XSS. Exploiting theme vulnerabilities can lead to website defacement and client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH] Misconfigured Deployment Settings (e.g., Exposed Credentials in Config Files)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__high-risk_path__misconfigured_deployment_settings__e_g___exposed_credentials_in_conf_64c4bca1.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Misconfigured Deployment Settings:** Developers may accidentally expose deployment credentials (API keys, passwords) in Hexo configuration files (e.g., `_config.yml`).
    *   **Access Deployment Credentials and Modify Deployed Site:** Attackers who gain access to these credentials can directly modify the deployed website, bypassing the intended build process.
    *   **Risk:** Critical and High-Risk. Misconfiguration is a common issue, and exposed deployment credentials provide a direct and easy path to website compromise with high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Identify Vulnerable Node.js Dependencies:** Attackers analyze `package.json` and `package-lock.json` (if accessible) or use dependency scanning tools to find known vulnerabilities in Hexo's Node.js dependencies.
    *   **Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Attackers exploit identified vulnerabilities in dependencies. This can include vulnerabilities like prototype pollution or arbitrary code execution within the dependencies.
    *   **Trigger Vulnerable Code Paths:** Attackers need to trigger vulnerable code paths in the dependencies through Hexo functionality or plugins to exploit the vulnerability in the context of the Hexo application.
    *   **Risk:** High. Dependency vulnerabilities are increasingly common, and tools make them easy to identify. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to various impacts, including code execution during the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise Build Environment](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__compromise_build_environment.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Gain Access to Build Server/Machine:** Attackers attempt to gain unauthorized access to the server or machine where the Hexo build process is executed. This can be through exploiting system vulnerabilities, weak credentials, or social engineering.
    *   **Modify Build Pipeline:** Once inside the build environment, attackers can modify the build pipeline, injecting malicious code into build scripts or deployment processes.
    *   **Inject Malicious Content During Build:** Attackers can directly modify Hexo source files, theme files, or plugin files within the build environment to inject malicious content into the generated website.
    *   **Risk:** High. Compromising the build environment provides attackers with complete control over the build process and the generated website. The impact is very high, allowing for any type of malicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH-RISK PATH] Theme-Based Client-Side Vulnerabilities (XSS) (Deployed Site)](./attack_tree_paths/_high-risk_path__theme-based_client-side_vulnerabilities__xss___deployed_site_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Hexo Theme:** The chosen Hexo theme contains client-side vulnerabilities, specifically XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Inject Malicious JavaScript:** Attackers exploit these vulnerabilities to inject malicious JavaScript into the website, which is then executed in visitors' browsers.
    *   **Risk:** High. Theme-based XSS vulnerabilities are a common issue in web applications. Exploiting them on a deployed Hexo site can lead to client-side attacks, website defacement, and other malicious activities affecting website visitors.
