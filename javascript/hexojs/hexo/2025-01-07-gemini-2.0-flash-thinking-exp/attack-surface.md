# Attack Surface Analysis for hexojs/hexo

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/markdown_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Flaws in the Markdown parser used by Hexo can allow attackers to inject malicious code through crafted Markdown content.

**How Hexo Contributes:** Hexo relies on external Markdown parsing libraries (like `marked` or `markdown-it`) to convert Markdown files into HTML. If these libraries have vulnerabilities, Hexo inherits that risk.

**Example:** A blog post containing specially crafted Markdown that exploits an XSS vulnerability in the parser, causing arbitrary JavaScript to execute in a visitor's browser.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement. Server-side vulnerabilities could lead to SSRF or DoS.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Hexo and its dependencies, including the Markdown parser, to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using a more secure and actively maintained Markdown parser.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.
*   Sanitize user-provided Markdown content if it's not directly controlled by the site owner.

## Attack Surface: [Theme Templating Engine Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/theme_templating_engine_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the templating engine (like Nunjucks or EJS) used by Hexo themes can allow attackers to inject malicious code into templates.

**How Hexo Contributes:** Hexo uses templating engines to dynamically generate HTML. If a theme uses vulnerable templating syntax or doesn't properly escape variables, it can be exploited.

**Example:** A theme that directly renders user-provided data into a template without proper escaping, allowing server-side template injection (SSTI) and potentially remote code execution during site generation.

**Impact:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI), potentially leading to remote code execution on the server during site generation, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Choose themes from trusted sources and actively maintained repositories.
*   Regularly update themes to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Avoid using themes that directly render user-provided data without proper sanitization.
*   Review theme code for potential templating vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

**Description:** Hexo's plugin system allows for extending functionality, but plugins can be malicious or contain security vulnerabilities.

**How Hexo Contributes:** Hexo's architecture allows plugins to execute code within the Hexo environment. This provides a vector for attackers to introduce malicious functionality or exploit vulnerabilities within the plugin.

**Example:** Installing a plugin that contains a backdoor, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the server or manipulate the generated website.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data theft, website defacement, introduction of malware, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
*   Carefully review the code of plugins before installing them.
*   Keep plugins updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Regularly audit installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or maintained.
*   Consider using a minimal set of plugins to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** The `_config.yml` file can contain sensitive information like deployment credentials or API keys.

**How Hexo Contributes:** Hexo uses the `_config.yml` file to store various settings, and developers might inadvertently store sensitive information there.

**Example:**  Storing FTP credentials or API keys for deployment services directly in the `_config.yml` file, which could be exposed if the `.git` directory is publicly accessible or through other server misconfigurations.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to deployment targets, external services, or sensitive data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in `_config.yml`.
*   Use environment variables or dedicated secret management tools to handle sensitive credentials.
*   Ensure proper `.gitignore` configuration to prevent committing sensitive files to version control.
*   Implement proper file permissions on the server to restrict access to configuration files.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Hexo and its plugins rely on numerous npm packages, which can have known security vulnerabilities.

**How Hexo Contributes:** Hexo's reliance on the Node.js ecosystem means it inherits the risks associated with dependency management. Outdated or vulnerable dependencies can introduce security flaws.

**Example:** A vulnerable version of a core dependency like a Markdown parser being used by Hexo, which could be exploited by an attacker.

**Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, impacts can range from denial of service to remote code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability, including critical ones)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Hexo and all its dependencies using `npm update` or similar tools.
*   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Consider using a dependency management tool that provides security scanning and alerts.
*   Pin dependency versions in `package.json` to ensure consistent builds and avoid unexpected updates with vulnerabilities.
