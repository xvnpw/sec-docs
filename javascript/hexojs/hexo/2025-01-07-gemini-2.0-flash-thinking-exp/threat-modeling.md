# Threat Model Analysis for hexojs/hexo

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via Source Files](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via_source_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the source Markdown, YAML, or other content files injects malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript within Markdown or HTML). When **Hexo** generates the static site, this malicious code becomes part of the website. When a user visits the affected page, their browser executes the malicious script.

**Impact:**  Leads to Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Attackers can steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected Component:** **Hexo**'s Markdown rendering engine, potentially specific Markdown processors used by **Hexo**, and the theme's templating engine (as the output is generated by Hexo).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Restrict write access to source files to trusted individuals.
- Implement a code review process for all content changes.
- If allowing user-generated content, sanitize all input before it is processed by **Hexo**.
- Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS.

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Theme or Plugin Vulnerabilities](./threats/server-side_template_injection__ssti__via_theme_or_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the Jinja2 templating engine used by a **Hexo** theme or plugin. They inject malicious code into template directives that are processed by **Hexo** on the server during site generation. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Impact:**  Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server. Attackers can gain full control of the server, access sensitive data, modify files, or pivot to other systems.

**Affected Component:**  **Hexo**'s integration with the Jinja2 templating engine, specifically how **Hexo** processes theme and plugin templates.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Use themes and plugins from trusted sources with a good security track record.
- Regularly update themes and plugins to patch known vulnerabilities.
- Consider using static analysis tools to scan theme and plugin code for potential vulnerabilities.
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization within theme and plugin code that interacts with **Hexo**'s templating.

## Threat: [Path Traversal Vulnerabilities during Asset Processing](./threats/path_traversal_vulnerabilities_during_asset_processing.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates file paths provided to **Hexo** or its plugins during asset processing (e.g., image handling, CSS processing). By using special characters like `../`, they can access or overwrite files outside of the intended directories on the server **during the Hexo build process**.

**Impact:**  Can lead to information disclosure (reading sensitive files), modification of critical files (e.g., configuration files), or even remote code execution if executable files are overwritten **during the site generation**.

**Affected Component:** **Hexo**'s core asset processing functions and potentially the plugin API that allows plugins to handle assets.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Avoid directly using user-provided input in file paths within **Hexo** plugins or custom scripts.
- Implement strict validation and sanitization of file paths within **Hexo** and its plugins.
- Use secure file handling functions provided by the operating system or programming language within **Hexo**'s codebase and plugins.
- Enforce proper access controls on the server's filesystem where **Hexo** operates.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks via Malicious Plugins or Themes](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_via_malicious_plugins_or_themes.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads a malicious plugin or theme to a public repository (e.g., npm). Unsuspecting users install this malicious component, which can contain backdoors, malware, or vulnerabilities that compromise their **Hexo** setup. **Hexo's plugin and theme installation mechanism is directly involved.**

**Impact:**  Can lead to any of the threats mentioned above, including remote code execution, data theft, and malicious content injection. The attacker gains access through the compromised plugin or theme integrated with **Hexo**.

**Affected Component:** The **Hexo** plugin and theme installation mechanism and the specific malicious plugin or theme interacting with **Hexo**.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Only install plugins and themes from trusted and reputable sources.
- Review the code of plugins and themes before installation, if possible.
- Be cautious of plugins or themes with very few users or recent updates.
- Utilize security scanning tools to check for known vulnerabilities in installed plugins and themes used with **Hexo**.

## Threat: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities via Plugin or Theme CLIs](./threats/command_injection_vulnerabilities_via_plugin_or_theme_clis.md)

**Description:** Some plugins or themes might extend the **Hexo** CLI with their own commands. If these commands do not properly sanitize user input, attackers could potentially inject arbitrary commands that are executed on the server when these custom CLI commands are used **in conjunction with Hexo**.

**Impact:**  Can lead to remote code execution and full server compromise if the vulnerable command is executed on the server through **Hexo's CLI extension mechanism**.

**Affected Component:**  Vulnerable **Hexo** plugins or themes that extend the CLI and their command-line interfaces integrated with **Hexo**.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Developers of plugins and themes should implement proper input validation and sanitization for all CLI commands that extend **Hexo**.
- Users should be cautious when using custom CLI commands provided by plugins or themes from untrusted sources within the **Hexo** environment.
- Regularly review the code of plugins and themes that extend the **Hexo** CLI.
