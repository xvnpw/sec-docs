## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Hexo Core Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_hexo_core_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Malicious Markdown Injection:**
    *   **Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Markdown:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft Markdown content containing malicious HTML or JavaScript code that is not properly sanitized or escaped by Hexo's rendering process.
        *   **Impact:**  Leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   **Achieve Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Successful injection of malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser when they visit the affected page.
        *   **Impact:**  Can lead to stealing user credentials/session tokens, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the website.
    *   **Trigger Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Potentially via vulnerable dependency) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within the Markdown parsing library used by Hexo (or its dependencies) to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to gain shell access to the server, modify configuration files, and deploy backdoors, leading to complete server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Theme Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_theme_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):**
    *   **Leverage Vulnerable Templating Engine Features (e.g., Nunjucks) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code into template expressions within the Hexo theme, exploiting vulnerabilities in the templating engine (like Nunjucks) to execute code on the server.
        *   **Impact:**  Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Successful exploitation of SSTI vulnerabilities allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
        *   **Impact:**  Provides the attacker with shell access to the server and the ability to exfiltrate sensitive data.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Theme Templates [CRITICAL]:**
    *   **Exploit Lack of Output Encoding:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Theme developers fail to properly encode dynamic content before displaying it in the browser, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript into the theme templates.
        *   **Impact:**  Leads to client-side attacks where malicious scripts execute in users' browsers, potentially stealing credentials or performing actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Vulnerable Plugin Installed:**
    *   **Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in installed Hexo plugins.
        *   **Impact:**  Can lead to various outcomes depending on the vulnerability, including Remote Code Execution (RCE) or data breaches.
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities within a plugin's code (e.g., unsafe input handling, deserialization flaws) to execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Impact:**  Allows the attacker to gain complete control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Manipulate Hexo Configuration:](./attack_tree_paths/4__manipulate_hexo_configuration.md)

*   **Modify `_config.yml`:**
    *   **Inject Malicious Scripts into Header/Footer Settings:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If an attacker gains write access to the `_config.yml` file, they can inject malicious JavaScript code into the header or footer settings.
        *   **Impact:**  Results in persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, affecting all visitors to the website.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Inject Malicious Content During Generation:](./attack_tree_paths/5__inject_malicious_content_during_generation.md)

*   **Modify Source Files (Markdown, Data Files):**
    *   **Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** If an attacker gains write access to the source Markdown or data files, they can directly inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
        *   **Impact:**  Leads to persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities as the malicious content is included in the generated static files.
