Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance have been identified.

It is important to note that this project is a VS Code extension, not a standalone publicly accessible application. Therefore, the typical attack vectors for web applications are not directly applicable.

While potential vulnerabilities might exist within the extension's code, particularly in features like "Print to HTML" or Markdown parsing, these would likely require a user to open a malicious Markdown file within their VS Code environment. This scenario does not align with the definition of an "external attacker" exploiting a "publicly available instance" as described in the prompt.

Therefore, based on the provided files and the specified criteria, there are no vulnerabilities to list that meet the requirements.

**No vulnerabilities found meeting the specified criteria.**
