**2. System Overview**

Standard Notes is a robust, open-source note-taking application distinguished by its commitment to end-to-end encryption. Its fundamental function is to enable users to securely create, store, and seamlessly synchronize notes across a multitude of devices. The application's core tenet is the prioritization of user privacy and data security through client-side encryption.

**3. Architectural Design**

The Standard Notes architecture is logically divided into client-side applications and backend services, each with distinct responsibilities.

**3.1. Client Applications**

These are the applications that users directly interact with to access Standard Notes functionality.

*   **Web Application:** A single-page application (SPA) accessible through web browsers, likely built using a JavaScript framework such as React. It communicates with the backend API via HTTPS, typically interacting with RESTful endpoints.
*   **Desktop Applications (macOS, Windows, Linux):**  Standalone applications, often built using frameworks like Electron, which embed a Chromium browser. This allows for cross-platform development while providing access to native operating system features. They communicate with the backend API over HTTPS.
*   **Mobile Applications (iOS, Android):** Native or hybrid mobile applications developed using platform-specific SDKs (Swift/Objective-C for iOS, Kotlin/Java for Android) or cross-platform frameworks like React Native. They interact with the backend API via HTTPS.

**Key Responsibilities of Client Applications:**

*   Rendering the user interface and providing a seamless user experience for note management.
*   Facilitating note creation, editing, deletion, and organization.
*   Local storage of encrypted notes, enabling offline access.
*   Implementing end-to-end encryption and decryption of notes using keys derived from the user's password or a securely stored key.
*   Initiating and managing communication with the backend API for user authentication, synchronization, and other services.
*   Loading and executing extensions and themes, potentially within a sandboxed environment.

**3.2. Backend Services**

These are the server-side components that provide the core infrastructure and functionalities for the application.

*   **API Server (Ruby on Rails):** The central point of contact for client applications. It handles:
    *   User authentication (login, registration, password reset) likely using methods like username/password and potentially multi-factor authentication.
    *   Authorization, ensuring users can only access their own data.
    *   Synchronization requests, receiving encrypted notes from clients and providing updated encrypted notes. Key endpoints likely include `/api/v1/notes`, `/api/v1/sync`, `/api/v1/users`.
    *   Account management, including profile updates and subscription management if applicable.
*   **Database (PostgreSQL):** Stores persistent data, including:
    *   User account information (usernames, hashed passwords, email addresses).
    *   Encrypted note content and associated metadata (timestamps, tags).
    *   Potentially, information about extensions, themes, and subscriptions.
*   **Synchronization Logic (Likely integrated within the API Server):** Manages the process of merging changes from different clients, handling potential conflicts, and ensuring data consistency across all devices.
*   **Authentication Logic (Likely integrated within the API Server):**  Handles the verification of user credentials and the generation of authentication tokens (e.g., JWT).
*   **Extension/Theme Hosting (Potentially a separate service or part of the API Server):**  May serve static files for extensions and themes or provide an API for retrieving extension metadata.

**Key Responsibilities of Backend Services:**

*   Securely managing user accounts and their associated credentials.
*   Receiving and securely storing encrypted note data without the ability to decrypt it.
*   Orchestrating the synchronization process between different user devices.
*   Enforcing authentication and authorization policies to protect user data.
*   Potentially managing user subscriptions and payment processing.
*   Serving and managing extensions and themes for client applications.

**4. Data Flow**

The fundamental data flow revolves around the secure creation, encryption, synchronization, and decryption of user notes.

*   **Note Creation/Modification:**
    *   A user creates or modifies a note within a client application.
    *   The client application encrypts the note content locally using an encryption key derived from the user's password (or a key securely managed by the application's key management system).
    *   The encrypted note, along with relevant metadata, is stored locally on the client device for offline access.
*   **Synchronization Process:**
    *   The client application initiates a synchronization request to the API server via an HTTPS POST request to an endpoint like `/api/v1/sync`.
    *   The request includes the encrypted note data and potentially information about local changes.
    *   The API server authenticates the user.
    *   Upon successful authentication, the server receives the encrypted note data.
    *   The server stores the encrypted note in the database, associating it with the user's account.
    *   When another client application belonging to the same user synchronizes, it sends a similar request to the API server.
    *   The API server retrieves the latest encrypted notes associated with the user from the database.
    *   The API server sends the encrypted notes back to the requesting client application via an HTTPS response.
*   **Note Decryption and Viewing:**
    *   The client application receives the encrypted note data from the server or local storage.
    *   The client application decrypts the note content using the user's derived encryption key.
    *   The decrypted note is then rendered and displayed to the user within the application's interface.

**5. Security Considerations (Detailed)**

*   **End-to-End Encryption (E2EE):**  A cornerstone of Standard Notes security. Notes are encrypted on the client-side *before* transmission to the server, ensuring that the backend has zero-knowledge of the note content. This relies heavily on robust client-side encryption libraries and secure key derivation.
*   **Client-Side Key Derivation and Management:** The security of E2EE hinges on the secure generation and management of encryption keys on the client. Typically, a key is derived from the user's master password using a key derivation function (KDF) like PBKDF2 or Argon2. Secure storage of this derived key (or the means to derive it) on the client is critical.
*   **Secure Authentication:**  Robust authentication mechanisms are paramount. This likely involves:
    *   Secure password hashing with salting using algorithms like bcrypt or Argon2.
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks through rate limiting and account lockout policies.
    *   Potentially, support for multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.
*   **Authorization:**  Strict authorization controls are necessary to ensure that users can only access and modify their own data. The backend API must enforce these policies on every request.
*   **Data at Rest Encryption:** While E2EE protects note content, the database itself should also employ encryption at rest to protect other sensitive data like user credentials and metadata. Database-level encryption or full-disk encryption on the server can achieve this.
*   **Data in Transit Encryption:** All communication between client applications and the backend API *must* be encrypted using HTTPS (TLS). This protects data from eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Input Validation:**  Rigorous input validation is crucial on both the client and server-side to prevent various injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, cross-site scripting). The server-side should never trust data received from the client.
*   **Secure Storage of User Credentials:**  Passwords should never be stored in plaintext. Strong, salted hashing algorithms are essential.
*   **Vulnerability Management:**  A proactive approach to vulnerability management is necessary, including:
    *   Regular security audits and penetration testing.
    *   Keeping dependencies up-to-date with security patches.
    *   Having a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities.
*   **Extension and Theme Security:**  The architecture for extensions and themes needs to consider potential security risks. This might involve:
    *   Sandboxing extensions to limit their access to system resources and user data.
    *   Code signing or verification of extensions to ensure their integrity.
    *   Clear permission models for extensions.
