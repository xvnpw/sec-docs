# Threat Model Analysis for standardnotes/app

## Threat: [Compromised Encryption Keys Stored Locally](./threats/compromised_encryption_keys_stored_locally.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's device and retrieves the locally stored encryption keys due to insecure storage practices within the Standard Notes application. This could be due to storing keys in plaintext or using weak protection mechanisms.
*   **Impact:** Complete loss of confidentiality for all stored notes, as the attacker can decrypt them without the user's password.
*   **Affected Component:** Local Storage (specifically the area where encryption keys are persisted by the application).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement robust key derivation functions (KDFs) with salting and iteration. Encrypt the stored keys themselves using a key derived from the user's master password or a hardware-backed keystore. Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms (e.g., Keychain on macOS/iOS, Credential Manager on Windows, Keystore on Android).

## Threat: [Weak Key Derivation Function Allows Brute-Force Attack](./threats/weak_key_derivation_function_allows_brute-force_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker obtains the stored (encrypted) encryption keys and attempts to brute-force the user's master password because the Standard Notes application uses a weak or improperly implemented key derivation function.
*   **Impact:** If successful, the attacker can derive the encryption keys and decrypt all stored notes, leading to a complete loss of confidentiality.
*   **Affected Component:** Key Derivation Function (within the authentication and encryption modules of the application).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Use industry-standard, well-vetted KDFs like Argon2id with appropriate parameters (salt length, memory cost, iterations). Regularly review and update KDF implementations based on security best practices. Implement rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms within the application to hinder brute-force attempts.

## Threat: [Client-Side Encryption Implementation Flaws Leading to Plaintext Exposure](./threats/client-side_encryption_implementation_flaws_leading_to_plaintext_exposure.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability exists in the client-side encryption logic of the Standard Notes application (e.g., a buffer overflow, incorrect use of cryptographic primitives) that allows an attacker to bypass the encryption process and access notes in plaintext. This could be exploited through a crafted note or by manipulating the application's state.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of individual notes or potentially all notes, compromising confidentiality.
*   **Affected Component:** Encryption Module (specifically the client-side implementation within the application).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement rigorous code reviews and security testing (including penetration testing) of the encryption implementation within the application. Use well-established cryptographic libraries and follow their best practices. Employ static and dynamic analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the application's encryption code.

## Threat: [Malicious Extensions Injecting Code or Stealing Data](./threats/malicious_extensions_injecting_code_or_stealing_data.md)

**Description:** A user installs a malicious extension that exploits vulnerabilities in the Standard Notes application's extension system to inject arbitrary code into the application or steal sensitive data, including encryption keys or plaintext notes. This is a direct consequence of the application's extension architecture.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the application and user data, potentially leading to data exfiltration, account takeover, or further malicious actions.
*   **Affected Component:** Extensions System, Extension API (provided by the application).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement strong sandboxing for extensions to limit their access to application resources and user data. Implement a rigorous review process for extensions before they are made available to users through the application's extension marketplace or installation mechanisms. Provide clear warnings and permissions requests within the application when extensions attempt to access sensitive data or functionalities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Extension Sandboxing Allowing Escape](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_extension_sandboxing_allowing_escape.md)

**Description:** A flaw exists in the Standard Notes application's extension sandboxing mechanism that allows a malicious extension to bypass the intended restrictions and gain broader access to the application or the underlying operating system.
*   **Impact:** Similar to malicious extensions, this can lead to complete compromise of the application and user data, potentially allowing for system-level attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Extensions System, Sandboxing Implementation (within the application).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Employ robust and well-tested sandboxing technologies within the application. Regularly audit the sandboxing implementation for vulnerabilities. Implement multiple layers of security to prevent sandbox escapes within the application's architecture.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Channel Delivering Malicious Updates](./threats/insecure_update_channel_delivering_malicious_updates.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the Standard Notes application's update mechanism and distributes a malicious update containing malware or backdoors to users. This is a direct vulnerability in the application's update process.
*   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of user devices and data, potentially leading to data theft, ransomware attacks, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected Component:** Update Mechanism, Update Client (within the application).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:** Implement secure update mechanisms using code signing and HTTPS to ensure the authenticity and integrity of updates distributed by the application. Verify the digital signatures of updates before applying them within the application.
