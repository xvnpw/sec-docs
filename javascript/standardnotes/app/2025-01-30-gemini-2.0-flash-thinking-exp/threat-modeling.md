    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Employ platform-specific secure storage mechanisms like Keychain (macOS/iOS), Credential Manager (Windows), Keystore (Android). Encrypt keys before storing them locally. Implement proper file permissions to restrict access to key storage.

## Threat: [Weak Key Derivation Function (KDF)](./threats/weak_key_derivation_function__kdf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker obtaining a user's password hash (e.g., from a server breach or phishing) could attempt offline brute-force or dictionary attacks to recover the password and subsequently derive the encryption keys if a weak KDF is used.
    *   **Impact:** High. Offline password cracking could lead to the derivation of encryption keys, allowing decryption of notes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Password Handling and Key Derivation Function (within client applications and potentially server-side for password storage if applicable)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Use strong and well-vetted KDFs like Argon2id or PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 with high iteration counts and unique salts per user. Regularly review and update KDF parameters based on security best practices.

## Threat: [Implementation Flaws in Encryption/Decryption Logic](./threats/implementation_flaws_in_encryptiondecryption_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might introduce bugs or errors in the code implementing encryption and decryption. An attacker could exploit these flaws to bypass encryption, cause data leakage, or perform side-channel attacks.
    *   **Impact:** High. Data breaches, potential for partial or full decryption of notes due to implementation errors.
    *   **Affected Component:** Encryption/Decryption Logic (specific code implementing cryptographic operations within the application)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Conduct thorough code reviews, security audits, and penetration testing specifically focusing on encryption and decryption logic. Utilize well-tested and audited cryptographic libraries instead of implementing custom cryptography where possible. Employ static and dynamic analysis tools to detect potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Sync Service Compromise (Server-Side)](./threats/sync_service_compromise__server-side_.md)

*   **Description:** Although server-side, a compromise of Standard Notes' server infrastructure could allow an attacker to access user metadata or manipulate sync data. While note content is encrypted, server compromise can have significant impact.
    *   **Impact:** High. Data breaches (metadata), potential for data manipulation, service disruption, loss of user trust.
    *   **Affected Component:** Server Infrastructure, Sync Service (Standard Notes backend servers)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (for the overall ecosystem, though less directly "app-introduced")
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer (Server-Side):** Implement robust security measures for server infrastructure: strong access controls, intrusion detection, regular security audits, incident response plans, secure server configuration, and patching.

## Threat: [Unencrypted Local Storage](./threats/unencrypted_local_storage.md)

*   **Description:** Developers might accidentally or intentionally store notes or encryption keys in unencrypted form in local storage (e.g., browser local storage, application files). An attacker with local device access could easily read this data.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Complete compromise of note confidentiality if local storage is accessed by an attacker or malware.
    *   **Affected Component:** Local Storage Module (within client applications)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Enforce encryption for all locally stored data, including notes and encryption keys. Regularly audit local storage mechanisms to ensure no unencrypted data is present. Use secure coding practices to prevent accidental unencrypted storage.

## Threat: [Insufficient Local Storage Protection](./threats/insufficient_local_storage_protection.md)

*   **Description:** Even if encrypted, local storage might have insufficient platform-level protection (e.g., weak file permissions). An attacker or malicious application on the same device could potentially access the encrypted data.
    *   **Impact:** High. Unauthorized access to encrypted notes if local storage protection is insufficient, potentially leading to decryption.
    *   **Affected Component:** Local Storage Module, File System Permissions (within client applications)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Utilize platform-specific secure storage mechanisms that provide access control. Ensure proper file permissions are set to restrict access to local storage to only the Standard Notes application and the user.

## Threat: [Malicious Extensions](./threats/malicious_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** Users might install malicious extensions designed to steal decrypted notes, inject malicious code, or compromise application security. Extensions could be distributed through unofficial channels or compromised official channels.
    *   **Impact:** Critical to High. Data breaches (note theft), malware infection, compromise of application functionality, depending on extension capabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Extensions System, Extensions API (within client applications)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** Implement a robust extension vetting and review process. Provide clear warnings to users about extension risks. Consider sandboxing extensions to limit their access to application resources and data. Implement a permission system for extensions.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Extensions](./threats/vulnerable_extensions.md)
