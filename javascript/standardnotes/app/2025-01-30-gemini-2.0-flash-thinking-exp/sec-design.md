# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Provide a secure and private note-taking application.
 - Offer end-to-end encryption to protect user data.
 - Ensure accessibility across multiple platforms (web, desktop, mobile).
 - Maintain user trust by prioritizing data security and privacy.
 - Offer a reliable and stable note-taking service.

- Business Risks:
 - Data breach leading to exposure of user notes.
 - Loss of user trust due to security vulnerabilities.
 - Service unavailability impacting user productivity.
 - Compliance issues related to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
 - Supply chain attacks compromising the application or its dependencies.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: End-to-end encryption of notes (described in application documentation and likely implemented within the client applications).
 - security control: Password-based authentication (standard authentication mechanism for user accounts).
 - security control: Secure software development lifecycle (inferred from the project's focus on security and privacy, although specific details are not provided in the input).
 - security control: HTTPS for communication (standard practice for web applications, assumed for Standard Notes web and API interactions).
 - accepted risk: Reliance on user-generated passwords for account security (inherent risk with password-based authentication).
 - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies (common risk in software development, requires ongoing dependency management).

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance account security.
 - security control: Regularly perform penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to identify and address security weaknesses.
 - security control: Implement a robust security incident response plan to handle potential security breaches effectively.
 - security control: Conduct regular security awareness training for developers and operations teams.
 - security control: Implement static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline.
 - security control: Implement software composition analysis (SCA) to manage and monitor third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Securely authenticate users accessing the application.
  - Requirement: Support strong password policies and consider passwordless authentication options.
  - Requirement: Implement session management to control user access after successful authentication.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) if different user roles or access levels are required (although not explicitly stated as needed for a note-taking app, it's good practice for future scalability).
  - Requirement: Ensure users can only access and modify their own notes and data.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: Validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection if a database is directly accessed from the client - unlikely in this architecture, but relevant for backend services).
  - Requirement: Sanitize user-generated content before rendering it in the application to prevent XSS.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Utilize strong encryption algorithms for end-to-end encryption of notes (likely AES-256 or similar).
  - Requirement: Securely manage encryption keys, ensuring they are not accessible to unauthorized parties.
  - Requirement: Use HTTPS for all communication channels to protect data in transit.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - User note creation, editing, and deletion.
 - Note synchronization across devices.
 - User authentication and account management.
 - Subscription management (if applicable).

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - User notes: Highly sensitive. Contain personal thoughts, ideas, and potentially confidential information. Confidentiality and integrity are critical.
 - User credentials (passwords): Highly sensitive. Confidentiality and integrity are critical to prevent unauthorized access.
 - User metadata (account information, settings): Sensitive. Confidentiality and integrity are important to protect user privacy and account security.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What type of database is used for the backend? (Relational, NoSQL?)
 - What specific cloud provider is used for deployment (if any)?
 - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
 - What is the process for managing and rotating encryption keys?
 - Are there any third-party integrations that need to be considered from a security perspective?
 - What is the current level of security awareness training for developers?

- Assumptions:
 - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure and private note-taking application. User privacy and data security are paramount.
 - SECURITY POSTURE: End-to-end encryption is a core security control. HTTPS is used for all communication. Secure software development lifecycle practices are followed.
 - DESIGN: The application uses a cloud-based backend architecture with separate services for API gateway, authentication, and synchronization. A relational or NoSQL database is used for persistent storage. Client applications handle end-to-end encryption. Deployment is likely on a major cloud provider using multiple availability zones for high availability. GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD is used for build and deployment automation.
