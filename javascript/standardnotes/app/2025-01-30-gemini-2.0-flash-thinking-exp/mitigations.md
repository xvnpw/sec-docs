## Mitigation Strategy: [Sandboxing for Extensions and Themes](./mitigation_strategies/sandboxing_for_extensions_and_themes.md)

### Description:
1.  **Implement a Secure Sandbox Environment:**  Design and implement a robust sandbox environment within Standard Notes to isolate extensions and themes from the core application and the user's system.
2.  **Restrict API Access:** Limit the APIs and functionalities that extensions and themes can access.  Grant only necessary permissions and restrict access to sensitive core application functionalities and data.
3.  **Resource Isolation:** Isolate extension and theme resources (e.g., storage, network access, processing power) to prevent them from interfering with the core application or other extensions.
4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) Enforcement:** For web-based extensions, strictly enforce a Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which extensions can load resources and execute scripts, mitigating XSS risks.
5.  **Regular Sandbox Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the sandbox implementation itself to ensure its effectiveness and identify any potential bypass vulnerabilities.
### Threats Mitigated:
*   **Malicious Extension/Theme Compromise (High Severity):** Limits the damage a malicious extension or theme can cause by preventing it from accessing sensitive core application data or system resources.
*   **Vulnerable Extension/Theme Exploitation (Medium to High Severity):**  Reduces the impact of vulnerabilities in extensions or themes by containing them within the sandbox and preventing them from escalating to compromise the entire application.
*   **Cross-Extension Interference (Medium Severity):** Prevents poorly designed or malicious extensions from interfering with the functionality or security of other extensions or the core application.
### Impact:
High reduction in the potential impact of malicious or vulnerable extensions and themes. Significantly enhances the security and stability of the Standard Notes application when using extensions.

Likely partially implemented. Some level of isolation is probably in place for extensions, but the *robustness* and *security depth* of the sandboxing may vary.
### Missing Implementation:
A fully robust and security-audited sandbox environment with strict API access controls, resource isolation, and CSP enforcement might be missing or require further strengthening.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Permissions System for Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/permissions_system_for_extensions.md)

### Description:
1.  **Define Granular Permissions:**  Identify and define granular permissions that extensions might require to access specific functionalities or data within Standard Notes. Examples include: accessing note content, modifying settings, network access, local storage access, etc.
2.  **Request Permissions at Installation:**  Require extensions to declare the permissions they need during the installation process.
3.  **User Consent for Permissions:**  Implement a user interface that clearly displays the permissions requested by an extension to the user *before* installation. Users should be able to review and explicitly grant or deny these permissions.
4.  **Runtime Permission Enforcement:**  Enforce the permission system at runtime.  The Standard Notes application should verify that an extension has the necessary permissions before allowing it to access protected functionalities or data.
5.  **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the permission system based on the principle of least privilege. Extensions should only request and be granted the minimum permissions necessary for their intended functionality.
6.  **Permission Revocation:**  Allow users to easily review and revoke permissions granted to extensions at any time after installation.
### Threats Mitigated:
*   **Over-Permissioned Extensions (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents extensions from gaining excessive permissions that they don't need, reducing the potential damage if an extension is compromised or malicious.
*   **Data Misuse by Extensions (Medium Severity):** Limits the ability of extensions to access and misuse user data by controlling their access to specific data and functionalities.
*   **Unintended Extension Behavior (Medium Severity):**  Provides users with more control over extension behavior and reduces the risk of unintended or malicious actions.
### Impact:
Medium to High reduction in risk by giving users control over extension capabilities and limiting the potential for misuse of permissions. Enhances user privacy and security when using extensions.
### Currently Implemented:
Potentially partially implemented. Some level of permission control for extensions might exist, but the *granularity* and *user control* may vary.
### Missing Implementation:
A fully granular permission system with clear user consent mechanisms, runtime enforcement, and easy permission revocation might be missing or require further development.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Automated Security Scanning for Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/automated_security_scanning_for_extensions.md)

### Description:
1.  **Integrate SAST Tools:** Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the extension submission and update pipeline. These tools should automatically scan extension code for known vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, injection flaws, insecure coding patterns).
2.  **Custom Security Rules:**  Configure SAST tools with custom security rules specific to the Standard Notes extension environment and common vulnerabilities relevant to JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
3.  **Regular Scanning Schedule:**  Schedule automated security scans to run not only on new extension submissions but also periodically on existing approved extensions to detect newly discovered vulnerabilities or regressions.
4.  **Vulnerability Reporting and Alerting:**  Configure the scanning tools to automatically generate reports of identified vulnerabilities and alert the extension review team or security team.
5.  **Integration with Review Process:**  Integrate the results of automated security scans into the extension review process.  Flag extensions with high-severity vulnerabilities for manual review or rejection.

### Impact:
High reduction in risk by proactively identifying and mitigating known vulnerabilities in the core Standard Notes application and its dependencies. Reduces the attack surface and improves overall security.
### Currently Implemented:
Likely partially implemented. Some level of automated scanning might be in place, but the *comprehensiveness*, *frequency*, and *integration* may vary.
### Missing Implementation:
A fully integrated and comprehensive vulnerability scanning system with automated dependency scanning, prioritized remediation, and issue tracking integration might be missing or require further development.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rapid Patching and Release Cycle for Security Issues](./mitigation_strategies/rapid_patching_and_release_cycle_for_security_issues.md)

### Description:
1.  **Prioritize Security Fixes:**  Establish a clear policy that prioritizes security fixes above feature development when vulnerabilities are discovered.
2.  **Expedited Patching Process:**  Develop an expedited process for developing, testing, and releasing security patches. This process should be faster than the regular release cycle.
3.  **Automated Testing for Patches:**  Implement automated testing (unit tests, integration tests, regression tests) to ensure security patches are effective and do not introduce new issues.
4.  **Staged Rollout (Optional but Recommended):** Consider a staged rollout approach for security patches, releasing them to a subset of users initially before wider deployment to monitor for any unforeseen issues.
5.  **Clear Communication of Security Updates:**  Communicate security updates clearly and promptly to users, informing them about the vulnerability, the fix, and the importance of updating to the latest version.
6.  **Automated Update Mechanisms:**  Implement automated update mechanisms within the Standard Notes application to make it easy for users to receive and install security patches quickly.
### Threats Mitigated:
*   **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities (High to Critical Severity):**  Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit known vulnerabilities by releasing patches quickly.
*   **Widespread Impact of Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Limits the potential for widespread impact by ensuring users receive security fixes promptly.
