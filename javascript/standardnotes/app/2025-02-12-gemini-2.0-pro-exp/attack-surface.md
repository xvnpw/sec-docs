# Attack Surface Analysis for standardnotes/app

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Encryption Key Compromise (App Code)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_encryption_key_compromise__app_code_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the user's master encryption key due to flaws *within the Standard Notes client application code*.
*   **How App Contributes:** The client application is *entirely responsible* for generating, storing (temporarily), and using the encryption key. Any weakness in this process is a direct vulnerability in the app.
*   **Example:** A bug in the key derivation function (KDF) implementation, insecure storage of the key in memory (allowing for memory scraping), or a vulnerability that allows a malicious extension to access the key. A compromised build process injecting malicious code.
*   **Impact:** Complete loss of confidentiality for all user notes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies (Developers):**
    *   Use a strong, well-vetted KDF (e.g., Argon2id) with a high iteration count, ensuring *correct implementation* within the app code.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within the client to prevent injection attacks that could compromise key handling.
    *   *Secure the build process* to prevent supply chain attacks that could inject key-logging or key-exfiltration code.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the client application *code*, focusing on cryptographic operations.
    *   Implement secure memory management to prevent key leakage, ensuring keys are zeroed out after use and protected from unauthorized access.
    *   Implement robust extension sandboxing and permission controls *within the client application* to prevent extensions from accessing the key.
    *   Provide a secure and transparent extension review process, focusing on code analysis for potential key compromise vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Extensions (App Code Interaction)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_extensions__app_code_interaction_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a Standard Notes extension, or publishes a malicious extension, to gain access to user data or the encryption key *by interacting with vulnerabilities in the core application's extension handling*.
*   **How App Contributes:** The Standard Notes client application *defines the extension API and manages the interaction between extensions and the core application*.  Weaknesses in this interaction are direct vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** The client application fails to properly sandbox an extension, allowing it to access the main application's memory space and steal the encryption key.  The client's inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism between the app and extensions is insecure.
*   **Impact:** Potential loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data. Could lead to complete account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies (Developers):**
    *   Implement a rigorous review process for all extensions, focusing on *code analysis* to identify potential security flaws that could interact with the main application.
    *   Enforce *strict sandboxing* and permission controls for extensions *within the client application code*. This is the primary defense.
    *   Provide clear documentation and guidelines for extension developers on secure coding practices, specifically addressing how to interact safely with the main application's API.
    *   Regularly audit existing extensions for vulnerabilities, focusing on how they interact with the core application.
    *   Implement a mechanism for quickly disabling or removing malicious extensions, controlled by the *client application*.
    *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) *within the client application* to limit the resources extensions can access, further restricting their capabilities.
    * Secure the inter-process communication (IPC) between the client and extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Vulnerabilities (Standard Notes Server Code)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_vulnerabilities__standard_notes_server_code_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability *in the Standard Notes server software code* to gain access to encrypted user data, metadata, or the server infrastructure.
*   **How App Contributes:** This is entirely dependent on the code of the Standard Notes server application.
*   **Example:** A SQL injection vulnerability in the server code allows database access. A remote code execution vulnerability allows server takeover.  Improper handling of authentication tokens.
*   **Impact:** Potential loss of confidentiality (of encrypted data and metadata), integrity, and availability. Could lead to a denial-of-service attack or compromise of the entire server infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies (Developers):**
    *   Follow secure coding practices *within the server codebase* to prevent common web application vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, command injection).
    *   Regularly update all server-side dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. This includes libraries used by the *server application*.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the *server software code*.
    *   Implement robust logging and monitoring *within the server application* to detect and respond to security incidents.
    *   Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms *within the server code*.
