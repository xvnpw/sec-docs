Okay, let's create a design document for the Standard Notes application based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a secure and private note-taking application across multiple platforms.
*   Ensure data confidentiality and integrity for user notes.
*   Offer a simple, clean, and distraction-free user experience.
*   Maintain a sustainable development model through open-source contributions and paid subscriptions.
*   Build user trust through transparency and a strong security focus.
*   Provide end-to-end encryption.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Data breaches leading to exposure of user notes.
*   Loss of user data due to system failures or vulnerabilities.
*   Reputational damage due to security incidents or privacy violations.
*   Compromise of encryption keys or mechanisms.
*   Inability to maintain the application due to lack of resources or developer interest.
*   Supply chain attacks.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: End-to-end encryption (E2EE) using XChaCha20-Poly1305 and Argon2 for key derivation. (Implemented in the application logic and libraries).
*   security control: Cross-platform support (Web, Desktop, Mobile) to ensure consistent security. (Architecture design).
*   security control: Open-source codebase, allowing for community review and auditing. (Development model).
*   security control: Two-factor authentication (2FA) support. (Implemented in server and client applications).
*   security control: Automatic synchronization with encryption. (Implemented in the application logic).
*   security control: Use of well-vetted cryptographic libraries. (Dependencies).
*   security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing (mentioned on their website, assumed to be ongoing).
*   security control: Data at rest and in transit encryption.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party services for infrastructure (e.g., hosting providers, email delivery).
*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and dependencies.
*   accepted risk: User error, such as weak passwords or compromised devices.
*   accepted risk: The possibility of sophisticated, targeted attacks that may bypass existing security measures.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust vulnerability disclosure program (bug bounty).
*   Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Implement software composition analysis (SCA) to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
*   Consider implementing certificate pinning to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   Provide security hardening guides for self-hosting users.
*   Implement account activity monitoring and alerting for suspicious behavior.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Strong password policies enforced.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
    *   Secure session management with appropriate timeouts.
    *   Protection against brute-force and credential stuffing attacks.
    *   Secure password reset mechanisms.

*   Authorization:
    *   Role-based access control (RBAC) for different user roles (e.g., free, paid, administrator).
    *   Access to notes and features restricted based on user subscription level.
    *   Proper segregation of user data.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Sanitization of all user inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Validation of data types and formats to prevent unexpected behavior.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard encryption algorithms (already implemented).
    *   Secure key management practices, including key rotation and protection.
    *   Protection against replay attacks.
    *   Data integrity checks using cryptographic hashes or signatures.

    end
```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code and push changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions (CI/CD pipeline) is triggered by pushes and pull requests.
3.  Code review is performed as part of the pull request process.
4.  The CI pipeline runs various tests, including:
    *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the codebase.
    *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
    *   Unit tests to verify the functionality of individual components.
    *   Integration tests to verify the interaction between different parts of the application.
5.  If all tests pass, the CI pipeline builds the application for different platforms (Web, Desktop, Mobile).
6.  Build artifacts are created and made available for deployment.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   Code review: Manual inspection of code changes to identify potential security issues.
*   SAST: Automated analysis of the codebase to detect vulnerabilities.
*   SCA: Automated analysis of dependencies to identify known vulnerabilities.
*   Automated testing: Unit and integration tests to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   CI/CD pipeline: Automation of the build process to ensure consistency and reduce manual errors.
*   Signed commits: To ensure the integrity and authenticity of the code.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   User authentication and authorization.
*   Data synchronization and storage.
*   Encryption key management.
*   Application updates and deployments.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   User notes: Highly sensitive, confidential user data.
*   User account information (email, password hash, subscription details): Sensitive personal information.
*   Encryption keys: Extremely sensitive, must be protected at all costs.
*   Application logs: Potentially sensitive, may contain information about user activity or system behavior.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific threat actors are considered most relevant (e.g., script kiddies, organized crime, nation-states)?
*   What is the acceptable downtime for the application?
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA)?
*   What is the process for handling security incidents?
*   Details about infrastructure and hosting environment.
*   Details about monitoring and logging.

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure and private note-taking service.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The existing security controls are implemented correctly and effectively.
*   DESIGN: The application architecture is as described in the GitHub repository and documentation. The syncing server is the primary backend component. The deployment environment for the hosted service uses a load balancer and multiple application server instances.
*   The build process uses GitHub Actions.
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing are conducted.
