        print("* **Decrypted Note Exfiltration:** A malicious extension uses an API flaw to access and send decrypted notes to an external server.")
        print("* **Encryption Key Compromise:** An extension exploits a vulnerability to access or manipulate the storage/retrieval of encryption keys.")
