# Threat Model Analysis for standardnotes/app

## Threat: [Weaknesses in Encryption Implementation](./threats/weaknesses_in_encryption_implementation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit flaws in the encryption algorithms or their implementation within the Standard Notes application to decrypt user notes without authorization. This might involve cryptanalysis or exploiting implementation errors in the XChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-256-CBC algorithms or their usage within the app's codebase.

**Impact:** Full compromise of user notes, exposing sensitive information.

**Affected Component:** Encryption Module (within core application and potentially extensions)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Rigorous code reviews of encryption logic, adherence to cryptographic best practices, regular updates to cryptographic libraries used by the application, penetration testing specifically focused on the application's encryption implementation.

## Threat: [Insecure Local Storage of Encrypted Keys](./threats/insecure_local_storage_of_encrypted_keys.md)

**Description:** An attacker with local access to a user's device could potentially extract the locally stored encrypted keys if the Standard Notes application's storage mechanisms do not adequately protect them. This could involve exploiting file permissions, insecure caching within the application's data directory, or vulnerabilities in the operating system's key storage integration used by the app.

**Impact:** Ability to decrypt the user's notes if the master password is also known or if the key storage is compromised directly.

**Affected Component:** Local Storage Module, Key Management Module

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Utilize secure storage mechanisms provided by the operating system (e.g., Keychain on macOS/iOS, Credential Manager on Windows) and ensure the Standard Notes application correctly interfaces with these systems. Consider encrypting the key storage itself with a key derived from a user-specific secret within the application's secure storage.

## Threat: [Malicious Extensions Stealing Data](./threats/malicious_extensions_stealing_data.md)

**Description:** A user installs a seemingly legitimate but malicious extension for the Standard Notes application. This extension, leveraging the application's extension API, could exfiltrate decrypted note content, encryption keys, or other sensitive information directly from the application's memory or storage.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of user data, including access to decrypted notes and potentially the ability to impersonate the user or manipulate their data within the application.

**Affected Component:** Extensions API, Extension Loading Mechanism

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement a robust extension vetting process before allowing extensions to be listed or easily installed. Enforce strict permission models for extensions, limiting their access to sensitive data and APIs. Provide clear warnings to users about the risks associated with installing third-party extensions. Consider implementing sandboxing for extensions to limit their impact if compromised.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Extension APIs Allowing Data Access](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_extension_apis_allowing_data_access.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the APIs provided by the Standard Notes application for extension developers could allow malicious extensions (or even unintentionally buggy ones) to access data or functionality they shouldn't. This could enable unauthorized access to decrypted notes, encryption keys, or the ability to manipulate application settings.

**Impact:** Potential for unauthorized data access, modification, or application crashes due to extension exploitation of API weaknesses.

**Affected Component:** Extensions API

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Thoroughly audit and test extension APIs for security vulnerabilities. Implement strong input validation and sanitization for all data passed through the APIs. Enforce the principle of least privilege for extension access, granting only necessary permissions. Provide clear documentation and security guidelines for extension developers. Implement rate limiting or other protective measures against API abuse.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Application Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_application_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise a third-party library or dependency that is directly integrated into the Standard Notes application. This could involve injecting malicious code into the dependency's repository or build process, which is then included in the distributed version of the application.

**Impact:** Wide-scale compromise of user data and the application's integrity, potentially affecting all users of the compromised application version.

**Affected Component:** Build Process, Dependency Management

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:** Implement robust dependency management practices, including using dependency pinning and verifying checksums. Utilize software composition analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies. Regularly update dependencies to patch known security flaws. Consider using private or mirrored repositories for dependencies to reduce the risk of compromise.
