## Attack Tree Path: [Access Decrypted Notes in Memory](./attack_tree_paths/access_decrypted_notes_in_memory.md)

**Description:** If the Standard Notes application doesn't securely manage decrypted notes in memory, an attacker with local access could potentially dump the application's memory to retrieve sensitive information.
**How:** Exploiting memory leaks, using debugging tools, or leveraging vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary code execution within the application's process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Encrypted Notes on Disk](./attack_tree_paths/access_encrypted_notes_on_disk.md)

**Description:** Even though notes are encrypted, weaknesses in the encryption implementation could allow an attacker with local access to decrypt the stored data.
**How:** Using weak encryption algorithms that are susceptible to brute-force or cryptanalysis, or if the encryption keys are easily guessable or compromised.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Encryption Keys](./attack_tree_paths/steal_encryption_keys.md)

**Description:** If the encryption keys used to protect the notes are not securely derived or stored, an attacker could potentially retrieve them.
**How:** Exploiting insufficient Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) that make brute-forcing easier, or if keys are stored in plaintext or easily reversible formats on the local system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_extensions.md)

**Description:** Malicious extensions can be installed and executed within the Standard Notes environment, potentially gaining access to decrypted notes or manipulating application behavior.
**How:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the extension API that allow for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within the extension context, tricking users into installing malicious extensions through social engineering.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Note Editor or UI Elements](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_note_editor_or_ui_elements.md)

**Description:** Injecting malicious scripts into notes that are then executed within the application's context, allowing for data theft or manipulation.
**How:**  Improper input sanitization or output encoding in the note editor or other UI components.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

**Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application parses or handles specific note content (e.g., Markdown, HTML) to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
**How:**  Flaws in parsing libraries or insufficient validation of note content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** Intercepting and modifying update requests to deliver a malicious version of the application.
**How:** Lack of HTTPS for update communication, missing or weak signature verification of updates.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Memory Leaks or Debugging Features in Standard Notes](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_memory_leaks_or_debugging_features_in_standard_notes.md)

**Description:** This node represents the specific actions an attacker would take to access decrypted notes in memory.
**Why Critical:** Successful exploitation directly leads to a high-impact outcome: access to sensitive, decrypted data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Local Storage Encryption Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_local_storage_encryption_implementation.md)

**Description:** This node represents the exploitation of flaws in how Standard Notes encrypts and stores data locally.
**Why Critical:**  Compromising this node bypasses the intended security of local storage and grants access to all encrypted notes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Steal Encryption Keys](./attack_tree_paths/steal_encryption_keys.md)

**Description:** This node represents the successful retrieval of the encryption keys used by Standard Notes.
**Why Critical:**  Possession of the encryption keys allows the attacker to decrypt all stored notes, rendering the encryption mechanism useless.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Extension API](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_extension_api.md)

**Description:** This node represents the exploitation of weaknesses in the interface that allows extensions to interact with the core application.
**Why Critical:**  Compromising the extension API allows attackers to inject malicious code via extensions, leading to a wide range of potential attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Core Standard Notes Application](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_core_standard_notes_application.md)

**Description:** This node is a high-level category representing various vulnerabilities within the core application logic.
**Why Critical:**  This node encompasses several high-risk attack paths (XSS, RCE, Insecure Updates) that can lead to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Update Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_update_mechanism.md)

**Description:** This node represents vulnerabilities in how the application updates itself.
**Why Critical:** A compromised update mechanism allows for the delivery of malicious updates, giving the attacker persistent access and control over the application and potentially the user's system.
