*   **Missing Implementation:**  A formalized, regularly scheduled penetration testing program with dedicated external security experts specifically auditing the `standardnotes/app` repository. Publicly sharing summaries of security audits related to `standardnotes/app` would also increase transparency.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Sanitization and Output Encoding in `standardnotes/app`](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_sanitization_and_output_encoding_in__standardnotesapp_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points in `standardnotes/app`:**  Map all input points within the `standardnotes/app` codebase where user-provided data is processed (e.g., note content parsing in `standardnotes/app`, tag handling, settings inputs, plugin communication interfaces within `standardnotes/app`).
    2.  **Implement Sanitization Functions in `standardnotes/app`:** Develop and implement robust input sanitization functions within the `standardnotes/app` codebase for each identified input point. These functions should validate and sanitize user input within `standardnotes/app` to remove or neutralize potentially malicious code or characters before processing.
    3.  **Context-Aware Sanitization in `standardnotes/app`:** Ensure sanitization logic in `standardnotes/app` is context-aware. For example, sanitization for note content (likely HTML or Markdown) will differ from sanitization for plain text settings or JSON data exchanged with plugins within `standardnotes/app`.
    4.  **Output Encoding in Rendering Components of `standardnotes/app`:** Implement proper output encoding within the rendering components of `standardnotes/app` (e.g., React components) when displaying user-generated content. Encode data based on the output context (e.g., HTML encoding for display in HTML note views, JavaScript encoding if dynamically generating JavaScript within `standardnotes/app`).
    5.  **Regular Review and Updates of Sanitization in `standardnotes/app`:** Regularly review and update sanitization and encoding functions within the `standardnotes/app` codebase to address new attack vectors and ensure they remain effective against evolving threats relevant to the application's functionality.

    *   Client-Side Code Injection in `standardnotes/app` - Severity: High
    *   HTML Injection in `standardnotes/app` - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS in `standardnotes/app`: High Risk Reduction
    *   Client-Side Code Injection in `standardnotes/app`: High Risk Reduction
    *   HTML Injection in `standardnotes/app`: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - Input sanitization and output encoding are fundamental web security practices and are likely implemented to some extent within the `standardnotes/app` codebase, especially for note content rendering and handling user inputs in settings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Continuous and rigorous review of all input points and output contexts within the `standardnotes/app` codebase to ensure consistent and effective sanitization and encoding across the entire application, including plugin interactions and less frequently used features. Automated testing specifically for sanitization bypasses within `standardnotes/app` would be beneficial.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Sandboxing and Isolation within `standardnotes/app`](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_sandboxing_and_isolation_within__standardnotesapp_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Plugin API Boundaries in `standardnotes/app`:** Clearly define and strictly enforce the API boundaries that plugins can access within the `standardnotes/app` architecture. Limit plugin access to core application functionalities and data exposed by `standardnotes/app` to the absolute minimum required for their intended purpose. Document these boundaries clearly for plugin developers.
    2.  **Implement a Sandboxing Environment in `standardnotes/app`:**  Create a sandboxed environment within `standardnotes/app` for plugins to execute in. This could involve using isolated JavaScript contexts within the application's runtime, or leveraging browser/Electron features for process isolation if applicable. The implementation should be within the `standardnotes/app` codebase.
    3.  **Restrict System Access from Plugins via `standardnotes/app`:**  Prevent plugins, through the `standardnotes/app`'s plugin API, from accessing sensitive system resources, performing arbitrary file system operations outside of designated plugin storage areas managed by `standardnotes/app`, and initiating unrestricted network access beyond necessary plugin communication channels defined by `standardnotes/app`.
    4.  **Permission-Based Access Control in `standardnotes/app` Plugin System:** Implement a permission-based access control system within `standardnotes/app` for plugins. Plugins should declare the permissions they require in their manifest or during installation within `standardnotes/app`, and users should be informed and explicitly consent to these permissions through the `standardnotes/app` UI before installation.
    5.  **Resource Quotas and Monitoring for Plugins in `standardnotes/app`:**  Implement resource quotas (CPU, memory, network) for plugins within `standardnotes/app` to prevent resource exhaustion or denial-of-service attacks caused by malicious or poorly written plugins. Monitor plugin resource usage within `standardnotes/app` to enforce these quotas.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Plugin Execution within `standardnotes/app` - Severity: High
    *   Plugin-Induced Denial of Service (DoS) against `standardnotes/app` - Severity: Medium
    *   Data Exfiltration by Malicious Plugins via `standardnotes/app` - Severity: High
    *   Cross-Plugin Interference within `standardnotes/app` - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Plugin Execution within `standardnotes/app`: High Risk Reduction
    *   Plugin-Induced Denial of Service (DoS) against `standardnotes/app`: Medium Risk Reduction
    *   Data Exfiltration by Malicious Plugins via `standardnotes/app`: High Risk Reduction
    *   Cross-Plugin Interference within `standardnotes/app`: Medium Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially - Standard Notes has a plugin system, and likely implements some level of isolation within `standardnotes/app`, but the robustness of sandboxing and granularity of permission controls within the `standardnotes/app` codebase might vary depending on the plugin architecture's design and implementation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Strengthening plugin sandboxing within `standardnotes/app` to be more robust and granular, potentially using more advanced isolation techniques available in the application's runtime environment. Implementing a more detailed and user-facing permission model for plugins within the `standardnotes/app` UI.  More comprehensive documentation for plugin developers on security best practices and sandboxing limitations enforced by `standardnotes/app`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Key Derivation Function (KDF) in `standardnotes/app`](./mitigation_strategies/robust_key_derivation_function__kdf__in__standardnotesapp_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Argon2id in `standardnotes/app`:** Ensure the `standardnotes/app` codebase uses Argon2id as the Key Derivation Function (KDF) for deriving encryption keys from user passwords. Argon2id is a modern, memory-hard KDF recommended for password hashing and key derivation. Verify this in the cryptographic code within `standardnotes/app`.
    2.  **Tune Argon2 Parameters in `standardnotes/app`:**  Properly configure Argon2 parameters (memory cost, time cost, parallelism) within the `standardnotes/app` codebase to balance security and performance. Parameters should be strong enough to provide adequate security against brute-force attacks but not so high as to cause unacceptable performance degradation on user devices running `standardnotes/app`.
    3.  **Salt Generation in `standardnotes/app`:** Ensure `standardnotes/app` generates cryptographically secure random salts for each user's password during key derivation. Salts should be unique per user and stored securely alongside the derived key (or key derivation parameters) within the application's data storage.
    4.  **Regular Parameter Review for `standardnotes/app`:** Periodically review and potentially increase Argon2 parameters within the `standardnotes/app` codebase as computing power increases to maintain a strong security margin against brute-force attacks over time.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Brute-Force Password Cracking against `standardnotes/app` users - Severity: High
    *   Dictionary Attacks against `standardnotes/app` users - Severity: High
    *   Rainbow Table Attacks against `standardnotes/app` user passwords - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Brute-Force Password Cracking: High Risk Reduction
    *   Dictionary Attacks: High Risk Reduction
    *   Rainbow Table Attacks: High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely Yes - Standard Notes emphasizes end-to-end encryption, and using a strong KDF is a fundamental security requirement. It's highly probable they are using a reasonably strong KDF within `standardnotes/app`, but confirming Argon2id specifically would require a code review of the cryptographic parts of `standardnotes/app`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Publicly documenting the specific KDF (ideally Argon2id) and parameters used within `standardnotes/app` would increase transparency and user confidence.  Including automated tests in the `standardnotes/app` codebase to verify the correct KDF implementation and parameter settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Update Channels (HTTPS) and Code Signing for `standardnotes/app`](./mitigation_strategies/secure_update_channels__https__and_code_signing_for__standardnotesapp_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **HTTPS for Update Delivery for `standardnotes/app`:**  Ensure all application updates for `standardnotes/app` are downloaded and delivered exclusively over HTTPS. This encrypts the communication channel and prevents man-in-the-middle attacks from tampering with updates during download. This needs to be configured in the update distribution infrastructure for `standardnotes/app`.
    2.  **Code Signing Infrastructure for `standardnotes/app`:** Implement a robust code signing infrastructure specifically for `standardnotes/app`. Obtain a valid code signing certificate from a trusted Certificate Authority for signing `standardnotes/app` releases.
    3.  **Sign Application Updates for `standardnotes/app`:** Digitally sign all application updates (executables, installers, update packages) for `standardnotes/app` using the code signing certificate before distribution. This signing process should be integrated into the release pipeline for `standardnotes/app`.
    4.  **Update Verification in `standardnotes/app` Application:**  The `standardnotes/app` application itself must verify the digital signature of updates before applying them. This signature verification logic needs to be implemented within the `standardnotes/app` codebase to ensure only updates signed by the legitimate Standard Notes developers are installed.
    5.  **Automated Update Process in `standardnotes/app`:**  Ideally, automate the update process within `standardnotes/app` to minimize user interaction and ensure timely updates are applied, while still providing users with control over update timing if desired. The automation logic resides within `standardnotes/app`.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on `standardnotes/app` Updates - Severity: High
    *   Malicious Update Injection into `standardnotes/app` - Severity: High
    *   Compromised Update Distribution Channels for `standardnotes/app` - Severity: High

    *   Malicious Update Injection into `standardnotes/app`: High Risk Reduction
    *   Compromised Update Distribution Channels for `standardnotes/app`: High Risk Reduction

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - HTTPS for update delivery and code signing are standard practices for software distribution and are very likely implemented for Standard Notes desktop and mobile applications built from `standardnotes/app`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Publicly documenting the code signing process and the certificate used for `standardnotes/app` would enhance transparency.  Regularly auditing the update infrastructure for `standardnotes/app` for any vulnerabilities and ensuring the code signing certificate is securely managed as part of the `standardnotes/app` project's security practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Clear Communication about Master Key Security within `standardnotes/app` and related documentation](./mitigation_strategies/clear_communication_about_master_key_security_within__standardnotesapp__and_related_documentation.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prominent Master Key Education in `standardnotes/app` UI:**  Display clear and prominent educational messages to users within the `standardnotes/app` user interface during account creation and setup, specifically about the importance of the master key. This should be implemented in the UI components of `standardnotes/app`.
    2.  **Explain Master Key Function in `standardnotes/app` and Help Resources:**  Clearly explain within `standardnotes/app` itself and in associated help documentation that the master key is crucial for data encryption and decryption, and that Standard Notes (as the service provider) does not have access to it. Emphasize that losing the master key means permanent data loss.
    3.  **Guidance on Secure Master Key Management in `standardnotes/app` and Documentation:** Provide practical guidance to users within `standardnotes/app` and in documentation on how to create strong master passwords/passphrases and how to securely store and back up their master key (e.g., suggesting password managers, recommending secure offline storage).
    4.  **Warnings about Password Reset Limitations in `standardnotes/app` and Account Recovery Flows:**  Clearly communicate within `standardnotes/app` and during account recovery processes that password reset is not possible without the master key and that account recovery options are limited due to the end-to-end encryption design. Make this limitation very explicit in the UI flows of `standardnotes/app`.
    5.  **In-App Security Tips and Reminders in `standardnotes/app`:**  Integrate security tips and reminders about master key security within the application's settings or help sections of `standardnotes/app`. Consider periodic reminders or security checkups within the application.
