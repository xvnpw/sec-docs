## Vulnerability List for GitLens Project

Based on the provided project files, the following vulnerabilities have been identified in the GitLens project:

- Potential Command Injection in `command` Deep Link

**Potential Command Injection in `command` Deep Link**

- Description:
    - GitLens supports deep links with the format `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/{command}` to execute specific GitLens commands.
    - If the GitLens extension does not properly validate and sanitize the `{command}` parameter, an attacker could craft a malicious deep link by injecting arbitrary commands.
    - Step-by-step trigger:
        1. Attacker crafts a malicious deep link of the format `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/{malicious_command}`. For example: `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/walkthrough%20--malicious-param`.
        2. Attacker tricks a user into clicking this malicious link. This could be achieved through social engineering, embedding the link in a website, or sending it via email/chat.
        3. When the user clicks the link, VS Code attempts to open it, triggering the GitLens extension.
        4. If GitLens improperly handles the `command` parameter without validation, it might attempt to execute the injected command, in this example potentially trying to run a `walkthrough` command with an unexpected `--malicious-param` parameter or even something more dangerous if proper sanitization is missing.

- Impact:
    - Successful command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the VS Code extension.
    - This could lead to various malicious outcomes, including:
        - Information disclosure: Accessing sensitive files or configurations within the VS Code environment.
        - Code execution: Running arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
        - Modification of settings or data within the VS Code environment or related Git repositories.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - Unknown. Based on the documentation (`docs/links.md`), only a predefined set of commands are listed as supported for deep links (`cloud-patches`, `graph`, `home`, `inspect`, `launchpad`, `walkthrough`, `worktrees`).
    - It is necessary to analyze the source code to confirm if the `command` parameter is strictly validated against this whitelist and properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `command` parameter in deep link handling.
    - Validate the `command` parameter against a predefined whitelist of allowed commands.
    - Ensure no additional parameters or arguments can be injected and executed by the extension.

- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the GitLens extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    - The attacker needs to successfully trick the user into clicking a maliciously crafted deep link.

- Source code analysis:
    - To confirm this vulnerability and assess the mitigation status, source code analysis is required.
    - Specifically, the code that handles deep links starting with `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/` needs to be examined.
    - The analysis should focus on how the `{command}` parameter is extracted and processed.
    - Verify if there is any validation to ensure that only the intended commands from the whitelist are executed.
    - Check for any sanitization or escaping of the `command` parameter before execution.
    - If no proper validation and sanitization are found, the vulnerability is confirmed.

- Security test case:
    1. Craft a malicious deep link: `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/walkthrough%20test`. This link attempts to call the `walkthrough` command with an additional parameter `test`.
    2. Send this link to a test user and have them click on it.
    3. Observe the behavior of GitLens when the link is opened.
    4. Expected behavior in a secure implementation: GitLens should either:
        - Recognize `walkthrough` as a valid command but ignore the invalid parameter `test` and execute the `walkthrough` command normally.
        - Reject the entire link as invalid due to the unrecognized parameter or invalid command format.
    5. Vulnerable behavior: If GitLens attempts to process or execute a command including the injected `test` parameter in an unexpected way, or throws an error indicating it tried to interpret `test` as part of the command, it might indicate a potential command injection vulnerability.
    6. For a more thorough test (requiring code modification for testing purposes only and **not for production**):
        - Modify the deep link handling code to log the exact command string being executed.
        - Craft a link with a potentially harmful command, e.g., if the system allows shell execution, try injecting shell commands (though unlikely in this context, but for demonstration).
        - Observe the logs to see if the injected commands are being passed to any execution function.
