- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposed Detailed Dependency Information Enabling Targeted Supply Chain Attacks
  **Description:**
  The published `pnpm-lock.yaml` file discloses every resolved dependency (with exact versions and integrity hashes). An external attacker can download and programmatically parse this file to pinpoint which dependencies (or even transitive dependencies) are used. By cross‑referencing these versions with public vulnerability databases, the attacker may identify known high‑severity CVEs (or outdated libraries) to craft targeted supply‑chain attacks.
  **Impact:**
  - Helps the attacker narrow down weaknesses in third‑party libraries.
  - May enable focused exploitation (e.g. via remote code execution or bypass of security controls) if one or more of the dependencies contains an unpatched vulnerability.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The project relies on strict version pinning (via pnpm) and integrity hashes to ensure reliable installations.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - No filtering or obfuscation of the lock file before it becomes publicly accessible.
  - No automated dependency vulnerability scanning is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to alert maintainers of subsequent discovered vulnerabilities.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The repository and its full dependency tree are publicly accessible.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - Analysis of the `/code/pnpm-lock.yaml` file shows the full map of dependencies (including both direct and transitive libraries).
  - The disclosed versions (e.g. of libraries that process external input) allow an attacker to identify any dependency that has publicly known prototype pollution or similar vulnerabilities.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. From an external, untrusted network, navigate to the publicly available repository and download `/code/pnpm-lock.yaml`.
  2. Use a script (or an online tool) to extract the full dependency tree and determine which packages are used (directly or indirectly) by core application logic.
  3. Cross‑reference the extracted version numbers with public vulnerability databases (e.g. NVD, Snyk).
  4. Demonstrate that the publicly available detailed dependency information could empower an attacker’s reconnaissance process.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Prototype Pollution via Vulnerable “glob‑parent” Dependency
  **Description:**
  The project’s dependency tree (as revealed by the `pnpm‑lock.yaml`) includes an instance of `glob-parent@5.1.2`. This version is known to be vulnerable to prototype pollution. In libraries that rely on glob‑pattern matching (for example, inside modules used by file search or copy operations), unsanitized user input may flow into methods that call into glob-parent. An attacker who can supply specially crafted (malicious) glob patterns may cause the library to merge data that includes a `__proto__` property into target objects.
  **Impact:**
  - Polluting the global `Object.prototype` may allow the attacker to modify default object behavior, which in turn can be leveraged to bypass security checks or alter application logic.
  - In some scenarios, prototype pollution can lead to arbitrary code execution or a full system compromise.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - Strict dependency pinning is used as per the lock file; however, the vulnerable package version is not itself mitigated by additional runtime safeguards.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - The vulnerable dependency (`glob‑parent`) should be upgraded to a non‑vulnerable version (version 6.0.2 or later, which contains the necessary checks).
  - Input sanitization should be applied at any point where user‑controlled values can be used to form glob patterns.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The application must use a library (for example, a file operation or build tool) that calls into glob-parent with unsanitized (or insufficiently validated) glob patterns.
  - The attacker must be able to influence the value of such an input (for example, via a file upload or a parameter in an API request).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The `pnpm‑lock.yaml` file confirms that `glob-parent@5.1.2` is included in the dependency tree.
  - In the absence of any wrapper code that filters out malicious keys, functions in the dependency chain (such as those used by file copying or glob matching tools) will pass the provided input to glob-parent, which in this version does not prevent `__proto__` from being merged into the base object.
  - (Visualization)
    User Input → File/Glob‑processing function (e.g. in a plugin) → Calls glob‑parent → Merges object keys → `__proto__` polluted
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Identify an API endpoint or a build process of the application that accepts a glob pattern (for example, through a file upload mechanism or a custom configuration).
  2. Submit a request with a specially crafted payload such as:
     ```json
     {
       "pattern": {"__proto__": {"polluted": "yes"}}
     }
     ```
     (Adjust the payload to match the expected input structure.)
  3. After the request, run a small script in the application environment (or via an exposed endpoint, if available) to check if
     ```js
     console.log({}.polluted);
     ```
     outputs “yes”.
  4. The detection of the polluted property confirms that prototype pollution can be triggered via the vulnerable dependency.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Prototype Pollution via Vulnerable “deep‑extend” Dependency
  **Description:**
  The project uses the `rc@1.2.8` module for configuration handling. This module depends on `deep‑extend@0.6.0` to merge configuration objects. That version of deep‑extend does not adequately filter out dangerous keys (such as `__proto__`), thereby making it vulnerable to prototype pollution. An attacker who can control or influence configuration input may force the deep‑extend algorithm to merge in a `__proto__` property, thereby poisoning the base object prototype.
  **Impact:**
  - Successful exploitation can lead to unexpected behavior across the application, data tampering, or even arbitrary code execution if prototype methods are overwritten.
  - The integrity of all objects (including those not directly under the attacker’s control) may be compromised, potentially undermining security checks throughout the system.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The project uses a fixed version of `rc` and thus deep‑extend remains at version 0.6.0 without any known custom sanitization applied at the application level.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Upgrade deep‑extend to a version that addresses prototype pollution vulnerabilities (or replace it with a merger function that explicitly rejects keys such as `__proto__`).
  - Implement strict input validation on any configuration or data that will be merged using this library.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The application must allow external or untrusted sources to contribute configuration data (or settings) which are then merged via `rc` and its dependency on deep‑extend.
  - The attacker must be able to inject an object containing a `__proto__` key into those settings.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - A review of the `pnpm‑lock.yaml` shows that `rc@1.2.8` is in use, which depends on `deep‑extend@0.6.0`.
  - Examining deep‑extend’s merging algorithm reveals that it iterates over all enumerable keys of input objects without explicitly filtering out dangerous keys.
  - (Visualization)
    User‑controlled configuration object → Passed into rc’s merge routine → deep‑extend recursively copies keys → `__proto__` is merged into Object.prototype
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Identify where the application reads configuration data (e.g. a JSON config file provided at runtime or via an API endpoint).
  2. Craft a configuration payload such as:
     ```json
     {
       "__proto__": {"polluted": "true"}
     }
     ```
  3. Provide this payload to the configuration loader (e.g. by replacing or appending to the expected configuration file) and restart the application if necessary.
  4. In an environment where you can run JavaScript (for instance, through a debugging shell or a diagnostic endpoint), execute:
     ```js
     console.log({}.polluted);
     ```
  5. If the output is “true”, then prototype pollution has been achieved via deep‑extend.
