## Combined Vulnerability List for GitLens Project

This document consolidates identified vulnerabilities in the GitLens project, providing detailed descriptions, potential impacts, mitigation strategies, and testing procedures for each.

### 1. Potential Open Redirect Vulnerability due to outdated node-fetch dependency

- **Description:**
    - The project's dependency manifest, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, indicates the use of `node-fetch` version `2.7.0`. Versions of `node-fetch` prior to `2.7.1` are susceptible to an open redirect vulnerability. This vulnerability arises when `redirect: 'manual'` is configured in `node-fetch` options and the server responds with a 301, 302, 303, or 307 redirect. In vulnerable versions, the `location` header from the server's response is not properly validated and is directly utilized to construct a redirect URL, potentially within a browser environment using `window.location.href`. An attacker can manipulate the `location` header in a malicious server response to achieve an open redirect.
    - **Step-by-step trigger:**
        1. An attacker establishes a malicious server accessible to the GitLens extension.
        2. The attacker finds a method to induce the GitLens extension to initiate a `node-fetch` request to this malicious server, possibly through user interaction or exploitation of another vulnerability to inject a URL.
        3. The `node-fetch` request within GitLens must be configured with the `redirect: 'manual'` option.
        4. The malicious server responds to the request with an HTTP redirect status code (301, 302, 303, or 307) and sets the `location` header to a URL under the attacker's control (e.g., `https://attacker.com`).
        5. If GitLens's code handling the `node-fetch` response directly uses the `location` header to perform a redirect (e.g., via `window.location.href` in a webview context) without adequate validation, the user will be redirected to the attacker-controlled URL.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to redirect users of the GitLens extension to an arbitrary external website.
    - This can be exploited for phishing attacks, deceiving users into entering credentials or sensitive information on a counterfeit website disguised as legitimate due to being reached through a trusted application like GitLens.
    - Alternatively, attackers could redirect users to websites hosting malware or other malicious content.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Currently, no explicit mitigations are implemented. Analysis of `pnpm-lock.yaml` confirms the project is still using the vulnerable `node-fetch` version `2.7.0`. Therefore, this vulnerability is currently **not mitigated**.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The project urgently needs to update the `node-fetch` dependency to version `2.7.1` or a more recent, secure version.
    - If manual redirect handling with `redirect: 'manual'` is essential, robust validation of the `location` header must be implemented in the application code before any redirection is performed. This validation should include:
        - Verifying if the redirect URL falls within an expected and safe domain or origin.
        - Sanitizing the URL to prevent injection of malicious code.
        - Avoiding direct and unchecked use of the `location` header for redirection.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The GitLens extension codebase utilizes `node-fetch` for making HTTP requests.
    - At least one instance of `node-fetch` usage within the codebase is configured with the `redirect: 'manual'` option.
    - The code processing `node-fetch` responses with manual redirects enabled uses the `location` header for redirection without sufficient validation.
    - An attacker must be capable of controlling the `location` header in a server response, either by controlling a server the extension interacts with or through a man-in-the-middle attack.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - To confirm this vulnerability, a detailed source code review is necessary:
        1. Search for instances of `require('node-fetch')` or `import fetch from 'node-fetch'`.
        2. Identify locations where `fetch` is invoked with the `redirect: 'manual'` option.
        3. Analyze the code handling responses from these `fetch` calls, specifically looking for usage of `response.headers.get('location')`.
        4. Verify if the `location` header is used to initiate a redirect (e.g., by setting `window.location.href` in a webview) and whether there is any URL validation prior to redirection.
    - The presence of `node-fetch@2.7.0` in `/code/pnpm-lock.yaml` underscores the importance of source code analysis to evaluate the actual exploitability of this vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Establish a mock HTTP server using tools like `node.js` with the `http` module or `python -m http.server`. This server will simulate a malicious endpoint.
    2. **Configure Mock Server:** Configure the mock server to listen on a designated port (e.g., 8080). When the server receives a request on a specific path (e.g., `/redirect`), it should respond with:
        ```
        HTTP/1.1 302 Found
        Location: https://attacker.com
        Content-Type: text/plain
        Content-Length: 0
        ```
        Replace `https://attacker.com` with a test URL you control.
    3. **Modify GitLens (for testing):** If feasible for testing, modify the GitLens extension to include a `node-fetch` call targeting the mock server endpoint with `redirect: 'manual'`:
        ```javascript
        fetch('http://localhost:8080/redirect', { redirect: 'manual' })
          .then(response => {
            if (response.status >= 300 && response.status < 400) {
              const redirectUrl = response.headers.get('location');
              if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
                window.location.href = redirectUrl;
              } else {
                console.log('Redirect URL:', redirectUrl);
              }
            }
          });
        ```
    4. **Trigger Code Path:** Execute the code path in GitLens where this modified `fetch` call is placed. This might involve using specific GitLens features or commands.
    5. **Observe Redirection:** Monitor if the GitLens extension redirects to `https://attacker.com` (or the configured test URL).
    6. **Expected Result:** If the extension redirects to `https://attacker.com` without validation or warning, the open redirect vulnerability is confirmed. If redirection is blocked or the URL is validated, the vulnerability is mitigated in that specific code path.

### 2. Exposed Detailed Dependency Information Enabling Targeted Supply Chain Attacks

- **Vulnerability Name:** Exposed Detailed Dependency Information Enabling Targeted Supply Chain Attacks

- **Description:**
    - The publicly available `pnpm-lock.yaml` file reveals a comprehensive list of resolved dependencies, including exact versions and integrity hashes. This detailed information allows external attackers to download and parse the file programmatically to identify specific dependencies and their versions used by the GitLens project. By correlating these versions with public vulnerability databases, attackers can pinpoint known high-severity CVEs or outdated libraries, facilitating targeted supply-chain attacks.

- **Impact:**
    - Provides attackers with specific information to identify weaknesses in third-party libraries used by the project.
    - Enables focused exploitation efforts, such as remote code execution or security control bypasses, if any of the dependencies contain unpatched vulnerabilities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project employs strict version pinning (via pnpm) and integrity hashes to ensure consistent and reliable installations.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Lack of filtering or obfuscation of the lock file before public exposure.
    - Absence of automated dependency vulnerability scanning integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to proactively alert maintainers of newly discovered vulnerabilities in dependencies.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The project repository and its complete dependency tree are publicly accessible.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Analysis of the `/code/pnpm-lock.yaml` file confirms the comprehensive mapping of both direct and transitive dependencies.
    - The disclosed versions of libraries, especially those handling external input, allow attackers to identify dependencies with publicly known vulnerabilities like prototype pollution.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. From an external, untrusted network, access the publicly available repository and download `/code/pnpm-lock.yaml`.
    2. Use a script or an online tool to extract the complete dependency tree and determine packages used directly or indirectly by core application logic.
    3. Cross-reference the extracted version numbers with public vulnerability databases (e.g., NVD, Snyk).
    4. Document how the publicly available detailed dependency information simplifies an attacker's reconnaissance process, potentially leading to targeted attacks.

### 3. Prototype Pollution via Vulnerable “glob‑parent” Dependency

- **Vulnerability Name:** Prototype Pollution via Vulnerable “glob‑parent” Dependency

- **Description:**
    - The project's dependency tree, as detailed in `pnpm-lock.yaml`, includes `glob-parent@5.1.2`. This specific version is known to be vulnerable to prototype pollution. In libraries utilizing glob-pattern matching (e.g., modules involved in file search or copy operations), unsanitized user input might flow into methods that subsequently call `glob-parent`. An attacker capable of supplying maliciously crafted glob patterns can cause the library to merge data containing a `__proto__` property into target objects, leading to prototype pollution.

- **Impact:**
    - Pollution of the global `Object.prototype` can alter default object behavior, potentially enabling attackers to bypass security checks or modify application logic.
    - In certain scenarios, prototype pollution can escalate to arbitrary code execution or full system compromise.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Strict dependency pinning is in place as per the lock file. However, the vulnerable package version itself is not mitigated by additional runtime safeguards within the application.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Upgrade the vulnerable `glob-parent` dependency to a non-vulnerable version (version `6.0.2` or later, which includes necessary security fixes).
    - Implement input sanitization wherever user-controlled values are used to construct glob patterns, preventing injection of malicious payloads.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must employ a library (like a file operation or build tool) that uses `glob-parent` with unsanitized or insufficiently validated glob patterns.
    - An attacker must be able to influence the value of such input, for example, through file uploads or parameters in API requests.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file confirms the inclusion of `glob-parent@5.1.2` in the dependency tree.
    - Without wrapper code to filter out malicious keys, functions in the dependency chain (such as those used by file copying or glob matching tools) will pass input to `glob-parent`, which in version `5.1.2` does not prevent `__proto__` from being merged into the base object.

    ```
    User Input → File/Glob‑processing function (e.g. in a plugin) → Calls glob‑parent → Merges object keys → __proto__ polluted
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Identify an API endpoint or a build process within the application that accepts a glob pattern (e.g., via file upload or custom configuration).
    2. Submit a request with a crafted payload like:
        ```json
        {
          "pattern": {"__proto__": {"polluted": "yes"}}
        }
        ```
        (Adjust the payload structure to match the expected input format).
    3. After the request, execute a small script within the application environment (or via an exposed endpoint, if available) to check if:
        ```javascript
        console.log({}.polluted);
        ```
        outputs “yes”.
    4. Detection of the "polluted" property confirms that prototype pollution can be triggered via the vulnerable `glob-parent` dependency.

### 4. Prototype Pollution via Vulnerable “deep‑extend” Dependency

- **Vulnerability Name:** Prototype Pollution via Vulnerable “deep‑extend” Dependency

- **Description:**
    - The project utilizes the `rc@1.2.8` module for configuration management. This module depends on `deep-extend@0.6.0` to merge configuration objects. Version `0.6.0` of `deep-extend` inadequately filters dangerous keys like `__proto__`, making it vulnerable to prototype pollution. An attacker capable of controlling or influencing configuration input may force the `deep-extend` algorithm to merge in a `__proto__` property, thereby poisoning the base object prototype.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation can lead to unpredictable application behavior, data corruption, or even arbitrary code execution if prototype methods are overwritten.
    - The integrity of all objects, including those not directly controlled by the attacker, can be compromised, potentially undermining security mechanisms throughout the system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The project uses a fixed version of `rc`, and consequently, `deep-extend` remains at version `0.6.0` without any known custom sanitization applied at the application level.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Upgrade `deep-extend` to a version that addresses prototype pollution vulnerabilities or replace it with a safer merging function that explicitly rejects dangerous keys like `__proto__`.
    - Implement strict input validation on all configuration data or settings that are merged using this library, preventing malicious payloads.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must allow external or untrusted sources to contribute configuration data or settings that are subsequently merged via `rc` and its dependency on `deep-extend`.
    - The attacker must be able to inject an object containing a `__proto__` key into these configuration settings.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - A review of `pnpm-lock.yaml` confirms the use of `rc@1.2.8`, which depends on `deep-extend@0.6.0`.
    - Examination of `deep-extend`'s merging algorithm reveals that it iterates through all enumerable keys of input objects without explicitly filtering out dangerous keys.

    ```
    User‑controlled configuration object → Passed into rc’s merge routine → deep‑extend recursively copies keys → __proto__ is merged into Object.prototype
    ```

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Identify where the application reads configuration data (e.g., a JSON config file loaded at runtime or via an API endpoint).
    2. Craft a configuration payload such as:
        ```json
        {
          "__proto__": {"polluted": "true"}
        }
        ```
    3. Provide this payload to the configuration loader (e.g., by replacing or appending to the expected configuration file) and restart the application if necessary for the configuration to be reloaded.
    4. In an environment where JavaScript can be executed (e.g., through a debugging shell or a diagnostic endpoint), execute:
        ```javascript
        console.log({}.polluted);
        ```
    5. If the output is “true”, prototype pollution has been successfully achieved via `deep-extend`.

### 5. Potential Command Injection in `command` Deep Link

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Command Injection in `command` Deep Link

- **Description:**
    - GitLens supports deep links with the format `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/{command}` to execute specific GitLens commands. If the GitLens extension lacks proper validation and sanitization of the `{command}` parameter, an attacker could craft a malicious deep link by injecting arbitrary commands.
    - **Step-by-step trigger:**
        1. An attacker creates a malicious deep link of the format `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/{malicious_command}`, for example: `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/walkthrough%20--malicious-param`.
        2. The attacker deceives a user into clicking this malicious link through social engineering, embedding it on a website, or sending it via email/chat.
        3. When the user clicks the link, VS Code attempts to open it, triggering the GitLens extension.
        4. If GitLens improperly handles the `command` parameter without validation, it might attempt to execute the injected command. In the example, this could involve trying to run a `walkthrough` command with the unexpected `--malicious-param` parameter, or potentially something more dangerous if robust sanitization is absent.

- **Impact:**
    - Successful command injection could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands within the context of the VS Code extension.
    - This could lead to:
        - Information disclosure: Accessing sensitive files or configurations within the VS Code environment.
        - Code execution: Running arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
        - Modification of settings or data within the VS Code environment or related Git repositories.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Currently unknown. Documentation (`docs/links.md`) lists supported commands for deep links (`cloud-patches`, `graph`, `home`, `inspect`, `launchpad`, `walkthrough`, `worktrees`). However, source code analysis is needed to confirm if the `command` parameter is strictly validated against this whitelist and properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement strict input validation and sanitization for the `command` parameter in deep link handling.
    - Validate the `command` parameter against a predefined whitelist of allowed commands.
    - Ensure no additional parameters or arguments can be injected and executed by the extension by properly parsing and sanitizing the input.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the GitLens extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    - The attacker must successfully trick the user into clicking a maliciously crafted deep link.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Source code analysis is required to confirm and assess the mitigation status.
    - Examine the code handling deep links starting with `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/`.
    - Focus analysis on how the `{command}` parameter is extracted and processed.
    - Verify if validation exists to ensure only whitelisted commands are executed.
    - Check for sanitization or escaping of the `command` parameter before execution.
    - Lack of proper validation and sanitization would confirm the vulnerability.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Craft a malicious deep link: `vscode://eamodio.gitlens/link/command/walkthrough%20test`. This link attempts to call the `walkthrough` command with an additional parameter `test`.
    2. Send this link to a test user and have them click it.
    3. Observe GitLens's behavior upon opening the link.
    4. **Expected behavior (secure implementation):**
        - GitLens recognizes `walkthrough` as valid but ignores `test`, executing `walkthrough` normally.
        - Or, GitLens rejects the link entirely due to the unrecognized parameter or invalid format.
    5. **Vulnerable behavior:** If GitLens attempts to process or execute a command including the injected `test` parameter unexpectedly, or throws errors indicating interpretation of `test` as part of the command, it suggests a potential command injection vulnerability.
    6. **For thorough testing (code modification required, **not for production**):**
        - Modify the deep link handling code to log the exact command string being executed.
        - Craft a link with a potentially harmful command (e.g., shell commands if the system allows, though less likely in this context, but for demonstration).
        - Observe logs to check if injected commands are passed to any execution function, confirming command injection potential.
