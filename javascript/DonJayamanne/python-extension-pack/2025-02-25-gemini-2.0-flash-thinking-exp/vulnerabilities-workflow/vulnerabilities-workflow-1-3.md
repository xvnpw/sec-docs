## Vulnerability List for Python Extension Pack

Based on the provided project files (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`), no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank, as defined by the criteria, were identified within the Python Extension Pack documentation itself.

The provided files are documentation files describing a curated list of Python extensions for VS Code. These files do not contain any executable code or configurations that could be directly exploited by an external attacker in a publicly available instance.

Therefore, based on the information available, there are no vulnerabilities to report for this project that meet the specified requirements.

It's important to note that while the extension pack itself (the documentation listing extensions) doesn't introduce vulnerabilities, the individual extensions it recommends *could* potentially have vulnerabilities. However, assessing the security of each listed extension is outside the scope of analyzing *this project's files*. This analysis is limited to the vulnerabilities introduced by the project as defined by the provided `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files.

If the intention was to analyze the security of the *extensions themselves*, then the project files for each individual extension would need to be provided.
