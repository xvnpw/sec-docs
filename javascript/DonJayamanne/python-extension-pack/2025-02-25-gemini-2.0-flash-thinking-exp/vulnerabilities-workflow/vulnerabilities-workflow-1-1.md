## Vulnerability List

Based on the project files provided, no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank were identified that are introduced by this project.

**Reasoning:**

The provided project files consist of a `README.md` and a `CHANGELOG.md`. These files describe a Visual Studio Code extension pack for Python development. They list the included extensions and provide a brief history of changes.

This project does not contain any executable code or server-side components. It is essentially a metadata file that defines a collection of existing VS Code extensions.

Therefore, there are no attack vectors or mechanisms through which an external attacker could exploit vulnerabilities directly within this project itself. Any vulnerabilities would reside within the individual extensions listed in the pack, which are external to this project and are maintained by their respective developers.

Given the nature of the project as a simple extension pack definition, it does not introduce any security vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria.
