## Combined Vulnerability List

### - **Vulnerability Name:** No High or Critical Vulnerabilities Identified
  - **Description:** A thorough security assessment was conducted, specifically considering external attackers targeting a publicly available instance of the application. The project files consist solely of static Markdown documentation (README.md and CHANGELOG.md). These files do not contain any executable code, server-side logic, or configuration that could be manipulated by an attacker. Consequently, there are no attack vectors for high or critical vulnerabilities within these static documentation files when considering the defined criteria for inclusion and exclusion.
  - **Impact:** Due to the absence of any interactive or executable components in the provided documentation files, there is no potential for exploitation by external threat actors. The impact is effectively null as the files do not offer any functionality that could be compromised to cause harm or unauthorized access in a publicly accessible instance.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Not Applicable (No high/critical vulnerabilities present)
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** The architectural design of the project, being purely static documentation, inherently mitigates all common web application vulnerabilities. There is no code to execute, no user input to process, and no server-side interactions, thus eliminating potential attack surfaces.
  - **Missing Mitigations:** No additional mitigations are required or applicable. The nature of static documentation inherently prevents the types of vulnerabilities that would necessitate mitigation in active applications.
  - **Preconditions:** There are no preconditions for exploiting vulnerabilities because no exploitable vulnerabilities exist within the scope of these static documentation files when considering external attackers and high/critical ranks as per instructions.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **README.md and CHANGELOG.md Analysis:** Both files are reviewed to ensure they are purely static Markdown content. Examination confirms the absence of any:
        - Embedded scripts (JavaScript, etc.)
        - Executable code snippets
        - Server-side processing instructions
        - External resource loading that could introduce vulnerabilities.
    The content is limited to text, links, and formatting tags inherent to Markdown, none of which pose a security risk in a static context.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Access and Inspect:** Access the publicly available repository or rendered documentation (e.g., on GitHub).
    2. **Static Content Verification:** Confirm that the content is purely static text, links, and formatting.
    3. **No Dynamic Behavior Test:** Attempt to interact with the documentation in ways that might trigger dynamic behavior (e.g., clicking links, inspecting elements for scripts). Verify that no client-side or server-side code execution occurs.
    4. **Absence of Endpoints:** Confirm that the project does not expose any interactive endpoints or forms that could process user input or initiate server-side actions.
    5. **Vulnerability Scan (Optional but redundant):** Perform automated vulnerability scans against the repository URL. The scans should not identify any relevant high or critical vulnerabilities due to the static nature of the content.
