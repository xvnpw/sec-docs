## Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Code Injection in Python Interactive Server
- **Description:** The `python_server.py` script uses the `eval()` and `exec()` functions to execute arbitrary Python code provided in the "execute" method requests. An attacker can send a crafted JSON request containing malicious Python code. This code will be executed on the server with the same privileges as the Python server process.
- **Impact:** Critical. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary Python code on the server. This can lead to:
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE)
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data
    - System compromise
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None. The code directly uses `eval` and `exec` without any input sanitization or sandboxing mechanisms.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Eliminate `eval` and `exec`**: The most effective mitigation is to avoid using `eval()` and `exec()` entirely. If dynamic code execution is required, explore safer alternatives like restricted execution environments or whitelisting allowed operations.
    - **Sandboxing/Restricted Execution Environment (Recommended if dynamic execution is necessary)**: If dynamic code execution cannot be avoided, implement a robust sandboxing mechanism or a restricted execution environment to limit the capabilities of the executed code. This can involve using techniques like:
        - Running the code in a separate process with reduced privileges.
        - Utilizing security libraries or modules designed for code isolation.
        - Employing containerization technologies to isolate the execution environment.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The `python_server.py` script is running and accessible to external attackers. This could be if the script is exposed as part of a publicly accessible service or application.
    - An attacker is able to send JSON requests to the server's input mechanism (e.g., standard input if the server reads from stdin).
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - File: `/code/python_files/python_server.py`
    - The `execute` function is responsible for handling "execute" method requests, which are intended to execute user-provided Python code:
        ```python
        def execute(request, user_globals):
            str_output = CustomIO("<stdout>", encoding="utf-8")
            str_error = CustomIO("<stderr>", encoding="utf-8")

            with redirect_io("stdout", str_output):
                with redirect_io("stderr", str_error):
                    str_input = CustomIO("<stdin>", encoding="utf-8", newline="\n")
                    with redirect_io("stdin", str_input):
                        exec_user_input(request["params"], user_globals) # Vulnerable code execution
            send_response(str_output.get_value(), request["id"])
        ```
    - The `exec_user_input` function receives the code to be executed from `request["params"]` and determines whether to use `eval` or `exec` for execution:
        ```python
        def exec_user_input(user_input, user_globals):
            user_input = user_input[0] if isinstance(user_input, list) else user_input

            try:
                callable = exec_function(user_input) # Determines whether to use eval or exec
                retval = callable(user_input, user_globals) # Executes the code using eval or exec
                if retval is not None:
                    print(retval)
            except KeyboardInterrupt:
                print(traceback.format_exc())
            except Exception:
                print(traceback.format_exc())
        ```
    - The `exec_function` function attempts to compile the user input as an evaluatable expression. If this fails (SyntaxError), it defaults to using `exec` to execute the input as a statement:
        ```python
        def exec_function(user_input):
            try:
                compile(user_input, "<stdin>", "eval") # Attempts to compile as eval expression
            except SyntaxError:
                return exec # Fallback to exec for statements if eval compilation fails
            return eval # Use eval if compilation as expression is successful
        ```
    - The `user_input` is taken directly from the `request["params"]` and passed to `eval` or `exec` without any form of validation or sanitization, making the application vulnerable to code injection.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have Python installed and can run the `python_server.py` script.
    2. **Start the Python Server:** Run the `python_server.py` script from your terminal: `python python_files/python_server.py`. This will start the server, listening for commands on standard input and sending responses to standard output.
    3. **Craft a Malicious JSON Request:** Create a file named `request.json` with the following content. This payload attempts to list the contents of the root directory (`/`) and print it to the server's output:
        ```json
        {
            "jsonrpc": "2.0",
            "id": 1,
            "method": "execute",
            "params": ["import os; print(os.listdir('/'))"]
        }
        ```
    4. **Send the Request to the Server:** Use `curl` or a similar command-line tool to send the crafted JSON request to the `python_server.py` script via its standard input.  The following bash command will calculate the `Content-Length` header and pipe the request to the Python script:
        ```bash
        content=$(cat request.json)
        content_length=$(echo -n "$content" | wc -c)
        echo -e "Content-Length: $content_length\n\n$content" | python python_files/python_server.py
        ```
    5. **Analyze the Output:** Observe the output printed by the `python_server.py` script on your terminal (standard output). If the vulnerability is present, the response will include the output of the `os.listdir('/')` command, listing the files and directories in the root directory of the server's file system. This confirms successful code injection and remote code execution.
