## Vulnerability List

There are no identified vulnerabilities of high or critical rank in the provided project files.

**Explanation:**

After reviewing the provided files, which consist of documentation, configuration files, and GitHub Actions workflows, no vulnerabilities that meet the specified criteria were found.

- **Documentation files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, test/non-extension/__mocks__/vsc/README.md, .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md):** These files are primarily for informational purposes and do not contain executable code that could introduce vulnerabilities.
- **GitHub Actions workflows (.github/workflows/pr-validate.yml, .github/workflows/release-on-tag.yml, .github/workflows/vsce-publish.yml):** These files define CI/CD pipelines. While misconfigurations in CI/CD can lead to security issues, the provided workflows appear to be standard and do not expose any obvious vulnerabilities in the extension itself. The `vsce-publish.yml` workflow uses a secret token for publishing, which is a standard practice and a general supply chain security concern, not a vulnerability in the project's code exploitable by an external attacker against a running instance of the extension.

**Reason for not finding vulnerabilities:**

- **Limited Scope:** The provided files do not include the source code of the VS Code extension itself. Without access to the extension's code, it is impossible to analyze its logic and identify potential vulnerabilities.
- **File Types:** The files provided are primarily configuration and documentation, which are less likely to contain exploitable vulnerabilities compared to application code.
- **Focus on Project Files:** The task specifically asks to focus on vulnerabilities *introduced by the project from PROJECT FILES*. The provided files are related to project management and CI/CD, not the core logic of the extension.

To identify vulnerabilities, especially of high or critical rank, a review of the extension's source code would be necessary. This would involve analyzing how the extension interacts with the Git repository, handles user input, and renders the UI in the VS Code environment.
