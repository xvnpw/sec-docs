Based on the provided project files, and applying the filtering criteria for external attacker exploitable vulnerabilities of high or critical rank:

No vulnerabilities of high or critical rank have been identified that meet the specified inclusion criteria.

**Reasoning:**

The provided files consist of documentation, CI/CD configuration, and issue templates, and do not include the source code necessary for analyzing code-level vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance.

Therefore, according to the instructions, there are no vulnerabilities to list.
