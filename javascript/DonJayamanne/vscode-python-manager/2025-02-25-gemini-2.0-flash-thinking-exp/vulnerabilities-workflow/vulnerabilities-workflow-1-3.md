### Vulnerability 1: Dependency Integrity Issue in Debugpy and Pip Installation Scripts

- Vulnerability Name: Dependency Integrity Issue in Debugpy and Pip Installation Scripts
- Description:
    - The project uses scripts `pythonFiles/install_debugpy.py` and `pythonFiles/download_get_pip.py` to download and install `debugpy` and `pip` respectively during the build process and potentially during runtime in certain scenarios.
    - These scripts fetch files from hardcoded URLs:
        - `install_debugpy.py` fetches debugpy wheels from PyPI based on version `DEBUGGER_VERSION` and ABI compatibility.
        - `download_get_pip.py` fetches `get-pip.py` from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypa/get-pip/{version}/public/get-pip.py`.
    - There is no integrity verification (like checksum or signature validation) performed on the downloaded files.
    - If PyPI or `raw.githubusercontent.com` or the specific paths for `debugpy` wheels and `get-pip.py` are compromised, or if a man-in-the-middle attack occurs, malicious files could be downloaded and installed instead of the legitimate dependencies.
    - This could lead to supply chain security issues, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the extension's dependencies during build or runtime installation.
- Impact:
    - **High** - Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the environment where the extension is installed. An attacker could compromise the development or runtime environment by replacing legitimate dependencies with malicious ones. This could allow the attacker to steal credentials, modify code, or pivot to other systems.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The scripts directly download and extract/execute the files without any integrity checks.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks for downloaded files. This could be done by:
        - **Checksum Verification:**  Fetch and verify checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of `debugpy` wheels and `get-pip.py` from a trusted source (like PyPI's metadata or a dedicated checksum file).
        - **Signature Verification:** If available, verify the digital signatures of the downloaded packages.
        - **Secure Channels:** Ensure HTTPS is used for all downloads to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during transit (already in place for URLs, but needs to be ensured and explicitly mentioned as a mitigation).
    - **Dependency Pinning:** While `debugpy` version is pinned, there is no pinning or hash checking for `get-pip.py` content itself. Consider pinning the content of `get-pip.py` to a specific commit hash or using a specific version tag for more predictability and control.
- Preconditions:
    - Network connectivity to PyPI and `raw.githubusercontent.com` during the extension build or runtime dependency installation.
    - Successful execution of `install_debugpy.py` or `download_get_pip.py` scripts.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - **`pythonFiles/install_debugpy.py`:**
        ```python
        def _download_and_extract(root, url, version):
            root = os.getcwd() if root is None or root == "." else root
            print(url)
            with url_lib.urlopen(url) as response: # Vulnerable Point: Downloads wheel without integrity check
                data = response.read()
                with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(data), "r") as wheel:
                    for zip_info in wheel.infolist():
                        # Ignore dist info since we are merging multiple wheels
                        if ".dist-info/" in zip_info.filename:
                            continue
                        print("\t" + zip_info.filename)
                        wheel.extract(zip_info.filename, root)
        ```
        The function `_download_and_extract` downloads the debugpy wheel from the given `url` using `url_lib.urlopen` and extracts it. There is no step to verify the integrity of the downloaded wheel file before extraction.

    - **`pythonFiles/download_get_pip.py`:**
        ```python
        def _download_and_save(root, version):
            root = os.getcwd() if root is None or root == "." else root
            url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypa/get-pip/{version}/public/get-pip.py"
            print(url)
            with url_lib.urlopen(url) as response: # Vulnerable Point: Downloads get-pip.py without integrity check
                data = response.read()
                get_pip_file = pathlib.Path(root) / "get-pip.py"
                get_pip_file.write_bytes(data)
        ```
        The function `_download_and_save` downloads `get-pip.py` script from the hardcoded URL using `url_lib.urlopen` and saves it. No integrity check is performed on the downloaded `get-pip.py` script before saving it.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup:**
        - Intercept network traffic from the machine where the extension build process is running (e.g., using a proxy).
        - Identify the URL requested by `install_debugpy.py` or `download_get_pip.py` for downloading `debugpy` wheel or `get-pip.py`.
    2. **Attack:**
        - When the script attempts to download the dependency, the proxy should intercept the request.
        - Replace the legitimate `debugpy` wheel or `get-pip.py` content with a malicious file containing reverse shell or any other payload.
        - Forward the malicious response to the script.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe the execution of the build process. If the malicious payload is executed (e.g., reverse shell connects back to attacker's machine, or malicious actions are performed in the build environment), it confirms the vulnerability.
        - For `get-pip.py`, after replacement and execution, try to install a package using the compromised `pip` and observe if malicious actions are performed.
