### Vulnerabilities in VS Code Python Extension

This document outlines identified vulnerabilities within the VS Code Python extension, detailing their descriptions, impacts, ranks, mitigations, and steps for verification.

#### 1. Remote Code Execution via `get_output_via_markers.py`

- **Vulnerability Name:** Remote Code Execution via `get_output_via_markers.py`
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Python script or module.
    2. The attacker finds a way to make the VS Code Python extension execute `pythonFiles/get_output_via_markers.py`.
    3. The attacker ensures that the first argument passed to `get_output_via_markers.py` is `-c` or `-m` or path to the malicious python script, and if `-c` is used, the second argument is malicious python code.
    4. When `get_output_via_markers.py` is executed with these arguments, it will execute the attacker's arbitrary Python code due to the use of `exec`, `runpy.run_module`, or `runpy.run_path`.
    5. This allows the attacker to gain full control over the machine where VS Code is running with the privileges of the VS Code process.
- **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently implemented mitigations:** None visible in the provided Python code. Mitigation would need to happen in how the extension uses this script, by ensuring user input is never directly used to construct the arguments for `get_output_via_markers.py`.
- **Missing mitigations:** Input sanitization and validation for arguments passed to `get_output_via_markers.py`. The extension should not allow user-controlled data to directly determine the code executed by this script.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The VS Code Python extension uses `pythonFiles/get_output_via_markers.py` to execute Python code.
    - There is a way for an external attacker to influence the arguments passed to `pythonFiles/get_output_via_markers.py` through the extension's user interface or API.
- **Source code analysis:**
    1. File: `/code/pythonFiles/get_output_via_markers.py`
    2. The script starts by importing necessary modules (`runpy`, `sys`).
    3. It retrieves the first command-line argument `module = sys.argv[1]`.
    4. It checks the value of `module`:
        - If `module == "-c"`, it takes the second argument `code = sys.argv[2]` and executes it using `exec(code, ns, ns)`. `exec` allows arbitrary Python code execution.
        - If `module.startswith("-m")`, it takes the second argument `moduleName = sys.argv[2]` and executes it as a module using `runpy.run_module(moduleName, run_name="__main__", alter_sys=True)`. `runpy.run_module` can execute arbitrary modules if `moduleName` is attacker-controlled.
        - If `module.endswith(".py")`, it takes `module` as a path to a Python script and executes it using `runpy.run_path(module, run_name="__main__")`. `runpy.run_path` can execute arbitrary scripts if `module` path is attacker-controlled.
    5. There is no input validation or sanitization on `module` or `code` arguments before execution.

- **Security test case:**
    1. Create a malicious Python script named `malicious.py` with the content:
       ```python
       import os
       os.system("touch /tmp/pwned")
       print("PWNED")
       ```
    2. Assume there's a feature in the VS Code Python extension that allows running a Python script by specifying its path, and this path is somehow passed as the first argument to `get_output_via_markers.py`. (This is hypothetical, as I don't have the extension's code.)
    3. As an attacker, use this extension feature to "run" the `malicious.py` script.
    4. Observe if the file `/tmp/pwned` is created on the system and if "PWNED" is printed in the output.
    5. If `/tmp/pwned` is created, it confirms arbitrary code execution.

#### 2. Arbitrary File Disclosure via Unsanitized File Path in Test Discovery

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Disclosure via Unsanitized File Path in Test Discovery
- **Description:**
  In the pytest adapter’s helper function (e.g. in
  `pythonFiles/testing_tools/adapter/pytest/_discovery.py` or related helper modules), a file path supplied through test identification is used directly in an `open()` call without verifying that the file is within an allowed sandbox. An attacker who controls the test identifier (or the derived file path) may supply an absolute path (for example, `/etc/passwd` on UNIX) so that when the file is opened—even if only to search for a marker—sensitive file contents or existence information are disclosed via error messages or log traces.

- **Impact:**
  Successful exploitation could cause inadvertent disclosure of sensitive system files or configuration data, assisting further targeted attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  There is no filtering or path normalization before opening the file. No sandboxing or whitelisting is applied.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Normalize and validate any file path parameter so that it must reside within a restricted, pre–configured test directory.
  • Enforce sandboxing (or a whitelist) to reject absolute paths or paths containing traversal patterns.
  • Catch and sanitize file–read errors to avoid reflecting detailed system paths in error responses.

- **Preconditions:**
  The attacker must be able to supply or modify the test identification data (or file path parameter) that eventually is passed to this function. In deployments where the test–discovery interface is exposed to untrusted input, this vector is feasible.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  The vulnerable function (for example, in a helper module) resembles:
  ```python
  def find_test_line_number(test_name: str, test_file_path) -> str:
      test_file_unique_id = "test_marker--" + test_name.split("[")[0]
      with open(test_file_path) as f:
          for i, line in enumerate(f):
              if test_file_unique_id in line:
                  return str(i + 1)
      raise ValueError(f"Test {test_name!r} not found in {test_file_path}")
  ```
  Notice that the `test_file_path` parameter is used verbatim without any check—allowing an attacker to supply a path such as `/etc/passwd`.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a controlled test environment, craft a test identifier or parameter so that the file path passed to the vulnerable function becomes an absolute sensitive path (e.g. `/etc/passwd`).
  2. Trigger the test–discovery routine (via the extension’s interface) using the crafted input.
  3. Observe that the function attempts to open the supplied file without checks.
  4. Confirm that either an error message or log trace reveals parts of the sensitive file’s content or its existence.

#### 3. Sensitive Information Disclosure via Unsanitized Logging in Test Discovery

- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Information Disclosure via Unsanitized Logging in Test Discovery
- **Description:**
  In the helper function that computes the “absolute” test identifier (for example, in
  `pythonFiles/testing_tools/adapter/pytest/_cli.py` or analogous modules), a debug print statement outputs the computed absolute test ID derived from untrusted test–discovery input. For example:
  ```python
  print("absolute path", absolute_test_id)
  ```
  This verbose debug output may disclose internal filesystem layout (absolute paths, directory structure, etc.) if the output is accessible.

- **Impact:**
  Disclosure of internal filesystem paths enables an attacker to craft further targeted attacks such as path traversal, arbitrary file access, or privilege escalation.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  There is no conditional logging or sanitization; debug output is always sent to standard output.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Remove or disable verbose debug logging in production deployments.
  • Use configurable logging levels so that such detailed output is emitted only in secure debugging sessions.
  • Mask internal paths before logging if they must be logged.

- **Preconditions:**
  The attacker must be able to observe the output (or log stream) of the test–discovery process. This may occur in misconfigured deployments where logs are exposed.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  For example, in one adapter module, the function is defined as follows:
  ```python
  def get_absolute_test_id(test_id: str, testPath: pathlib.Path) -> str:
      split_id = test_id.split("::")[1:]
      absolute_test_id = "::".join([str(testPath), *split_id])
      print("absolute path", absolute_test_id)
      return absolute_test_id
  ```
  This use of a plain `print()` without sanitization discloses sensitive path information.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Deploy the extension with logging enabled so that standard output is visible or collected in logs.
  2. Supply a test identifier that reveals internal folder names during discovery.
  3. Trigger test discovery, then monitor logs or stdout for the full absolute path output.
  4. Verify that internal filesystem information is disclosed.

#### 4. Sensitive Information Disclosure via Exception Tracebacks in Unittest Discovery/Execution

- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Information Disclosure via Exception Tracebacks in Unittest Discovery/Execution
- **Description:**
  In the unittest adapter’s discovery routine (for example, in
  `pythonFiles/unittestadapter/discovery.py:discover_tests()`), any exception occurring during the test loading process is caught and the full traceback (via `traceback.format_exc()`) is appended to an error list. This error list is then included in the payload sent over a TCP socket without any sanitization or filtering. An attacker who triggers an exception (for example, by supplying an invalid test directory) may cause detailed stack traces—including file paths, line numbers, and code snippets—to be transmitted.

- **Impact:**
  Detailed exception tracebacks constitute sensitive information that may reveal internal code structure, filesystem layout, and other confidential implementation details; such information can be used to mount further attacks.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  Exceptions are caught and the complete traceback is directly captured (via `traceback.format_exc()`) with no redaction.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Sanitize or remove internal traceback details before including them in any payload or log output.
  • Optionally, limit the verbosity of error messages in production deployments.

- **Preconditions:**
  The attacker must be able to supply parameters (for example, an invalid `start_dir` or other discovery arguments) that cause an exception during test discovery. The attacker must also be able to intercept the resulting error payload (for example, via misconfigured socket bindings or exposed logs).

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  In the `discover_tests` function the flow is:
  ```python
  try:
      loader = unittest.TestLoader()
      suite = loader.discover(start_dir, pattern, top_level_dir)
      tests, error = build_test_tree(suite, cwd)
  except Exception:
      error.append(traceback.format_exc())
  …
  if len(error):
      payload["status"] = "error"
      payload["error"] = error
  ```
  The full traceback is then sent in the payload to the caller.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Invoke the discovery script with a malformed value for `--start-directory` so that test discovery fails.
  2. Capture the outgoing payload (for example, by running the adapter on a misconfigured network interface).
  3. Verify that the captured payload contains the full Python traceback, including sensitive internal details such as filesystem paths and source code lines.

#### 5. Insecure Socket Communication in Test Discovery/Execution Adapters

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Socket Communication in Test Discovery/Execution Adapters
- **Description:**
  Multiple adapter modules (including those for unittest discovery/execution, pytest discovery via the VS Code adapter, and the run–adapter in testing_tools) rely on a custom TCP–based protocol to exchange data with the “Node side” (or the test runner). These connections are established by creating a socket connection to a host/port (typically hardcoded as `"localhost"` with the port supplied via command–line or environment variables) and sending HTTP–like headers and JSON payloads, for example:
  ```python
  with socket_manager.SocketManager(addr) as s:
      if s.socket is not None:
          s.socket.sendall(request.encode("utf-8"))
  ```
  There is no authentication, encryption, or message integrity check on these communications.

- **Impact:**
  In the event that the service is misconfigured (for example, binding to all interfaces instead of only localhost) or if an attacker is able to compromise the local network, an attacker could intercept, modify, or inject malicious payloads. This could lead to tampering with test–discovery or execution results and potentially serve as a stepping stone for further attacks on the host.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  The socket is created with standard options (e.g. using `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` on Windows or `SO_REUSEADDR` on other platforms) but no authentication or encryption is applied.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Enforce binding exclusively to localhost and use firewall rules to restrict access.
  • Use an authenticated and/or encrypted communication channel (e.g. TLS) between endpoints.
  • Validate incoming payloads and verify that the source of the connection is trusted.

- **Preconditions:**
  The TCP port used for communications must be exposed (or misconfigured) so that an external attacker can connect. This may occur if the deployment is publicly accessible or the local network is compromised.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  In several modules (for example, in `pythonFiles/unittestadapter/discovery.py` and `pythonFiles/unittestadapter/execution.py`), a socket is created and connected as follows:
  ```python
  addr = ("localhost", port)
  …
  with socket_manager.SocketManager(addr) as s:
      if s.socket is not None:
          s.socket.sendall(request.encode("utf-8"))
  ```
  No client authentication or encryption is used before sending sensitive JSON payloads.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a test environment, configure the adapter’s TCP port to bind to a network–accessible interface (or simulate an attacker on the local network).
  2. Using a custom client, connect to the designated port and send a modified payload (or intercept the outgoing payload).
  3. Verify that the adapter accepts and processes the payload without any authentication checks.
  4. Demonstrate that an attacker can modify test–discovery or execution data in transit, thereby altering the reported results.

#### 6. Directory Traversal in Unittest Test Discovery via Unsanitized “--start-directory” Argument

- **Vulnerability Name:** Directory Traversal in Unittest Test Discovery via Unsanitized “--start-directory” Argument
- **Description:**
  In the unittest adapter, command–line arguments for test discovery (parsed in functions such as
  `pythonFiles/unittestadapter/utils.py:parse_unittest_args()`) accept a “start–directory” parameter (via the `--start-directory` or `-s` flag) with a default of `"."`. This parameter is then used with no further validation other than passing it directly to functions like `os.path.abspath()`. An attacker who is able to supply an arbitrary value (for example, a directory–traversal string such as `"../../../../etc"`) may force the discovery process to scan directories outside the intended scope, potentially importing (or even executing) sensitive or malicious modules not meant for testing.

- **Impact:**
  Exploitation could lead to the disclosure of sensitive files (via test discovery output) and might even enable arbitrary code execution if sensitive modules are loaded and run as part of the test suite.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  The value of “start–directory” is directly passed to `os.path.abspath()` with no checks to confirm that it lies within an approved directory tree.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Validate that the provided “start–directory” is within a pre–approved safe directory (for example, the project’s root folder).
  • Reject or properly sanitize values that contain traversal patterns (e.g. “../”) or resolve to directories outside a preset boundary.

- **Preconditions:**
  An attacker must be able to control the command–line arguments (or equivalent parameters) passed to the test discovery runner. This vector is more likely if the extension accepts external parameters or if an adversary gains control over the test–runner configuration.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  In the function:
  ```python
  def parse_unittest_args(args: List[str]) -> Tuple[str, str, Union[str, None]]:
      arg_parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
      arg_parser.add_argument("--start-directory", "-s", default=".")
      …
      parsed_args, _ = arg_parser.parse_known_args(args)
      return (parsed_args.start_directory, parsed_args.pattern, parsed_args.top_level_directory)
  ```
  The returned “start–directory” is then used in the discovery function as follows:
  ```python
  cwd = os.path.abspath(start_dir)
  suite = loader.discover(start_dir, pattern, top_level_dir)
  ```
  There is no check that `start_dir` (even after abspath conversion) lies within a safe boundary.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. Run the unittest discovery command and provide a “--start-directory” parameter containing directory–traversal elements (for example, `"../../../../etc"`).
  2. Trigger the test discovery process and capture its output/log.
  3. Verify that the discovery process scans directories and discovers files outside the expected project boundaries.
  4. Confirm that sensitive files (or tests in sensitive directories) are listed—even if unintentionally—thereby disclosing internal system information.

#### 7. Sensitive Information Disclosure via Uncontrolled Debug Output in Pytest Node Parsing

- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Information Disclosure via Uncontrolled Debug Output in Pytest Node Parsing
- **Description:**
  In the module `pythonFiles/testing_tools/adapter/pytest/_pytest_item.py`, the function `parse_item()` processes each pytest test node. When processing function–type test items, if an item’s attributes (such as `originalname` and `name`) are inconsistent, the code falls back to a branch that calls `should_never_reach_here(item, ...)`. This function prints a detailed error message, dumping internal attributes (including node IDs, file paths, markers, and more) and a complete stack trace via `traceback.print_stack()` using plain `print()` calls. An attacker controlling or introducing a malicious test file (or altering test metadata) can force this branch to execute, thereby causing unsanitized sensitive data from the application’s internals to be output.

- **Impact:**
  Exposure of detailed internal application state, including filesystem paths, internal test identifiers, and complete stack traces. Such information can be leveraged to refine further attacks by revealing internal structures and configurations.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  There is no control on the debug output. The function uses unconditional `print()` calls that emit unsanitized internal details to standard output.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  • Disable or restrict debug output in production environments.
  • Replace raw `print()` calls with conditional logging at appropriate log levels and sanitize output to remove sensitive internal details.
  • Ensure that unexpected branches in node parsing do not disclose full internal context to untrusted outputs.

- **Preconditions:**
  The attacker must be able to influence the test discovery process—such as by introducing a custom test file with manipulated attributes (for example, forcing a discrepancy between `originalname` and `name`)—so that the execution flow in `parse_item()` reaches the error branch calling `should_never_reach_here()`.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  In `pythonFiles/testing_tools/adapter/pytest/_pytest_item.py`, the processing flow is as follows:
  - The function `parse_item()` inspects the test item. For function–type items with a nonempty `originalname` that does not equal `name`, it computes a `parameterized` segment and then calls `_parse_node_id()` to split the node ID into components.
  - Immediately afterward, for a function item, it verifies that the computed full name (`fullname`) matches the expected combination of the test function name and the parameterized segment. When this check fails:
    ```python
    if testfunc and fullname != testfunc + parameterized:
         raise should_never_reach_here(item, fullname=fullname, testfunc=testfunc, parameterized=parameterized, ...)
    ```
  - The `should_never_reach_here()` function then proceeds to print:
    - A message instructing the user to file an issue.
    - A series of internal fields from the test item (using the helper `_summarize_item(item)`), which include sensitive details such as `nodeid`, `fspath`, and markers.
    - Any additional context passed via the `extra` parameters.
    - A full stack trace using `traceback.print_stack()`.
  The output from these print statements is unsanitized and can reveal internal details to an external attacker monitoring output or logs.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a test environment, create a malicious test file that defines a test function with manipulated attributes (for example, ensuring that the `originalname` differs from the actual `name` in a way that causes a mismatch in the computed full name).
  2. Run pytest discovery on the directory containing this test file.
  3. Capture the standard output or logs generated by the discovery process.
  4. Confirm that the execution path triggers `should_never_reach_here()` and that the printed output includes sensitive internal details—such as detailed test item attributes and a full stack trace.
  5. Verify that these details are not sanitized or protected by access controls.

#### 8. Dependency Integrity Issue in Debugpy and Pip Installation Scripts

- **Vulnerability Name:** Dependency Integrity Issue in Debugpy and Pip Installation Scripts
- **Description:**
    - The project uses scripts `pythonFiles/install_debugpy.py` and `pythonFiles/download_get_pip.py` to download and install `debugpy` and `pip` respectively during the build process and potentially during runtime in certain scenarios.
    - These scripts fetch files from hardcoded URLs:
        - `install_debugpy.py` fetches debugpy wheels from PyPI based on version `DEBUGGER_VERSION` and ABI compatibility.
        - `download_get_pip.py` fetches `get-pip.py` from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypa/get-pip/{version}/public/get-pip.py`.
    - There is no integrity verification (like checksum or signature validation) performed on the downloaded files.
    - If PyPI or `raw.githubusercontent.com` or the specific paths for `debugpy` wheels and `get-pip.py` are compromised, or if a man-in-the-middle attack occurs, malicious files could be downloaded and installed instead of the legitimate dependencies.
    - This could lead to supply chain security issues, potentially allowing an attacker to inject malicious code into the extension's dependencies during build or runtime installation.
- **Impact:**
    - **High** - Successful exploitation could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) within the environment where the extension is installed. An attacker could compromise the development or runtime environment by replacing legitimate dependencies with malicious ones. This could allow the attacker to steal credentials, modify code, or pivot to other systems.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The scripts directly download and extract/execute the files without any integrity checks.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks for downloaded files. This could be done by:
        - **Checksum Verification:**  Fetch and verify checksums (e.g., SHA256 hashes) of `debugpy` wheels and `get-pip.py` from a trusted source (like PyPI's metadata or a dedicated checksum file).
        - **Signature Verification:** If available, verify the digital signatures of the downloaded packages.
        - **Secure Channels:** Ensure HTTPS is used for all downloads to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks during transit (already in place for URLs, but needs to be ensured and explicitly mentioned as a mitigation).
    - **Dependency Pinning:** While `debugpy` version is pinned, there is no pinning or hash checking for `get-pip.py` content itself. Consider pinning the content of `get-pip.py` to a specific commit hash or using a specific version tag for more predictability and control.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Network connectivity to PyPI and `raw.githubusercontent.com` during the extension build or runtime dependency installation.
    - Successful execution of `install_debugpy.py` or `download_get_pip.py` scripts.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **`pythonFiles/install_debugpy.py`:**
        ```python
        def _download_and_extract(root, url, version):
            root = os.getcwd() if root is None or root == "." else root
            print(url)
            with url_lib.urlopen(url) as response: # Vulnerable Point: Downloads wheel without integrity check
                data = response.read()
                with zipfile.ZipFile(io.BytesIO(data), "r") as wheel:
                    for zip_info in wheel.infolist():
                        # Ignore dist info since we are merging multiple wheels
                        if ".dist-info/" in zip_info.filename:
                            continue
                        print("\t" + zip_info.filename)
                        wheel.extract(zip_info.filename, root)
        ```
        The function `_download_and_extract` downloads the debugpy wheel from the given `url` using `url_lib.urlopen` and extracts it. There is no step to verify the integrity of the downloaded wheel file before extraction.

    - **`pythonFiles/download_get_pip.py`:**
        ```python
        def _download_and_save(root, version):
            root = os.getcwd() if root is None or root == "." else root
            url = f"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pypa/get-pip/{version}/public/get-pip.py"
            print(url)
            with url_lib.urlopen(url) as response: # Vulnerable Point: Downloads get-pip.py without integrity check
                data = response.read()
                get_pip_file = pathlib.Path(root) / "get-pip.py"
                get_pip_file.write_bytes(data)
        ```
        The function `_download_and_save` downloads `get-pip.py` script from the hardcoded URL using `url_lib.urlopen` and saves it. No integrity check is performed on the downloaded `get-pip.py` script before saving it.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Intercept network traffic from the machine where the extension build process is running (e.g., using a proxy).
        - Identify the URL requested by `install_debugpy.py` or `download_get_pip.py` for downloading `debugpy` wheel or `get-pip.py`.
    2. **Attack:**
        - When the script attempts to download the dependency, the proxy should intercept the request.
        - Replace the legitimate `debugpy` wheel or `get-pip.py` content with a malicious file containing reverse shell or any other payload.
        - Forward the malicious response to the script.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Observe the execution of the build process. If the malicious payload is executed (e.g., reverse shell connects back to attacker's machine, or malicious actions are performed in the build environment), it confirms the vulnerability.
        - For `get-pip.py`, after replacement and execution, try to install a package using the compromised `pip` and observe if malicious actions are performed.
