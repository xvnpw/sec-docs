## Attack Tree Path: [1. Bypass Sanitization (Markdown-it Vulnerabilities) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__bypass_sanitization__markdown-it_vulnerabilities___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the foundation of most attacks. Markdown-it is responsible for converting Markdown to HTML and sanitizing it to prevent XSS.  If this sanitization can be bypassed, the attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.
*   **Why Critical:**  It's the core component; failure here compromises the entire system.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit known markdown-it CVEs (if unpatched) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_known_markdown-it_cves__if_unpatched___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  If the application uses an outdated version of `markdown-it` with known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), an attacker can craft malicious Markdown input that exploits these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker identifies a known CVE in the specific version of `markdown-it` used by the application.
    *   The attacker crafts a Markdown payload specifically designed to trigger the vulnerability.  This payload might involve unusual character sequences, malformed HTML tags (if partially allowed), or other techniques specific to the CVE.
    *   The attacker submits this malicious Markdown to the application.
    *   If the application is vulnerable, `markdown-it` fails to properly sanitize the input, and the injected JavaScript executes in the user's browser.
*   **Mitigation:** Keep `markdown-it` updated to the latest version. Use dependency management tools and vulnerability scanners.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 Exploit misconfiguration of markdown-it options [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_exploit_misconfiguration_of_markdown-it_options__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:**  `markdown-it` has several configuration options that, if misused, can create significant security vulnerabilities.
*   **Why High Risk:**  Easy to exploit, high impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1 `html: true` enabled (allows raw HTML) - Inject `<script>` tags directly. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__html_true__enabled__allows_raw_html__-_inject__script__tags_directly___critical_.md)

*   **Description:**  This is the most dangerous misconfiguration.  If `html: true` is set, `markdown-it` will *not* sanitize raw HTML embedded within the Markdown.  This allows an attacker to directly inject `<script>` tags containing arbitrary JavaScript.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker submits Markdown containing:  `<script>alert('XSS');</script>`
    *   `markdown-it` passes the HTML through unchanged.
    *   The browser executes the script.
*   **Mitigation:**  *Never* enable `html: true` unless absolutely necessary, and if you do, implement a robust, independent HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify) *after* `markdown-it` processing.  This is still risky.
*   **Why Critical:**  Direct, trivial XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.2 `linkify: true` with insufficient URL validation - Craft malicious URLs (e.g., `javascript:alert(1)`).[CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_2__linkify_true__with_insufficient_url_validation_-_craft_malicious_urls__e_g____javascriptalert_612ff373.md)

*   **Description:**  If `linkify: true` is enabled, `markdown-it` automatically converts text that looks like a URL into a clickable link.  However, if the URL validation is weak or absent, an attacker can create links using the `javascript:` protocol, which executes JavaScript when clicked.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker submits Markdown containing:  `[Click me](javascript:alert('XSS'))`
    *   `markdown-it` creates an `<a>` tag with the malicious `href`.
    *   When a user clicks the link, the JavaScript executes.
*   **Mitigation:**  Use a strong URL allowlist or a robust URL sanitization library to ensure that only safe protocols (like `http:` and `https:`) are allowed.  *Never* allow `javascript:` URLs.
*   **Why Critical:**  Common and easily overlooked vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Markdown Here Specific Features/Bugs](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_markdown_here_specific_featuresbugs.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Code Highlighting (highlight.js) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_code_highlighting__highlight_js__vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.2.1 Exploit known highlight.js CVEs (if unpatched) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_1_exploit_known_highlight_js_cves__if_unpatched___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to markdown-it, if an unpatched version of highlight.js is used, attackers can craft malicious code blocks to exploit known vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker identifies a known CVE in the highlight.js version.
    *   Attacker crafts a code block designed to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   The crafted code block, when processed, leads to JavaScript execution.
*   **Mitigation:** Keep highlight.js updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.4 Math Rendering (KaTeX/MathJax) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2_4_math_rendering__katexmathjax__vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.4.1 Exploit known KaTeX/MathJax CVEs [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_4_1_exploit_known_katexmathjax_cves__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Math rendering libraries can also have vulnerabilities. Unpatched versions are susceptible to crafted malicious math expressions.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Attacker identifies a known CVE in the KaTeX/MathJax version.
    *   Attacker crafts a malicious math expression to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   The expression, when rendered, executes JavaScript.
*   **Mitigation:** Keep KaTeX/MathJax updated.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Interactions with Other Libraries/Components](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_interactions_with_other_librariescomponents.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 If Markdown Here output is directly inserted into a vulnerable DOM context (e.g., without proper escaping), exploit that. [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_if_markdown_here_output_is_directly_inserted_into_a_vulnerable_dom_context__e_g___without_proper_c47da0e8.md)

*   **Description:**  Even if Markdown Here and its dependencies are perfectly secure and configured correctly, the *application* itself can still introduce an XSS vulnerability if it doesn't properly handle the output from Markdown Here.  This is a general web security issue, but it's crucial in this context.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Markdown Here sanitizes the input and produces safe HTML.
    *   The application takes this HTML and inserts it directly into the DOM *without* proper escaping or encoding.  For example, it might use `innerHTML` directly on an element without first sanitizing the output.
    *   If the output contains any characters that have special meaning in HTML (like `<`, `>`, `&`, `
