# Threat Model Analysis for adam-p/markdown-here

## Threat: [XSS via Malicious Script Injection in Link URLs](./threats/xss_via_malicious_script_injection_in_link_urls.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Markdown link using a malicious `javascript:` URL or other dangerous URL schemes. Markdown Here's link parsing logic fails to properly sanitize these URLs, allowing the injected script to be executed in the victim's browser. Example: `[Click Me](javascript:alert('XSS'))`.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete account compromise, data breaches, session hijacking, redirection to phishing sites, and other actions the user could perform.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Markdown Here's link parsing and rendering logic (likely within the core Markdown parsing module and potentially a URL sanitization function).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict URL Whitelisting (Post-Processing):** After Markdown Here processes the input, use a dedicated URL parsing library to enforce a strict whitelist of allowed URL schemes (e.g., `http`, `https`, `mailto`). Reject any URL that doesn't match.
        *   **URL Sanitization Library (Post-Processing):** Employ a robust URL sanitization library (e.g., from `DOMPurify` or a standalone library) *after* Markdown Here rendering to parse and validate URLs, handling encoding/decoding correctly.
        *   **CSP (script-src):** Implement a strong Content Security Policy with a restrictive `script-src` directive to prevent the execution of inline JavaScript, even if a `javascript:` URL is injected.

## Threat: [XSS via Malicious Script Injection in Image URLs](./threats/xss_via_malicious_script_injection_in_image_urls.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a Markdown image tag with a malicious `javascript:` URL or other dangerous URL scheme in the `src` attribute. Markdown Here's image parsing logic fails to sanitize these URLs. Example: `![alt text](javascript:alert('XSS'))`.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially the same as link-based XSS (account compromise, data breaches), although exploitation might be less reliable depending on the browser and rendering context.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Markdown Here's image parsing and rendering logic (likely a separate function or module from link handling, but potentially sharing sanitization routines).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict URL Whitelisting (Post-Processing):** Apply the *same* strict URL whitelisting and sanitization strategies as for link URLs, using a dedicated library *after* Markdown Here processing.
        *   **Image Proxy (Optional):** Consider using an image proxy to fetch and serve all images, isolating the application from potentially malicious image URLs.
        *   **CSP (script-src):** A strong CSP with a restrictive `script-src` is crucial.

## Threat: [XSS via Malicious HTML Attributes](./threats/xss_via_malicious_html_attributes.md)

*   **Description:** If Markdown Here allows inline HTML or custom Markdown extensions that permit arbitrary HTML attributes, an attacker can inject malicious event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`). Markdown Here's sanitization (if any) fails to remove these attributes. Example: `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript, leading to account compromise, data breaches, and other XSS consequences.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Markdown Here's HTML sanitization module (if it exists) or the lack thereof. The core Markdown parsing logic, which determines allowed HTML elements and attributes, is also directly involved.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable Inline HTML (Configuration):** Configure Markdown Here to *completely disable* the rendering of inline HTML. This is the most secure option.
        *   **Strict HTML Sanitization (DOMPurify - Post-Processing):** If inline HTML *must* be allowed, use a robust HTML sanitizer like DOMPurify *after* Markdown Here rendering. Configure DOMPurify with a *very restrictive* whitelist, disallowing *all* event handler attributes (`on*`).
        *   **CSP (script-src):** A strong CSP with a restrictive `script-src` directive is essential to prevent the execution of inline event handlers.

## Threat: [XSS via Exploiting Parser Bugs](./threats/xss_via_exploiting_parser_bugs.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in Markdown Here's parsing engine (or the underlying Markdown library it uses) and crafts a specific Markdown input to trigger this bug, resulting in JavaScript injection. This could be a buffer overflow, a regular expression DoS leveraged for XSS, or an unexpected interaction between Markdown features.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete control over the user's session, data breaches, and all other consequences of XSS.
    *   **Affected Component:**  The core Markdown parsing engine within Markdown Here or its dependent Markdown library (e.g., `marked`, `markdown-it`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Markdown Here and *all* of its dependencies (especially the Markdown parser) up-to-date. Monitor security advisories for all related projects.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Perform fuzz testing on the Markdown rendering pipeline to try to trigger unexpected behavior.
        *   **HTML Sanitization (DOMPurify - Post-Processing):** Even for parser bugs, a robust HTML sanitizer like DOMPurify *after* Markdown Here rendering provides a crucial last line of defense.
        *   **Defense in Depth:** Combine multiple mitigation strategies (sanitization, CSP, input validation) for layered protection.
