# Attack Surface Analysis for adam-p/markdown-here

## Attack Surface: [1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Injection (Critical)](./attack_surfaces/1__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_injection__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious Javascript code injected through Markdown syntax, executed in a user's browser after Markdown-Here conversion to HTML.
*   **Markdown-Here Contribution:** Markdown-Here's primary function of converting Markdown to HTML, if not properly sanitized, creates a direct pathway for injecting and executing malicious scripts.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Markdown Input:** `` `<img src="x" onerror="alert('Critical XSS Vulnerability!')">` ``
    *   **Markdown-Here Conversion (Vulnerable):** `<img src="x" onerror="alert('Critical XSS Vulnerability!')">`
    *   **Execution:** Browser executes the Javascript `alert('Critical XSS Vulnerability!')` from the `onerror` attribute.
*   **Impact:** Complete compromise of user accounts, session hijacking, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, and arbitrary code execution within the user's browser.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust HTML Sanitization:** Implement a strong HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify or Bleach) *after* Markdown-Here performs the Markdown to HTML conversion.  Whitelist allowed HTML tags and attributes, and strictly escape or remove any potentially dangerous elements or Javascript code.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Enforce a strict CSP to control resource loading in the browser, significantly limiting the impact of XSS attacks by restricting script sources and inline execution.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Testing:** Conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities in the Markdown-Here integration and sanitization processes.

## Attack Surface: [2. HTML Injection and Content Spoofing (High)](./attack_surfaces/2__html_injection_and_content_spoofing__high_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of arbitrary HTML through Markdown, leading to content manipulation, visual deception, and phishing opportunities, even without direct Javascript execution.
*   **Markdown-Here Contribution:** Markdown-Here's HTML generation capabilities can be exploited to inject HTML tags that, while not executing scripts, can drastically alter the visual presentation and potentially mislead users.
*   **Example:**
    *   **Markdown Input:** `` `[Urgent Security Alert! Click Here](https://malicious.example.com) <div style="position:fixed; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9); z-index:9999;"> <h1 style="color:red; text-align:center;">URGENT SECURITY ALERT!</h1> <p style="text-align:center;">Your account may be compromised. Click the link above to verify.</p> </div>` ``
    *   **Markdown-Here Conversion (Vulnerable):**  `<a href="https://malicious.example.com">Urgent Security Alert! Click Here</a> <div style="position:fixed; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%; background-color:rgba(255,255,255,0.9); z-index:9999;"> <h1 style="color:red; text-align:center;">URGENT SECURITY ALERT!</h1> <p style="text-align:center;">Your account may be compromised. Click the link above to verify.</p> </div>`
    *   **Execution:** The injected `<div>` overlays the entire page with a fake security alert, making the malicious link appear legitimate and urgent.
*   **Impact:** Highly effective phishing attacks, significant reputation damage, widespread user confusion and distrust, manipulation of critical information displayed to users.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict and Context-Aware HTML Sanitization:** Implement a highly restrictive HTML sanitizer that aggressively removes or neutralizes HTML tags and attributes that enable visual manipulation (e.g., `style`, `position`, `z-index`, layout-altering tags).  Sanitization should be context-aware, considering the intended use of Markdown-Here and the acceptable HTML elements.
    *   **Content Preview and Moderation:** For user-generated Markdown, provide a clear preview of the rendered HTML *after* sanitization. Implement content moderation workflows to review and approve Markdown content before it is displayed publicly, especially in sensitive areas.
    *   **User Education (Contextual Warnings):**  In contexts where HTML injection is a significant risk, display clear warnings to users about the potential dangers of clicking links or interacting with content from untrusted sources, even if it appears to be within the application.

## Attack Surface: [3. Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Markdown Parsing (High)](./attack_surfaces/3__regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_markdown_parsing__high_.md)

*   **Description:**  Specially crafted Markdown input exploits inefficient regular expressions within Markdown-Here's parsing engine, leading to excessive CPU consumption and denial of service.
*   **Markdown-Here Contribution:** Markdown-Here's parsing process relies on regular expressions to interpret Markdown syntax. Vulnerable regex patterns can be triggered by malicious input, causing the parser to become extremely slow and resource-intensive.
*   **Example:** (Conceptual - ReDoS patterns are complex and parser-specific)
    *   **Markdown Input:**  `` `[Very long link text with many nested brackets](aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...)` `` (Input designed to trigger backtracking in regex matching link text or URLs).
    *   **Markdown-Here Parsing (Vulnerable):** The parsing process gets stuck in exponential backtracking while processing the complex input, consuming excessive CPU time.
    *   **Execution:** Repeated requests with ReDoS-triggering Markdown can overload the server or client, leading to application unresponsiveness or complete denial of service.
*   **Impact:** Application-wide slowdowns, server resource exhaustion, denial of service for all legitimate users, potential for infrastructure instability.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Complexity Limits:** Implement strict limits on the size and complexity of Markdown input. Reject excessively long inputs, deeply nested structures, or inputs with patterns known to trigger ReDoS in regex engines.
    *   **ReDoS-Resistant Parser or Regex Optimization:**  Investigate and replace vulnerable regular expressions in Markdown-Here's parsing logic with optimized, ReDoS-resistant alternatives. Consider using Markdown parser libraries specifically designed to mitigate ReDoS risks.
    *   **Rate Limiting and Request Throttling:** Implement aggressive rate limiting and request throttling to limit the number of Markdown processing requests from a single source, mitigating the impact of automated ReDoS attacks.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:** Continuously monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory) during Markdown processing. Set up alerts to detect unusual spikes in resource consumption that might indicate a ReDoS attack in progress, allowing for rapid response and mitigation.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF with ReDoS protection rules to detect and block malicious requests attempting to exploit ReDoS vulnerabilities in Markdown parsing.
