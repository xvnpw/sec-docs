# Threat Model Analysis for adam-p/markdown-here

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Injection](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted Markdown input containing embedded JavaScript or HTML is processed by "markdown-here". The library fails to properly sanitize this input, resulting in the execution of the injected JavaScript code within the user's browser when the rendered HTML is displayed. This allows attackers to steal user session data, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions within the application's context.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Successful XSS exploitation can lead to complete user account compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive information, and significant damage to the application's integrity and user trust.
*   **Affected Component:** Markdown Rendering Engine (within "markdown-here"). Specifically, the module responsible for converting Markdown to HTML and handling inline HTML or JavaScript.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent inline JavaScript execution and restrict script sources.
    *   Apply robust output sanitization (post-processing) to the HTML generated by "markdown-here" using a dedicated HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify. This should remove or neutralize any potentially harmful HTML elements and attributes, especially JavaScript event handlers and `<iframe>` tags.
    *   While less reliable as a primary defense, consider input validation (pre-processing) to detect and reject obvious malicious patterns in Markdown input before processing.
    *   If using a programmatic interface or modified version of "markdown-here", ensure it is updated to the latest version to benefit from potential security fixes.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Underlying Markdown Parsing Library (Indirect but Relevant)](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_underlying_markdown_parsing_library__indirect_but_relevant_.md)

*   **Description:** "markdown-here" relies on an external Markdown parsing library. If this underlying library has critical security vulnerabilities (e.g., code execution flaws, memory corruption), attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting specific, malicious Markdown input. When "markdown-here" processes this input using the vulnerable library, it could lead to arbitrary code execution or other severe security breaches within the application or user's browser environment.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical. Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the underlying parsing library can result in arbitrary code execution, data corruption, or complete system compromise, depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** Underlying Markdown Parsing Library (dependency of "markdown-here"). The vulnerable module or function within the parsing library itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability in the dependency).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   While indirect, stay informed about the security posture of "markdown-here" and any reported vulnerabilities in its dependencies. If you maintain a modified version or programmatic integration, actively monitor and update the underlying Markdown parsing library to its latest patched version.
    *   The output sanitization and CSP mitigations recommended for XSS will also provide a layer of defense against potential exploits originating from vulnerabilities in the underlying parser, by limiting the impact of unexpected or malicious HTML output.
