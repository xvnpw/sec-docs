# Threat Model: Application Using Markdown Here - High-Risk Sub-Tree

**Objective:** Compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities within the Markdown Here library.

**Attacker's Goal:** Execute arbitrary code within the context of the application or gain unauthorized access to sensitive information by leveraging vulnerabilities in how the application uses Markdown Here.

## High-Risk Sub-Tree and Critical Nodes:

└── **Compromise Application via Markdown Here** (Critical Node)
    └── **Exploit Malicious HTML Injection** (High-Risk Path)
        └── **Inject Malicious <script> Tags** (Critical Node)
            └── **Bypass Input Sanitization** (Critical Node)
                ├── Leverage Incomplete Markdown Parsing
                └── Exploit Differences in Markdown Here's Rendering vs. Application's Expectations
            └── **Execute Arbitrary JavaScript in User's Browser** (Critical Node)
                ├── **Steal Session Cookies/Tokens** (High-Risk Path)
                ├── **Modify DOM to Inject Malicious Content** (High-Risk Path)
                └── **Redirect User to Malicious Site** (High-Risk Path)

## Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

### 1. Compromise Application via Markdown Here (Critical Node)

*   **Description:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities within Markdown Here leads to the compromise of the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:** All the sub-nodes in the attack tree represent potential attack vectors leading to this goal. The high-risk paths detailed below are the most likely avenues.

### 2. Exploit Malicious HTML Injection (High-Risk Path)

*   **Description:** This is the primary high-risk path. By injecting malicious HTML through Markdown Here, an attacker can execute arbitrary code or manipulate the application's behavior.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Injecting `<script>` tags to execute JavaScript.
    *   Injecting HTML attributes with event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`) to execute JavaScript.
    *   Injecting malicious links (e.g., `javascript:` URLs) to execute JavaScript or trigger unintended actions.

### 3. Inject Malicious `<script>` Tags (Critical Node)

*   **Description:** This critical node represents the direct injection of `<script>` tags into the rendered HTML. Successful injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Crafting Markdown input that, when processed by Markdown Here, results in the rendering of `<script>` tags. This often involves bypassing input sanitization.

### 4. Bypass Input Sanitization (Critical Node)

*   **Description:** This critical node represents the attacker's ability to circumvent the application's security measures designed to prevent the injection of malicious HTML.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Leverage Incomplete Markdown Parsing:** Exploiting edge cases or less common Markdown syntax that Markdown Here parses into dangerous HTML, while the application's sanitization might not recognize this specific pattern.
    *   **Exploit Differences in Markdown Here's Rendering vs. Application's Expectations:**  Taking advantage of discrepancies in how Markdown Here renders certain Markdown constructs compared to the application's interpretation or sanitization rules for the final HTML.

### 5. Execute Arbitrary JavaScript in User's Browser (Critical Node)

*   **Description:** This critical node signifies the successful execution of malicious JavaScript within the user's browser context. This is a direct consequence of successful HTML injection, particularly the injection of `<script>` tags or event handlers.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Any JavaScript code embedded within injected `<script>` tags or triggered by injected event handlers.

### 6. Steal Session Cookies/Tokens (High-Risk Path)

*   **Description:** A common and high-impact consequence of successful JavaScript execution (XSS). Attackers can use JavaScript to access and exfiltrate session cookies or tokens, leading to account takeover.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Using `document.cookie` in JavaScript to access cookies.
    *   Using `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch` to send cookies or tokens to an attacker-controlled server.

### 7. Modify DOM to Inject Malicious Content (High-Risk Path)

*   **Description:** Another common and high-impact consequence of XSS. Attackers can use JavaScript to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) of the web page, injecting fake login forms, displaying misleading information, or redirecting users.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Using JavaScript DOM manipulation methods (e.g., `document.createElement`, `appendChild`, `innerHTML`) to inject malicious content.

### 8. Redirect User to Malicious Site (High-Risk Path)

*   **Description:** A direct consequence of successful JavaScript execution (XSS). Attackers can use JavaScript to redirect the user's browser to a malicious website, potentially leading to malware infection, phishing attacks, or further exploitation.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Using `window.location.href` or similar JavaScript methods to redirect the user.
