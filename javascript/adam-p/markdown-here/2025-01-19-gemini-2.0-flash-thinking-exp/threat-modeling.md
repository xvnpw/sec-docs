# Threat Model Analysis for adam-p/markdown-here

## Threat: [Injection of Arbitrary HTML/JavaScript](./threats/injection_of_arbitrary_htmljavascript.md)

*   **Threat:** Injection of Arbitrary HTML/JavaScript
    *   **Description:**
        *   **What the attacker might do and how:** An attacker crafts malicious Markdown input containing HTML or JavaScript code. When Markdown Here renders this input, the malicious code is injected into the resulting HTML and executed by the target application (e.g., email client, browser). This can be achieved by using raw HTML tags within the Markdown or exploiting vulnerabilities in the Markdown parser *within Markdown Here* to generate unintended HTML structures.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks can occur, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, redirect users to malicious sites, deface content, or perform actions on behalf of the user within the context of the target application.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Description:** Markdown Parser/Renderer module within the Markdown Here extension. Specifically, the part responsible for converting Markdown syntax into HTML.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Description:**
            *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization on the Markdown input *within Markdown Here* before rendering. This involves stripping or escaping potentially harmful HTML tags and JavaScript code.
            *   **Contextual Output Encoding:** Ensure that the rendered output *from Markdown Here* is properly encoded for the HTML context to prevent the interpretation of injected code.
            *   **Use a Secure Markdown Parser:** Employ a well-vetted and actively maintained Markdown parsing library *within Markdown Here* that is resistant to known injection vulnerabilities. Regularly update the library to patch any discovered flaws.

## Threat: [Bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP)](./threats/bypassing_content_security_policy__csp_.md)

*   **Threat:** Bypassing Content Security Policy (CSP)
    *   **Description:**
        *   **What the attacker might do and how:** An attacker crafts Markdown that, when rendered *by Markdown Here*, produces HTML that circumvents the target application's Content Security Policy. This could involve using inline event handlers, `javascript:` URLs, or data URIs to execute scripts that would normally be blocked by the CSP.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Allows the execution of scripts from unintended sources, undermining the security provided by the CSP and potentially leading to XSS or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Description:** Markdown Parser/Renderer module within Markdown Here, specifically the part that handles attributes and URLs within Markdown elements.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Description:**
            *   **Strict Attribute Filtering:**  Implement strict filtering of HTML attributes generated from Markdown *by Markdown Here*, removing or sanitizing attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`, and `href` values starting with `javascript:`.
            *   **Data URI Handling:** Carefully review and potentially restrict the use of data URIs for sensitive content or script execution *within Markdown Here's rendering logic*.

## Threat: [Markdown Parser Vulnerabilities](./threats/markdown_parser_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Markdown Parser Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:**
        *   **What the attacker might do and how:** An attacker provides specially crafted Markdown input that exploits a vulnerability in the Markdown parser *used by Markdown Here*. This could lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even remote code execution within the context of the extension.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Can compromise the user's system or the target application. Remote code execution could allow the attacker to gain complete control over the affected environment.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Description:** The specific Markdown parsing library or module used by Markdown Here.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Description:**
            *   **Use a Secure and Updated Parser:** Employ a well-vetted and actively maintained Markdown parsing library. Regularly update the library to patch any discovered vulnerabilities.
            *   **Input Validation:** Implement input validation *within Markdown Here* to detect and reject potentially malicious Markdown structures before passing them to the parser.
            *   **Sandboxing (Extension):**  Run the Markdown Here extension in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of any potential parser vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Extension Updates/Distribution](./threats/malicious_extension_updatesdistribution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Extension Updates/Distribution
    *   **Description:**
        *   **What the attacker might do and how:** An attacker compromises the update mechanism or distributes a malicious version of the Markdown Here extension through unofficial channels. Users who install or update to this malicious version could have their browser or email client compromised.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Complete compromise of the user's browser or email client, allowing attackers to steal data, monitor activity, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Description:** The extension's update mechanism and distribution channels for Markdown Here.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Description:**
            *   **Official Distribution Channels:** Encourage users to only download and install the extension from official and trusted sources (e.g., browser extension stores).
            *   **Secure Update Mechanism:** Implement a secure update mechanism *for Markdown Here* that uses HTTPS and verifies the integrity of updates using digital signatures.
            *   **Code Signing:** Sign the extension code *of Markdown Here* to ensure its authenticity and prevent tampering.

## Threat: [Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities](./threats/client-side_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:**
        *   **What the attacker might do and how:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the client-side JavaScript code *of the Markdown Here extension*. This could involve manipulating input parameters, exploiting logic flaws, or injecting malicious code that is executed by the extension's JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Description:** Similar to XSS, attackers could execute arbitrary code within the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Description:** JavaScript modules and functions within the Markdown Here extension.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Description:**
            *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing the extension's JavaScript code, including input validation, output encoding, and avoiding common JavaScript vulnerabilities.
            *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the extension's JavaScript code.
            *   **Dependency Management:** Keep all JavaScript dependencies *of Markdown Here* up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Minimize Client-Side Logic:**  Where possible, minimize the amount of sensitive logic performed on the client-side *within Markdown Here*.
