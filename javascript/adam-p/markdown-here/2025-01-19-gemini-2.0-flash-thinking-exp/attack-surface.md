# Attack Surface Analysis for adam-p/markdown-here

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Maliciously crafted Markdown code, when rendered by the extension, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the context of the webpage.
    *   **How Markdown Here Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The core functionality of Markdown Here is to parse and render Markdown into HTML. If the parsing or rendering process is not secure, it can be exploited to inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Example:** A user copies Markdown containing `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` and uses Markdown Here to render it. The `onerror` event will trigger the JavaScript `alert('XSS')`.
    *   **Impact:**  Can lead to stealing cookies and session tokens, redirecting users to malicious websites, defacing the webpage, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Use a robust and actively maintained Markdown parsing library with built-in sanitization features. Ensure all rendered HTML is properly escaped to prevent script execution. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources. Regularly update the parsing library to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about rendering Markdown from untrusted sources. Review the rendered HTML if you are unsure about the source.

## Attack Surface: [Markdown Parser Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/markdown_parser_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or vulnerabilities within the specific Markdown parsing library used by the extension can be exploited to cause unexpected behavior, denial-of-service, or potentially even remote code execution.
    *   **How Markdown Here Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The extension relies on a third-party library to interpret Markdown syntax. Vulnerabilities in this library directly impact the security of the extension.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted Markdown input with deeply nested elements or unusual character combinations could cause the parser to crash or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial-of-service (crashing the browser tab or the extension), unexpected behavior, potential for more severe exploits depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if the parser vulnerability allows for more than just DoS)

## Attack Surface: [Overly Broad Extension Permissions](./attack_surfaces/overly_broad_extension_permissions.md)

*   **Description:** If the extension requests excessive permissions beyond what is strictly necessary for its functionality, a compromised extension could be used to perform malicious actions with those elevated privileges.
    *   **How Markdown Here Contributes to the Attack Surface:** The extension requires certain permissions to access and modify webpage content. If these permissions are too broad, they can be abused.
    *   **Example:** If the extension has permission to "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit," a compromised extension could potentially steal sensitive information from any webpage.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the granted permissions, a compromised extension could steal data, modify website content, track browsing activity, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Adhere to the principle of least privilege and request only the necessary permissions for the extension to function correctly. Clearly justify the requested permissions in the extension's description.
        *   **Users:** Review the permissions requested by the extension before installing it. Be wary of extensions that request overly broad permissions without a clear justification. Regularly review installed extensions and remove any that are no longer needed or seem suspicious.
