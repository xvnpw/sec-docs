                *   Craft Markdown containing `<iframe>` tags with malicious src or other attributes
                *   Application renders the unsanitized HTML, potentially loading external malicious content
*   **AND: Application Exposes Markdown Here Functionality to Untrusted Input (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   Application allows users to input Markdown directly
        *   User provides malicious Markdown
    *   Application retrieves Markdown from external, untrusted sources
        *   External source provides malicious Markdown
    *   Application uses Markdown Here to process data from untrusted sources without proper sanitization on the application side
        *   Untrusted data contains malicious Markdown

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Markdown Here Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_markdown_here_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents the core vulnerability within the `adam-p/markdown-here` library itself. If an attacker can successfully exploit how the library processes Markdown, it opens the door to injecting malicious HTML. This is a critical point because it bypasses the intended functionality of the library and allows for direct manipulation of the rendered output.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_html.md)

This path focuses on the injection of harmful HTML code through the Markdown processing. If Markdown Here fails to properly sanitize the generated HTML, attackers can insert tags that execute malicious scripts or load harmful content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject <script> tags](./attack_tree_paths/inject_script_tags.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker crafts Markdown input that includes `<script>` tags containing malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Vulnerability:** Markdown Here fails to remove or neutralize these `<script>` tags during the Markdown to HTML conversion.
*   **Impact:** When the application renders the resulting HTML, the injected JavaScript executes within the user's browser. This allows for a wide range of attacks, including:
    *   Stealing session cookies and hijacking user accounts.
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying the content of the page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject <iframe> tags](./attack_tree_paths/inject_iframe_tags.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** The attacker crafts Markdown input that includes `<iframe>` tags. These tags can have malicious `src` attributes pointing to attacker-controlled websites or malicious attributes like `onload` that execute JavaScript.
*   **Vulnerability:** Markdown Here fails to sanitize or remove these `<iframe>` tags and their potentially dangerous attributes.
*   **Impact:** When the application renders the HTML, the `<iframe>` tag loads content from the specified URL. This can lead to:
    *   Loading malicious content from an external site.
    *   Clickjacking attacks, where the attacker overlays a transparent malicious layer on top of legitimate content.
    *   Loading exploits that target browser vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Exposes Markdown Here Functionality to Untrusted Input](./attack_tree_paths/application_exposes_markdown_here_functionality_to_untrusted_input.md)

This node highlights a critical flaw in how the application integrates and uses the `adam-p/markdown-here` library. Even if the library itself were perfectly secure, exposing it to untrusted input without proper sanitization at the application level creates a significant vulnerability.

*   **Attack Vector:** The application allows users to directly input Markdown, which is then processed by Markdown Here. If this input is not sanitized, users can inject malicious Markdown.
*   **Attack Vector:** The application retrieves Markdown content from external sources that are not under its control. If these sources are compromised or malicious, they can inject harmful Markdown.
*   **Attack Vector:** The application processes data from untrusted sources using Markdown Here without first sanitizing the data. This means any malicious Markdown embedded within the untrusted data will be processed and potentially rendered.
*   **Vulnerability:** The application lacks proper input validation and sanitization mechanisms before passing data to Markdown Here.
*   **Impact:** This allows attackers to leverage any vulnerabilities within Markdown Here's processing to compromise the application, as described in the "Inject Malicious HTML" high-risk paths. The impact is the same as the specific injection attack that is successful.
