## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve Code Execution via XSS [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_code_execution_via_xss__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

* **Why High-Risk/Critical:** This path has a Medium likelihood and a Critical impact. Successful execution allows the attacker to run arbitrary code within the user's browser, leading to complete compromise of the user's session and potentially the application.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Inject Malicious `<script>` Tags [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Exploit insufficient HTML sanitization in Markdown Here's rendering [CRITICAL NODE]:** The core vulnerability. If Markdown Here doesn't properly remove or escape `<script>` tags, they will be rendered and executed by the browser.
        * **Leverage injected script to: Steal sensitive data (cookies, tokens, etc.) [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Attackers can use JavaScript to access and exfiltrate sensitive information stored in cookies or local storage.
        * **Leverage injected script to: Perform actions on behalf of the user [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Attackers can make requests to the application's backend as if they were the logged-in user, potentially modifying data or performing unauthorized actions.
    * **Inject Malicious HTML Attributes with JavaScript Event Handlers [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Exploit insufficient attribute sanitization [CRITICAL NODE]:** If attributes like `onload`, `onerror`, `onclick` are not properly sanitized, attackers can inject JavaScript code into these attributes.
        * **Trigger execution upon event occurrence (e.g., image load failure, click) [CRITICAL NODE]:** When the specified event occurs (e.g., an image fails to load), the injected JavaScript code will be executed.
    * **Exploit Browser Quirks or Rendering Engine Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Achieve code execution through unexpected behavior [CRITICAL NODE]:**  By crafting specific Markdown input, attackers might trigger unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in the browser's HTML or JavaScript rendering engine, leading to code execution. This is generally lower likelihood but has a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Application Behavior via HTML Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_application_behavior_via_html_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Why High-Risk:** This path has a Medium likelihood and a Moderate to Significant impact. While not always leading to direct code execution, it can be used for phishing and malware distribution.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Inject Malicious iframes [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Exploit lack of iframe sanitization:** If Markdown Here doesn't prevent or sanitize `<iframe>` tags, attackers can embed external content.
        * **Embed iframes pointing to malicious domains to: Phish for credentials [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers can display fake login pages within an iframe to steal user credentials.
        * **Embed iframes pointing to malicious domains to: Serve malware [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers can redirect users to websites that attempt to install malware on their systems.
    * **Inject Form Elements for Data Theft [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Exploit lack of sanitization for `<form>` and related tags:** If form elements are not sanitized, attackers can inject their own forms.
        * **Inject fake login forms or other input fields to capture user data [CRITICAL NODE]:** Attackers can create fake input fields to trick users into entering sensitive information, which is then sent to the attacker.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Markdown-Specific Features for Malicious Purposes [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_markdown-specific_features_for_malicious_purposes__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Why High-Risk:** This path has a Medium likelihood and a Significant impact. It leverages the specific syntax of Markdown to introduce malicious content.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Craft Malicious Links with `javascript:` Protocol [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Exploit lack of sanitization for URL protocols in links:** If Markdown Here allows the `javascript:` protocol in links, attackers can create links that execute arbitrary JavaScript when clicked.
        * **Create links that execute arbitrary JavaScript when clicked [CRITICAL NODE]:**  A user clicking on such a link will trigger the execution of the malicious JavaScript.
    * **Embed Malicious Images with Event Handlers in URL [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Exploit lack of sanitization for image URLs:** If Markdown Here doesn't sanitize image URLs, attackers can include JavaScript code within event handlers in the URL (e.g., using `onerror`).
        * **Embed images with `onerror` or other event handlers in the URL to execute JavaScript [CRITICAL NODE]:** When the browser attempts to load the image (and fails, triggering `onerror`), the embedded JavaScript will be executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Vulnerabilities in Markdown Here's Parser or Rendering Logic (Specific Critical Node):](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_markdown_here's_parser_or_rendering_logic__specific_critical_node_.md)

* **Why Critical:** While the overall path has a Low likelihood, exploiting vulnerabilities in the underlying rendering library can have a Critical impact.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in the Underlying Rendering Library (if any):**
        * **Achieve code execution or bypass security measures [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the JavaScript library used by Markdown Here for rendering has known vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS flaws), attackers can craft specific Markdown input to trigger these vulnerabilities and potentially achieve code execution or bypass security measures. This is generally a lower likelihood attack requiring specific knowledge of the underlying library's vulnerabilities.
