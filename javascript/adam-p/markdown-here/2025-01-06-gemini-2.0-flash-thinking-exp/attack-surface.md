# Attack Surface Analysis for adam-p/markdown-here

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_markdown.md)

* **Description:**  The ability for an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a webpage by crafting malicious Markdown input.
    * **How Markdown Here Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Markdown Here's primary function is to convert Markdown into HTML. If the conversion process doesn't properly sanitize or escape potentially harmful HTML elements or JavaScript constructs embedded within the Markdown, it can introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:**  A user pastes or types the following Markdown: `` `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS!')">` ``. When rendered by Markdown Here, this could execute the JavaScript `alert('XSS!')` in the user's browser.
    * **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the webpage, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Implement robust HTML sanitization libraries (e.g., DOMPurify) during the Markdown to HTML conversion process. Ensure all user-provided Markdown is processed through this sanitization step before being injected into the DOM. Regularly update sanitization libraries to address newly discovered bypasses.
        * **Users:** Be cautious about pasting Markdown from untrusted sources. If possible, review the rendered HTML before submitting or relying on the content.

## Attack Surface: [HTML Injection Leading to Phishing or UI Redress](./attack_surfaces/html_injection_leading_to_phishing_or_ui_redress.md)

* **Description:** The ability to inject arbitrary HTML into the webpage, even if JavaScript execution is blocked, allowing for the creation of fake UI elements or misleading content.
    * **How Markdown Here Contributes to the Attack Surface:**  If Markdown Here doesn't properly escape or remove potentially harmful HTML tags (even without JavaScript), attackers can inject elements that mimic legitimate UI components for phishing or other deceptive purposes.
    * **Example:** A user pastes Markdown containing: `` `<div style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: white; z-index: 9999;">Fake Login Form Here</div>` ``. This could overlay a fake login form on the actual page.
    * **Impact:**  Users can be tricked into entering credentials or sensitive information into fake forms, leading to credential theft or other forms of social engineering attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** **High**
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Employ strict HTML sanitization that removes or escapes potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes, even those without direct JavaScript execution capabilities. Focus on preventing the injection of elements that can alter the page's visual structure in a malicious way.
        * **Users:** Be vigilant about unexpected UI elements or requests for information. Verify the authenticity of the webpage before entering sensitive data.
