        print("\n**1. Implement Robust HTML Sanitization (Post `markdown-here`):**")
        print(
            "   - **Utilize DOMPurify:** This is a highly recommended, actively maintained, and well-regarded HTML sanitization library. Integrate it into your application's processing pipeline *after* `markdown-here` has converted the Markdown to HTML.\n"
            "     - **Installation:**  Use a package manager like npm or yarn to install DOMPurify.\n"
            "     - **Implementation:**  Pass the HTML output from `markdown-here` through DOMPurify's `sanitize()` function before rendering it in the user's browser.\n"
            "     - **Configuration:**  Understand DOMPurify's configuration options to tailor the sanitization rules to your application's specific needs. Consider using a strict configuration initially and relaxing it only when necessary and with careful consideration.\n"
            "     - **Example (Conceptual):**\n"
            "       ```python\n"
            "       from dompurify import sanitize\n"
            "\n"
            "       markdown_input = '# Hello <script>alert(\\'XSS\\')</script>'\n"
            "       html_output = markdown_here.convert(markdown_input)  # Assuming markdown_here is the library\n"
            "       sanitized_html = sanitize(html_output)\n"
            "       # Render sanitized_html in the browser\n"
            "       ```"
        )
        print(
            "   - **Alternative Sanitization Libraries:** While DOMPurify is preferred, other libraries like `bleach` (Python) or `js-xss` (JavaScript) can be considered. Ensure thorough evaluation and understanding of their capabilities and limitations."
        )
        print(
            "   - **Whitelisting over Blacklisting:**  Sanitization should primarily focus on whitelisting allowed HTML tags and attributes rather than blacklisting potentially harmful ones. Blacklists are prone to bypasses as attackers find new ways to inject malicious code."
        )
        print(
            "   - **Regular Updates:** Keep the sanitization library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and protection against newly discovered XSS vectors."
        )

        print("\n**2. Avoid Relying on `markdown-here`'s Built-in Sanitization:**")
        print(
            "   - **Assume Insecurity:** Treat any built-in sanitization within `markdown-here` as a secondary layer of defense at best. Do not depend on it for robust protection against XSS."
        )
        print(
            "   - **Documentation Review:** Carefully review the `markdown-here` documentation to understand its sanitization capabilities (if any) and limitations. Be aware that these mechanisms might be insufficient or have known bypasses."
        )

        print("\n**3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**")
        print(
            "   - **Mitigation Layer:** CSP is a browser security mechanism that helps mitigate XSS attacks by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load for a specific website or application.\n"
            "   - **Configuration:** Configure CSP headers on your web server to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.\n"
            "   - **Example (Conceptual HTTP Header):** `Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; object-src 'none';`\n"
            "   - **Benefits:** Even if an XSS vulnerability exists, a properly configured CSP can prevent the malicious script from executing or limit its capabilities.\n"
            "   - **Start Strict, Relax Gradually:** Begin with a strict CSP policy and gradually relax it as needed, ensuring each relaxation is carefully considered and tested."
        )

        print("\n**4. Input Validation (Pre-Processing):**")
        print(
            "   - **While Sanitization is Key for Output, Validate Input:** Although not directly preventing the `<script>` tag issue in `markdown-here`, input validation can help prevent other types of attacks and ensure data integrity.\n"
            "   - **Character Encoding:** Ensure consistent character encoding (e.g., UTF-8) throughout the application to prevent encoding-related vulnerabilities."
        )

        print("\n**5. Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**")
        print(
            "   - **Regular Assessments:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including XSS.\n"
            "   - **Focus on User-Generated Content:** Pay particular attention to areas where user-generated content is processed and displayed."
        )

        print("\n**6. Developer Training:**")
        print(
            "   - **Security Awareness:** Educate developers about common web security vulnerabilities, including XSS, and best practices for secure coding.\n"
            "   - **Sanitization Library Usage:** Provide training on how to properly use and configure the chosen sanitization library."
        )

        print("\n**7. Contextual Output Encoding:**")
        print(
            "   - **Beyond HTML:** Be mindful of the context where the output of `markdown-here` is used. If it's used in JavaScript strings or URLs, appropriate encoding for those contexts is also necessary to prevent other types of injection attacks."
        )

        print("\n### Testing and Validation Strategies:\n")
        print(
            "To ensure the effectiveness of the implemented mitigation strategies, thorough testing is crucial:"
        )
        print("* **Manual Testing:** Manually test various malicious payloads, including different variations of `<script>` tags, event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`), and other potentially harmful HTML elements and attributes. Try to find bypasses in the sanitization logic.")
        print("* **Automated Testing:** Integrate automated security testing tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) into the development pipeline to regularly scan for XSS vulnerabilities.")
        print("* **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests specifically targeting the sanitization logic to ensure it correctly handles various malicious inputs.")
        print("* **Penetration Testing:** Engage external security experts to conduct penetration testing and identify vulnerabilities that might have been missed.")

        print("\n### Communication and Collaboration:\n")
        print(
            "Effective communication and collaboration between the cybersecurity team and the development team are essential for addressing this threat effectively. Share the findings of this analysis, discuss the proposed mitigation strategies, and work together to implement and test the solutions."
        )

        print("\n## Conclusion:\n")
        print(
            f"The {self.threat_name} targeting `{self.target_library}` is a critical security concern that requires immediate attention. By implementing the detailed mitigation strategies outlined above, prioritizing robust HTML sanitization with libraries like DOMPurify, and adopting a security-conscious development approach, the risk of successful XSS attacks can be significantly reduced. Continuous testing and collaboration between security and development teams are crucial for maintaining a secure application."
