## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities have been identified that meet the specified criteria. The files analyzed in this batch consist of a `pnpm-lock.yaml` file, which is a dependency lock file. This file primarily describes project dependencies and their versions, and does not introduce code-level vulnerabilities that could be directly triggered by an external attacker on a publicly available instance of the application (VS Code extension).

The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file helps ensure consistent dependency versions across installations and does not contain executable code or application logic that could be directly exploited. While dependency vulnerabilities are a concern, the scope of this task excludes vulnerabilities arising from the *use* of vulnerable dependencies unless developers explicitly use insecure code patterns when *using* those dependencies (which is not evident from `pnpm-lock.yaml` alone).

It's important to reiterate that this analysis is limited to the provided files, which now include `pnpm-lock.yaml` in addition to the previously analyzed documentation and configuration files. A comprehensive security assessment necessitates examining the source code of the language server and the VS Code extension itself to identify potential vulnerabilities within the application's logic and code execution paths.

Therefore, based on the current PROJECT FILES, the vulnerability list remains empty. Further analysis of source code files is required to perform a more thorough security assessment.
