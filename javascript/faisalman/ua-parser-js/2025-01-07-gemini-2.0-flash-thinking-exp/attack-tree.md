# Attack Tree Analysis for faisalman/ua-parser-js

Objective: To compromise an application that uses the `ua-parser-js` library by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the library itself, leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application's Reliance on Parsed Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application's_reliance_on_parsed_data__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application uses the output of `ua-parser-js`, rather than flaws within the parser itself.
*   Attackers aim to manipulate the application's behavior by influencing the parsed user agent data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Attacks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/injection_attacks__high-risk_path_.md)

*   This path involves injecting malicious code or commands into the application through the parsed user agent data.
*   The application's failure to properly sanitize this data is the core vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Parsed Data [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_parsed_data__critical_node_.md)

*   Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code within the user agent string.
*   If the application renders the parsed browser or OS information (or other derived data) in its HTML output without proper escaping or sanitization, this injected script will be executed in the victim's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application renders parsed data without proper sanitization [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/application_renders_parsed_data_without_proper_sanitization__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the specific point of failure within the XSS attack path.
*   The application directly includes the raw output from `ua-parser-js` in its HTML, allowing injected JavaScript to run.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Crafting user agent strings containing `<script>` tags and malicious JavaScript code.
    *   Injecting HTML event attributes containing JavaScript (e.g., `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`).
    *   Using JavaScript URLs (e.g., `<a href="javascript:alert('XSS')">`).

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos___high-risk_path_.md)

*   Attackers aim to make the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   This path focuses on overloading the application's resources through crafted user agent strings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion.md)

*   Attackers send requests designed to consume excessive server resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Provide Complex User-Agent Strings that cause excessive CPU usage during parsing [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/provide_complex_user-agent_strings_that_cause_excessive_cpu_usage_during_parsing__critical_node_.md)

*   This is a specific technique to trigger resource exhaustion.
*   Attackers craft user agent strings that are intentionally complex or contain nested patterns that force `ua-parser-js` to perform extensive computations, consuming significant CPU time.
*   Attack Vectors:
    *   Including a large number of different browser or OS tokens.
    *   Creating deeply nested structures within the user agent string that the parser struggles to process efficiently.
    *   Using unusual or ambiguous patterns that lead to backtracking or inefficient parsing algorithms within `ua-parser-js`.
