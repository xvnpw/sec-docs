### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary PHP code execution via `modelsPaths` configuration

- Description:
    1. An attacker opens a workspace in VSCode where the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension is active.
    2. The attacker modifies the workspace settings and adds a malicious path to the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` configuration array. This path can point to a PHP file containing arbitrary malicious code, located either within the workspace or accessible externally. For example, the attacker could create a file named `malicious.php` in the root of the workspace with content `<?php file_put_contents('pwned.txt', 'You have been pwned!'); ?>`.  Then, the attacker sets `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` to include the workspace root, such as `["."]`.
    3. The extension periodically or on file change event triggers the `loadModels` function in `EloquentProvider.ts`.
    4. The `loadModels` function constructs a PHP script that iterates through the configured `modelsPaths`. For each path, it scans for PHP files and includes them using `include_once`.
    5. Due to the attacker-controlled `modelsPaths` configuration, the malicious file `malicious.php` is included and executed by the PHP interpreter within the extension's execution context.
    6. The attacker achieves arbitrary PHP code execution on the developer's machine, within the context of the VSCode extension host process.

- Impact:
    Critical. Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the developer's machine. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the VSCode extension host. This can lead to severe consequences, including:
    - Data theft: Access to sensitive files, credentials, and source code within the workspace and potentially beyond.
    - Malware installation: Installation of viruses, ransomware, or other malicious software on the developer's system.
    - System compromise: Full compromise of the developer's machine, allowing the attacker to perform any action the developer can.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. The extension directly uses the paths provided in the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` configuration to locate and include PHP files without any validation or sanitization.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension should validate and sanitize the paths provided in the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` configuration. It should verify that these paths are within the expected project structure and ideally only allow paths that are intended for model files. It should disallow paths pointing to arbitrary locations, especially outside the workspace.
    - Path traversal prevention: Implement checks to prevent path traversal attacks in the `modelsPaths` configuration, ensuring that users cannot specify paths like `../` to escape the intended directories.
    - Sandboxing or isolation: If executing user-provided code is unavoidable, the extension should execute the PHP code in a sandboxed or isolated environment with restricted permissions to minimize the potential impact of malicious code execution.
    - Principle of least privilege: The extension should only request the minimum necessary permissions required for its functionality to limit the scope of potential damage from vulnerabilities.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker must have the ability to modify the workspace settings for a project where the developer has the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed and activated. This could be achieved through various means, including:
        - Local access to the developer's machine.
        - Social engineering to trick the developer into opening a workspace with malicious settings.
        - Compromising a shared workspace configuration repository.
    - The developer must have the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed and enabled in VSCode.
    - The VSCode workspace must be a Laravel project, and the extension must be activated for this project.
    - The configured `phpCommand` in the extension settings must be functional and capable of executing PHP code within the workspace context.

- Source code analysis:
    File: `/code/src/EloquentProvider.ts`
    Function: `loadModels()`

    ```typescript
    loadModels() {
        var self = this;
        try {
            Helpers.runLaravel(
                "foreach (['" + vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("LaravelExtraIntellisense").get<Array<string>>('modelsPaths', ['app', 'app/Models']).join('\', \'') + "'] as $modelPath) {" +
                "   if (is_dir(base_path($modelPath))) {" +
                "      foreach (scandir(base_path($modelPath)) as $sourceFile) {" +
                "         if (substr($sourceFile, -4) == '.php' && is_file(base_path(\"$modelPath/$sourceFile\"))) {" +
                "             include_once base_path(\"$modelPath/$sourceFile\");" // Vulnerable line: Includes PHP files from user-defined paths
                +
                "         }" +
                "      }" +
                "   }" +
                "}" +
                "$modelClasses = array_values(array_filter(get_declared_classes(), function ($declaredClass) {" +
                "   return is_subclass_of($declaredClass, 'Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Model') && $declaredClass != 'Illuminate\\Database\\Eloquent\\Relations\\Pivot' && $declaredClass != 'Illuminate\\Foundation\\Auth\\User';" +
                "}));" +
                "$output = [];" +
                "foreach ($modelClasses as $modelClass) {" +
                "   // ... (code for processing models) ...
                "echo json_encode($output);",
                "Eloquent Attributes and Relations"
            ).then(function (result) {
                let models = JSON.parse(result);
                self.models = models;
            }).catch(function (e) {
                console.error(e);
            });
        } catch (exception) {
            console.error(exception);
        }
    }
    ```
    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Configuration (LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths) --> loadModels() Function --> PHP Script Construction --> include_once base_path("$modelPath/$sourceFile") --> Arbitrary PHP Code Execution
    ```

    **Explanation:**
    The `loadModels()` function retrieves the paths from the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` configuration. It then dynamically constructs a PHP script that iterates through these paths. For each path, it scans for files ending with `.php` and includes them using `include_once`.  The vulnerability arises because the `modelsPaths` configuration is user-controlled, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary paths. When the extension executes this PHP script, it blindly includes and runs any PHP file found in the attacker-specified paths, leading to arbitrary PHP code execution within the extension's context.

- Security test case:
    1.  **Setup:** Ensure you have a Laravel project open in VSCode with the "Laravel Extra Intellisense" extension installed and activated.
    2.  **Create Malicious File:** Create a new PHP file named `malicious.php` in the root directory of your Laravel project with the following content:
        ```php
        <?php
        file_put_contents('pwned.txt', 'You have been pwned!');
        ?>
        ```
        This simple script will create a file named `pwned.txt` in the project root when executed.
    3.  **Modify Workspace Settings:** Open VSCode workspace settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings, then select "Workspace" tab). Search for "LaravelExtraIntellisense: Models Paths" and edit the setting to include the workspace root directory. You can achieve this by setting the value to `["."]` or adding `"."` to the existing array.
        ```json
        {
            "LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths": ["."]
        }
        ```
    4.  **Trigger Model Loading:** To trigger the `loadModels()` function, you can either:
        - Wait for the extension's periodic refresh (which happens every 5 seconds according to the code).
        - Force a refresh by making a change to a PHP file within a directory that is typically scanned by the extension (e.g., modify and save a model file in `app/Models`). This file modification will trigger the file watcher and eventually lead to `loadModels()` being called.
    5.  **Verify Exploitation:** After waiting for a short period or triggering the refresh, check the root directory of your Laravel project. If a file named `pwned.txt` exists and contains the text "You have been pwned!", it indicates that the `malicious.php` file was successfully included and executed, confirming the Remote Code Execution vulnerability.

This test case successfully demonstrates that by manipulating the `LaravelExtraIntellisense.modelsPaths` configuration, an attacker can achieve arbitrary PHP code execution within the VSCode extension's environment.
