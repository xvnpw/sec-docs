- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Remote Configuration Injection via Unvalidated Upstream Settings
  - **Description:**
    The extension is designed to “auto update” file nesting configuration by fetching a remote README file through a URL constructed from configuration keys—specifically, the values of `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` and `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch`. These values are read directly from the user’s workspace configuration without any sanitization or validation. An attacker who is able to manipulate or force these settings (for example, via misconfiguration, an insider attack, or compromising a supply‐chain process that sets these values) can cause the URL to point to a repository under their control. The extension then fetches and parses a code block (using a brittle regular‐expression approach) from the remote file and writes its contents into the user’s configuration (`explorer.fileNesting.patterns`). In effect, malicious configuration data can be injected into the environment.

  - **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized changes to VS Code’s file nesting configuration may cause files to be hidden or erroneously displayed.
    - An attacker may manipulate the configuration to obscure security‐sensitive information or change the editor’s behavior in an unexpected manner.
    - This redirection of configuration updates can serve as the first step in a broader supply‐chain attack where subsequent malicious changes may lead to further exploitation.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The URL is built on a fixed HTTPS endpoint (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh`), which enforces transport security once the URL is constructed.
    - The project’s ESLint configuration includes a custom rule (via an eslint-factory plugin named “wildcards‑check”) that enforces limited use of wildcards in string literals. However, this rule targets specific pattern formatting (e.g. ensuring only one wildcard per pattern) and does not address the lack of input validation for the configuration values used in remote fetches.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** No sanitization or strict validation is performed on the `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` and `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch` values. The extension should validate these against an expected format or a predefined whitelist.
    - **Integrity Verification:** The extension does not verify that the remote content is authentic (for example, by checking a digital signature or hash) before applying it to the local configuration.
    - **Strict Parsing:** The JSON extraction is implemented via ad hoc string manipulation (splitting, filtering, and slicing) rather than using a robust parser; this may lead to unpredictable results when the remote file’s format deviates from expectations.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must have the ability to influence the VS Code user configuration for this extension (for example, by modifying the keys `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` and `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch` either directly or indirectly through a compromised update process).
    - The extension’s auto-update behavior must be enabled (or the manual-update command must be run) so that the remote file is fetched and applied.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `fetch.ts`, the function `fetchLatest` is defined as follows:
       - It calls `getConfig<string>('fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo')` and `getConfig<string>('fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch')` to retrieve the repository and branch strings from the user’s configuration.
       - It then constructs the URL by concatenating the fixed URL prefix (`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh`), the unsanitized repo value, an “@” symbol, the branch value, and finally the filename (`README.md`), for example:
         `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/<repo>@<branch>/README.md`
    2. The code proceeds to fetch the content of that URL using `ofetch`; once the response arrives the text is extracted.
    3. A regular expression (`/```jsonc([\s\S]*?)```/`) is used to capture the first block of text delimited by “```jsonc” and “```”. The captured text is then trimmed, split into lines, filtered to remove lines starting with `//` (assumed to be comments), joined back together, and then the last character is removed (using `slice(0, -1)`); the result is wrapped in curly braces (`{ … }`) to create a JSON string.
    4. The JSON string is parsed using `JSON.parse` into an object, and then the property `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` is extracted.
    5. Later, in `fetchAndUpdate`, if the currently stored patterns differ from the new patterns, the extension updates the VS Code configuration by calling `workspace.getConfiguration().update(...)` with the fetched patterns.
    6. At no point during the process are the `repo` or `branch` values validated against any expected pattern or checked for malicious content, thereby opening the door for remote manipulation.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:**
       - Set up a test VS Code instance with the extension installed.
       - Modify the user settings (either manually or via a settings file) so that:
         - `"fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo"` is set to an attacker-controlled value (e.g., `"attacker/malicious-config"`).
         - `"fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch"` is set to `"main"`.
       - Ensure that the CDN (jsdelivr) is serving a file at
         `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/attacker/malicious-config@main/README.md`
         that includes a code block labeled as ```jsonc containing malicious or unexpected configuration data. For example, the file might contain:
         ```
         ```jsonc
         "explorer.fileNesting.patterns": {
           "secret.txt": "*.env, secret.txt",
           "config.js": "config.js, config.bak"
         }
         ```
         ```
    2. **Execution:**
       - Manually trigger the update process by running the command `antfu.file-nesting.manualUpdate` from the Command Palette.
       - (Alternatively, adjust the auto-update interval so that the extension automatically triggers an update.)
    3. **Verification:**
       - Observe that the extension contacts the URL constructed with the attacker-controlled values.
       - Verify that (upon confirmation if prompted) the VS Code setting `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` is updated to match the malicious configuration.
       - Check the updated settings in VS Code (via the settings UI or by inspecting the JSON settings file) to confirm that the injected configuration is present.
       - Document that the remote configuration influenced the local setting without proper validation or integrity checking.
