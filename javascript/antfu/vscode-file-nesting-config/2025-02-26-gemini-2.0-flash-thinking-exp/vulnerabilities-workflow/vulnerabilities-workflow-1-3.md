### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Upstream Repository
- Description:
    1. The VS Code extension "File Nesting Updater" is designed to automatically update file nesting configurations.
    2. The extension fetches these configurations from the `README.md` file of the upstream repository: `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config`.
    3. The extension parses this `README.md` to extract a JSON code block containing the file nesting patterns.
    4. If an attacker were to compromise the `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config` repository, they could modify the `README.md` file.
    5. By altering the JSON code block within `README.md`, the attacker could inject malicious or unintended file nesting configurations.
    6. When users of the "File Nesting Updater" extension trigger an update, they would fetch this compromised `README.md`.
    7. The extension would then extract and present the malicious JSON configuration to the user for application in their VS Code settings.
- Impact:
    - Users applying the malicious configuration will have their VS Code file nesting settings altered in a way unintended by the project maintainers.
    - This could lead to unexpected or confusing file organization within the VS Code Explorer, potentially making it harder for users to locate and manage their files.
    - While the impact is primarily limited to the VS Code environment and does not directly compromise the user's operating system or sensitive data, it can still disrupt developer workflows and potentially be used for social engineering attacks if the malicious configuration is crafted to visually mislead users.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The project, in its current form, does not implement any mechanisms to verify the integrity or authenticity of the configurations fetched from the upstream repository.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Content Verification: Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity and authenticity of the fetched configuration from the upstream repository. This could include:
        - Digital Signatures: Digitally sign the `README.md` file or the JSON configuration snippet in the upstream repository. The extension would then verify this signature before applying the configuration, ensuring that the content originates from a trusted source and has not been tampered with.
        - Checksum/Hash Verification: Establish and maintain a known good checksum or cryptographic hash of the legitimate configuration. The extension would then calculate the hash of the downloaded configuration and compare it against the known good hash. If the hashes do not match, the update should be rejected.
        - HTTPS for Communication: While likely already in place due to GitHub using HTTPS, explicitly ensure that all communication with the upstream repository is conducted over HTTPS. This protects against man-in-the-middle attacks that could occur during transit, although it does not prevent attacks originating from a compromised repository.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker must successfully compromise the upstream repository `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config`.
    - Users must have the "File Nesting Updater" VS Code extension installed and enabled.
    - Users must manually trigger the "File Nesting Updater: Update config now" command or have the auto-update feature enabled, and an update check must occur after the upstream repository has been compromised and malicious content injected.
    - Users must explicitly choose to apply the updated (malicious) configuration when prompted by the extension.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The vulnerability exists in the `fetchLatest` function within `/extension/src/fetch.ts`.
    - ```typescript
      export async function fetchLatest() {
        const repo = getConfig<string>('fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo')
        const branch = getConfig<string>('fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch')
        const url = `${URL_PREFIX}/${repo}@${branch}/${FILE}`
        const md = await fetch(url).then(r => r.text())
        const content = (md.match(/```jsonc([\s\S]*?)```/) || [])[1] || ''

        const json = `{${
          content
            .trim()
            .split(/\n/g)
            .filter(line => !line.trim().startsWith('//'))
            .join('\n')
            .slice(0, -1)
        }}`

        const config = JSON.parse(json) || {}
        return config['explorer.fileNesting.patterns']
      }
      ```
    - The function constructs a URL to fetch the `README.md` file from the upstream repository specified in the extension's configuration (`fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` and `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch`).
    - It uses the `fetch` API to retrieve the content of `README.md`.
    - A regular expression `(/```jsonc([\s\S]*?)```/)` is used to extract the JSON content within code blocks marked with ```jsonc.
    - The extracted content is then parsed as JSON using `JSON.parse()`.
    - **Vulnerability:** The code directly trusts the content fetched from the upstream repository without any verification of its integrity or authenticity. If an attacker gains control of the upstream repository and modifies the `README.md` to include malicious JSON within the designated code block, this malicious configuration will be fetched, parsed, and applied by the extension. There are no checks to ensure the fetched content is from a trusted source or hasn't been tampered with.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Prepare a mock or local HTTP server that can serve a modified version of the `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config` repository's `README.md` file.
        - In this modified `README.md`, alter the JSON configuration snippet within the code block. For testing purposes, introduce a benign but noticeable change to the file nesting patterns, such as adding an unusual or unexpected nesting rule (e.g., nesting all `.txt` files under a file named `vulnerable.config`).
    2. Extension Configuration:
        - In VS Code, navigate to the settings of the "File Nesting Updater" extension.
        - Modify the `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` setting to point to the address of your mock server and the path to the modified `README.md` file (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/README.md` if your mock server is running locally on port 8000 and serving the modified `README.md` at the root path).
    3. Trigger Update:
        - Execute the command "File Nesting Updater: Update config now" in VS Code.
        - Observe the extension's behavior. It should fetch the modified `README.md` from your mock server.
    4. Verify Configuration Prompt:
        - The extension should present a prompt showing the updated file nesting configuration. Examine this prompt and confirm that it contains the malicious or modified JSON configuration snippet that you injected into the mock `README.md`. Specifically, check for the unusual nesting rule you added (e.g., nesting `.txt` files under `vulnerable.config`).
    5. Apply Malicious Configuration:
        - Choose to apply the updated configuration to your VS Code settings.
    6. Observe VS Code Explorer:
        - Open the VS Code Explorer in a project with some `.txt` files.
        - Verify if the file nesting in the Explorer has changed according to the malicious configuration. In our example, check if `.txt` files are now nested under a file named `vulnerable.config`. If the Explorer reflects the injected malicious configuration, the vulnerability is confirmed.
