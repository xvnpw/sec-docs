## Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Configuration Update - Man-in-the-Middle Vulnerability
- Description: The VS Code extension "File Nesting Updater" automatically fetches file nesting configurations from a remote repository. If this download is performed over an insecure channel (e.g., HTTP) without proper integrity verification, an attacker positioned to intercept network traffic can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack. By replacing the legitimate configuration file with a malicious one during transit, the attacker can inject arbitrary file nesting patterns into the user's VS Code settings.
- Impact: A successful MITM attack allows an attacker to inject arbitrary VS Code file nesting configurations. While the direct impact of manipulating file nesting might seem limited, a maliciously crafted configuration could lead to user confusion, hide or misrepresent files in the explorer, potentially facilitate social engineering attacks, or be used as a stepping stone for more sophisticated exploits by altering the perceived structure of projects.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: None visible from the provided files.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Enforce HTTPS:** Ensure that all configuration downloads are performed over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and tampering during transit.
    - **Integrity Checks:** Implement integrity checks, such as verifying a digital signature or checksum of the configuration file against a known trusted value, to ensure that the downloaded file has not been tampered with.
- Preconditions:
    - The user has installed the "File Nesting Updater" VS Code extension.
    - The "fileNestingUpdater.autoUpdate" setting is enabled (or the user manually triggers an update).
    - The attacker is positioned to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack on the network connection between the user's machine and the server hosting the configuration file (e.g., by controlling a network node or via ARP spoofing on a local network).
- Source Code Analysis: To confirm this vulnerability, the source code of the extension needs to be analyzed. Specifically, the code responsible for downloading the configuration file needs to be examined to check:
    1. Is HTTPS enforced for the download URL?
    2. Are there any integrity checks performed on the downloaded file before applying the configuration?

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Environment Setup:** Set up a local MITM proxy (e.g., mitmproxy) to intercept HTTP/HTTPS traffic. Configure the user's system to route network traffic through the proxy.
    2. **Extension Configuration:** Install the "File Nesting Updater" VS Code extension. Ensure "fileNestingUpdater.autoUpdate" is enabled or prepare to trigger manual update via command.
    3. **Intercept and Replace:** Using the MITM proxy, intercept the request made by the extension to download the configuration file. Identify the request URL. If the request is over HTTP, this confirms the insecure channel. For HTTPS, attempt to strip SSL if possible for testing in a controlled environment.
    4. **Malicious Payload:** Prepare a malicious configuration file (e.g., a modified `settings.jsonc` snippet) that, when applied, will visibly alter file nesting in VS Code in an unexpected way. For example, modify the patterns to nest all `*.js` files under `README.md`.
    5. **Proxy Response Modification:** Configure the MITM proxy to replace the legitimate response from the server with the malicious configuration file prepared in the previous step.
    6. **Trigger Update:** Trigger the extension to update the configuration (either wait for auto-update or manually trigger the update command "File Nesting Updater: Update config now").
    7. **Verification:** Open a project in VS Code and observe the file explorer. If the malicious file nesting configuration is applied (e.g., all `*.js` files are nested under `README.md`), it confirms the vulnerability.
