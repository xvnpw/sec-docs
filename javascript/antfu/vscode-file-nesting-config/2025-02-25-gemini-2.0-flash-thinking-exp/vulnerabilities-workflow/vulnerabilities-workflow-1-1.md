### Vulnerability List for File Nesting Config VS Code Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Configuration Injection in File Nesting Updater

* Description:
    1. The File Nesting Updater VS Code extension is designed to automatically update the file nesting configuration in VS Code by fetching the configuration from a remote repository (by default, `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config`).
    2. The extension reads the `README.md` file from the specified repository and branch, extracts the file nesting patterns, and applies them to the user's VS Code settings (`explorer.fileNesting.patterns`).
    3. If an attacker gains write access to the upstream repository (e.g., through compromised credentials or by getting a malicious pull request merged), they can modify the `README.md` file to include malicious file nesting patterns.
    4. When the File Nesting Updater extension automatically updates (or when a user manually triggers an update), it will fetch the modified `README.md` from the compromised repository.
    5. The extension will then extract and apply the malicious file nesting patterns from the attacker-controlled `README.md` to the user's VS Code settings.
    6. This can lead to unexpected and potentially harmful changes in the user's VS Code file explorer, making it difficult to navigate projects or potentially misleading users about the project structure.

* Impact:
    - Users of the File Nesting Updater extension will have their VS Code file nesting configuration silently modified to patterns controlled by the attacker.
    - This can lead to a confusing and disorganized file tree in VS Code Explorer, reducing user productivity and potentially hiding important files or making project navigation difficult.
    - While not directly leading to code execution or data breach based on the provided information, it can significantly degrade the user experience and potentially be used for social engineering attacks by misleading developers about the project structure.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None identified in the provided project files. The project relies on the security of the upstream repository (`antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config`) and the assumption that only trusted contributions are merged.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation: The extension should validate the fetched file nesting patterns before applying them to VS Code settings. This could include checks for excessively long patterns, disallowed characters, or patterns that could cause performance issues in VS Code.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP) or similar mechanisms: If the extension processes the `README.md` as HTML or Markdown, ensure proper sanitization to prevent injection of malicious scripts or content. While file nesting patterns themselves are not executable code, vulnerabilities in the parsing process could be exploited.
    - Integrity checks: Implement checks to verify the integrity and authenticity of the fetched configuration, such as using signatures or checksums, although this might be complex to implement with GitHub README files.
    - User warnings: Display a warning to users when the extension updates the file nesting configuration, especially if significant changes are detected, to increase transparency and user awareness.

* Preconditions:
    - User has the File Nesting Updater extension installed in VS Code.
    - Auto-update feature of the extension is enabled (or the user manually triggers an update).
    - An attacker has successfully modified the `README.md` file in the configured upstream repository and branch (e.g., `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config` and `main` branch by default).

* Source Code Analysis:
    - Based on the description in `extension/README.md` and the workflow in `.github/workflows/update.yml`, the extension likely performs the following steps during an update:
        1. Fetches the `README.md` file from the remote repository specified by `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo` and `fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch` settings.
        2. Parses the `README.md` content to extract the JSON snippet within the `<!-- eslint-skip -->` block.
        3. Extracts the `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` from the JSON snippet.
        4. Applies the extracted patterns to the VS Code user settings using the VS Code API.
    - **Vulnerability Point**: The extension directly applies the fetched configuration without any validation or sanitization. If the fetched `README.md` is compromised, malicious patterns will be directly injected into the user's VS Code settings.
    - **Code Visualization (Conceptual Flow):**
        ```
        [Extension Update Trigger] --> Fetch README.md from Upstream Repo --> Extract JSON Config --> Extract fileNesting.patterns --> Apply to VS Code Settings
                                                        ^
                                                        | Malicious README.md from compromised repo
        ```

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup Mock Repository:** Create a fork or a local Git repository that mimics the structure of `antfu/vscode-file-nesting-config`.
    2. **Create Malicious Configuration:** Modify the `README.md` in your mock repository. Within the `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` section, add a malicious pattern. For example, a pattern that aggressively nests common files under a misleading folder name to disrupt project navigation:
        ```jsonc
        "explorer.fileNesting.patterns": {
          "malicious_folder": "*.js, *.ts, *.html, *.css, *.json, *.env, *.config.*, package.json, ... (include many common file types here)"
          // ... rest of the original patterns
        }
        ```
    3. **Install Extension:** Ensure the "File Nesting Updater" extension is installed in VS Code.
    4. **Configure Extension:** Open VS Code settings (JSON settings) and modify the extension's configuration to point to your mock repository:
        ```json
        "fileNestingUpdater.upstreamRepo": "YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/YOUR_MOCK_REPO_NAME", // Replace with your mock repo details
        "fileNestingUpdater.upstreamBranch": "main" // Or the branch where you modified README.md
        ```
    5. **Trigger Update:** Execute the command "File Nesting Updater: Update config now" in VS Code's command palette.
    6. **Verify Malicious Configuration Applied:**
        - Open VS Code settings (JSON settings) and check the `explorer.fileNesting.patterns` section. Verify that the malicious pattern `"malicious_folder": "*.js, ..."` from your mock `README.md` has been added to the configuration.
        - Open VS Code Explorer in a project folder. Observe if files are being unexpectedly nested under the "malicious_folder" or if other disruptive nesting behaviors from your malicious pattern are visible.

This test case demonstrates that by controlling the content of the upstream `README.md`, an attacker can inject arbitrary file nesting patterns into users' VS Code settings via the File Nesting Updater extension, confirming the Configuration Injection vulnerability.
