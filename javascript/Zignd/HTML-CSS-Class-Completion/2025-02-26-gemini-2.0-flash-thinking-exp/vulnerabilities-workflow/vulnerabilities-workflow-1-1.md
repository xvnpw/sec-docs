## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities could be identified.

**Reasoning:**

The provided project files consist primarily of documentation (README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG, and a VS Code extension quick start guide). There is no source code available in these files to analyze for potential vulnerabilities.

A security assessment of the actual VS Code extension would require access to its source code to examine its parsing logic for CSS and HTML, its handling of user settings, and its interactions with the VS Code API and the file system.

Without access to the source code, it is impossible to identify specific vulnerabilities introduced by the project with high confidence and detail as requested in the prompt.

Therefore, based solely on the provided documentation files, no vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria (high rank, introduced by the project, not excluded by the given rules) can be identified.

It's important to note that this conclusion is limited by the scope of the provided files. A comprehensive security analysis would necessitate a review of the extension's source code.
