### Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** SSRF via External Stylesheet Fetching
  **Description:**
  The extension supports external stylesheets referenced through `<link>` elements in HTML files. An attacker can craft a malicious HTML file that contains a `<link>` tag with a reference to an attacker‑controlled URL. When a user (or an automated system) opens this malicious workspace, the extension will automatically scan the HTML file and attempt to fetch the remote stylesheet. The steps involved are:
  1. The attacker creates an HTML file containing a tag such as:
     `<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://attacker-controlled.example/evil.css">`
  2. The attacker distributes this file (for example, by contributing it to a public repository or mailing it directly).
  3. A victim, using VS Code with the extension enabled, opens the project.
  4. The extension reads the HTML file, discovers the external stylesheet reference, and automatically attempts to fetch the file from the provided URL.
  5. The attacker’s server then receives the request from the victim’s machine—potentially hitting internal endpoints if the URL is carefully crafted.

  **Impact:**
  Exploitation of this vulnerability may allow the attacker to:
  - Initiate unwanted outbound requests from the victim’s machine.
  - Leverage the victim’s network permissions to access internal or otherwise unreachable services.
  - Potentially gather information about the victim’s network environment, leading to further targeting.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - There is no evidence in the documentation or configuration of any URL validation or whitelist enforcement for external stylesheet links.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Validate and sanitize the URL extracted from `<link>` elements.
  - Enforce a whitelist of allowed domains or require HTTPS.
  - Restrict fetching only to local workspace files unless explicitly approved.

  **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to supply or modify HTML content in a project (for example, via a malicious pull request or by tricking a user into downloading a compromised project).
  - The victim must have the extension enabled and automatically process external `<link>` references.

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The README and changelog state that the extension “supports external stylesheets referenced through `link` elements in HTML files.”
  - This implies that during the workspace scan the extension parses HTML files, extracts the href attribute from `<link>` tags, and fetches the corresponding CSS file.
  - Without proper input validation (e.g., checking the scheme, domain, or network destination), this behavior results in an SSRF risk.
  - The absence of documented URL restrictions or sanitization steps indicates that any URL supplied via a `<link>` element will be fetched.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Preparation:** Set up a controlled HTTP server (acting as the attacker’s server) to log incoming requests.
  2. **Attack File Creation:** Create an HTML file with the following content:
     ```html
     <!DOCTYPE html>
     <html>
     <head>
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="http://<YOUR-TEST-SERVER>/evil.css">
     </head>
     <body>
       <h1>Test Page</h1>
     </body>
     </html>
     ```
  3. **Workspace Setup:** Place the HTML file in a new workspace and open the workspace in Visual Studio Code with the extension enabled.
  4. **Trigger Action:** Either open the HTML file or manually trigger the caching process (e.g., via “Cache CSS class definitions” command).
  5. **Observation:** Monitor the test server logs for an HTTP request corresponding to `evil.css`.
  6. **Result:** Verification of the outbound request confirms that the extension fetched the external resource, validating the SSRF vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via Path Traversal in Workspace
  **Description:**
  The extension scans workspace files according to configured glob patterns (by default, `"**/*.{css,html}"`) to cache CSS class definitions. A malicious actor can exploit path traversal vulnerabilities by including either a symlink or a relative path within the project.

  **Symlink Traversal:** If a malicious actor includes a symlink within the project that points to a sensitive file outside the intended project directory, the extension might follow the link and read unauthorized file content. The exploitation steps are:
    1. The attacker creates a project (or submits a contribution) containing a symlink named for example `malicious.css` that points to a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd` on Linux or a critical configuration file on Windows).
    2. The extension, during its file scan and caching process, uses its include glob pattern to locate files.
    3. The glob pattern matches the symlink without checking if it points outside the workspace.
    4. The extension then opens and reads the content of the file the symlink points to, unknowingly caching sensitive information.

  **Relative Path Traversal:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML file with a `<link>` tag that uses relative path sequences (like `../`) in the `href` attribute to point to files outside the workspace. The exploitation steps are:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious HTML file.
    2. In this HTML file, the attacker includes a `<link>` tag with an `href` attribute that contains a path traversal sequence, such as `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`.
    3. The user opens this malicious HTML file in VS Code with the extension installed and activated.
    4. The extension parses the HTML file and processes the `<link>` tag, attempting to load the external stylesheet.
    5. Due to insufficient sanitization of the `href` attribute, the extension interprets the path relative to the workspace root and attempts to read a file from the local file system using the manipulated path, potentially traversing outside the intended workspace directory.
    6. If successful, the extension may read and process the content of an arbitrary file on the user's system that the VS Code process has access to. This could lead to information disclosure.

  **Impact:**
  The exploitation can lead to:
  - Disclosure of confidential or system-sensitive data.
  - Leakage of internal configuration details, which can pave the way for further attacks.
  - Compromise of the victim’s system confidentiality through unintended file reads.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - Although user settings (e.g., `"html-css-class-completion.includeGlobPattern"` and `"excludeGlobPattern"`) allow configuring which files or folders to scan, there is no documented behavior regarding the handling of symbolic links or path validation that would prevent reading files outside the workspace.
  - Unknown. Based on the provided documentation files (README.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, CHANGELOG.md, vsc-extension-quickstart.md), there is no information available about specific input sanitization or path validation mechanisms implemented within the extension for handling external stylesheets.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Implement explicit checks to ensure that files opened or scanned reside within the intended project directory.
  - Do not follow symlinks that point outside the workspace root (or require explicit user confirmation).
  - Sanitize and validate resolved file paths before processing.
  - Input sanitization and validation for the `href` attribute of `<link>` tags are missing. The extension should implement robust path validation to ensure that any resolved paths for external stylesheets remain within the intended workspace or a strictly defined set of allowed directories. Path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`) should be explicitly disallowed or neutralized. If the intention is to only support loading stylesheets from within the workspace, the extension should verify that the resolved file path is within the workspace boundaries.

  **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to place a malicious project or contribution in a workspace (for example, by contributing to a public repository).
  - The user must open or check out the project with the extension enabled, triggering the caching process.
  - The "IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML" VS Code extension is installed and activated in VS Code.
  - A user opens a malicious HTML file, crafted by an attacker, within their VS Code workspace.

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - Documentation for the extension specifies the use of glob patterns to locate CSS and HTML files.
  - In the absence of specific code to resolve and restrict symbolic links, a pattern like `"**/*.{css,html}"` will match symlinked files indiscriminately.
  - Thus, if a symlink points to a file outside the repository (e.g., a system file), the standard file I/O used by the extension will follow the link and include the file content in its cache.
  - Based on the extension's described functionality of supporting "external stylesheets referenced through `link` elements in HTML files", a hypothetical vulnerable code pattern in JavaScript (or TypeScript) could be:

    ```javascript
    // Hypothetical vulnerable code snippet (JavaScript/TypeScript)
    import * as fs from 'fs';
    import * as path from 'path';

    function processLinkElement(linkElement, workspacePath) {
        const href = linkElement.getAttribute('href');
        if (href) {
            // Potentially vulnerable: Directly using href as a file path without sanitization
            const stylesheetPath = path.resolve(workspacePath, href);
            try {
                const stylesheetContent = fs.readFileSync(stylesheetPath, 'utf8');
                // ... process stylesheetContent to extract CSS class names ...
            } catch (error) {
                console.error(`Error reading stylesheet: ${stylesheetPath}`, error);
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    In this hypothetical vulnerable code, `path.resolve(workspacePath, href)` might be intended to resolve the `href` relative to the workspace path. However, if `href` starts with path traversal sequences like `../`, `path.resolve` will resolve the path outside the intended `workspacePath`. If there are no checks to ensure that `stylesheetPath` remains within `workspacePath` or allowed directories, a path traversal vulnerability exists.

    **Visualization for Relative Path Traversal:**

    ```
    User's Workspace: /home/user/myproject
    Malicious HTML file in workspace: /home/user/myproject/malicious.html

    <link href="../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd" rel="stylesheet">

    Hypothetical vulnerable code resolves path:
    stylesheetPath = path.resolve("/home/user/myproject", "../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd")
    stylesheetPath becomes: /etc/passwd  (Path traversal successful)

    fs.readFileSync("/etc/passwd")  <-- Extension attempts to read /etc/passwd
    ```


  **Security Test Case:**
  **Symlink Traversal Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:** On a test system, create a file (for instance, if on Linux, use `/etc/hosts` or another noncritical file that represents sensitive data).
    2. **Attack Setup:** In a new workspace, create a symlink named `malicious.css` that points to the chosen sensitive file.
       - Example (Linux/macOS):
         ```bash
         ln -s /etc/hosts malicious.css
         ```
    3. **Workspace Setup:** Open the workspace in Visual Studio Code with the extension installed and enabled.
    4. **Trigger Action:** Trigger the caching process either by opening the workspace (or by executing the “Cache CSS class definitions” command).
    5. **Observation:** Check the extension’s output or cache. Alternatively, log the file read operations if possible.
    6. **Result:** If the sensitive file’s content appears in the cache data (or an error log indicates an unexpected file read), then the vulnerability is confirmed.

  **Relative Path Traversal Test Case:**
    1. Create a new directory to serve as a VS Code workspace, for example, `test-workspace`.
    2. Inside `test-workspace`, create a malicious HTML file named `malicious.html` with the following content:

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>Malicious HTML</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../../../../../../../../../tmp/test-traversal.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class=""></div>
        <p>This is a test HTML file to trigger path traversal.</p>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

    3. In the `/tmp` directory (or a similar temporary directory on your system), create a file named `test-traversal.css` with the following content:

    ```css
    .traversed-class {
        color: red;
    }
    ```

    If `/tmp` is not accessible, choose another location and adjust the path in `malicious.html` accordingly. Ensure the target path is outside the `test-workspace` but accessible to the VS Code process. Alternatively, for a safer test without creating extra files outside workspace, try to traverse to a known file within the user's home directory if feasible and less risky than `/etc/passwd` for testing purposes.

    4. Open VS Code and open the `test-workspace` directory as a workspace.
    5. Install and activate the "IntelliSense for CSS class names in HTML" extension.
    6. Open the `malicious.html` file in VS Code.
    7. Place the cursor inside the `class=""` attribute of the `<div>` tag in `malicious.html` and trigger the CSS class name autocompletion (usually by typing a space or characters that would trigger completion).
    8. Observe if the class name `traversed-class` (defined in `/tmp/test-traversal.css`) appears in the autocompletion suggestions.

    If `traversed-class` appears in the autocompletion list, it indicates that the extension has successfully read and parsed the CSS file from the traversed path, confirming the path traversal vulnerability.
