Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

*   **Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Drawio [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Diagram [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Inject Malicious JavaScript in Diagram Data [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker crafts a Drawio diagram with malicious JavaScript embedded within the diagram's XML data (e.g., in labels, links, custom properties).
            *   **Payload Execution on Victim's Browser [CRITICAL NODE]:** When the application renders the malicious diagram, the embedded JavaScript executes in the victim's browser.
                *   **Steal Session Cookies/Tokens [CRITICAL NODE]:** The JavaScript can access and exfiltrate session cookies or authentication tokens, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
                *   **Perform Actions on Behalf of User [CRITICAL NODE]:** The JavaScript can make requests to the application's backend on behalf of the logged-in user, potentially performing unauthorized actions or accessing sensitive data.
    *   **Client-Side Code Injection via Vulnerable Dependencies:**
        *   **Gain Control of Client-Side Execution [CRITICAL NODE]:** If Drawio relies on vulnerable JavaScript libraries, an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities through crafted diagrams or interactions, potentially gaining the ability to execute arbitrary code within the user's browser.

*   **Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Related to Drawio (If Applicable) [CRITICAL NODE POTENTIAL]:**
    *   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (If Server-Side Processing) [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the application processes Drawio diagrams server-side and the XML parser is not properly configured:
        *   **Read Local Files on Server [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker can embed malicious external entity references in the diagram's XML to read arbitrary files from the server's file system.
        *   **Initiate Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) [CRITICAL NODE]:** The attacker can use external entity references to make the server send requests to internal or external resources, potentially accessing internal services or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Path Traversal via Filename Manipulation (If File Upload/Storage) [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the application allows users to upload Drawio files and doesn't properly sanitize filenames:
        *   **Read Sensitive Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker can craft filenames with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../config.ini`) to access sensitive configuration files.
        *   **Overwrite Existing Files [CRITICAL NODE]:** With write access, an attacker could potentially overwrite critical system or application files using path traversal.
    *   **Insecure Deserialization (If Server-Side Object Handling):**
        *   **Execute Arbitrary Code on Server [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the application deserializes Drawio objects server-side without proper validation, an attacker can craft malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.

*   **Social Engineering Attacks Leveraging Drawio:**
    *   **Distribute Malicious Diagrams via Phishing [CRITICAL NODE POTENTIAL]:**
        *   **Embed XSS Payloads in Diagrams Sent to Users:** Attackers send emails or messages containing malicious Drawio diagrams with embedded XSS payloads.
            *   **Compromise User Accounts [CRITICAL NODE]:** When a user opens the malicious diagram within the application, the XSS payload executes, potentially stealing their session cookies or credentials, leading to account compromise.
