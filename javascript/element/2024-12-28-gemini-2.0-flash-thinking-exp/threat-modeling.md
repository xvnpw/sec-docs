Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the Element UI library:

* **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through vulnerable component rendering
    * **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into data that is subsequently rendered by an Element UI component without proper sanitization. This could happen if user-supplied data is directly bound to component properties that render HTML. The attacker might manipulate input fields or data sources to inject scripts.
    * **Impact:** Successful execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the application, or the execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Affected Component:** Primarily affects components that render user-provided content, such as:
        * `el-table` (rendering data in cells)
        * `el-form` (displaying labels or help text)
        * `el-dialog` (displaying content)
        * `el-tooltip` (displaying content on hover)
        * Any component where `v-html` directive is used with unsanitized data.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided data on the server-side before it reaches the client-side.
        * **Output Encoding:** Ensure that data rendered by Element UI components is properly encoded to prevent the interpretation of HTML tags and JavaScript. Utilize Element UI's built-in mechanisms for safe rendering. Avoid using `v-html` with untrusted data.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, reducing the impact of injected scripts.
