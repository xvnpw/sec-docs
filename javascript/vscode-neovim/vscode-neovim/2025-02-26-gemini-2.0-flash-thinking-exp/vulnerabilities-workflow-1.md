## Combined Vulnerability List

This document outlines identified vulnerabilities by combining and deduplicating provided lists.

### 1. Arbitrary JavaScript Code Execution via `vscode.eval()`

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Neovim script or plugin.
    2. The victim unknowingly executes this malicious Neovim script or uses the malicious plugin within VSCode using the vscode-neovim extension.
    3. The malicious script or plugin calls the `vscode.eval(code)` API function, passing a string containing malicious JavaScript code as the `code` parameter, potentially derived from user-controlled input.
    4. The `vscode-neovim` extension executes this JavaScript code within the VSCode extension host context without sufficient sanitization or security checks.
    5. The malicious JavaScript code gains arbitrary code execution capabilities within VSCode.

- **Impact:**
    Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows for arbitrary code execution within the VSCode extension host, leading to:
    - Full compromise of the VSCode instance.
    - Unauthorized access to and modification of files on the user's system.
    - Potential exfiltration of sensitive data.
    - Possibility of further system exploitation and privilege escalation.
    - Access to sensitive information within the VSCode workspace, including files, configurations, and environment variables.
    - Modification of files within the workspace.
    - Installation of malicious VSCode extensions.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    No mitigations are currently implemented within the project to prevent arbitrary JavaScript code execution via the `vscode.eval()` API. The documentation focuses solely on the functionality of the API without mentioning any security considerations or input validation.  There are no explicit mitigations within the vscode-neovim extension to prevent misuse of `vscode.eval()`. The extension provides the API function without input validation on the `code` parameter.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization: The `code` parameter of the `vscode.eval()` function should be rigorously sanitized to prevent the execution of malicious JavaScript code. A secure sandbox environment or a restricted subset of JavaScript functionality should be considered.
    - Access control: Implement access control mechanisms to restrict the usage of `vscode.eval()` to only trusted Neovim scripts or under specific, controlled conditions. User consent or permission prompts could be introduced before executing JavaScript code via this API.
    - Security documentation and warnings:  The documentation for `vscode.eval()` must be updated to include prominent warnings about the severe security risks associated with executing arbitrary JavaScript code. Best practices for secure usage and potential mitigations should be clearly outlined.
    - Input validation and sanitization should be performed by Neovim plugin developers before passing user-controlled input to the `code` parameter of `vscode.eval()`.
    - Documentation should be enhanced to explicitly warn plugin developers about the security risks of using `vscode.eval()` with unsanitized user input and provide best practices for secure usage.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim must have the `vscode-neovim` extension installed and enabled in VSCode.
    - The victim must execute a malicious Neovim script or use a malicious Neovim plugin that utilizes the `vscode.eval()` API function. This could occur through opening a maliciously crafted file, installing a malicious Neovim plugin, or other means of executing untrusted Neovim code.
    - In case of plugin, the user has installed and is using a Neovim plugin that utilizes the `vscode.eval()` API function.
    - This Neovim plugin takes user-controlled input and passes it to `vscode.eval()` without sanitization.
    - The attacker has found a way to provide malicious Javascript code as input to this vulnerable Neovim plugin.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    To confirm the vulnerability and identify the exact location for mitigation, a thorough code review of the `vscode-neovim` extension's source code is necessary, specifically focusing on the implementation of the `vscode.eval()` API function.  Based on the documentation provided in `README.md`, the `code` string is directly evaluated as JavaScript, suggesting a lack of sanitization. The `README.md` file documents the `vscode.eval(code[, opts, timeout])` API function. The documentation states that this function evaluates Javascript code within the VSCode environment and that the `code` parameter is a string containing the Javascript code to be executed. The documentation does not mention any input validation or security considerations for the `code` parameter. The API description confirms that arbitrary Javascript code execution is possible if the `code` parameter is attacker-controlled. Without examining the actual code, visualization is not applicable at this stage. Further analysis of the codebase is required to pinpoint the exact execution flow and confirm the absence of sanitization and access controls.

- **Security Test Case:**

    **Test Case 1 (via `init.vim`)**
    1. Create a file named `init.vim` in your Neovim configuration directory (e.g., `~/.config/nvim/init.vim` or `~/.vimrc`).
    2. Add the following lines to `init.vim`:
        ```vim
        vim.api.nvim_command [[
          command! ExploitJS lua << EOF
            local vscode = require('vscode')
            local cmd = "return process.mainModule.require('child_process').execSync('whoami').toString()"
            local result = vscode.eval(cmd)
            vim.notify(result, vim.log.levels.ERROR, {})
          EOF
        ]]
        nnoremap <leader>x :ExploitJS<CR>
        ```
    3. Open VSCode and ensure the `vscode-neovim` extension is enabled and configured to use your Neovim configuration.
    4. Open any text file in VSCode.
    5. Switch to normal mode by pressing `<Esc>`.
    6. Press `<leader>x` (by default, `<leader>` is `\` or `,`). This will execute the `:ExploitJS` command defined in your `init.vim`.
    7. Observe an error notification appearing in VSCode. The content of the notification should display the output of the `whoami` command (or equivalent command for your operating system), which confirms that arbitrary system commands can be executed via the `vscode.eval()` API.

    **Test Case 2 (via Neovim plugin)**
    1. Create a Neovim plugin (e.g., in `init.lua`):
    ```lua
    local vscode = require('vscode')
    vim.api.nvim_command('command! EvalVSCodeEval lua vscode.notify(vscode.eval(vim.fn.input("Enter JS code to eval: ")))')
    ```
    2. Install this plugin in your Neovim configuration.
    3. Open VSCode with the vscode-neovim extension and Neovim configured to load the plugin.
    4. In Neovim, execute the command `:EvalVSCodeEval`.
    5. When prompted "Enter JS code to eval: ", input: `vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Vulnerability Found!')`.
    6. Press Enter. Observe a VSCode information message "Vulnerability Found!".
    7. Repeat steps 4-5, but input: `vscode.window.showInformationMessage(vscode.workspace.workspaceFolders[0].uri.fsPath);`.
    8. Press Enter. Observe a VSCode information message displaying the workspace file path.

### 2. Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Workspace Composite Keys Configuration

- **Description:**
    1. The attacker crafts a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file in a public repository. This file contains a compositeKeys entry that defines a key sequence bound to the `"vscode-neovim.lua"` command with malicious Lua code in the arguments.
    2. The attacker distributes this malicious configuration file by committing it to a repository that a victim trusts and eventually opens in VSCode.
    3. When the victim opens the workspace in VSCode, the vscode-neovim extension automatically loads the workspace settings and registers the malicious composite key binding.
    4. When the victim activates the composite key (by pressing the defined key sequence), the extension executes the malicious Lua code via the `"vscode-neovim.lua"` command.
    5. The Lua code is evaluated without sanitization, and the attacker’s command (e.g., using `os.execute`) is run in the context of the VSCode extension host, achieving arbitrary code execution.

- **Impact:**
    Critical. Successful exploitation would allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the VSCode extension host with the same privileges as the user. This could lead to system compromise, data exfiltration, unauthorized file access, and further lateral movement within the environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The project documentation provides sample settings for composite key mappings but does not specify any code‐level validation or sanitization of the workspace configuration. It is assumed that the end user supplies trusted configuration.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for any configuration values used to form these composite key commands.
    - A verification step (or a user prompt/warning) when loading executable commands from workspace settings, especially from untrusted sources.
    - Restricting the set of allowed commands or checking that command arguments are from an approved whitelist (or at least not arbitrary strings).

- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim opens a workspace that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file with compositeKeys mappings defined to execute arbitrary Lua code.
    - The user’s VSCode is configured to automatically load workspace settings without any trust verification.
    - The victim must activate the malicious composite key binding within VSCode.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    The README and related documentation clearly show examples where composite key bindings are read directly from user (or workspace) settings. For instance, the sample composite key configuration does not indicate any filtering. The example that uses `"vscode-neovim.lua"` shows that an array of Lua code strings is accepted. There is no evidence in the documentation or configuration files that the extension validates that the commands being registered are safe before registering them. As a result, any string provided in the `"args"` array will later be passed for evaluation via the internal Lua API without sanitization.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup**: Create a new test repository containing a file at `.vscode/settings.json` with the following content:
       ```json
       {
         "vscode-neovim.compositeKeys": {
           "xx": {
             "command": "vscode-neovim.lua",
             "args": [
               [
                 "os.execute('echo Malicious Code Executed > /tmp/malicious.txt')"
               ]
             ]
           }
         }
       }
       ```
    2. **Execution**: Open this repository in VSCode while having the vscode-neovim extension installed.
    3. **Trigger the Vulnerability**: In normal mode of the embedded Neovim within VSCode, press the key sequence “xx” (or the key sequence defined by the tester corresponding to “xx”).
    4. **Verification**: Check on the system (for example, by listing the contents of `/tmp`) to see if a file named `malicious.txt` has been created with the string “Malicious Code Executed”. The presence of this file confirms that arbitrary code execution was achieved.
    5. **Result Analysis**: Document the results as proof that the extension executes unsanitized workspace configuration, thus allowing arbitrary code execution.
