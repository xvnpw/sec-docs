# Threat Model Analysis for tooljet/tooljet

## Threat: [Unauthorized Data Source Modification](./threats/unauthorized_data_source_modification.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Data Source Modification

    *   **Description:** An attacker, either through compromised credentials or exploiting a vulnerability in ToolJet's *access control mechanisms*, gains access to the "Data Sources" configuration section. They modify an existing data source connection string to point to a malicious database server under their control, or they alter credentials to gain unauthorized access to a legitimate data source. This is a *ToolJet-specific* threat because it targets ToolJet's internal data source management.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, injection of malicious data into ToolJet applications, potential for lateral movement to other systems connected to the compromised data source.
    *   **ToolJet Component Affected:** Data Source Management module (specifically, the configuration and connection handling logic *within ToolJet*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict RBAC *within ToolJet*, limiting access to the "Data Sources" section to only authorized administrators.
        *   Require MFA for all users with access to data source configurations *managed by ToolJet*.
        *   Implement audit logging for all changes to data source configurations *within ToolJet*, including who made the change and when.
        *   Use environment variables or a secure secrets management system *integrated with ToolJet* to store sensitive data source credentials, rather than storing them directly in the ToolJet configuration.
        *   Regularly review and validate data source configurations *within the ToolJet interface*.

## Threat: [Malicious Query Injection in Query Builder](./threats/malicious_query_injection_in_query_builder.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Query Injection in Query Builder

    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to create or modify ToolJet applications exploits a vulnerability in the *ToolJet Query Builder component*. They craft a malicious query (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection, or a query specific to the connected data source) that bypasses ToolJet's *intended security controls*. This is a *ToolJet-specific* threat because it targets the *internal logic of the Query Builder*. This is distinct from general SQLi; it's about vulnerabilities *within ToolJet's query handling*.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, data deletion, potential for remote code execution on the connected data source server.
    *   **ToolJet Component Affected:** Query Builder module (specifically, the query parsing, validation, and execution logic *within ToolJet*). This also affects any data source connector *that ToolJet provides* that doesn't properly handle parameterized queries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *within the ToolJet Query Builder itself* to prevent the injection of malicious code. This is *ToolJet-specific* input validation.
        *   Enforce the use of parameterized queries (prepared statements) for all data source interactions *initiated from the ToolJet Query Builder*. Avoid dynamic query generation based on user input *within the ToolJet Builder*.
        *   Regularly update ToolJet and its *provided* data source connectors to address any known security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement least privilege principle for database users accessed by Tooljet.

## Threat: [Unauthorized Application Deployment/Modification](./threats/unauthorized_application_deploymentmodification.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Application Deployment/Modification

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the ToolJet interface (either legitimately or through compromised credentials, *specifically targeting ToolJet's authentication*) and deploys a new malicious application or modifies an existing application to include malicious code or exfiltrate data. This focuses on *ToolJet's application management*.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, denial of service, potential for lateral movement to other systems if the application interacts with other services.
    *   **ToolJet Component Affected:** Application Management module (specifically, the deployment, versioning, and access control logic *within ToolJet*).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict RBAC *within ToolJet*, limiting the ability to deploy or modify applications to authorized users.
        *   Require MFA for all users with application deployment or modification privileges *within ToolJet*.
        *   Implement an approval workflow for application deployments and modifications *managed by ToolJet*.
        *   Implement version control for ToolJet applications *within ToolJet*, allowing for rollback to previous versions in case of a security incident.
        *   Regularly review and audit deployed applications *within ToolJet* for potential security issues.

## Threat: [Plugin/Connector Vulnerability Exploitation (ToolJet-Provided)](./threats/pluginconnector_vulnerability_exploitation__tooljet-provided_.md)

*   **Threat:** Plugin/Connector Vulnerability Exploitation (ToolJet-Provided)

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a *ToolJet-provided* plugin or data source connector. This could be a vulnerability in the plugin's code itself or in how ToolJet handles the plugin's interaction with external systems. The attacker might use a publicly known vulnerability or discover a zero-day vulnerability. This is limited to plugins *provided and maintained by ToolJet*.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could include data breaches, data modification, denial of service, remote code execution on the ToolJet server, or lateral movement to other systems.
    *   **ToolJet Component Affected:** The specific vulnerable *ToolJet-provided* plugin or data source connector, and potentially the ToolJet plugin loading and execution framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (potentially Critical depending on the plugin)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update ToolJet and all installed *ToolJet-provided* plugins and connectors to the latest versions.
        *   Implement a vulnerability scanning process for all *ToolJet-provided* plugins and connectors before deploying them.
        *   Implement sandboxing or isolation mechanisms for plugins *within ToolJet* to limit their access to the ToolJet server and other resources.
        *   Carefully review the source code of any custom-built plugins or connectors *if they interact with ToolJet's internal APIs*.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in ToolJet Data Source Connectors](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__in_tooljet_data_source_connectors.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in ToolJet Data Source Connectors

    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits an SSRF vulnerability in a *ToolJet-provided* data source connector. They craft a malicious request that causes the ToolJet server to make requests to internal or external resources that it should not have access to. This is specific to the *connectors provided by ToolJet*.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal systems, data breaches, network reconnaissance, potential for lateral movement.
    *   **ToolJet Component Affected:** *ToolJet-provided* data source connectors (specifically, the logic that handles making requests to external resources).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all URLs and other parameters used by *ToolJet-provided* data source connectors.
        *   Use a whitelist of allowed URLs or IP addresses for data source connections *within the ToolJet connector configuration*.
        *   Avoid making requests to internal resources based on user-supplied input *within the ToolJet connector*.
        *   Use a network firewall to restrict outbound connections from the ToolJet server (general mitigation, but relevant).

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within ToolJet](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_tooljet.md)

* **Threat:** Privilege Escalation within ToolJet

    *   **Description:** A low-privileged ToolJet user exploits a vulnerability in *ToolJet's authorization logic* to gain access to higher-level privileges, such as administrator access. This could involve exploiting a bug in the RBAC implementation *within ToolJet* or a misconfiguration *within ToolJet's user management*.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over ToolJet, access to all applications and data sources, potential for lateral movement to other systems.
