Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Custom Code Execution (Sandbox Escape - ToolJet's Sandbox)" attack surface.

## Deep Analysis: ToolJet Sandbox Escape

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the risks associated with ToolJet's custom code execution environment (its JavaScript sandbox), specifically focusing on the potential for sandbox escapes.  We aim to identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level ones already listed.  This analysis will inform development and security practices to minimize the risk of a successful sandbox escape.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack surface related to ToolJet's JavaScript sandbox and its potential for escape.  It encompasses:

*   The specific JavaScript engine and sandbox implementation used by ToolJet (this is crucial information we need to determine).
*   The mechanisms ToolJet uses to isolate the sandbox from the host system.
*   The input vectors through which malicious code could be introduced into the sandbox.
*   The potential consequences of a successful sandbox escape.
*   The effectiveness of existing and proposed mitigation strategies.

This analysis *does not* cover other attack surfaces of ToolJet, such as SQL injection or cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in other parts of the application, *unless* they directly contribute to a sandbox escape.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Information Gathering:**
    *   **Identify the Sandbox:** Determine the *exact* JavaScript engine and sandbox library/technique used by ToolJet.  This is the most critical first step.  We'll examine ToolJet's source code on GitHub, documentation, and any relevant configuration files.  We'll look for dependencies like `vm2`, `isolated-vm`, or custom implementations.
    *   **Review ToolJet's Security Documentation:**  Search for any existing documentation related to the sandbox's security, known limitations, or recommended configurations.
    *   **Analyze ToolJet's Code:**  Examine the code responsible for:
        *   Creating and configuring the sandbox.
        *   Passing user-provided code to the sandbox.
        *   Handling communication between the sandbox and the host system.
        *   Enforcing resource limits.
        *   Implementing any security-related features (e.g., input sanitization).

2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**
    *   **Known Vulnerabilities:** Research known vulnerabilities in the identified JavaScript engine and sandbox implementation.  Check CVE databases (e.g., NIST NVD), security advisories, and exploit databases.
    *   **Common Sandbox Escape Techniques:**  Investigate common techniques used to escape JavaScript sandboxes, such as:
        *   Prototype pollution.
        *   Exploiting built-in functions or objects (e.g., `eval`, `Function`, `process`).
        *   Bypassing restrictions on `require` or module loading.
        *   Memory corruption vulnerabilities in the underlying engine.
        *   Side-channel attacks.
        *   Logic flaws in the sandbox's implementation.
    *   **ToolJet-Specific Vulnerabilities:**  Analyze ToolJet's code for potential vulnerabilities that could be specific to its implementation, such as:
        *   Insufficient input validation or sanitization.
        *   Improper configuration of the sandbox.
        *   Logic errors in the communication between the sandbox and the host.
        *   Weaknesses in resource limit enforcement.

3.  **Impact Assessment:**
    *   **Consequences of Escape:**  Detail the specific actions an attacker could take after successfully escaping the sandbox.  This includes:
        *   Accessing and modifying files on the server.
        *   Executing arbitrary system commands.
        *   Accessing environment variables and secrets.
        *   Connecting to internal networks or databases.
        *   Exfiltrating data.
        *   Launching further attacks.

4.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**
    *   **Specific Recommendations:**  Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigating the identified vulnerabilities, going beyond the general strategies already listed.  This includes:
        *   Specific configuration settings for the sandbox.
        *   Code changes to improve input validation and sanitization.
        *   Recommendations for patching or upgrading the sandbox implementation.
        *   Suggestions for improving resource limit enforcement.
        *   Guidance on secure coding practices for ToolJet developers.

5.  **Reporting:**
    *   Document all findings, including the identified vulnerabilities, their potential impact, and the recommended mitigation strategies.
    *   Prioritize vulnerabilities based on their severity and exploitability.
    *   Provide clear and concise explanations that are understandable to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

Let's proceed with the deep analysis, assuming we've performed the initial information gathering and identified the following (this is a *hypothetical example* for demonstration; the actual findings will depend on ToolJet's specific implementation):

**Hypothetical Findings (Example):**

*   **Sandbox Implementation:** ToolJet uses `vm2` version `3.9.15` for its sandbox.
*   **Input Vector:** User-provided JavaScript code is passed to the sandbox via a REST API endpoint.
*   **Resource Limits:** CPU and memory limits are enforced, but network access is not restricted by default.
*   **Known Vulnerabilities:** `vm2` version `3.9.15` is known to have several vulnerabilities, including CVE-2023-32314 (a sandbox escape vulnerability).
*   **ToolJet-Specific Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The input validation on the REST API endpoint only checks for basic syntax errors and does not perform any sanitization to prevent prototype pollution or other advanced attacks.
    *   The sandbox configuration allows access to the `process` object, which could be abused to gain information about the host system.

**Vulnerability Analysis:**

*   **CVE-2023-32314:** This is a critical vulnerability that allows attackers to escape the `vm2` sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host system.  The exploit involves manipulating the `Error.prepareStackTrace` property to bypass the sandbox's restrictions.
*   **Prototype Pollution:**  The lack of input sanitization makes ToolJet vulnerable to prototype pollution attacks.  An attacker could inject malicious code into the prototype of built-in objects, which could then be executed within the sandbox.
*   **`process` Object Access:**  Allowing access to the `process` object within the sandbox is a security risk.  An attacker could use this object to:
    *   Gather information about the host system (e.g., operating system, environment variables).
    *   Potentially interact with the host system in unintended ways.
*   **Unrestricted Network Access:** The lack of network restrictions allows an attacker to make outbound connections from the sandbox. This could be used to:
    *   Exfiltrate data.
    *   Connect to internal networks or services.
    *   Launch further attacks.

**Impact Assessment:**

A successful sandbox escape would allow an attacker to gain complete control over the ToolJet server.  The attacker could:

*   Steal sensitive data, including database credentials, API keys, and user information.
*   Modify or delete data within the ToolJet application.
*   Deploy malware or ransomware.
*   Use the compromised server to launch attacks against other systems.
*   Disrupt the operation of the ToolJet application.

**Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**

1.  **Immediate Patching:** *Immediately* upgrade `vm2` to the latest version (or a version that addresses CVE-2023-32314 and other known vulnerabilities). This is the highest priority.  If a patched version is not available, consider switching to a different sandbox solution (e.g., `isolated-vm`).

2.  **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization to prevent prototype pollution and other code injection attacks.  This should include:
    *   Using a dedicated JavaScript parser to analyze the user-provided code and identify potentially malicious constructs.
    *   Filtering or escaping dangerous characters and keywords.
    *   Rejecting code that attempts to modify built-in prototypes or access restricted objects.
    *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of code that can be executed within the sandbox.

3.  **Sandbox Configuration:**  Review and tighten the `vm2` sandbox configuration:
    *   Disable access to the `process` object.
    *   Restrict access to other potentially dangerous built-in objects and functions.
    *   Enable strict mode (`"use strict";`) within the sandbox.
    *   Consider using a whitelist of allowed modules and functions.

4.  **Network Restrictions:** Implement network restrictions to prevent the sandbox from making outbound connections.  This could be done using:
    *   `vm2`'s built-in network restriction features (if available).
    *   Operating system-level firewall rules.
    *   Network namespaces (if running ToolJet in a containerized environment).

5.  **Resource Limits:**  Ensure that CPU, memory, and *network* limits are appropriately configured and enforced.  Consider using a process monitoring tool to detect and terminate any sandbox processes that exceed these limits.

6.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the ToolJet codebase, including the sandbox implementation and related components.  This should include:
    *   Code reviews.
    *   Penetration testing.
    *   Vulnerability scanning.

7.  **Dependency Management:**  Implement a robust dependency management process to ensure that all dependencies, including the sandbox library, are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify vulnerable dependencies.

8.  **Least Privilege:** Run the ToolJet application with the least privileges necessary.  Avoid running it as root or with unnecessary permissions.

9. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Implement monitoring and alerting to detect any suspicious activity related to the sandbox, such as:
    *   Attempts to escape the sandbox.
    *   Unusual resource usage.
    *   Unexpected network connections.

### 3. Reporting

This deep analysis would be compiled into a formal report, including:

*   **Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of the findings and recommendations.
*   **Detailed Findings:** A comprehensive description of each identified vulnerability, including its technical details, potential impact, and exploitability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  A prioritized list of recommended mitigation strategies, with specific instructions for implementation.
*   **Appendix:**  Supporting information, such as code snippets, configuration examples, and references to relevant CVEs and security advisories.

This report would be shared with the ToolJet development team, security team, and other relevant stakeholders.  The findings would be used to prioritize security improvements and reduce the risk of a successful sandbox escape.
