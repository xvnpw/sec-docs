Okay, here's a deep analysis of the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack surface within ToolJet, focusing on its internal request handling, as described.

## Deep Analysis of ToolJet's Internal SSRF Vulnerability

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly assess and mitigate the risk of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks originating from *within ToolJet's internal request handling mechanisms*.  We aim to identify potential vulnerabilities where user-supplied input, or even improperly configured internal settings, could be leveraged to force ToolJet to make unauthorized requests to internal or external resources.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to harden ToolJet against this specific attack vector.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on SSRF vulnerabilities arising from ToolJet's *own internal network requests*.  This includes, but is not limited to:

*   **Data Source Connections:** How ToolJet connects to databases, APIs, and other data sources, particularly if connection parameters are influenced by user input or configuration.
*   **Plugin/Integration Logic:**  How plugins and integrations within ToolJet handle network requests, especially if they fetch data from URLs provided directly or indirectly by users.
*   **Internal API Calls:**  Any internal API calls made by ToolJet's backend to other services, whether within the same container, on the same host, or on the local network.
*   **Webhook Handling:** How ToolJet processes incoming webhooks, particularly if it subsequently makes requests based on the webhook payload.
*   **File Operations (if applicable):**  If ToolJet's internal logic interacts with the filesystem using URLs (e.g., `file://`), this will be included.
*   **Any feature using user input to construct URLs:** Any feature that takes user input, even indirectly, and uses that input to build a URL for an internal request.

This analysis *excludes* SSRF vulnerabilities that might exist in *external* services that ToolJet connects to.  The focus is solely on ToolJet's own code and configuration.

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  A thorough examination of the ToolJet codebase (available on GitHub) to identify areas where internal network requests are made.  This will involve searching for:
    *   Functions that make HTTP requests (e.g., using libraries like `axios`, `node-fetch`, `requests` in Python, etc.).
    *   Code that constructs URLs based on user input or configuration.
    *   Areas where input validation and sanitization are performed (or are missing).
    *   Use of potentially dangerous URL schemes (e.g., `file://`, `gopher://`).
    *   Hardcoded URLs or IP addresses.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  Setting up a test environment of ToolJet and performing targeted testing to attempt to trigger SSRF vulnerabilities.  This will involve:
    *   Crafting malicious inputs to various ToolJet features that might trigger internal requests.
    *   Using a proxy (like Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP) to intercept and analyze ToolJet's internal network traffic.
    *   Monitoring server logs for any unusual network activity.
    *   Attempting to access internal resources (e.g., metadata services, internal APIs) through ToolJet.
    *   Testing with various URL schemes and payloads.

3.  **Dependency Analysis:**  Examining the dependencies used by ToolJet to identify any known SSRF vulnerabilities in those libraries.  This will involve using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or similar for other package managers.

4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Creating a threat model to systematically identify potential attack scenarios and their impact.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

Based on the provided description and the methodology outlined above, here's a breakdown of the potential attack surface and specific areas of concern:

**2.1 Potential Vulnerable Areas (Code Review Focus):**

*   **`server/datasources` Directory:**  This is a prime suspect.  Code responsible for connecting to various data sources (databases, APIs, etc.) likely resides here.  We need to examine how connection strings, URLs, and other parameters are constructed and validated.  Are user-provided values directly used in constructing these connection parameters?  Is there a whitelist of allowed hosts/IPs?

*   **`server/plugins` Directory:**  Plugins often interact with external services.  The code handling plugin configuration and execution needs careful scrutiny.  Do plugins accept URLs as input?  Are those URLs validated before being used to make requests?

*   **`server/app` or `server/api` Directory:**  These directories likely contain the core application logic and API endpoints.  We need to look for any internal API calls made between different ToolJet components.  Are these calls authenticated and authorized?  Are they made to hardcoded addresses, or are addresses dynamically constructed?

*   **`server/utils` or `server/lib` Directory:**  Utility functions or libraries used for making network requests might be located here.  These functions should be examined for proper input validation and sanitization.

*   **Webhook Handlers:**  If ToolJet supports webhooks, the code that processes incoming webhook requests needs to be checked.  Does ToolJet make any subsequent requests based on the webhook payload?  If so, is the payload properly validated?

*   **Any function using `fetch`, `axios`, `http.request`, `urllib`, etc.:**  A global search across the codebase for these functions (and similar ones in other languages) will reveal potential points where network requests are made.  The context around these calls needs to be analyzed.

**2.2 Dynamic Analysis (Testing Scenarios):**

*   **Data Source Connection Strings:**
    *   Attempt to inject internal URLs (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`, `http://127.0.0.1:27017`) into database connection strings or API URLs.
    *   Try using different URL schemes (e.g., `file:///etc/passwd`, `gopher://`) if supported by the underlying data source connector.
    *   Test with invalid hostnames and IP addresses to see how ToolJet handles errors.

*   **Plugin Configuration:**
    *   If plugins accept URLs as configuration parameters, try injecting internal URLs and malicious payloads.
    *   Test with plugins that are known to interact with external services.

*   **Webhook Payloads:**
    *   Send webhooks with payloads containing internal URLs or malicious data.
    *   Monitor ToolJet's behavior to see if it makes any unexpected requests.

*   **Internal API Calls:**
    *   Use a proxy to intercept and analyze internal API calls between ToolJet components.
    *   Try to modify these calls to access unauthorized resources.

*   **File Operations (if applicable):**
    *   If ToolJet uses `file://` URLs, try to access sensitive files on the system.

*   **DNS Spoofing/Rebinding:**
    *   Attempt to use DNS spoofing or DNS rebinding techniques to trick ToolJet into connecting to a malicious server.

**2.3 Dependency Analysis:**

*   Run `npm audit` (or equivalent) regularly to identify any known vulnerabilities in ToolJet's dependencies.
*   Pay close attention to any dependencies related to network requests or URL parsing.
*   Keep dependencies updated to the latest versions.

**2.4 Threat Modeling:**

*   **Scenario 1: Accessing Internal Metadata Service:** An attacker injects a URL pointing to an internal metadata service (e.g., AWS metadata service) into a data source connection string.  ToolJet connects to the metadata service and leaks sensitive information (e.g., AWS credentials).

*   **Scenario 2: Accessing Internal Database:** An attacker injects a URL pointing to an internal database (e.g., MongoDB running on localhost) into a database connection string.  ToolJet connects to the database and allows the attacker to read or modify data.

*   **Scenario 3: Triggering Internal Actions:** An attacker injects a URL pointing to an internal API endpoint into a plugin configuration.  ToolJet calls the API endpoint, triggering unintended actions (e.g., deleting data, creating users).

*   **Scenario 4: Reading Local Files:** An attacker injects a `file:///etc/passwd` URL into a data source connection string (if supported). ToolJet attempts to read the file and potentially leaks its contents.

### 3. Mitigation Strategies (Reinforcement of Initial Recommendations)

The following mitigation strategies, building upon the initial ones, are crucial:

*   **3.1 Strict Input Validation (Whitelist Approach):**
    *   **Implement a strict whitelist of allowed hosts and IP addresses for *all* internal network requests.**  This whitelist should be as restrictive as possible.
    *   **Validate *all* URL components (scheme, hostname, port, path, query parameters) before making any request.**  Do not rely solely on regular expressions; use dedicated URL parsing libraries.
    *   **Reject any requests to loopback addresses (127.0.0.1, ::1) or private IP ranges (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) unless explicitly allowed by the whitelist.**
    *   **Consider using a dedicated library for URL validation and sanitization.**

*   **3.2 Network Restrictions (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Use network policies (e.g., Kubernetes Network Policies, firewall rules) to restrict ToolJet's ability to connect to internal services.**  Only allow connections to explicitly authorized services.
    *   **Run ToolJet in a containerized environment (e.g., Docker) with limited network access.**
    *   **Consider using a service mesh (e.g., Istio, Linkerd) to enforce fine-grained network policies.**

*   **3.3 Disable Unnecessary Protocols:**
    *   **Explicitly disable support for dangerous URL schemes (e.g., `file://`, `gopher://`) in ToolJet's code and configuration.**
    *   **Restrict the allowed HTTP methods (e.g., only allow GET and POST).**

*   **3.4 DNS Resolution Control:**
    *   **If possible, use a custom DNS resolver within ToolJet's environment to prevent it from resolving internal hostnames.**  This can be achieved using techniques like DNS filtering or a local DNS server.
    *   **Consider using DNS over HTTPS (DoH) or DNS over TLS (DoT) to prevent DNS spoofing attacks.**

*   **3.5 Least Privilege:**
    *   **Run ToolJet with the least privileges necessary.**  Do not run it as root.
    *   **Limit the permissions of the user account that ToolJet uses to access data sources.**

*   **3.6 Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Implement comprehensive logging of all internal network requests made by ToolJet.**  Include details like the URL, timestamp, user (if applicable), and result.
    *   **Monitor logs for any suspicious activity, such as requests to unexpected hosts or unusual error codes.**
    *   **Use a security information and event management (SIEM) system to aggregate and analyze logs.**

*   **3.7 Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address any remaining vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Include SSRF testing as part of the regular testing process.**

*   **3.8 Secure Coding Practices:**
    *   **Train developers on secure coding practices, with a specific focus on preventing SSRF vulnerabilities.**
    *   **Use code linters and static analysis tools to identify potential security issues.**
    *   **Perform code reviews to ensure that security best practices are followed.**

* **3.9. Dependency Management:**
    *  Continuously monitor and update dependencies.
    *  Use tools to automatically scan for vulnerable dependencies.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the risk of SSRF attacks originating from ToolJet's internal request handling can be significantly reduced.  The combination of code-level validation, network restrictions, and monitoring provides a robust defense-in-depth approach. Continuous monitoring and updates are crucial to maintain a strong security posture.
