# Deep Analysis: Malicious Query Injection in ToolJet Query Builder

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the "Malicious Query Injection in Query Builder" threat within the context of the ToolJet application.  This includes identifying specific vulnerabilities, assessing potential attack vectors, evaluating the effectiveness of existing mitigations, and recommending further security enhancements.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable insights to the development team to harden ToolJet against this critical threat.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on the ToolJet Query Builder component and its interaction with connected data sources.  The scope includes:

*   **ToolJet's Query Builder Internal Logic:**  The code responsible for parsing, validating, constructing, and executing queries generated through the visual interface. This includes any client-side (JavaScript/TypeScript) and server-side (Node.js, potentially other languages) components involved in this process.
*   **Data Source Connectors:**  The specific implementations of ToolJet's connectors for various databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, REST APIs, etc.) and how they handle query parameters and escaping.  We'll focus on *ToolJet-provided* connectors, not custom connectors built by users.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  The mechanisms (or lack thereof) within ToolJet to prevent malicious input from being incorporated into queries.
*   **Parameterized Query Implementation:**  How ToolJet enforces (or fails to enforce) the use of parameterized queries/prepared statements across different data source types.
*   **Error Handling:** How ToolJet handles errors returned by the database, particularly those that might reveal information about the database structure or vulnerabilities.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** While the threat assumes an attacker *has* access to create/modify applications, we'll briefly consider how authorization checks within ToolJet could limit the *scope* of a successful injection attack.

This analysis *excludes* general database security best practices (e.g., database hardening, network segmentation) that are outside the direct control of the ToolJet application itself.  It also excludes vulnerabilities in the underlying database systems themselves, focusing instead on how ToolJet interacts with them.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

*   **Code Review:**  Manual inspection of the ToolJet codebase (client-side and server-side) related to the Query Builder and data source connectors.  This will be the primary method. We will use the provided GitHub repository link (https://github.com/tooljet/tooljet) as the source of truth.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Potentially using static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube, Semgrep) to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  If feasible, we will perform fuzzing on the Query Builder input fields to identify unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities. This would involve crafting a range of malicious and unexpected inputs to test the robustness of the query handling logic.
*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-evaluating the existing threat model (from which this threat is extracted) to ensure it accurately reflects the current state of the application.
*   **Documentation Review:**  Examining ToolJet's official documentation to understand the intended security mechanisms and best practices.
*   **Vulnerability Database Search:** Checking for any known vulnerabilities related to ToolJet or its dependencies that could be relevant to this threat.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Attack Vectors

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability through several attack vectors:

1.  **Direct Input Manipulation:**  If the Query Builder allows direct editing of query strings without proper validation, the attacker could inject malicious code directly into the query.  This is the most obvious and direct attack vector.
2.  **Parameter Manipulation:**  Even if direct query editing is restricted, if the Query Builder constructs queries by concatenating user-provided parameters without proper escaping or parameterization, an attacker could inject malicious code through these parameters.
3.  **Exploiting Connector Weaknesses:**  If a specific data source connector doesn't properly implement parameterized queries or has its own vulnerabilities, the attacker could craft a query that exploits these weaknesses, even if ToolJet's core logic is secure.
4.  **Bypassing Client-Side Validation:**  If validation is primarily performed on the client-side, an attacker could bypass these checks using browser developer tools or a proxy, sending malicious requests directly to the ToolJet server.
5.  **Leveraging ToolJet Features:**  Exploiting features like custom JavaScript functions or transformations within ToolJet that might be used to construct queries, injecting malicious code into these features.
6.  **Stored XSS in conjunction:** If there is stored XSS vulnerability, attacker can inject javascript code that will modify queries in the background.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis (Codebase Focus)

This section requires a deep dive into the ToolJet codebase.  Here's a breakdown of areas to examine and potential vulnerabilities to look for:

*   **`client/` (Frontend):**
    *   **Query Builder UI Components:**  Examine the React components responsible for rendering the Query Builder interface.  Look for any places where user input is directly used to construct query strings without proper sanitization or escaping.  Pay close attention to event handlers (e.g., `onChange`, `onSubmit`) that handle user input.
    *   **Data Source Connector UI:**  Examine how the UI for each data source connector is implemented.  Are there any differences in how parameters are handled between different connectors?
    *   **Client-Side Validation Logic:**  Identify any client-side validation routines.  Are they robust enough to prevent common injection attacks?  Can they be easily bypassed?
    *   **Redux/State Management:**  How is the query state managed?  Are there any potential vulnerabilities in how the query is built up and stored in the application's state?

*   **`server/` (Backend):**
    *   **API Endpoints:**  Examine the API endpoints that handle requests from the Query Builder.  How are these requests validated?  Are there any potential vulnerabilities in how the server processes these requests?
    *   **Data Source Connector Implementations:**  This is the *most critical* area.  Examine the code for each data source connector (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB).  Specifically, look for:
        *   **Query Construction:**  How are queries constructed?  Are they built using string concatenation, or are parameterized queries/prepared statements used consistently?
        *   **Parameter Handling:**  How are parameters passed to the database driver?  Are they properly escaped and sanitized?
        *   **Error Handling:**  How are database errors handled?  Are error messages returned to the client in a way that could reveal sensitive information?
        *   **Database Driver Usage:**  Are the correct database drivers being used?  Are they configured securely? Are they up-to-date?
    *   **ORM Usage (if any):**  If ToolJet uses an Object-Relational Mapper (ORM), examine how it's used to interact with the database.  ORMs can provide some protection against SQL injection, but they can also be misconfigured or misused.
    * **Authentication and Authorization:** Check how Tooljet implements authentication. Check if there is proper authorization checks before executing query.

*   **`ee/` (Enterprise Edition, if applicable):**  If there are any enterprise-specific features related to the Query Builder or data source connectors, examine these as well.

**Specific Code Examples (Hypothetical - Illustrative):**

*   **Vulnerable (String Concatenation):**

    ```javascript
    // server/app/datasources/postgresql.js (HYPOTHETICAL)
    async function executeQuery(query, params) {
      const sql = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${params.username}'`; // VULNERABLE!
      const result = await this.client.query(sql);
      return result.rows;
    }
    ```

*   **Secure (Parameterized Query):**

    ```javascript
    // server/app/datasources/postgresql.js (HYPOTHETICAL)
    async function executeQuery(query, params) {
      const sql = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = $1`; // Parameterized
      const result = await this.client.query(sql, [params.username]); // Parameter passed separately
      return result.rows;
    }
    ```

* **Vulnerable (Client-side only validation):**
    ```javascript
    //client/app/components/QueryBuilder.js
    function validateQuery(query) {
        if (query.includes(';')) { //Weak validation
            return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    ```

### 2.3 Mitigation Strategy Effectiveness

Based on the threat description, the following mitigation strategies were proposed:

*   **Robust Input Validation and Sanitization:**  This is essential, but it must be implemented *both* on the client-side (for immediate feedback) and, *critically*, on the server-side (to prevent bypass).  The effectiveness depends on the *thoroughness* of the validation and sanitization rules.  Simple checks (e.g., looking for semicolons) are insufficient.  A whitelist approach (allowing only specific characters or patterns) is generally more secure than a blacklist approach.
*   **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  This is the *most effective* mitigation against SQL injection.  It ensures that user input is treated as data, not as executable code.  The effectiveness depends on *consistent* use of parameterized queries across *all* data source connectors.  Any deviation from this practice creates a vulnerability.
*   **Regular Updates:**  This is crucial for addressing known vulnerabilities in ToolJet and its dependencies.  The effectiveness depends on the promptness of updates and the thoroughness of ToolJet's security patching process.
*   **Least Privilege Principle:** This is a good general security practice, but it's a *defense-in-depth* measure, not a primary mitigation against query injection.  It limits the damage an attacker can do if they *do* manage to inject malicious code, but it doesn't prevent the injection itself.

### 2.4 Further Recommendations

*   **Comprehensive Server-Side Validation:** Implement robust server-side validation for *all* user input that is used to construct queries.  This should include:
    *   **Whitelist Validation:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed characters and patterns for each input field.
    *   **Type Validation:**  Ensure that input values conform to the expected data types (e.g., integer, string, date).
    *   **Length Validation:**  Limit the length of input values to prevent excessively long strings that could be used in denial-of-service attacks or to bypass other validation checks.
*   **Enforce Parameterized Queries:**  Make it *impossible* to construct queries using string concatenation in the server-side code.  Use a linter or static analysis tool to enforce this rule.  Provide clear documentation and training for developers on how to use parameterized queries correctly.
*   **Data Source Connector Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of all ToolJet-provided data source connectors.  Ensure that they are using parameterized queries correctly and that they are up-to-date with the latest security patches.
*   **Fuzz Testing:**  Implement automated fuzz testing to identify unexpected behaviors or vulnerabilities in the Query Builder and data source connectors.
*   **Security Training:**  Provide security training for all developers working on ToolJet, with a specific focus on query injection vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
*   **Error Handling Review:**  Ensure that database errors are handled gracefully and that sensitive information is not leaked to the client.  Use generic error messages in the UI and log detailed error information on the server.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities that could be used in conjunction with query injection.
*   **Regular Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular penetration testing by security professionals to identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by internal reviews.
* **Input validation for custom functions:** If Tooljet allows custom functions, ensure proper input validation and sanitization within those functions to prevent injection.
* **Dependency Management:** Regularly review and update all dependencies, including database drivers, to address any known security vulnerabilities.
