# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tooljet/tooljet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Credential Storage (ToolJet Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_credential_storage__tooljet_configuration_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose a Secrets Manager:** Select a secure secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager).
2.  **Store Secrets:** Store *all* database credentials, API keys, and other sensitive information used by ToolJet applications in the chosen secrets manager.
3.  **Configure ToolJet:** Configure ToolJet applications to retrieve secrets from the secrets manager *at runtime*. Utilize ToolJet's environment variable support. Within ToolJet, set environment variables that point to the *location* of the secret within the secrets manager (e.g., a path or key), *not* the secret itself.  The ToolJet server will then need appropriate permissions to access the secrets manager.
4.  **Access Control (Secrets Manager):** Implement strict access control policies within the secrets manager to ensure that only authorized ToolJet servers/applications can retrieve specific secrets.
5.  **Rotation:** Implement a process for regularly rotating secrets (changing passwords, API keys) and updating the secrets manager accordingly.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Credential Exposure (Severity: High):** Prevents sensitive credentials from being exposed in ToolJet configuration files, environment variables visible in the UI, or source code repositories.
    *   **Compromise of ToolJet Server (Severity: High):** Even if the ToolJet server is compromised, attackers cannot directly access the credentials if they are stored securely in a separate secrets manager.
    *   **Insider Threat (Severity: Medium):** Limits the ability of unauthorized users with access to the ToolJet UI to view or copy sensitive credentials.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Eliminates the risk of direct credential exposure within ToolJet. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Compromise of ToolJet Server:** Significantly reduces the impact of a server compromise. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Insider Threat:** Reduces the risk of credential theft by insiders. Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Database credentials and API keys are currently stored directly in ToolJet's environment variables, which are visible in the ToolJet UI.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A secrets manager needs to be selected and implemented.
    *   ToolJet applications need to be reconfigured to retrieve secrets from the secrets manager using environment variables that point to the secret's *location*.
    *   Access control policies need to be defined for the secrets manager.
    *   A secret rotation process needs to be established.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Query Parameterization (Prevent SQL Injection) - *Within ToolJet*](./mitigation_strategies/query_parameterization__prevent_sql_injection__-_within_tooljet.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify All Queries:** Within the ToolJet application builder, identify *all* places where SQL queries are constructed.
2.  **Use ToolJet's Parameterized Query Features:** *Always* use ToolJet's built-in mechanisms for parameterized queries or prepared statements. This typically involves using placeholders (e.g., `?` or `:paramName`) in the SQL query builder and providing the actual values separately in the designated input fields provided by ToolJet.
3.  **Avoid String Concatenation:** *Never* directly concatenate user input or any untrusted data into the SQL query string *within the ToolJet query builder*.
4.  **Review ToolJet Query Configurations:** During reviews of ToolJet application configurations, specifically check for any instances of string concatenation in SQL queries within the query builder interface.
5.  **Testing within ToolJet:** Use ToolJet's testing features to create test cases that attempt SQL injection attacks and verify that they are blocked by the parameterized query implementation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious SQL code into queries, which could allow them to bypass authentication, steal data, modify data, or even execute commands on the database server.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** Effectively eliminates the risk of SQL injection *originating from within ToolJet*. Risk reduction: Critical.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Most ToolJet applications use parameterized queries via the ToolJet UI. However, a recent audit found one application ("Legacy Reporting") that still uses string concatenation in a few queries within the query builder.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The "Legacy Reporting" application needs to be refactored within ToolJet to use the built-in parameterized query features.
    *   A more rigorous review process for ToolJet application configurations needs to be enforced to catch any future instances of string concatenation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization (Within ToolJet)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization__within_tooljet_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Input Points:** Within the ToolJet application builder, identify *all* points where user input is received (e.g., form fields, URL parameters, data passed between components).
2.  **Define Allowed Input:** For each input point, define the *expected* type, format, and range of valid input within ToolJet's component settings. Use a whitelist approach whenever possible (allow only known-good characters/patterns).
3.  **Implement Validation (ToolJet Server-Side):** Utilize ToolJet's server-side JavaScript capabilities to implement validation checks.  This is crucial to prevent bypass of client-side validation.  Use ToolJet's event handlers (e.g., "On Form Submit") to trigger server-side validation logic.
4.  **Sanitize Input (ToolJet Server-Side):** After validation, use ToolJet's server-side JavaScript capabilities to sanitize the input to remove or encode any potentially dangerous characters. Use appropriate sanitization functions based on the context (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).  ToolJet may have built-in functions or libraries that can assist with this.
5.  **Reject Invalid Input:** If input fails validation within the ToolJet server-side logic, reject it and provide a clear error message to the user through the ToolJet UI. Do *not* attempt to "fix" invalid input within ToolJet.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (Severity: Critical):** Provides an additional layer of defense against SQL injection, even if parameterized queries are used.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Helps prevent XSS attacks by ensuring that user input does not contain malicious scripts.
    *   **NoSQL Injection (Severity: High):** Prevents injection attacks against NoSQL databases.
    *   **Command Injection (Severity: Critical):** Prevents attackers from injecting operating system commands (if ToolJet is used to interact with the OS, which should be avoided).
    *   **Other Injection Attacks (Severity: Varies):** Mitigates various other injection attacks depending on the specific context.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection/NoSQL Injection/Command Injection:** Provides significant additional protection *within the ToolJet context*. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **XSS:** Reduces the risk of XSS originating from ToolJet applications. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Other Injection Attacks:** Reduces risk depending on the specific attack. Risk reduction: Medium to High.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic client-side validation is implemented in some ToolJet applications using component properties. However, server-side validation using ToolJet's JavaScript capabilities is inconsistent and often missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive server-side validation using ToolJet's JavaScript event handlers and server-side code execution needs to be implemented for *all* user input in *all* ToolJet applications.
    *   Sanitization needs to be consistently applied after validation using ToolJet's server-side capabilities.
    *   A clear policy needs to be established for handling invalid input within ToolJet and displaying appropriate error messages.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review and Sandboxing (Custom JavaScript *within ToolJet*)](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_and_sandboxing__custom_javascript_within_tooljet_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Mandatory Code Reviews (ToolJet JavaScript):** Establish a mandatory code review process for *all* custom JavaScript code written *within* ToolJet applications, using ToolJet's code editor. At least two developers should review each piece of code.
2.  **Security Focus (ToolJet Code Reviews):** During code reviews of the JavaScript within ToolJet, specifically focus on security implications:
    *   Look for potential XSS vulnerabilities (improper output encoding within ToolJet's UI components).
    *   Look for potential SSRF vulnerabilities (unvalidated outbound requests using `fetch` or similar within ToolJet's JavaScript).
    *   Look for potential access control bypasses within the ToolJet application logic.
    *   Look for any use of `eval()` or other potentially dangerous functions within the ToolJet code.
3.  **Sandboxing (Exploration within ToolJet's Capabilities):** Research and explore potential sandboxing techniques *within the constraints of ToolJet's architecture*. This might involve:
    *   **Careful Use of ToolJet's Scope:** Understanding and carefully managing the scope of variables and functions within ToolJet's JavaScript environment to limit unintended interactions.
    *   **Leveraging ToolJet's Event System:** Using ToolJet's event system to control the flow of data and execution, rather than relying on potentially unsafe direct manipulation of the DOM or global variables.
    *   **Exploring ToolJet's Plugin API (if applicable):** If creating custom plugins for ToolJet, investigate any sandboxing features provided by the plugin API.
4.  **Linters (for ToolJet JavaScript):** If possible, use linters like ESLint with security plugins, configured to analyze the JavaScript code *within* ToolJet's editor, to automatically detect potential security issues. This may require integration with ToolJet's development environment.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities introduced by custom JavaScript code within ToolJet.
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of SSRF vulnerabilities within ToolJet's JavaScript.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: High):** Helps prevent custom code within ToolJet from bypassing access control mechanisms.
    *   **Malicious Code Execution (Severity: Critical):** Limits the potential damage that malicious or buggy code within ToolJet can cause.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS/SSRF/Unauthorized Data Access:** Significantly reduces the risk *within the ToolJet application*. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Malicious Code Execution:** Limits the impact of malicious code *within the ToolJet environment*. Risk reduction: Medium to High (depending on the effectiveness of any sandboxing that can be achieved within ToolJet).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Informal code reviews of ToolJet application configurations are sometimes conducted, but there is no mandatory process or security focus on the JavaScript code.
    *   No sandboxing is implemented within ToolJet.
    *   Linters are not used within ToolJet's code editor.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal, mandatory code review process needs to be established for all JavaScript code within ToolJet applications.
    *   Security-focused code review guidelines need to be developed, specifically addressing the risks within ToolJet's environment.
    *   Sandboxing techniques *within ToolJet's capabilities* need to be researched and potentially implemented.
    *   If possible, linters with security plugins should be integrated into the ToolJet development workflow.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Access Control (Within ToolJet Applications)](./mitigation_strategies/access_control__within_tooljet_applications_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Define User Roles:** Define clear user roles and permissions *within* your ToolJet applications.  This is *in addition to* ToolJet's built-in user management.  Consider roles like "Viewer," "Editor," "Admin," etc., specific to the application's functionality.
2.  **Utilize ToolJet's User Groups:** Use ToolJet's built-in user groups and permissions features to map users to these roles.
3.  **Implement Application-Specific Logic:**  Within your ToolJet applications, use ToolJet's server-side JavaScript and conditional logic capabilities to implement fine-grained access control.  For example:
    *   Check the current user's group membership before displaying certain components or data.
    *   Use conditional logic to enable/disable actions based on the user's role.
    *   Validate user permissions on the server-side before performing any sensitive operations.
4.  **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the access control rules implemented *within* your ToolJet applications to ensure they are effective and up-to-date.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access (Severity: High):** Prevents users from accessing data or functionality they are not authorized to use *within the specific ToolJet application*.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification (Severity: High):** Prevents users from modifying data they should not have write access to *within the application*.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Severity: Medium):** Reduces the chance of a user escalating their privileges *within the ToolJet application*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access/Modification:** Significantly reduces the risk within the ToolJet application. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Makes privilege escalation within the application more difficult. Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic access control is implemented using ToolJet's user groups, but application-specific logic is limited.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   More granular, application-specific access control logic needs to be implemented within ToolJet applications using server-side JavaScript and conditional logic.
    *   Regular audits of access control rules within ToolJet applications are needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Management (Within ToolJet)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_management__within_tooljet_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Plugin Source Verification:** Only install plugins from trusted sources, preferably the official ToolJet plugin repository or well-known, reputable developers. Avoid installing plugins from unknown or untrusted sources.
2.  **Plugin Permission Review:** Before installing a plugin *within ToolJet*, carefully examine the permissions it requests. ToolJet should display these permissions during the installation process. Avoid plugins that request excessive or unnecessary permissions.
3.  **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all installed plugins within ToolJet up-to-date with the latest security patches. ToolJet should provide a mechanism for managing and updating plugins.
4.  **Plugin Sandboxing (Ideal, but may require ToolJet modification):** Ideally, ToolJet would provide a sandboxing mechanism for plugins to limit their access to system resources and other applications. This is a more advanced mitigation and may depend on ToolJet's architecture. If developing custom plugins, explore any sandboxing features provided by the ToolJet plugin API.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Plugin Installation (Severity: High):** Reduces the risk of installing a malicious plugin that could compromise the ToolJet server or applications.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Plugins (Severity: Medium to High):** Keeping plugins updated mitigates known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Excessive Plugin Permissions (Severity: Medium):** Reviewing permissions helps prevent plugins from gaining unauthorized access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Plugin Installation:** Significantly reduces risk. Risk reduction: High.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Plugins:** Reduces risk by applying patches. Risk reduction: Medium to High.
    *   **Excessive Plugin Permissions:** Reduces risk by limiting plugin capabilities. Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Plugins are only installed from the official ToolJet repository.
    *   Basic permission review is done during installation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A more formal process for reviewing plugin permissions could be implemented.
    *   Automatic plugin updates are not enabled.
    *   Plugin sandboxing is not a feature currently offered by ToolJet (this would be a feature request).
