# Attack Surface Analysis for tooljet/tooljet

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Abuse (Authentication/Authorization)](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_abuse__authenticationauthorization_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers attempt to bypass ToolJet's *internal* authentication or authorization mechanisms to gain unauthorized access to its API.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** ToolJet's core functionality is driven by its API.  The complexity of its *internal* RBAC system and authentication methods (JWT, sessions, API keys) creates potential points of failure *within ToolJet's code*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a flaw in ToolJet's JWT validation *logic*, allowing them to forge a token with administrator privileges.  This is a vulnerability *in ToolJet*, not a general JWT issue.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, data modification, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Authentication (Internal):** Implement strong internal checks for user roles and permissions *within the ToolJet codebase*.
        *   **Strict Authorization (Internal):** Enforce least privilege principles *within ToolJet's API handling*. Ensure RBAC is correctly implemented *in code* and granularly controls access.
        *   **Input Validation (Internal API):** Validate all API inputs rigorously *within ToolJet's code*, even for seemingly internal calls.
        *   **Regular Security Audits (ToolJet Code):** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting ToolJet's API *implementation*.
        *   **JWT Best Practices (Internal Implementation):** Follow OWASP JWT best practices *within ToolJet's code*, including using strong signing algorithms, validating all claims, and setting appropriate expiration times.
        *   **Secure Session Management (Internal):** Use secure session management techniques *within ToolJet*, including secure cookies (HttpOnly, Secure flags) and proper session timeouts.

## Attack Surface: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Server Logic](./attack_surfaces/remote_code_execution__rce__in_server_logic.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in ToolJet's *own* server-side code to execute arbitrary commands.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** ToolJet's server handles user-provided configurations, data transformations, and interactions with data sources.  Vulnerabilities *in ToolJet's code* in these areas, or in *its direct* dependencies, can lead to RCE.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a data transformation function *written as part of ToolJet* allows an attacker to inject malicious code that is executed by the server. Or, a vulnerable dependency *directly used by ToolJet's core code* is exploited.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, data modification, deployment of malware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation (ToolJet Code):**  Rigorously sanitize and validate all user-supplied input *within ToolJet's code*, especially in areas that involve code execution or data transformations.
        *   **Dependency Management (ToolJet Core):**  Regularly update all *of ToolJet's* dependencies to their latest secure versions. Use a software composition analysis (SCA) tool to identify and track vulnerable dependencies *in ToolJet's codebase*.
        *   **Secure Coding Practices (ToolJet Development):**  Follow secure coding guidelines (e.g., OWASP) *when developing ToolJet*.
        *   **Code Reviews (ToolJet Code):**  Conduct thorough code reviews of *ToolJet's codebase*, focusing on security-sensitive areas.
        *   **Least Privilege (ToolJet Server):** Run the ToolJet server process with the least necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [Data Source Connection Exploitation (ToolJet's Handling)](./attack_surfaces/data_source_connection_exploitation__tooljet's_handling_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage *vulnerabilities in how ToolJet handles* connections to external data sources.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:**  This focuses on *ToolJet's code* related to connecting to data sources. Insecure handling of credentials *within ToolJet*, lack of input validation in connection strings *as processed by ToolJet*, or insufficient error handling *in ToolJet's connection logic* are the key concerns.
    *   **Example:** A SQL injection vulnerability *in ToolJet's query building logic* allows data extraction, *not* a general SQL injection in a user-defined query.  Or, ToolJet insecurely stores credentials *internally*.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, data modification, denial of service against connected data sources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Credential Storage (Internal):**  Use a secure method *within ToolJet's code* to store and manage data source credentials. Never hardcode credentials *in ToolJet*.
        *   **Input Validation (Connection Logic):**  Validate all user-supplied input used in constructing connection strings or queries *within ToolJet's connection handling code* to prevent injection attacks.
        *   **Least Privilege (ToolJet's Database Access):** Ensure ToolJet's *own* database user has only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   **Connection Pooling (Secure Implementation):** Use connection pooling *within ToolJet* to manage database connections efficiently and securely.
        *   **Monitoring and Alerting (ToolJet's Connections):** Monitor *ToolJet's* data source connections for suspicious activity and set up alerts.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin/Integration Vulnerabilities (ToolJet's Plugin System)](./attack_surfaces/pluginintegration_vulnerabilities__tooljet's_plugin_system_.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in *ToolJet's plugin loading and execution mechanisms*.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** This focuses on the security of *ToolJet's plugin system itself*, not the plugins themselves.  How ToolJet loads, validates, and isolates plugins is critical.
    *   **Example:**  A vulnerability in ToolJet's plugin loading mechanism allows an attacker to load a malicious plugin that bypasses security checks, leading to RCE *because of a flaw in ToolJet*.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies, but could lead to complete system compromise due to flaws *in ToolJet's plugin handling*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Vetting (ToolJet's Responsibility):**  Implement a robust plugin verification process *within ToolJet* to ensure plugins are from trusted sources and have not been tampered with.
        *   **Plugin Isolation (ToolJet's Implementation):**  Run plugins in isolated environments (e.g., separate processes or containers) *as managed by ToolJet* to limit the impact of a compromised plugin.
        *   **Security Audits (ToolJet's Plugin System):**  Conduct thorough security audits and code reviews of *ToolJet's plugin loading and execution code*.
        * **Dependency Management (ToolJet's Plugin System):** Manage dependencies of *ToolJet's plugin system* carefully and keep them updated.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (ToolJet's Internal Requests)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf___tooljet's_internal_requests_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers craft requests *through ToolJet's internal logic* to access internal systems or sensitive data.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** This focuses on *ToolJet's own internal network requests*. If ToolJet makes requests based on user input *without proper validation within its own code*, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`) as input to a ToolJet feature, and *ToolJet's code* attempts to connect to it without proper checks.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal systems, data exfiltration, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Internal Requests):**  Validate all URLs and hostnames *within ToolJet's code* that are used for internal requests, ensuring they are allowed and expected. Use a whitelist approach.
        *   **Network Restrictions (ToolJet's Access):**  Use network policies to restrict *ToolJet's* ability to connect to internal services or sensitive resources.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Protocols (Internal):**  Restrict the protocols *ToolJet's code* can use (e.g., disable `file://` access).
        *   **DNS Resolution Control (ToolJet's Context):** If possible, control DNS resolution *within ToolJet's environment* to prevent it from resolving internal hostnames.

## Attack Surface: [Custom Code Execution (Sandbox Escape - ToolJet's Sandbox)](./attack_surfaces/custom_code_execution__sandbox_escape_-_tooljet's_sandbox_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in *ToolJet's custom code execution environment (its JavaScript sandbox)* to escape and gain access to the underlying system.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** This is entirely about the security of *ToolJet's sandbox implementation*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in the JavaScript engine *used by ToolJet for its sandbox* that allows them to break out and execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete system compromise, data exfiltration, data modification.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Sandbox Implementation (ToolJet's Choice):**  Use a well-vetted and secure JavaScript sandbox implementation *chosen and maintained by ToolJet*. Regularly update the sandbox to address vulnerabilities.
        *   **Input Validation (Code Input to ToolJet):**  Validate and sanitize user-provided code *before it enters ToolJet's sandbox* to prevent malicious code injection.
        *   **Resource Limits (ToolJet's Enforcement):**  Enforce resource limits (CPU, memory, network) on custom code execution *within ToolJet's sandbox*.
        *   **Code Reviews (ToolJet's Sandbox Code):** Conduct thorough code reviews of *ToolJet's sandbox implementation*.
        * **Disable Unnecessary Features (Within ToolJet's Sandbox):** Disable any unnecessary features or APIs within *ToolJet's sandbox environment*.
