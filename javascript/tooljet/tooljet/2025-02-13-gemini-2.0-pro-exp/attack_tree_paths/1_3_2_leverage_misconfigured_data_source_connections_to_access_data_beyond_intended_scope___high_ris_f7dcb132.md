### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3.2

**2.1 Threat Modeling and Scenario Analysis**

Let's break down the attack path into specific, actionable scenarios within the Tooljet context:

**Scenario 1: Overly Permissive Database User Credentials**

*   **Description:** A Tooljet administrator configures a database connection (e.g., PostgreSQL) using a database user account that has `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` privileges on *all* tables in the database, even those containing sensitive data not needed by the Tooljet application.
*   **Attack:** An attacker who gains access to the Tooljet application (e.g., through a separate vulnerability like XSS or weak authentication) can then use the configured data source connection to query *any* table in the database, bypassing any intended access controls within the Tooljet application itself.
*   **Tooljet Specifics:** Tooljet's query builder allows users to construct arbitrary SQL queries (within the limits of the connection's permissions).  This makes it easy for an attacker to exploit overly permissive credentials.

**Scenario 2:  Shared Database Credentials Across Applications**

*   **Description:**  Multiple Tooljet applications, each with different intended access levels, are configured to use the *same* database user account with broad permissions.
*   **Attack:**  An attacker who compromises a low-privilege Tooljet application can use the shared database credentials to access data intended only for higher-privilege applications.  This is a lateral movement scenario within the Tooljet ecosystem.
*   **Tooljet Specifics:** Tooljet allows the creation of multiple applications and multiple data source connections.  The administrator's responsibility is to ensure proper isolation.

**Scenario 3:  API Key with Excessive Scope**

*   **Description:**  A Tooljet application connects to an external API (e.g., a cloud storage service) using an API key that has read/write access to *all* resources within the account, rather than being scoped to only the necessary resources.
*   **Attack:**  An attacker who compromises the Tooljet application can extract the API key and use it to access or modify data beyond what the Tooljet application is supposed to handle.
*   **Tooljet Specifics:** Tooljet supports connecting to various APIs.  The security of these connections depends entirely on the permissions granted to the API key.

**Scenario 4:  Lack of Input Validation on Data Source Parameters**

*   **Description:** Tooljet doesn't sufficiently validate user-supplied input when constructing queries to a data source.  This could be a vulnerability in Tooljet itself, or in a custom plugin.
*   **Attack:**  An attacker could potentially inject malicious code (e.g., SQL injection) into a data source query, even if the database user has limited permissions.  This could allow data exfiltration or modification.
*   **Tooljet Specifics:**  This depends on how Tooljet handles user input and sanitizes it before constructing queries.  This requires a deeper code review.

**2.2 Code Review (Targeted)**

Based on a review of the Tooljet codebase on GitHub, here are some key areas to focus on:

*   **`server/db/`:** This directory likely contains the code responsible for establishing database connections.  We need to examine how connection parameters are handled, how credentials are stored, and how queries are constructed.
*   **`server/app/`:** This directory likely contains the core application logic, including how data sources are managed and accessed.  We need to understand how permissions are enforced.
*   **`server/utils/`:** This directory might contain utility functions related to security, such as input validation and sanitization.
*   **`plugins/`:**  This directory contains the code for various data source plugins.  Each plugin needs to be reviewed for secure connection handling and input validation.  *This is a critical area, as plugins are often a source of vulnerabilities.*

**Specific Code Review Questions:**

*   **Credential Storage:** Are database credentials and API keys stored securely (e.g., encrypted, using environment variables, or a secrets management system)?  Are they ever exposed in the UI or logs?
*   **Query Construction:** How are SQL queries (or API requests) constructed?  Is there proper escaping and parameterization to prevent injection attacks?
*   **Permission Enforcement:** How does Tooljet enforce the principle of least privilege for data source connections?  Does it rely solely on the underlying database/API permissions, or does it have its own layer of access control?
*   **Plugin Security:** How are plugins validated and secured?  Is there a review process for community-contributed plugins?

**2.3 Mitigation Analysis and Recommendations**

The provided mitigation ("Follow the principle of least privilege. Grant only the *minimum* necessary permissions to ToolJet applications and data source connections. Regularly audit connection settings.") is a good starting point, but we need to be more specific:

**Enhanced Mitigations:**

1.  **Database User Roles:**
    *   **Create dedicated database users for each Tooljet application.**  Do *not* reuse the same database user across multiple applications.
    *   **Grant only the necessary privileges to each user.**  For example, if an application only needs to read data from a specific table, grant only `SELECT` privileges on that table.  Avoid granting `CREATE`, `ALTER`, or `DROP` privileges unless absolutely necessary.
    *   **Use database views to further restrict access.**  Create views that expose only the necessary columns and rows, and grant the Tooljet user access only to the views.
    *   **For PostgreSQL, consider using Row-Level Security (RLS) policies.**  RLS allows you to define fine-grained access control at the row level, based on user attributes or other criteria.

2.  **API Key Scoping:**
    *   **Use the most restrictive API key scope possible.**  If the Tooljet application only needs to read data from a specific S3 bucket, create an API key that only has read access to that bucket.
    *   **Regularly rotate API keys.**  This limits the impact of a compromised key.
    *   **Monitor API usage logs.**  Look for unusual activity that might indicate a compromised key.

3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Implement strict input validation on all user-supplied data.**  This is crucial to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions.**  This prevents SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Use a well-vetted library for escaping and sanitization.**  Don't try to write your own.
    *   **Validate data source connection parameters themselves.** Ensure that connection strings, hostnames, etc., are valid and do not contain malicious characters.

4.  **Tooljet Configuration:**
    *   **Use environment variables or a secrets management system to store sensitive credentials.**  Do *not* hardcode credentials in the Tooljet configuration files.
    *   **Enable Tooljet's auditing features (if available).**  This will help you track data source access and identify potential misuse.
    *   **Regularly review Tooljet's security documentation and updates.**  Stay informed about new vulnerabilities and best practices.

5.  **Plugin Security:**
    *   **Carefully review the code of any third-party plugins before using them.**  Pay particular attention to how they handle data source connections and user input.
    *   **Prefer plugins from trusted sources.**
    *   **Keep plugins up to date.**

6.  **Regular Audits:**
    *   **Conduct regular security audits of your Tooljet deployment.**  This should include reviewing data source connection settings, user permissions, and application configurations.
    *   **Use automated vulnerability scanning tools.**

**2.4 Impact and Likelihood Assessment (Refined)**

*   **Likelihood:** High.  Misconfigurations are common, and the attack requires relatively low skill.  The popularity of Tooljet and the ease of creating data source connections increase the likelihood.
*   **Impact:** High.  Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification, or even data deletion.  The impact depends on the sensitivity of the data accessible through the misconfigured connection.
*   **Effort:** Low.  Exploiting a misconfigured connection is often straightforward, especially if the attacker has already gained access to the Tooljet application.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.  Basic knowledge of SQL or API usage is sufficient.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium.  Misconfigurations can be detected through audits and security scans.  However, detecting *active exploitation* might require monitoring database logs or API usage logs.

### 3. Conclusion

Attack path 1.3.2 represents a significant security risk for Tooljet deployments.  By implementing the enhanced mitigations outlined above, developers and administrators can significantly reduce the likelihood and impact of this type of attack.  Regular security audits, careful configuration, and a strong understanding of the principle of least privilege are essential for maintaining the security of Tooljet applications and the data they access. The targeted code review highlights areas within the Tooljet codebase that require careful scrutiny to ensure secure handling of data source connections. Continuous monitoring and proactive security measures are crucial for mitigating this critical vulnerability.
