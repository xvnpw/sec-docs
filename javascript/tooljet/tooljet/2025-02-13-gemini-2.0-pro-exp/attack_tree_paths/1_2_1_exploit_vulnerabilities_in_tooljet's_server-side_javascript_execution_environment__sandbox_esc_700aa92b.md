Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, focusing on a potential sandbox escape vulnerability in ToolJet's server-side JavaScript execution environment.

## Deep Analysis: ToolJet Server-Side JavaScript Sandbox Escape (1.2.1)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the potential for a sandbox escape vulnerability within ToolJet's server-side JavaScript execution environment.  We aim to identify specific attack vectors, assess the feasibility of exploitation, understand the potential impact, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level recommendations already provided.  This analysis will inform development and security practices to proactively prevent such vulnerabilities.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on attack path 1.2.1:  "Exploit vulnerabilities in ToolJet's server-side JavaScript execution environment (sandbox escape)."  We will consider:

*   **ToolJet's Server-Side Code:**  Specifically, the components responsible for executing user-provided JavaScript code. This includes the choice of JavaScript runtime, the configuration of that runtime, and any custom code that wraps or interacts with the runtime to enforce sandboxing.
*   **Known Vulnerabilities:**  We will research known vulnerabilities in the specific JavaScript runtime used by ToolJet (e.g., Node.js's `vm` module, or a third-party sandboxing library).
*   **ToolJet's Input Handling:**  How ToolJet receives, validates (or fails to validate), and sanitizes user-provided JavaScript code before execution.
*   **ToolJet's Dependencies:**  The security posture of any libraries or modules used by ToolJet that are involved in the JavaScript execution process.
*   **ToolJet's Security Model:** How ToolJet isolates user code execution from the rest of the server and the underlying operating system.

We will *not* cover other attack vectors within the broader ToolJet application, such as SQL injection, XSS, or authentication bypasses, unless they directly contribute to a sandbox escape.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following techniques:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the relevant portions of the ToolJet codebase (available on GitHub) to understand the implementation details of the JavaScript execution environment.  This includes identifying the specific runtime, configuration options, and any custom sandboxing logic.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will research known vulnerabilities in the identified JavaScript runtime and any related libraries.  This will involve searching vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD), security advisories, and exploit databases.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):** While we won't be actively exploiting a live ToolJet instance, we will *conceptually* design potential attack payloads based on our code review and vulnerability research.  This will help us understand the feasibility of exploitation.
4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use threat modeling principles to identify potential attack vectors and assess their likelihood and impact.
5.  **Mitigation Analysis:** We will evaluate the effectiveness of existing mitigations and propose additional, more specific, and actionable recommendations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.2.1

**2.1.  Understanding ToolJet's JavaScript Execution Environment (Code Review)**

Based on the ToolJet repository, the server uses Node.js.  A crucial aspect is how ToolJet handles user-provided JavaScript.  Historically, Node.js's built-in `vm` module has been a source of sandbox escape vulnerabilities.  The `vm` module provides a way to execute JavaScript code in a separate context, but it's *not* a true security sandbox.  It's primarily designed for isolating code, not for running untrusted code securely.

We need to determine:

*   **Does ToolJet use `vm` directly?**  If so, how is it configured?  Are there any `context` options used to restrict access to Node.js built-in modules?
*   **Does ToolJet use a dedicated sandboxing library?**  If so, which one?  Examples include `vm2`, `isolated-vm`, or `jailed`.  Each has its own security track record and configuration options.
*   **Is there any custom code that wraps the `vm` module or sandboxing library?**  This custom code could introduce its own vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
*   **How is user input passed to the execution environment?**  Is there any pre-processing, validation, or sanitization?

**Example (Hypothetical - based on common `vm` usage):**

Let's assume ToolJet uses the `vm` module directly, like this (this is a simplified, *vulnerable* example):

```javascript
const vm = require('vm');

function executeUserCode(userCode) {
  try {
    const script = new vm.Script(userCode);
    const context = {}; // Empty context - VERY DANGEROUS
    script.runInContext(vm.createContext(context));
    return context.result; // Assuming user code sets a 'result' property
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error executing user code:", error);
    return null;
  }
}
```

This code is highly vulnerable because the `context` is empty.  This means the user-provided code has access to the global scope, including Node.js built-in modules like `process`, `require`, etc.

**2.2. Known Vulnerabilities (Vulnerability Research)**

*   **`vm` Module Vulnerabilities:**  Numerous CVEs exist related to the `vm` module.  These often involve clever ways to escape the context and access the global scope, even when some restrictions are in place.  Examples include:
    *   **Prototype Pollution:**  Manipulating the prototype of built-in objects to inject malicious code.
    *   **Proxy Traps:**  Using JavaScript Proxies to intercept and modify operations within the sandbox.
    *   **Error Handling:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how errors are handled to leak information or gain control.
    *   **`this` Binding:**  Exploiting the `this` keyword to access the global scope.
    *   **Async/Await:**  Using `async/await` to break out of the synchronous execution flow and access restricted resources.

*   **Sandboxing Library Vulnerabilities:**  Even dedicated sandboxing libraries are not immune to vulnerabilities.  `vm2`, for example, has had numerous critical vulnerabilities over the years, requiring frequent updates.  `isolated-vm` is generally considered more secure, but it's still essential to stay up-to-date.

**2.3.  Conceptual Attack Payloads (Dynamic Analysis - Conceptual)**

Based on the hypothetical (and vulnerable) `vm` example above, here are some potential attack payloads:

*   **Accessing `process`:**

    ```javascript
    result = process.env; // Access environment variables
    ```

    ```javascript
    result = process.exit(1); // Crash the server
    ```

*   **Using `require`:**

    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');
    result = fs.readFileSync('/etc/passwd', 'utf8'); // Read sensitive files
    ```

*   **Prototype Pollution (more complex):**

    ```javascript
    Object.prototype.polluted = true;
    result = global.polluted; // Access the global scope via the polluted prototype
    ```
    This is a simplified example; real-world prototype pollution attacks are often more sophisticated.

*   **Escaping via `this` (context-dependent):**

    ```javascript
    result = this.constructor.constructor('return process')(); // Access the global scope via the Function constructor
    ```

*   **Using a Proxy (if Proxies are not properly handled):**

    ```javascript
    const handler = {
        get: function(target, prop) {
            if (prop === 'process') {
                return global.process; // Leak the process object
            }
            return target[prop];
        }
    };
    const proxy = new Proxy({}, handler);
    result = proxy.process.env;
    ```

These payloads demonstrate how an attacker could potentially:

*   **Read sensitive files:**  Access configuration files, database credentials, or other sensitive data stored on the server.
*   **Modify files:**  Overwrite files, inject malicious code into existing files, or delete files.
*   **Execute arbitrary commands:**  Use `child_process.exec` or similar functions to run arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Crash the server:**  Cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
*   **Gain a reverse shell:**  Establish a persistent connection to the attacker's machine, allowing for ongoing control of the server.

**2.4. Threat Modeling**

*   **Threat Actor:**  A malicious user of the ToolJet application, or an external attacker who has gained access to a user account.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Submitting malicious JavaScript code through a ToolJet interface that allows for server-side code execution.
*   **Vulnerability:**  A flaw in ToolJet's JavaScript sandbox implementation (e.g., a misconfigured `vm` module, a vulnerability in a sandboxing library, or a flaw in custom sandboxing logic).
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the ToolJet server, including data theft, data modification, denial of service, and potential lateral movement to other systems.
*   **Likelihood:**  Low (as stated in the original attack tree), but this depends heavily on the specific implementation details.  If ToolJet uses a vulnerable configuration or a known-vulnerable library, the likelihood increases significantly.
*   **Risk:**  Very High (Likelihood * Impact).  Even if the likelihood is low, the potential impact is so severe that this vulnerability must be addressed with the highest priority.

**2.5. Mitigation Analysis**

The original attack tree provides high-level mitigations.  Here are more specific and actionable recommendations:

1.  **Avoid `vm` Directly:**  Do *not* use Node.js's built-in `vm` module for running untrusted code.  It is not designed for security.

2.  **Use a Robust Sandboxing Library:**  Choose a well-maintained and actively developed sandboxing library with a strong security track record.  `isolated-vm` is a good option, as it uses separate V8 isolates and provides more robust isolation than `vm` or `vm2`.

3.  **Configure the Sandboxing Library Securely:**  Follow the library's documentation carefully to configure it securely.  This typically involves:
    *   **Restricting access to Node.js built-in modules:**  Explicitly disallow access to modules like `process`, `fs`, `child_process`, `net`, etc.
    *   **Limiting memory and CPU usage:**  Prevent denial-of-service attacks by setting limits on the resources that the sandbox can consume.
    *   **Setting timeouts:**  Terminate long-running or unresponsive scripts to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Disabling `eval` and `Function` constructor:** Prevent the dynamic creation of code within the sandbox.

4.  **Implement Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Constructs:**  Instead of trying to blacklist dangerous constructs, define a whitelist of allowed JavaScript syntax and features.  This is a much more secure approach.
    *   **Parse the Code:**  Use a JavaScript parser (e.g., `acorn` or `esprima`) to analyze the user-provided code and ensure it conforms to the whitelist.
    *   **Reject Suspicious Code:**  Reject any code that contains potentially dangerous constructs, even if they are not directly exploitable.

5.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests of the ToolJet application, specifically focusing on the JavaScript execution environment.  This will help identify any vulnerabilities that may have been missed during development.

6.  **Dependency Management:**  Keep all dependencies, including the sandboxing library and Node.js itself, up-to-date with the latest security patches.  Use a dependency management tool (e.g., `npm` or `yarn`) to track dependencies and automate updates.

7.  **Least Privilege:**  Run the ToolJet server with the least privileges necessary.  Do not run it as root or with unnecessary permissions.

8.  **Monitoring and Logging:**  Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect and respond to any suspicious activity.  Log all attempts to execute JavaScript code, including the code itself, the user who submitted it, and the result of the execution.

9. **Consider WebAssembly (Wasm):** Explore using WebAssembly (Wasm) as an alternative to JavaScript for server-side code execution. Wasm provides a more secure and isolated execution environment by design.

By implementing these mitigations, ToolJet can significantly reduce the risk of a sandbox escape vulnerability and protect its users and infrastructure from attack. The key is to move away from relying on the inherently insecure `vm` module and adopt a defense-in-depth approach that combines a robust sandboxing library, strict input validation, and regular security testing.
