# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tooljet/tooljet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization within Tooljet Applications](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_within_tooljet_applications.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Tooljet Script-Based Input Validation and Sanitization

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Tooljet's JavaScript capabilities:**  Leverage JavaScript within Tooljet queries, transformers, and component event handlers to implement input validation and sanitization logic.
    2.  **Implement validation functions:** Write JavaScript functions within Tooljet to check user inputs against defined rules (data type, format, length, allowed characters). Use regular expressions for complex pattern matching.
    3.  **Apply validation before data processing:**  In Tooljet queries or scripts, call these validation functions *immediately* after receiving user input and *before* using the input in database queries, API calls, or UI rendering.
    4.  **Sanitize for UI display:** Use Tooljet's templating engine or JavaScript functions (like `encodeURIComponent` or libraries like DOMPurify if needed for more complex HTML sanitization) to sanitize user inputs before displaying them in Tooljet UI components. This prevents XSS attacks.
    5.  **Leverage Tooljet's error handling:** Use Tooljet's error handling mechanisms to display user-friendly error messages when validation fails, guiding users to correct their input.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **SQL Injection (High Severity):** Prevents malicious SQL code injection through user inputs processed by Tooljet queries.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious scripts into Tooljet application UI viewed by other users.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):** Prevents incorrect or malformed data from being processed by Tooljet applications.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** High risk reduction. Directly mitigates SQL injection vulnerabilities within Tooljet applications.
    *   **XSS:** High risk reduction. Directly mitigates XSS vulnerabilities within Tooljet applications.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues:** Medium risk reduction. Improves data quality and application reliability within Tooljet.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Basic validation might be present in some Tooljet applications, but consistent and comprehensive validation and sanitization using Tooljet's scripting features is not uniformly applied.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege using Tooljet Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_using_tooljet_role-based_access_control__rbac_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Tooljet RBAC Configuration and Enforcement

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Tooljet Roles:** Within Tooljet's "Organization Settings" -> "Roles", create roles that align with user responsibilities (e.g., `App Developer`, `Data Analyst`, `Business User`, `Support`).
    2.  **Configure Role Permissions:** For each Tooljet role, meticulously define permissions within Tooljet's RBAC system. Grant access only to necessary resources:
        *   **Applications:** Control which roles can view, edit, or manage specific Tooljet applications.
        *   **Data Sources:** Control which roles can create, edit, or use specific data source connections within Tooljet.
        *   **Environments:** If using Tooljet environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production), control access to each environment based on roles.
        *   **Settings:** Limit access to organization-level settings and configurations to only administrative roles.
    3.  **Assign Users to Tooljet Roles:** In Tooljet's "Organization Settings" -> "Users", assign each user to the most appropriate role based on their job function.
    4.  **Regularly Audit Tooljet RBAC:** Periodically review Tooljet role definitions and user assignments within Tooljet's settings to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege and organizational access policies.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access within Tooljet (High Severity):** Prevents users from accessing Tooljet applications, data sources, or settings they are not authorized to use, directly within the Tooljet platform.

    *   Automated scripts or processes to audit and report on Tooljet RBAC configurations and user permissions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Credential Management using Tooljet Secrets and Environment Variables](./mitigation_strategies/secure_credential_management_using_tooljet_secrets_and_environment_variables.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Tooljet Secrets Management and Environment Variables

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Tooljet Secrets:** For sensitive credentials like database passwords, API keys, and service account tokens, use Tooljet's built-in "Secrets" management feature (accessible in "Organization Settings" -> "Secrets"). Store these credentials as secrets within Tooljet.
    2.  **Use Tooljet Environment Variables:** For less sensitive configuration values that might vary across environments (e.g., API endpoints, feature flags), use Tooljet's "Environment Variables" (accessible in "Organization Settings" -> "Environment Variables").
    3.  **Access Secrets and Variables in Tooljet:** In Tooljet queries, scripts, and application configurations, access secrets and environment variables using Tooljet's templating syntax (e.g., `{{ secrets.DATABASE_PASSWORD }}` or `{{ env.API_ENDPOINT }}`). *Never* hardcode sensitive values directly.
    4.  **Securely Configure Data Source Connections:** When configuring data source connections in Tooljet, use the option to retrieve credentials from Tooljet Secrets or Environment Variables instead of directly entering them in the connection settings.
