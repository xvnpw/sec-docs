        *   **Mitigation:**  Utilize parameterized queries or equivalent mechanisms for interacting with external data sources. Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided data used in queries. Implement appropriate access controls on the data sources themselves.
    *   **Threat:**  Overly permissive access to data sources. Users might be able to query data sources they shouldn't have access to.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement granular access controls based on user roles and permissions to restrict access to specific data sources and data within those sources.

*   **Authentication Service:**
    *   **Threat:**  Brute-force attacks on login credentials.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement rate limiting on login attempts. Consider account lockout mechanisms after multiple failed attempts.
    *   **Threat:**  Weak password hashing algorithms.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use strong and well-vetted password hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2). Implement salting of passwords.
    *   **Threat:**  Insecure handling of authentication tokens (e.g., JWT).
        *   **Mitigation:** Use strong secret keys for signing tokens. Implement token expiration and refresh mechanisms. Store tokens securely on the client-side (e.g., using HTTP-only, Secure cookies).

*   **Authorization Service:**
    *   **Threat:**  Privilege escalation vulnerabilities. Flaws in the authorization logic could allow users to gain access to resources or perform actions they are not authorized for.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement a well-defined and consistently enforced authorization model (e.g., RBAC). Regularly review and audit authorization rules. Ensure that authorization checks are performed at every access point.
    *   **Threat:**  Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR). If object IDs are predictable or easily guessable, attackers could potentially access resources belonging to other users.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use non-sequential and unpredictable identifiers for resources. Implement authorization checks to ensure users can only access resources they own or are explicitly permitted to access.

*   **PostgreSQL Database:**
    *   **Threat:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
        *   **Mitigation:** Implement strong database access controls and authentication. Restrict database access to only necessary services and users.
    *   **Threat:**  Data breaches due to SQL injection vulnerabilities in the backend.
        *   **Mitigation:** As mentioned earlier, prevent SQL injection through parameterized queries and input validation in the backend.
    *   **Threat:**  Data at rest encryption not implemented.
        *   **Mitigation:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest within the PostgreSQL database.

*   **Redis (Caching, Queues):**
    *   **Threat:**  Unauthorized access to cached data or queue messages.
        *   **Mitigation:** Secure Redis access by configuring authentication and access controls. If sensitive data is cached, consider encrypting it.
    *   **Threat:**  Denial-of-service attacks targeting Redis.
        *   **Mitigation:** Configure appropriate resource limits and implement network security measures to protect Redis.

*   **Data Sources (APIs, Databases):**
    *   **Threat:**  Compromised credentials for external data sources.
        *   **Mitigation:** Store credentials for external data sources securely using encryption or a secrets management system. Rotate credentials regularly. Follow the security best practices of the specific data sources being integrated with.
    *   **Threat:**  Data breaches on the external data sources themselves.
        *   **Mitigation:** While ToolJet cannot directly control the security of external data sources, it's important to be aware of the risks and potentially limit the types of data accessed or stored.
