## Attack Tree Path: [OR: [HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Data Source Connection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/or__high-risk_path__exploit_data_source_connection_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to backend data sources connected through Tooljet.
    *   **AND: [HIGH-RISK PATH] Steal Data Source Credentials Stored in Tooljet [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Goal:** Obtain data source credentials stored within Tooljet.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Credential Storage (e.g., plain text, weak encryption)**
            *   **Description:** Tooljet needs to store credentials to connect to various data sources. If this storage is insecure (e.g., plain text in configuration files, weakly encrypted in the database), an attacker gaining access to the Tooljet server or its database could retrieve these credentials and directly access the backend data sources, bypassing the application entirely.
    *   **AND: [HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Queries/Commands via Tooljet Data Source Connections [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Goal:** Execute malicious queries or commands on backend data sources through Tooljet.
        *   **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Lack of Input Sanitization in Tooljet Query Builders**
            *   **Description:** Tooljet allows users to build queries and interact with data sources through its interface. If Tooljet doesn't properly sanitize user inputs when constructing queries, an attacker could inject malicious SQL, NoSQL, or API calls. This could lead to data breaches, data manipulation, or even remote code execution on the backend database server.
