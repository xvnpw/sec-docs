# Attack Surface Analysis for tooljet/tooljet

## Attack Surface: [Insecurely Stored Data Source Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecurely_stored_data_source_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive credentials (database passwords, API keys) required for Tooljet to connect to external data sources are stored insecurely.
    *   **How Tooljet Contributes:** Tooljet requires users to configure connections to various data sources. If Tooljet's built-in secret management is not used or if users store credentials directly in application configurations or environment variables without proper encryption *within Tooljet*, it introduces this risk.
    *   **Example:** A developer hardcodes database credentials within a Tooljet query or stores API keys in plain text within the Tooljet application's settings. An attacker gaining access to the Tooljet instance can then retrieve these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to backend databases or external APIs, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Tooljet's built-in secret management features or integrate with secure vault solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault) *within Tooljet*.
        *   Avoid storing credentials directly in application code, configuration files, or environment variables *within the Tooljet application*.
        *   Implement proper access controls and permissions *within Tooljet* to limit who can view or modify connection settings.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side JavaScript Injection](./attack_surfaces/server-side_javascript_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into server-side execution contexts within Tooljet, potentially leading to remote code execution.
    *   **How Tooljet Contributes:** Tooljet allows users to write JavaScript code for data transformations, query manipulation, and custom logic within queries and components. If user-provided input is not properly sanitized *before being used in these Tooljet server-side JavaScript contexts*, it can lead to injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates input fields that are used to construct a dynamic database query within a Tooljet JavaScript transformer. This injected JavaScript could execute arbitrary commands on the Tooljet server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the Tooljet server, potentially leading to data breaches, service disruption, or further lateral movement within the network.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all user inputs before using them in server-side JavaScript code *within Tooljet*.
        *   Avoid constructing dynamic code based on user input whenever possible *within Tooljet's JavaScript contexts*.
        *   Regularly update Tooljet to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side JavaScript Injection (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_javascript_injection__cross-site_scripting_-_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the client-side context of the Tooljet application, allowing attackers to execute scripts in the browsers of other users.
    *   **How Tooljet Contributes:** If Tooljet does not properly sanitize user-provided data that is displayed within the application's UI (e.g., in tables, text components), attackers can inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users view that data *within the Tooljet application*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker injects a `<script>` tag containing malicious JavaScript into a field in a database that is displayed in a Tooljet table. When another user views this table *within Tooljet*, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting them to a malicious site.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, credential theft, defacement of the application, redirection to malicious websites, and other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input and output sanitization for all user-provided data displayed within the Tooljet application.
        *   Utilize Tooljet's features for escaping HTML and JavaScript in dynamic content.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS *within the Tooljet application*.

## Attack Surface: [Insufficient Authorization and Access Controls](./attack_surfaces/insufficient_authorization_and_access_controls.md)

*   **Description:** Tooljet's authorization mechanisms are not properly configured, allowing users to access or modify resources they should not have access to.
    *   **How Tooljet Contributes:** Tooljet provides role-based access control (RBAC). If roles and permissions are not configured correctly *within Tooljet*, or if there are flaws in the implementation of these controls *within Tooljet*, it can lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** A user with a "viewer" role is able to modify data through a poorly configured Tooljet application due to insufficient permission checks *within Tooljet*.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of critical configurations, or execution of privileged actions *within the Tooljet application*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully define and configure roles and permissions *within Tooljet* based on the principle of least privilege.
        *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions *within Tooljet*.
        *   Implement granular access controls for different resources and functionalities *within Tooljet applications*.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Tooljet Management Interface](./attack_surfaces/exposed_tooljet_management_interface.md)

*   **Description:** The Tooljet management interface is publicly accessible without proper authentication or network restrictions.
    *   **How Tooljet Contributes:** If the Tooljet instance is deployed without properly securing the network and access to its administrative interface, it becomes a target for attackers *specifically targeting the Tooljet management features*.
    *   **Example:** The Tooljet management interface is accessible over the public internet without strong authentication or IP whitelisting. Attackers can attempt to brute-force credentials or exploit known vulnerabilities in the management interface *of Tooljet*.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the Tooljet instance, including access to all applications, data sources, and configurations *within Tooljet*.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict access to the Tooljet management interface to authorized networks or IP addresses.
        *   Enforce strong authentication mechanisms for the management interface, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) *for Tooljet administrators*.
        *   Keep the Tooljet instance and its underlying infrastructure up-to-date with security patches.
