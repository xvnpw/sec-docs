Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving ToolJet:

### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving ToolJet

*   **Threat:** Data Source Credential Theft
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit weak file permissions on the ToolJet server or a vulnerability in ToolJet's credential storage mechanism to access plaintext or weakly encrypted data source credentials managed by ToolJet. They could then use these credentials to directly access and manipulate the connected databases or APIs, bypassing ToolJet entirely.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data within connected data sources, data breaches, data manipulation or deletion, potential for further attacks on backend systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** Data Source Management Module (specifically the functions responsible for storing and retrieving connection details within ToolJet).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encrypt stored data source credentials within ToolJet using industry-standard algorithms.
        *   Implement strict file system permissions on the ToolJet server to prevent unauthorized access to ToolJet's configuration files.
        *   Consider using secrets management solutions integrated with ToolJet to store and manage sensitive credentials.
        *   Regularly audit access to ToolJet's credential storage mechanisms.

*   **Threat:**  Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Data Source Connectors
    *   **Description:** An attacker could identify and exploit vulnerabilities within ToolJet's specific data source connector implementations (e.g., a bug in the PostgreSQL connector within ToolJet's codebase). This could allow them to execute arbitrary code on the ToolJet server or gain unauthorized access to the connected data source through ToolJet.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the ToolJet server, unauthorized access to connected data sources via ToolJet, potential for denial of service affecting ToolJet.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific Data Source Connector Modules within ToolJet (e.g., `tooljet/server/src/plugins/db/postgresql`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep ToolJet updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches for its connectors.
        *   Monitor ToolJet's security advisories and patch notes for information on connector vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider the security posture of the specific data source connectors used by ToolJet and evaluate alternatives if necessary.

*   **Threat:** Malicious JavaScript Injection in Custom Code Blocks
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into custom code blocks within ToolJet applications. This code is then executed by ToolJet in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites targeting users of the ToolJet application.
    *   **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks affecting users of the ToolJet application, leading to data breaches, account compromise, or malware distribution facilitated by ToolJet.
    *   **Affected Component:** Custom Code Block Execution Engine within ToolJet (the part of ToolJet that interprets and runs user-provided JavaScript).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization within ToolJet for any user-provided JavaScript code.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) configured within ToolJet to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and mitigate the impact of injected scripts.
        *   Regularly review and audit custom code blocks within ToolJet applications for potential vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side JavaScript Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** If ToolJet utilizes server-side JavaScript execution for certain functionalities, vulnerabilities in this execution environment within ToolJet (e.g., insecure dependencies within ToolJet, lack of proper sandboxing by ToolJet) could be exploited by an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the ToolJet server itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Remote code execution on the ToolJet server, potentially leading to complete system compromise, data breaches affecting ToolJet data, or denial of service of the ToolJet platform.
    *   **Affected Component:** Server-Side JavaScript Execution Environment within ToolJet's architecture.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep ToolJet and its server-side dependencies updated to the latest secure versions.
        *   Implement appropriate sandboxing or isolation within ToolJet for server-side code execution to limit the impact of vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow secure coding practices for any server-side JavaScript code within the ToolJet codebase.

*   **Threat:** Lack of Access Control on Administrative Interface
    *   **Description:** If access to the ToolJet administrative interface is not properly secured (e.g., weak authentication mechanisms within ToolJet, no multi-factor authentication enforced by ToolJet), attackers could gain control of the entire ToolJet platform.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the ToolJet instance, ability to create or modify applications within ToolJet, access sensitive data managed by ToolJet, and potentially pivot to other systems accessible from the ToolJet server.
    *   **Affected Component:** ToolJet Administrative Interface and Authentication Modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong authentication mechanisms for the ToolJet administrative interface.
        *   Enforce multi-factor authentication for administrative accounts within ToolJet.
        *   Restrict access to the ToolJet administrative interface based on IP address or network segment.
        *   Regularly review and audit administrative user accounts and permissions within ToolJet.

*   **Threat:** Workflow Manipulation for Privilege Escalation
    *   **Description:** An attacker might be able to manipulate the logic of workflows built within ToolJet to bypass intended security checks or gain access to functionalities within ToolJet they are not authorized to use. This could involve modifying workflow parameters or exploiting vulnerabilities in ToolJet's workflow execution engine.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to restricted features or data within ToolJet applications, potential for performing actions with elevated privileges within the ToolJet environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** Workflow Engine and Workflow Definition Modules within ToolJet.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and test workflows within ToolJet for potential security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust authorization checks within ToolJet's workflows to verify user permissions at each step.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side logic for security decisions within ToolJet workflows.
