Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving ToolJet, with high and critical severity:

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Data Source Credential Storage**
    *   **Description:** Sensitive credentials (usernames, passwords, API keys) for connecting to external data sources are stored in a way that is accessible to unauthorized individuals or processes.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** ToolJet requires users to configure connections to various data sources. If **ToolJet stores these credentials** in plain text, weakly encrypted, or with overly broad access permissions on the server, it creates a significant vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials for a production database are stored in plain text within **ToolJet's configuration files** on the server. An attacker gaining access to the server can easily retrieve these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of connected data sources, leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service on those systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/ToolJet Team:** Implement secure credential storage mechanisms like encryption at rest (using strong encryption algorithms and proper key management), utilizing secrets management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault), and avoiding storing credentials directly in configuration files.
        *   **Users:**  Utilize environment variables or secure configuration options provided by **ToolJet** for storing credentials. Regularly review and rotate credentials.

*   **Attack Surface: Injection Vulnerabilities in Data Source Queries**
    *   **Description:**  User-provided input is directly incorporated into queries sent to connected data sources without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing attackers to inject malicious code.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** **ToolJet allows users to build dynamic queries** and interact with data sources through its interface. If user input from widgets or query parameters is not handled securely by **ToolJet**, it can be used to construct malicious queries.
    *   **Example:** A user input field in a **ToolJet application** is used to filter data in a SQL database. An attacker enters `'; DROP TABLE users; --` into the field, which, if not properly handled by **ToolJet**, could lead to the deletion of the `users` table.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access to data, or denial of service on connected data sources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/ToolJet Team:** Enforce parameterized queries or prepared statements for all data source interactions. Provide clear guidance and tools for users to build secure queries within **ToolJet**. Implement input validation and sanitization on the server-side.
        *   **Users:**  Utilize **ToolJet's features** for parameterized queries whenever possible. Avoid directly concatenating user input into query strings within **ToolJet**. Be cautious about the source and nature of user input.

*   **Attack Surface: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**
    *   **Description:** An attacker can induce the ToolJet server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external URLs, potentially accessing internal resources or interacting with unintended services.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** If **ToolJet allows users to specify URLs** or interact with external resources through its interface (e.g., fetching data from an API, using webhooks), vulnerabilities can arise if these requests are not properly validated and restricted by **ToolJet**.
    *   **Example:** An attacker manipulates a URL parameter in a **ToolJet application** that triggers a server-side request. They change the URL to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:6379`) to interact with a Redis instance running on the same server.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems, or denial of service on external services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/ToolJet Team:** Implement strict input validation and sanitization for URLs within **ToolJet**. Use allow-lists instead of block-lists for allowed destinations. Disable or restrict the ability to make requests to internal networks from **ToolJet**.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious when configuring integrations or features within **ToolJet** that involve making external requests. Understand the potential risks of allowing arbitrary URL inputs within **ToolJet**.

*   **Attack Surface: Code Injection through Custom Components/Queries**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can inject and execute malicious code (e.g., JavaScript, Python) within ToolJet's environment, potentially gaining control over the application or accessing sensitive data.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** **ToolJet allows users to add custom JavaScript or other code snippets** within components or queries to extend functionality. If this code execution is not properly sandboxed or validated by **ToolJet**, it can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user injects JavaScript code into a custom component within **ToolJet** that, when executed by other users, steals their session tokens and sends them to an attacker-controlled server.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data breaches, manipulation of application logic, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/ToolJet Team:** Implement robust sandboxing and isolation for custom code execution within **ToolJet**. Enforce strict input validation and sanitization for code inputs. Provide secure coding guidelines and tools for users within the **ToolJet** environment. Consider code review processes for custom components.
        *   **Users:** Exercise extreme caution when using custom code features within **ToolJet**. Only use code from trusted sources. Understand the security implications of the code being added to **ToolJet**.

*   **Attack Surface: Insufficient Authorization Controls**
    *   **Description:**  The application does not properly enforce access controls, allowing users to perform actions or access data they are not authorized for.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** **ToolJet's role-based access control (RBAC) or permission system** might be flawed or misconfigured, allowing users to bypass intended restrictions within **ToolJet**.
    *   **Example:** A user with a "viewer" role can modify data or access administrative functionalities due to a misconfiguration in **ToolJet's permission settings**.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data modification, privilege escalation, and potential compromise of the entire application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/ToolJet Team:** Implement a robust and well-defined authorization model within **ToolJet**. Enforce the principle of least privilege. Regularly audit and review access controls within **ToolJet**. Provide clear documentation and tools for configuring permissions.
        *   **Users:** Carefully configure user roles and permissions within **ToolJet**. Regularly review user access and remove unnecessary privileges. Understand the implications of different roles and permissions within **ToolJet**.

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Handling of File Uploads**
    *   **Description:** The application allows users to upload files without proper validation, potentially leading to the execution of malicious code or access to sensitive information.
    *   **How ToolJet Contributes:** If **ToolJet allows file uploads** for features like data import or asset management, vulnerabilities can arise if file types, sizes, and contents are not properly validated by **ToolJet**.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a malicious PHP script disguised as an image through a **ToolJet file upload feature**. If the server doesn't properly validate the file type and allows execution, the attacker can gain remote code execution on the ToolJet server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, malware deployment, information disclosure, or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers/ToolJet Team:** Implement strict file type validation (using allow-lists, not just extensions) within **ToolJet**. Sanitize file names. Store uploaded files outside the webroot. Implement virus scanning on uploaded files. Set appropriate file permissions.
        *   **Users:** Be cautious about the types of files being uploaded through **ToolJet**. Ensure that file upload functionalities are used responsibly within **ToolJet**.
