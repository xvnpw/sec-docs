## 3. High-Level Architecture

ToolJet employs a standard multi-tier architecture, logically separated into a user-facing frontend, a business logic handling backend, and a persistent data storage layer. Crucially, it also incorporates a mechanism for integrating with external data sources and services, extending its functionality.

*   **User Interface (Frontend):**  The interactive layer enabling users to design and operate applications.
*   **Backend API:** The central processing unit responsible for business rules, security, and data orchestration.
*   **Database:** The repository for storing application definitions, user details, and platform configurations.
*   **External Integrations:** The conduits for connecting to and interacting with external systems and data.

## 4. Detailed Component Description

### 4.1. User Interface (Frontend)

*   **Technology:** React.js, leveraging component-based architecture and state management libraries (e.g., Redux or Zustand).
*   **Description:** The frontend is implemented as a Single Page Application (SPA) using React. Its responsibilities include:
    *   Rendering the visual application builder, providing a WYSIWYG experience.
    *   Managing user input and interactions through event handlers and form management.
    *   Asynchronously communicating with the backend API using HTTP requests (typically RESTful).
    *   Dynamically displaying application dashboards and individual UI components based on backend data.
    *   Maintaining user session state and managing authentication tokens.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Intuitive drag-and-drop interface for application assembly and layout design.
    *   A rich library of pre-built, reusable UI components (e.g., buttons, tables, charts, forms).
    *   A visual query builder interface simplifying data integration configuration.
    *   A real-time application preview mode for immediate feedback during development.

### 4.2. Backend API

*   **Technology:** Node.js runtime environment, built upon the NestJS framework (utilizing TypeScript), employing an MVC (Model-View-Controller) or similar architectural pattern.
*   **Description:** The backend API serves as the core engine of the platform, responsible for:
    *   Securely authenticating users and managing their sessions using strategies like JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
    *   Enforcing authorization policies to control access to specific resources and functionalities.
    *   Managing the lifecycle of applications, pages within applications, and individual UI components.
    *   Receiving and processing requests originating from the frontend application.
    *   Interacting with the database layer to persist and retrieve application and user data.
    *   Orchestrating communication with configured external integrations to fetch or manipulate external data.
    *   Executing server-side logic associated with application components, potentially involving data transformation or business rule enforcement.
*   **Key Modules:**
    *   **Authentication Module:**  Handles user credential verification, login procedures, registration, and session lifecycle management.
    *   **Authorization Module:**  Manages user roles, permissions, and access control policies, often implemented using an RBAC model.
    *   **Application Management Module:**  Provides functionalities for creating, updating, deleting, and managing application metadata and configurations.
    *   **Page Management Module:**  Handles the organization and structure of pages within an application, including layout and component arrangement.
    *   **Component Management Module:**  Manages the configuration, properties, and data bindings of individual UI components within an application.
    *   **Datasource Management Module:**  Facilitates the configuration and management of connections to various external data sources, securely storing connection details.
    *   **Query Execution Engine:**  Responsible for translating user-defined queries or API calls into the specific language or protocol required by the connected data source.

### 4.3. Database

*   **Technology:** PostgreSQL (primary supported database), with potential support for other relational and NoSQL databases through abstraction layers (e.g., using an ORM like TypeORM).
*   **Description:** The database serves as the persistent storage layer for the ToolJet platform, housing critical information such as:
    *   User account details, profiles, and associated credentials (hashed and salted).
    *   Complete application configurations, including page layouts, component properties, and data binding definitions.
    *   Connection details for external data sources, stored securely (potentially encrypted).
    *   Audit logs tracking user actions and system events for security and debugging purposes.
    *   Internal platform settings and configuration parameters.

### 4.4. External Integrations

*   **Technology:**  Implementation varies depending on the target system, often involving REST API calls using libraries like `axios` or `node-fetch`, or utilizing specific SDKs provided by the external service.
*   **Description:** ToolJet's ability to connect to external systems is a core feature, enabling data retrieval and manipulation across various sources. These integrations encompass:
    *   **Relational Databases:** PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL Server, and others, accessed via database drivers.

    *   Secure storage of sensitive connection credentials, employing encryption at rest.
    *   An abstraction layer to provide a consistent interface for interacting with diverse integration types, simplifying development.
    *   Mechanisms for handling authentication and authorization requirements of external systems (e.g., API keys, OAuth tokens).
    *   Data transformation and mapping capabilities to adapt data structures between ToolJet and external systems.

### 4.5. Background Workers

*   **Technology:**  Likely leveraging a message queue system like Redis or RabbitMQ, coupled with worker processes (potentially using libraries like `bull` or `bee-queue` in Node.js).
*   **Description:**  Background workers are employed to handle asynchronous and non-interactive tasks, improving the responsiveness and scalability of the platform. Examples include:
    *   Scheduled data synchronization tasks between ToolJet and external data sources.
    *   Execution of long-running data processing jobs that would otherwise block user interactions.
    *   Sending out email notifications or other forms of asynchronous communication.
    *   Performing periodic maintenance tasks or data cleanup operations.
