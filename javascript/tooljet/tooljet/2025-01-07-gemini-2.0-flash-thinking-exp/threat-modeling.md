# Threat Model Analysis for tooljet/tooljet

## Threat: [Compromised Connector Credentials](./threats/compromised_connector_credentials.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the credentials used by ToolJet to connect to external data sources (databases, APIs, etc.). This could happen through insecure storage *within ToolJet's configuration* or by exploiting vulnerabilities in *ToolJet's credential management*. The attacker might then use these credentials to directly access, modify, or delete data in the connected system.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to external systems, potential financial loss, reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** Connector Configuration Module, potentially the internal credential storage mechanism *within ToolJet*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize secure credential management practices provided by ToolJet (if available).
*   Avoid storing credentials directly in ToolJet configurations.
*   Consider using secrets management solutions and integrating them with ToolJet if supported.
*   Regularly rotate connector credentials.
*   Implement strong access controls for managing ToolJet connector configurations.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Custom JavaScript](./threats/code_injection_via_custom_javascript.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how *ToolJet handles or executes custom JavaScript code*. This could allow the attacker to inject arbitrary code that is then executed on the ToolJet server or in the user's browser with elevated privileges.

**Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, privilege escalation, remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** Custom JavaScript Execution Engine *within ToolJet*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for any data used within custom JavaScript code *in ToolJet*.
*   Minimize the use of dynamic code execution within ToolJet applications.
*   Regularly review and audit custom JavaScript code for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in ToolJet Configuration Files](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_tooljet_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, might be stored in *ToolJet's configuration files* in an insecure manner (e.g., plain text). An attacker gaining access to the server or the configuration files could retrieve this sensitive information.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to connected systems.

**Affected Component:** Configuration Management System *within ToolJet*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in configuration files.
*   Utilize environment variables or secure secrets management solutions for storing sensitive configuration data.
*   Implement proper file system permissions to restrict access to configuration files.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Connector Communication](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_connector_communication.md)

**Description:** An attacker intercepts the communication between ToolJet and a connected data source. This could allow the attacker to eavesdrop on sensitive data being transmitted, or even modify requests and responses. This is particularly relevant if connections are not using TLS/SSL or if certificate validation is not properly implemented *by ToolJet*.

**Impact:** Data leakage, data manipulation, potential compromise of the connected system.

**Affected Component:** Connector Communication Layer *within ToolJet*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure all connector communications utilize TLS/SSL encryption.
*   Verify that ToolJet properly validates SSL/TLS certificates of connected services.
*   If possible, use secure communication protocols provided by the connected service.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Connector Configuration](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_connector_configuration.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the connector configuration *within ToolJet* to make requests to internal or external resources that *ToolJet* has access to. This could be used to scan internal networks, access internal services, or even launch attacks against other systems.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to internal resources, potential compromise of other systems, data exfiltration.

**Affected Component:** Connector Configuration Module, potentially the request handling logic within connectors *in ToolJet*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all connector configuration parameters, especially URLs and hostnames *within ToolJet*.
*   Restrict the network access of the ToolJet server to only necessary external resources.
*   Consider implementing a whitelist of allowed destination hosts for connectors *within ToolJet*.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Custom JavaScript Widgets](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_custom_javascript_widgets.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a custom widget or component *within ToolJet*. When other users interact with this widget, the malicious script is executed in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement of the ToolJet application.

**Affected Component:** Custom JavaScript Widget Component *within ToolJet*, potentially the rendering engine for user-defined content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Rely on ToolJet's built-in mechanisms for preventing XSS.
*   Implement proper output encoding and sanitization for any user-provided data displayed within custom widgets.
*   Educate developers on secure coding practices for front-end development within the ToolJet environment.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within ToolJet](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_tooljet.md)

**Description:** An attacker with limited access to ToolJet exploits vulnerabilities in the platform's authorization mechanisms to gain access to features or data they are not intended to have. This could involve manipulating roles, permissions, or exploiting flaws in access control logic *within ToolJet*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of critical configurations, potential takeover of the ToolJet instance.

**Affected Component:** User Management and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) System *within ToolJet*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly review and audit ToolJet's role and permission configurations.
*   Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning roles to users.
*   Ensure that ToolJet's authorization mechanisms are robust and secure.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configurations](./threats/insecure_default_configurations.md)

**Description:** ToolJet might be deployed with insecure default configurations, such as default passwords or overly permissive access controls. An attacker could exploit these default settings to gain unauthorized access *to ToolJet*.

**Impact:** Initial access point for further attacks, potential takeover of the ToolJet instance.

**Affected Component:** Installation and Configuration Modules *of ToolJet*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Change all default passwords immediately after installation.
*   Review and harden default security settings according to security best practices.
*   Follow ToolJet's security recommendations for deployment.
