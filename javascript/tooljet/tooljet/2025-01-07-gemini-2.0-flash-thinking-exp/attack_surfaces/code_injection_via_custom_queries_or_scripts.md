## Deep Dive Analysis: Code Injection via Custom Queries or Scripts in Tooljet

This analysis provides a comprehensive breakdown of the "Code Injection via Custom Queries or Scripts" attack surface in the Tooljet application, as described in the provided information. We will delve into the mechanisms, potential attack vectors, impact, and mitigation strategies, offering specific recommendations for the development team.

**1. Understanding the Attack Surface:**

The core of this vulnerability lies in Tooljet's functionality that allows users to define and execute custom logic, primarily through queries and scripts. This feature, while powerful for customization and automation, introduces a significant risk if not implemented with robust security measures. The fundamental problem is the potential for **untrusted user input to be interpreted and executed as code** by the Tooljet server.

**2. How Tooljet Contributes (Deep Dive):**

Tooljet's architecture likely involves several components where this vulnerability could manifest:

* **Data Source Connections:** When connecting to databases or APIs, users might be able to define custom SQL queries, GraphQL queries, or API requests. If user-provided data (e.g., from input fields in a Tooljet application) is directly concatenated into these queries without proper sanitization or parameterized queries, it opens the door for SQL injection or similar injection attacks.
* **JavaScript Transformations and Event Handlers:** Tooljet allows users to write JavaScript code for data transformations, handling events, and implementing custom logic within applications. This is a prime area for code injection if the execution environment is not properly sandboxed. Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript that interacts with the underlying server, accesses sensitive data, or even executes system commands.
* **Workflow Automation:** If Tooljet has workflow automation features that allow users to define custom scripts or commands to be executed as part of a workflow, this becomes another entry point. Imagine a workflow triggered by user input that executes a script containing injected malicious code.
* **Custom Components/Plugins:** If Tooljet supports custom components or plugins, these could also be vectors for code injection if the plugin development framework doesn't enforce strict security guidelines and sandboxing.

**3. Attack Vectors and Scenarios (Expanded):**

Let's explore specific ways an attacker could exploit this vulnerability:

* **Malicious Input in Data Sources:**
    * **SQL Injection:** A user input field in a Tooljet application is used to filter data from a database. An attacker enters `' OR 1=1; -- ` into the field, causing the query to return all records, potentially exposing sensitive information.
    * **NoSQL Injection:** Similar to SQL injection, but targeting NoSQL databases. An attacker might inject malicious operators or commands into a query to bypass authentication or access unauthorized data.
    * **GraphQL Injection:** If Tooljet uses GraphQL, attackers could craft malicious queries that exploit vulnerabilities in the schema or resolvers, potentially retrieving more data than intended or even manipulating data.
    * **API Injection:** If users can define custom API requests, attackers could inject malicious parameters or headers to access unauthorized endpoints or perform unintended actions on the target API.

* **Exploiting JavaScript Execution:**
    * **Accessing Server-Side APIs:** Injected JavaScript could try to access internal Tooljet APIs or Node.js modules that offer privileged functionalities, such as file system access or network operations.
    * **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious scripts could read sensitive data processed by the Tooljet application and send it to an external server controlled by the attacker.
    * **Denial of Service:** An attacker could inject JavaScript that consumes excessive resources, causing the Tooljet server to become unresponsive.
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to Server-Side Execution:** While technically a different vulnerability, if an attacker can inject client-side JavaScript that then triggers the execution of vulnerable server-side custom code, it can lead to server-side code injection.
    * **Abuse of Third-Party Libraries:** If the JavaScript execution environment allows the use of third-party libraries, an attacker might leverage vulnerabilities in those libraries to achieve code execution.

* **Compromising Workflow Automation:**
    * **Injecting Shell Commands:** If workflows allow execution of shell commands, an attacker could inject commands to gain shell access to the Tooljet server.
    * **Manipulating Workflow Logic:** Attackers could inject code to alter the intended flow of a workflow, potentially leading to data manipulation or unauthorized actions.

**4. Technical Implications and Impact (Detailed):**

The impact of successful code injection can be devastating:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** This is the most critical consequence. Attackers gain the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the Tooljet server, effectively taking complete control.
* **Data Breach and Exfiltration:** Attackers can access and steal sensitive data stored in the connected databases, APIs, or within the Tooljet application itself.
* **Data Manipulation and Integrity Loss:** Attackers can modify or delete critical data, leading to business disruption and incorrect information.
* **System Compromise and Lateral Movement:** A compromised Tooljet server can be used as a stepping stone to attack other systems within the network.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):** Attackers can overload the server with malicious code, causing it to crash or become unavailable.
* **Reputational Damage:** A security breach can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Tooljet.
* **Supply Chain Attacks:** If Tooljet is used to build applications for external clients, a compromise could lead to attacks on those clients.
* **Compliance Violations:** Data breaches resulting from code injection can lead to significant fines and legal repercussions.

**5. Defense in Depth Strategies (Elaborated):**

The provided mitigation strategies are crucial, but let's expand on them and add further recommendations:

* **Secure Sandboxing (Implementation Details):**
    * **Isolated Execution Environments:** Utilize technologies like virtual machines, containers (e.g., Docker), or secure JavaScript interpreters (e.g., VMs within Node.js) to isolate the execution of custom code.
    * **Restricted API Access:** Limit the APIs and system resources accessible to the sandboxed environment. Implement a whitelist of allowed functions and modules.
    * **Resource Limits:** Impose limits on CPU, memory, and network usage within the sandbox to prevent resource exhaustion attacks.
    * **Regular Sandbox Security Audits:** Ensure the sandbox implementation itself is secure and free from vulnerabilities.

* **Input Sanitization and Validation (Comprehensive Approach):**
    * **Context-Aware Sanitization:** Apply different sanitization techniques depending on the context where the input will be used (e.g., HTML escaping for display, SQL escaping for database queries).
    * **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):**  For database interactions, always use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection. Never concatenate user input directly into SQL strings.
    * **Input Validation:**  Define strict validation rules for all user inputs, including data types, formats, and allowed characters. Reject any input that doesn't conform to these rules.
    * **Output Encoding:** When displaying user-generated content, encode it properly to prevent client-side script injection (XSS).

* **Principle of Least Privilege (Granular Control):**
    * **Separate Execution Users:** Run the custom code execution environments with dedicated user accounts that have minimal privileges.
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement granular permissions for users defining and executing custom code. Restrict who can create, modify, and execute potentially dangerous scripts.
    * **Resource Access Control:** Limit the access of custom code to specific data sources and resources based on the user's permissions.

* **Regular Security Audits (Proactive Approach):**
    * **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Use automated tools to analyze the Tooljet codebase for potential code injection vulnerabilities.
    * **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):**  Simulate attacks on the running application to identify vulnerabilities.
    * **Manual Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough manual reviews of the code responsible for handling custom queries and scripts.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Engage external security experts to perform penetration testing and identify exploitable vulnerabilities.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of potential client-side script injection vulnerabilities.
* **Secure Coding Practices:** Train developers on secure coding practices to prevent the introduction of code injection vulnerabilities.
* **Security Awareness Training:** Educate users about the risks of injecting malicious code and how to avoid it.
* **Rate Limiting and Throttling:** Implement rate limiting and throttling to prevent attackers from repeatedly trying to exploit vulnerabilities.
* **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity and potential code injection attempts.
* **Regular Updates and Patching:** Keep Tooljet and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.

**6. Specific Considerations for Tooljet:**

* **Identify all entry points for custom code:**  Map out all features and functionalities where users can define custom queries, scripts, or logic.
