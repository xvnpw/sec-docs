# Attack Surface Analysis for tooljet/tooljet

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Custom Components/Widgets](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_custom_componentswidgets.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the application that are executed in the browsers of other users.
    *   **How Tooljet Contributes:** Tooljet's ability to create and integrate custom components and widgets introduces this risk if these components are not developed securely. If user-provided data or data retrieved from external sources is directly rendered without proper sanitization within these components, it can lead to XSS.
    *   **Example:** A developer creates a custom widget that displays data from an external API. If the API response contains malicious JavaScript and the widget directly renders this data, any user viewing the widget will execute the script.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, information theft, defacement of the application.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all data rendered within custom components, especially data originating from external sources or user input. Use appropriate encoding techniques (e.g., HTML escaping).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
        *   **Regular Security Reviews:**  Conduct security reviews of custom components and widgets to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   **Secure Development Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding practices for frontend development, focusing on XSS prevention.

## Attack Surface: [SQL Injection via Dynamic Queries in Data Source Integrations](./attack_surfaces/sql_injection_via_dynamic_queries_in_data_source_integrations.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate database queries to gain unauthorized access to or modify data.
    *   **How Tooljet Contributes:** Tooljet allows users to define queries and connect to various data sources. If parameters from user input (e.g., form fields, widget configurations) are directly incorporated into SQL queries without proper sanitization, it creates an entry point for SQL injection.
    *   **Example:** A Tooljet application allows users to search for products by name. If the search term is directly inserted into a SQL query without sanitization, an attacker could input `' OR '1'='1` to bypass the search logic and retrieve all products.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, data modification or deletion, potential for command execution on the database server depending on database permissions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Ensure all database interactions use parameterized queries to prevent the direct injection of SQL code. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Sanitize and validate all user inputs that are used in database queries on the backend.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Ensure database users connected by Tooljet have only the necessary permissions.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Review Tooljet configurations and custom queries for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Data Source Connections or Integrations](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_data_source_connections_or_integrations.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can induce the server to make unintended requests to internal or external resources.
    *   **How Tooljet Contributes:** If Tooljet allows users to specify arbitrary URLs or endpoints for data source connections or integrations, an attacker could manipulate these settings to make the Tooljet server send requests to internal network resources or external services.
    *   **Example:** An attacker modifies the configuration of a REST API data source to point to an internal service that is not publicly accessible. When Tooljet attempts to fetch data from this "data source," it inadvertently accesses the internal service.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Whitelisting:**  Strictly validate and whitelist allowed URLs and endpoints for data source connections and integrations.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the Tooljet server from sensitive internal networks where possible.
        *   **Disable Unnecessary Protocols:**  Disable any unnecessary protocols that might be used for SSRF attacks (e.g., file://, gopher://).
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Review data source configurations and integration settings for potential SSRF vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via Custom Queries or Scripts](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_custom_queries_or_scripts.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code that is executed by the server.
    *   **How Tooljet Contributes:** Tooljet allows users to write custom queries and scripts (e.g., JavaScript). If these scripts are not properly sandboxed or if user input is directly incorporated into their execution without sanitization, it can lead to code injection.
    *   **Example:** A Tooljet application allows users to define custom JavaScript to process data. If an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into this custom code, they could execute arbitrary commands on the Tooljet server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the Tooljet server and potentially the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Sandboxing:** Ensure that custom code execution environments are properly sandboxed to prevent access to sensitive system resources.
        *   **Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Sanitize and validate any user input that is used within custom queries or scripts.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run custom code execution environments with the minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Review custom queries and scripts for potential code injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of Data Source Credentials](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_data_source_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive credentials for connecting to data sources are stored insecurely.
    *   **How Tooljet Contributes:** Tooljet needs to store credentials for connecting to various databases and APIs. If these credentials are not properly encrypted or are stored in easily accessible locations, they can be compromised.
    *   **Example:** Data source credentials are stored in plain text in configuration files or the Tooljet database without proper encryption. An attacker gaining access to the server could easily retrieve these credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to connected data sources, data breaches, potential for further attacks on connected systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Encryption at Rest:**  Encrypt all stored data source credentials using strong encryption algorithms.
        *   **Secrets Management:**  Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and manage sensitive credentials.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant Tooljet only the necessary permissions to access data sources.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Review how Tooljet stores and manages data source credentials to ensure security best practices are followed.
