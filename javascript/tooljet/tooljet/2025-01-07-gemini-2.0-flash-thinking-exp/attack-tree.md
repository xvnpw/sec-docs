## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Tooljet [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_tooljet__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate objective of the attacker and represents the successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities within Tooljet to compromise the application it supports. A successful compromise can lead to various negative outcomes, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and disruption of services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 1: Exploiting Platform Vulnerabilities for RCE:](./attack_tree_paths/path_1_exploiting_platform_vulnerabilities_for_rce.md)

* **Exploit Tooljet Platform Vulnerabilities:** This is the initial stage where the attacker targets weaknesses within the core Tooljet platform.
    * **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws -> Leverage Default Credentials -> Gain Initial Access with Weak Default Passwords [HIGH-RISK PATH STEP]:** If Tooljet instances are deployed with default credentials and these are not changed, an attacker can easily gain initial access to the platform. This provides a foothold for further attacks.
    * **Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Tooljet Server -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Tooljet Dependencies -> Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used by Tooljet [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH STEP]:**  Tooljet relies on various third-party libraries. If these libraries have known vulnerabilities, and Tooljet's instance is not updated, an attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code on the Tooljet server. This represents a critical compromise as it grants full control over the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 2: Compromising External Systems via Stored Credentials:](./attack_tree_paths/path_2_compromising_external_systems_via_stored_credentials.md)

* **Exploit Tooljet's Interaction with External Systems:** This focuses on attacking the connections Tooljet has with external data sources and APIs.
    * **Compromise Data Source Connections -> Exploit Stored Credentials within Tooljet -> Retrieve Stored Database or API Credentials [HIGH-RISK PATH STEP]:** If Tooljet stores credentials for connecting to databases or APIs insecurely (e.g., without proper encryption), an attacker who gains access to the Tooljet system (even with limited privileges initially) can retrieve these credentials. This allows them to directly access and potentially compromise the connected external systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 3: Compromising External Systems via Exposed API Keys:](./attack_tree_paths/path_3_compromising_external_systems_via_exposed_api_keys.md)

* **Exploit Tooljet's Interaction with External Systems:** Again, the focus is on attacking external connections.
    * **Compromise API Integrations -> Exploit Weaknesses in API Key Management -> Retrieve or Forge API Keys Used by Tooljet [HIGH-RISK PATH STEP]:** If Tooljet's API keys are stored insecurely or if there are weaknesses in how they are managed, an attacker can retrieve or forge these keys. This allows them to impersonate Tooljet and access external services, potentially leading to data breaches or unauthorized actions on those services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 4: Data Breach via Exposed Credentials:](./attack_tree_paths/path_4_data_breach_via_exposed_credentials.md)

* **Exploit Tooljet Platform Vulnerabilities:**  The attacker starts by targeting weaknesses in the Tooljet platform.
    * **Exploit Information Disclosure Vulnerabilities -> Access Sensitive Configuration Files -> Retrieve API Keys, Database Credentials, etc. [HIGH-RISK PATH STEP]:** If sensitive configuration files containing API keys, database credentials, or other secrets are not properly protected (e.g., incorrect file permissions, lack of encryption), an attacker can access these files and retrieve the sensitive information. This directly leads to a data breach and potential compromise of connected systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path 5: Data Manipulation via SQL Injection:](./attack_tree_paths/path_5_data_manipulation_via_sql_injection.md)

* **Exploit User-Created Content/Configurations within Tooljet:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities introduced through user-defined elements within Tooljet.
    * **Inject Malicious Code into Queries/Scripts -> SQL Injection in Tooljet Queries -> Inject SQL Code into User-Defined Queries [HIGH-RISK PATH STEP]:** If Tooljet allows users to define database queries without proper input sanitization or by directly concatenating user input into SQL queries, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code. This can allow them to bypass security measures, read sensitive data, modify data, or even execute arbitrary commands on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on Tooljet Server [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/achieve_remote_code_execution__rce__on_tooljet_server__critical_node_.md)

As highlighted in Path 1, achieving Remote Code Execution on the Tooljet server is a critical point of compromise. It grants the attacker the ability to execute arbitrary commands, effectively giving them full control over the server and potentially the entire application environment. This can lead to data breaches, service disruption, and further lateral movement within the network.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Stored Credentials within Tooljet [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_stored_credentials_within_tooljet__critical_node_.md)

As highlighted in Path 2, the insecure storage of credentials within Tooljet is a critical vulnerability. If an attacker can access these stored credentials, they can bypass the authentication mechanisms of connected systems, leading to direct compromise of those systems and potential data breaches or unauthorized actions.
