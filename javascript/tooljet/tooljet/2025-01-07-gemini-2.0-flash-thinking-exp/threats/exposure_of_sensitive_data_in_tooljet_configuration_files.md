Let's analyze the provided mitigation strategies and offer more concrete and ToolJet-specific recommendations:

* **Avoid storing sensitive data directly in configuration files:** This is the foundational principle.
    * **Recommendation:**  **Strictly enforce this rule.**  Code reviews should specifically check for hardcoded secrets. Implement linters and static analysis tools to automatically detect potential violations. Educate developers on the risks and best practices.
    * **ToolJet Specific:**  Emphasize that even seemingly innocuous settings can become sensitive depending on the context. For example, API endpoint URLs might reveal internal architecture.
* **Utilize environment variables or secure secrets management solutions for storing sensitive configuration data:** This is the primary solution.
    * **Environment Variables:**
        * **Recommendation:**  Leverage environment variables extensively. ToolJet being a Node.js application, it can easily access environment variables using `process.env`.
        * **ToolJet Specific:**  Document the expected environment variables and their purpose clearly. Provide examples in the documentation. Consider using a `.env.example` file (without actual secrets) for development setup.
        * **Security Note:**  Ensure the environment where ToolJet runs (server, container) is configured to securely manage these variables. Avoid committing `.env` files to version control.
    * **Secure Secrets Management Solutions:**
        * **Recommendation:**  Integrate with dedicated secrets management solutions for production environments. Consider options like:
            * **HashiCorp Vault:** A popular and robust solution for managing secrets and sensitive data.
            * **AWS Secrets Manager/Azure Key Vault/Google Cloud Secret Manager:** Cloud-native solutions tightly integrated with their respective platforms.
            * **CyberArk Conjur:** An enterprise-grade secrets management platform.
        * **ToolJet Specific:**  Provide guidance on how to integrate ToolJet with these solutions. This might involve creating custom modules or utilizing existing libraries. Consider the deployment environment (cloud vs. on-premise) when recommending solutions.
        * **Benefits:** Centralized management, audit logging, access control, encryption at rest and in transit, secret rotation.
* **Implement proper file system permissions to restrict access to configuration files:** This is a crucial baseline security measure.
    * **Recommendation:**  Implement the principle of least privilege. Only the necessary user(s) and group(s) should have read access to configuration files. Avoid world-readable permissions.
