#### 4.4. Exploit Scenario

Let's consider a potential exploit scenario focusing on **Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA)**:

1.  **Reconnaissance:** An attacker identifies an API endpoint for managing Tooljet applications, for example, `/api/applications/{applicationId}` (hypothetical endpoint).
2.  **Authentication:** The attacker authenticates to the Tooljet platform using valid credentials (obtained through legitimate means, compromised account, or weak authentication exploit).
3.  **Initial Access:** The attacker successfully retrieves information about their own application using the API endpoint, e.g., `/api/applications/123` (where `123` is their application ID).
4.  **BOLA Attempt:** The attacker attempts to access information about *another* application by manipulating the `applicationId` in the API request, e.g., `/api/applications/456`.
5.  **Authorization Bypass:** Due to a BOLA vulnerability, the API endpoint fails to properly verify if the authenticated user is authorized to access application `456`.
6.  **Unauthorized Access:** The API endpoint returns sensitive information about application `456`, such as its configuration, data sources, and users, even though the attacker is not authorized to access it.
7.  **Further Exploitation:** The attacker can now use this unauthorized access to:
    *   **Modify application `456`:** Change its configuration, add malicious code, or disrupt its functionality.
    *   **Access data sources connected to application `456`:** Potentially gaining access to sensitive data stored in external databases.
    *   **Delete application `456`:** Causing service disruption.
    *   **Escalate privileges:** If application `456` has higher privileges, the attacker might be able to leverage this access to further compromise the Tooljet platform.
