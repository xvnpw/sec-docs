## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known ToolJet Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_tooljet_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs, security advisories) in ToolJet.
*   **Critical Node: Execute Exploit Code [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Attack Action:** Utilize publicly available exploits or develop custom exploit for identified vulnerability.
    *   **Insight:** Regularly update ToolJet to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement vulnerability scanning and penetration testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit ToolJet Configuration Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_tooljet_configuration_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Misconfigurations in ToolJet setup, deployment, or access controls.
*   **Critical Node: Default Credentials [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Attack Action:** Attempt default credentials for ToolJet admin panel or database connections.
    *   **Insight:** Follow ToolJet's security best practices for configuration and deployment. Implement strong password policies and principle of least privilege.
*   **Critical Node: Leverage Misconfiguration for Access [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Attack Action:** Exploit identified misconfiguration (default credentials, weak access controls, insecure deployment) to gain unauthorized access to ToolJet or the application.
    *   **Insight:** Regular security audits of ToolJet configuration and deployment are essential. Use configuration management tools to enforce secure settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Known vulnerabilities in ToolJet's dependencies (libraries, frameworks).
*   **Critical Node: Execute Exploit Vulnerability in Dependency [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Attack Action:** Exploit identified vulnerabilities in ToolJet's dependencies to compromise the application.
    *   **Insight:** Regularly update ToolJet and its dependencies. Implement dependency scanning in CI/CD pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Attacks via ToolJet UI Components [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/injection_attacks_via_tooljet_ui_components__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious code or queries through ToolJet UI components that handle user input.
*   **4.1. JavaScript Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious JavaScript Code [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Action:** Inject malicious JavaScript code into ToolJet UI components (e.g., custom code widgets, event handlers) to execute arbitrary actions within the user's browser, potentially stealing credentials, data, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
        *   **Insight:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided inputs within ToolJet applications. Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate JavaScript injection risks.
*   **4.2. SQL Injection via ToolJet Data Connections [HIGH-RISK PATH]**
    *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious SQL Queries [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Action:** Inject malicious SQL queries via ToolJet data connections, especially when user-provided input is used in queries without proper parameterization or sanitization. This can lead to bypassing authentication, data extraction, modification, or command execution on the database server.
        *   **Insight:** Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases from ToolJet applications. Implement input validation and sanitization for user-provided data used in SQL queries. Follow secure coding practices for database interactions.
*   **4.3. API Injection via ToolJet API Connections**
    *   **Critical Node: Inject Malicious API Payloads [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Action:** Inject malicious payloads into API requests made by ToolJet applications, especially when user-provided input is used in API parameters or request bodies without proper validation or encoding. This can lead to bypassing authorization, data manipulation, or triggering vulnerabilities in the backend API.
        *   **Insight:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for user-provided data used in API requests. Follow secure API development practices. Use API gateways and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to protect backend APIs.

*   **Critical Node: Bypass Access Controls [CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Attack Action:** Exploit identified weaknesses in role-based access control (RBAC), permission checks, or authentication mechanisms to bypass access controls and gain unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.
    *   **Insight:** Implement robust and well-defined access control policies within ToolJet applications. Regularly review and audit access control configurations. Follow the principle of least privilege.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise ToolJet Infrastructure (If Self-Hosted) [HIGH-RISK PATH - if self-hosted]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_tooljet_infrastructure__if_self-hosted___high-risk_path_-_if_self-hosted_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Vulnerabilities in the infrastructure hosting ToolJet (servers, network, operating system). This path is only relevant if ToolJet is self-hosted.
*   **6.1. Exploit Underlying Infrastructure Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH - if self-hosted]**
    *   **Critical Node: Exploit Infrastructure Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Attack Action:** Exploit identified infrastructure vulnerabilities (e.g., in OS, web server, network services) to gain access to the ToolJet server or network.
        *   **Insight:** Secure the underlying infrastructure hosting ToolJet. Implement regular patching, hardening, and security monitoring.
