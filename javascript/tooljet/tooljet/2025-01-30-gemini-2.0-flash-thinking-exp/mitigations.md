# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tooljet/tooljet

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation in Code Editors](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_in_code_editors.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all Tooljet components (queries, transformers, Javascript/Python code blocks) where user-provided input is used.
    2.  For each component, implement input validation within Tooljet's code editor to ensure data conforms to expected formats and types. Utilize Tooljet's built-in validation features or custom Javascript/Python validation logic.
    3.  Sanitize user input within Tooljet's code editor to remove or encode potentially harmful characters before using it in code execution, database queries, or API calls. Leverage Tooljet's scripting capabilities for sanitization.
    4.  Apply sanitization and validation logic within Tooljet's server-side execution context to ensure consistent security enforcement.
    5.  Regularly review and update validation and sanitization rules within Tooljet as application requirements evolve and new attack vectors are discovered.

    *   Code Injection (High Severity) - Prevents malicious code from being injected through user input and executed within Tooljet's environment.
    *   SQL Injection (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from manipulating database queries generated within Tooljet to gain unauthorized access or modify data.
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts into Tooljet applications that are executed in other users' browsers via data displayed from Tooljet.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Injection: High Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk by preventing the execution of arbitrary code through input manipulation within Tooljet.
    *   SQL Injection: High Reduction -  Effectively eliminates SQL injection vulnerabilities when combined with parameterized queries within Tooljet.
