## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Known jQuery Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE: Leverage Known Exploit, Execute Arbitrary JavaScript]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_known_jquery_vulnerabilities__critical_node_leverage_known_exploit__execute__8ac6a4a6.md)

**Description:** This path involves an attacker identifying a specific version of jQuery used by the application and then exploiting a known vulnerability (CVE) associated with that version. Successful exploitation often leads to the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Leverage Known Exploit (e.g., CVE):** This is a critical step where the attacker utilizes a pre-existing exploit or develops one to take advantage of the identified vulnerability. Success at this stage directly leads to code execution.
    * **Execute Arbitrary JavaScript:** This is the ultimate critical node in this path. Achieving arbitrary JavaScript execution allows the attacker to perform a wide range of malicious actions, effectively compromising the application.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Identify Vulnerable jQuery Version:** Attackers can often determine the jQuery version by inspecting the source code, looking at included files, or analyzing HTTP requests.
    * **Leverage Known Exploit:** Publicly available exploits or the attacker's own crafted exploit are used to trigger the vulnerability.
    * **Execute Arbitrary JavaScript:** Once the vulnerability is exploited, the attacker injects and executes malicious JavaScript code.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Abuse jQuery's Features in Application Code - XSS [CRITICAL NODE: Inject Malicious Script via DOM Manipulation, Execute Malicious Script]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__abuse_jquery's_features_in_application_code_-_xss__critical_node_inject_malicious_sc_93f79e21.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting how the application uses jQuery's DOM manipulation features. If the application inserts user-controlled data into the HTML document without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the user's browser (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Inject Malicious Script via DOM Manipulation:** This is the critical point where the attacker's malicious payload is introduced into the web page through jQuery's DOM manipulation functions.
    * **Execute Malicious Script (XSS):** This is the critical outcome where the injected script runs in the user's browser, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Application Uses jQuery to Insert User-Controlled Data into DOM:** The application uses functions like `.html()`, `.append()`, etc., to insert data that originates from user input or other external sources.
    * **Data is Not Properly Sanitized/Escaped:** The application fails to sanitize or escape the user-controlled data before inserting it into the DOM, allowing HTML and JavaScript code to be interpreted by the browser.
    * **Execute Malicious Script (XSS):** The browser executes the injected malicious script, leading to compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [*** HIGH-RISK PATH *** Exploit Vulnerabilities in jQuery Plugins [CRITICAL NODE: Leverage Plugin Vulnerability, Execute Arbitrary JavaScript or Malicious Actions]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_jquery_plugins__critical_node_leverage_plugin_vulnerabili_b3fe9012.md)

**Description:** This path targets vulnerabilities within third-party jQuery plugins used by the application. If a plugin has a security flaw, an attacker can exploit it to execute arbitrary JavaScript or perform other malicious actions.
* **Critical Nodes:**
    * **Leverage Plugin Vulnerability:** This is the critical step where the attacker exploits a security flaw in a jQuery plugin.
    * **Execute Arbitrary JavaScript or Malicious Actions:** Successful exploitation of a plugin vulnerability often leads to the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript or trigger other malicious functionalities provided by the plugin.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Identify Vulnerable Plugin:** Attackers can identify the plugins used by inspecting the source code or network requests. They then search for known vulnerabilities in those specific plugin versions.
    * **Leverage Plugin Vulnerability:** Publicly available exploits or custom-developed exploits are used to target the identified vulnerability.
    * **Execute Arbitrary JavaScript or Malicious Actions:** The attacker leverages the plugin vulnerability to execute malicious code or trigger unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise CDN Serving jQuery](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_cdn_serving_jquery.md)

**Description:** While not a "path" in the same sequential sense, compromising the Content Delivery Network (CDN) that serves the jQuery library to the application is a critical point of failure. If the CDN is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious code into the jQuery file served to numerous applications, leading to widespread compromise.
* **Critical Node:**
    * **Compromise CDN Serving jQuery:** This single point of compromise has a potentially catastrophic impact due to the widespread use of CDNs for serving libraries like jQuery.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Compromise CDN Infrastructure:** This would involve sophisticated attacks targeting the CDN provider's infrastructure.
    * **Inject Malicious Code into jQuery Served via CDN:** Once the CDN is compromised, the attacker modifies the jQuery file to include malicious code. This code is then automatically loaded by all applications using that CDN link.
