Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve jQuery, with high and critical severity:

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via DOM Manipulation**
    * **Description:**  Malicious scripts are injected into a website through the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM).
    * **How jQuery Contributes:** jQuery's powerful DOM manipulation methods like `html()`, `append()`, `prepend()`, `after()`, `before()`, and `attr()` can be exploited if used with unsanitized user-controlled data. These methods directly insert content into the DOM, and if that content contains `<script>` tags or event handlers with malicious JavaScript, it will be executed.
    * **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Vulnerable code: Directly inserting user input
        let userInput = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('name');
        $('#greeting').html('Hello, ' + userInput);

        // If userInput is "<script>alert('XSS');</script>", this will execute.
        ```
    * **Impact:**  Full compromise of the user's session, including stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, defacing the website, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Use secure coding practices:** Sanitize user input on the server-side before rendering it on the client-side.
        * **Utilize browser APIs for safe DOM manipulation where possible:** For example, use `textContent` instead of `html()` when inserting plain text.
        * **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, reducing the impact of injected scripts.
        * **Encode output:** Encode data before inserting it into the DOM to prevent the browser from interpreting it as executable code.

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via AJAX Handling**
    * **Description:**  Malicious scripts are injected through the handling of data received from asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) requests.
    * **How jQuery Contributes:** jQuery's AJAX methods (`$.ajax()`, `$.get()`, `$.post()`, etc.) are commonly used to fetch data from servers. If the response data is directly inserted into the DOM using methods like `html()` without proper sanitization, it can lead to XSS.
    * **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Vulnerable code: Directly inserting AJAX response
        $.get('/api/userData', function(data) {
            $('#user-info').html(data.name + ' - ' + data.description);
        });

        // If data.description contains "<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS\")'>", this will execute.
        ```
    * **Impact:** Similar to DOM manipulation XSS, leading to session compromise, redirection, website defacement, and actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Sanitize AJAX responses:** Sanitize data received from AJAX requests on the server-side before sending it to the client.
        * **Encode output:** Encode the data on the client-side before inserting it into the DOM.
        * **Use templating engines with auto-escaping:** Many templating engines automatically escape output, reducing the risk of XSS.
        * **Implement CSP:**  Helps mitigate the impact of injected scripts.
