# BUSINESS POSTURE

The jQuery project aims to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax interactions for web developers. It provides a cross-browser compatible JavaScript library that streamlines common web development tasks, allowing developers to write less code and achieve more.

Business priorities and goals:
- Simplify web development: jQuery reduces the complexity of JavaScript development, making it easier and faster to build interactive web pages.
- Cross-browser compatibility: jQuery abstracts away browser differences, ensuring consistent behavior across various browsers.
- Improve developer productivity: By providing a concise and powerful API, jQuery enhances developer efficiency.
- Enhance web application interactivity: jQuery enables developers to easily add dynamic and interactive features to web applications.
- Maintain a widely used and trusted library: jQuery has a long history and a large community, maintaining its reputation as a reliable and well-supported library is crucial.

Most important business risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in jQuery itself: If vulnerabilities are discovered in jQuery, they can affect a vast number of websites that rely on it. This could lead to widespread security breaches.
- Dependency risk: Projects relying heavily on jQuery might face challenges if jQuery development slows down or if a better alternative emerges, requiring significant refactoring.
- Performance overhead: While jQuery simplifies development, it can introduce a performance overhead compared to vanilla JavaScript, especially if not used efficiently.
- Compatibility issues with modern web standards: As web standards evolve, jQuery might require continuous updates to remain compatible and relevant.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Publicly accessible GitHub repository allows for community review and contribution, potentially leading to faster identification and resolution of security issues. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
- security control: Use of standard build tools and processes (assumed based on typical JavaScript library development). (Implemented: Build process - details unknown without deeper investigation)
- security control: Regular releases and updates, addressing reported issues including security vulnerabilities. (Observed: Release history on GitHub)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Inherent risk of using any third-party library, including potential undiscovered vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Risk of developers misusing jQuery API in ways that introduce security vulnerabilities in their applications.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in jQuery and its dependencies during development and build processes.
- security control: Encourage and provide guidelines for secure usage of jQuery API to prevent common web application vulnerabilities like XSS.
- security control: Promote regular updates of jQuery library in projects to patch known security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Conduct security code reviews of jQuery codebase and contributions to identify potential security flaws proactively.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to jQuery library itself, as it's a client-side library. Authentication is handled by the web applications using jQuery.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to jQuery library itself. Authorization is handled by the web applications using jQuery.
- Input validation: While jQuery itself doesn't perform input validation, applications using jQuery must implement robust input validation to prevent vulnerabilities like XSS. jQuery's DOM manipulation functions should be used carefully to avoid introducing XSS when handling user inputs.
- Cryptography: jQuery doesn't provide cryptographic functionalities. If cryptography is needed, web applications using jQuery should rely on browser built-in APIs or other dedicated libraries. Secure communication (HTTPS) is essential for web applications using jQuery to protect data in transit.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write and modify jQuery source code and commit changes to the GitHub repository.
2. Source Code (GitHub): GitHub repository hosts the jQuery source code and acts as the version control system.
3. Build System (e.g., Node.js, Grunt): An automated build system, likely using tools like Node.js and Grunt (based on historical jQuery build processes), is triggered by code changes in GitHub.
4. Automated Security Checks (SAST, Linters): During the build process, automated security checks are performed. This includes Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code and linters to enforce code quality and security best practices.
5. Distribution Files (jquery.js, jquery.min.js): If security checks pass and the build is successful, the build system generates distribution files, including the full and minified versions of jquery.js.
6. CDN / npm / Download Site: The distribution files are then published to CDNs (for CDN delivery), npm (for package managers), and the jQuery website (for direct download).

Build Process Security Controls:
- security control: Version control (GitHub) to track changes and manage code history. (Implemented: GitHub)
- security control: Automated build process to ensure consistent and repeatable builds. (Implemented: Assumed - details unknown without deeper investigation)
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities. (Recommended)
- security control: Code linters to enforce coding standards and security best practices. (Recommended)
- security control: Dependency scanning to detect vulnerabilities in build dependencies. (Recommended)
- security control: Secure build environment to protect the build process from tampering. (Recommended)
- security control: Code signing of distribution files to ensure integrity and authenticity. (Recommended)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- The primary business process is the development and delivery of the jQuery library itself, ensuring its availability, integrity, and security for web developers worldwide.
- Indirectly, we are protecting the functionality and security of countless web applications that rely on jQuery.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- jQuery source code: Sensitive as it represents the intellectual property and the core functionality of the library. Unauthorized access or modification could lead to malicious versions of jQuery being distributed.
- Build artifacts (jquery.js, jquery.min.js): Sensitive as these are the final distributable files. Integrity is paramount to prevent supply chain attacks where malicious code is injected into the library.
- Project infrastructure (build systems, CDN origin servers): Sensitive as compromise could lead to the distribution of malicious jQuery versions.

Data sensitivity levels:
- jQuery source code: High - Intellectual Property, Security Critical
- Build artifacts: Critical - Integrity and Availability are paramount for millions of websites.
- Project infrastructure: High - Security and Availability of the library depend on it.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific SAST and linting tools are currently used in the jQuery build process?
- Is there a formal security review process for code contributions to jQuery?
- Are distribution files (jquery.js, jquery.min.js) currently signed to ensure integrity?
- What dependency scanning is in place for jQuery's build dependencies?
- What security measures are in place to protect the build environment itself?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: jQuery project prioritizes ease of use and cross-browser compatibility for web developers. The project aims to maintain its position as a widely used and trusted library.
- SECURITY POSTURE: jQuery project follows standard open-source development practices. Security is considered but might not be formally documented or rigorously enforced in all areas. There is an understanding of the inherent risks of using third-party libraries.
- DESIGN: jQuery library is primarily distributed via CDNs and direct downloads. The build process is automated and involves standard JavaScript build tools.
