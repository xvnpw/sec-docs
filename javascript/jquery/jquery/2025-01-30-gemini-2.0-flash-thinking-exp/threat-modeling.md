# Threat Model Analysis for jquery/jquery

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known jQuery Vulnerability](./threats/exploitation_of_known_jquery_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a publicly known, high or critical severity security vulnerability present in the specific version of the jQuery library used by the application. This is achieved by crafting malicious inputs or requests that trigger the vulnerability.  For example, known vulnerabilities in older jQuery versions have allowed for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through selector manipulation or event handling exploits.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or other malicious actions. In some cases, vulnerabilities could potentially lead to Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **jQuery Component Affected:** Core jQuery library (specific version). Vulnerabilities reside within the core code and can affect various modules depending on the specific CVE.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on exploitability and specific vulnerability details).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate jQuery Updates:**  Prioritize and immediately update jQuery to the latest stable version, especially when security advisories are released.
    *   **Proactive Vulnerability Monitoring:** Regularly monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for jQuery (e.g., CVE databases, jQuery security blogs).
    *   **Dependency Scanning in CI/CD:** Integrate automated dependency scanning tools into the CI/CD pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities in jQuery before deployment.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI) for CDN Loading:**  Utilize SRI hashes when loading jQuery from Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to guarantee the integrity of the loaded file and prevent loading of potentially compromised versions.

## Threat: [DOM-based XSS via Insecure `.html()` Usage](./threats/dom-based_xss_via_insecure___html____usage.md)

*   **Description:** Developers unsafely use the jQuery `.html()` function (or similar DOM manipulation functions like `.append()`, `.prepend()`, etc.) with user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized. An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within this user input. When jQuery processes this input with `.html()`, the injected script is executed in the user's browser as part of the DOM.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session, enabling session hijacking, sensitive data theft, website defacement, and unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
*   **jQuery Component Affected:**  `.html()` function (and related DOM manipulation functions like `.append()`, `.prepend()`, `.after()`, `.before()`). The vulnerability arises from the *unsafe usage* of these jQuery functions with unsanitized input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High. DOM XSS via `.html()` is a common and easily exploitable vulnerability with significant impact.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Mandatory and rigorous sanitization and encoding of all user-provided input *before* using it with jQuery's DOM manipulation functions like `.html()`. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for HTML context).
    *   **Prefer `.text()` for Text Display:**  Favor using jQuery's `.text()` function instead of `.html()` when displaying user-provided text content. `.text()` automatically performs HTML entity encoding, preventing XSS in text contexts.
    *   **Avoid `.html()` with User Input (if possible):**  Minimize or eliminate the use of `.html()` and similar functions when dealing with user-generated content. Explore alternative approaches that avoid direct HTML injection.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a robust Content Security Policy to significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by controlling the resources the browser is allowed to load and execute.

## Threat: [DOM-based XSS via Insecure `.attr()`/`.prop()` Usage with User Input](./threats/dom-based_xss_via_insecure___attr_____prop____usage_with_user_input.md)

*   **Description:** Developers unsafely use jQuery's `.attr()` or `.prop()` functions to set HTML attributes or properties based on unsanitized user-controlled input. Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code, particularly into attributes that can execute JavaScript, such as `href` (in `<a>` tags), `src` (in `<img>` tags), or event handler attributes (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`).
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). When the manipulated HTML element is processed by the browser (e.g., link clicked, image loaded), the injected JavaScript code is executed, leading to the same severe impacts as other XSS vulnerabilities: session hijacking, data theft, etc.
*   **jQuery Component Affected:** `.attr()` and `.prop()` functions. The vulnerability stems from the insecure application of these functions with untrusted user input.
*   **Risk Severity:** High. Similar to `.html()` XSS, this is a highly exploitable and impactful vulnerability.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate user input before using it to set attributes or properties with `.attr()` or `.prop()`. Implement strict validation rules and context-appropriate encoding.
    *   **Attribute Allowlisting and Blacklisting:** Define strict allowlists of attributes that can be dynamically modified based on user input. Blacklist attributes known to be dangerous (e.g., event handlers, `javascript:` URLs in `href`).
    *   **Secure Attribute Setting Methods:** Explore safer alternatives to dynamically setting attributes with user input if possible.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** CSP remains a crucial mitigation to limit the damage from successful XSS attacks, including those via attribute manipulation.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attack via Compromised jQuery Package](./threats/dependency_confusionsupply_chain_attack_via_compromised_jquery_package.md)

*   **Description:** If jQuery is installed using a package manager (like npm, yarn), there is a critical risk of dependency confusion or a supply chain attack. An attacker could introduce a malicious package with a name similar to or intended to replace the legitimate jQuery package. If developers mistakenly install this malicious package or if the package registry itself is compromised, the application could unknowingly use a backdoored or malicious jQuery library.
*   **Impact:** Critical Application Compromise. A compromised jQuery package can inject arbitrary malicious code into the application's codebase. This can lead to complete application takeover, sensitive data exfiltration, installation of backdoors, malware distribution to users, and other catastrophic security breaches.
*   **jQuery Component Affected:** The entire jQuery library is replaced or augmented by a malicious version. This affects all parts of the application relying on jQuery.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical. Supply chain attacks targeting core dependencies like jQuery are extremely dangerous and can have widespread impact.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Utilize Reputable Package Registries Only:**  Strictly use well-established and reputable package registries (e.g., npmjs.com for npm, yarnpkg.com for yarn). Avoid using untrusted or unofficial registries.
    *   **Package Integrity Verification:**  Whenever possible, verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or digital signatures provided by the official jQuery project or package registry.
    *   **Comprehensive Dependency Scanning:** Implement robust dependency scanning tools that actively monitor for known vulnerabilities and suspicious packages in project dependencies, including jQuery.
    *   **Lock Files for Dependency Integrity:**  Mandatory use of lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions across environments and prevent unexpected or malicious dependency updates.
    *   **Regular Security Audits of Dependencies:** Conduct periodic security audits of all project dependencies, including jQuery, to verify their source, integrity, and identify any potential security risks.
