### 2. Deep Analysis

#### 2.1 Vulnerability Explanation

Prototype pollution occurs when an attacker can modify the properties of `Object.prototype`.  In JavaScript, all objects inherit properties from `Object.prototype`.  If an attacker can add or modify properties on this base prototype, those changes will affect *all* objects in the application, unless the object has its own property that overrides the prototype's property.

jQuery's `$.extend(true, target, source)` performs a *deep* copy, recursively merging properties from the `source` object into the `target` object.  The vulnerability arises because, prior to being patched, `$.extend()` did not properly handle specially crafted property names like `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` within the `source` object.

Here's a breakdown:

1.  **Attacker-Controlled Input:** The attacker provides a JSON payload (or other data structure) that is used as the `source` object in `$.extend(true, {}, userInput)`.

2.  **`__proto__` Injection:** The payload includes a key named `__proto__` (or `constructor.prototype` in some older, less common cases).  The value associated with `__proto__` is an object containing properties the attacker wants to inject into `Object.prototype`.

    ```javascript
    // Example malicious payload:
    const maliciousPayload = JSON.parse('{ "__proto__": { "polluted": true } }');
    ```

3.  **Deep Copy Traversal:**  `$.extend()` recursively traverses the `source` object.  When it encounters the `__proto__` key, it *does not* treat it as a regular property name.  Instead, it accesses the prototype of the *target* object (which, in the case of an empty target `{}` is `Object.prototype`).

4.  **Prototype Modification:**  `$.extend()` then copies the properties from the attacker's `__proto__` object *onto* `Object.prototype`.

5.  **Global Impact:**  Now, *every* object in the application (unless it has its own "polluted" property) will have a `polluted` property with the value `true`.

#### 2.2 Code Examples

**Vulnerable Code:**

```javascript
// Assume 'userInput' comes from an untrusted source (e.g., a form, URL parameter, etc.)
const userInput = JSON.parse(req.body.data); // Example: req.body.data = '{ "__proto__": { "isAdmin": true } }'

const config = $.extend(true, {}, userInput); // Deep copy into an empty object

// ... later in the code ...
if (config.isAdmin) {
  // Grant administrative privileges - VULNERABLE!
  console.log("Granting admin access...");
}
```

**Exploit Payload:**

```json
{
  "__proto__": {
    "isAdmin": true
  }
}
```

**Demonstration of Pollution:**

```javascript
const maliciousPayload = JSON.parse('{ "__proto__": { "polluted": true } }');
$.extend(true, {}, maliciousPayload);

const obj = {};
console.log(obj.polluted); // Output: true (even though 'obj' was created *after* the pollution)

const arr = [];
console.log(arr.polluted); // Output: true (arrays are also affected)
```

#### 2.3 Exploitation Scenarios

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can overwrite critical properties used by the application, causing it to crash or behave unexpectedly.  For example, overwriting methods on `Object.prototype` like `toString` or `hasOwnProperty` can lead to widespread errors.

    *   **Payload:** `{"__proto__": {"toString": 123}}`
    *   **Result:**  Any subsequent call to `toString()` on any object will likely result in a `TypeError`.

*   **Property Injection/Modification:** The attacker can inject properties that influence application logic.  This is the most common and dangerous scenario, as demonstrated in the "isAdmin" example above.  The attacker targets properties that control access, configuration, or data validation.

*   **Potential Code Execution (Indirect):**  While prototype pollution itself doesn't *directly* execute code, it can create conditions that lead to code execution.  This often involves a combination of factors:

    *   **Gadget Chains:**  The attacker might pollute a property that is later used in a way that triggers code execution.  For example, if a library uses a polluted property as a callback function, the attacker could inject a malicious function.
    *   **Template Engines:**  If a polluted property is used within a template (e.g., Handlebars, Mustache), it could lead to code injection within the template rendering process.
    *   **Dynamic Property Access:** If the application uses bracket notation (`object[pollutedProperty]`) to access properties, and `pollutedProperty` is controlled by the attacker, this could lead to unexpected behavior or even code execution if the accessed property is a function.

#### 2.4 Mitigation Analysis

*   **1. Update jQuery:**  This is the *most crucial* and straightforward mitigation.  jQuery versions 3.5.0 and later include a fix for this vulnerability.  The fix involves checking for and ignoring the `__proto__` property during the deep copy process.  **Always prioritize updating to the latest stable version.**

    *   **Pros:**  Simple, effective, addresses the root cause.
    *   **Cons:**  May require testing to ensure compatibility with existing code.
    *   **Best Practice:**  Use a package manager (npm, yarn) to manage jQuery and keep it up-to-date.  Regularly check for security updates.

*   **2. Avoid Deep Cloning Untrusted Input:**  The best defense is to avoid using `$.extend(true, ...)` with data directly from user input.  If you don't need a deep copy, use a shallow copy (`$.extend({}, userInput)`) or `Object.assign({}, userInput)`.  Shallow copies do *not* recursively traverse the object, so they are not vulnerable to this specific prototype pollution attack.

    *   **Pros:**  Prevents the vulnerability entirely.
    *   **Cons:**  May require refactoring if deep cloning is genuinely needed.
    *   **Best Practice:**  Carefully analyze your code to determine if deep cloning is truly necessary.  Often, a shallow copy or a more targeted approach is sufficient.

*   **3. Sanitize Input:**  If you *must* use deep cloning with potentially untrusted input, sanitize the input to remove the dangerous properties (`__proto__`, `constructor`, `prototype`).  This can be done recursively.

    ```javascript
    function sanitizeInput(obj) {
      if (typeof obj !== 'object' || obj === null) {
        return obj;
      }

      if (Array.isArray(obj)) {
        return obj.map(sanitizeInput);
      }

      const sanitized = {};
      for (const key in obj) {
        if (obj.hasOwnProperty(key) && key !== '__proto__' && key !== 'constructor' && key !== 'prototype') {
          sanitized[key] = sanitizeInput(obj[key]);
        }
      }
      return sanitized;
    }

    const userInput = JSON.parse(req.body.data);
    const sanitizedInput = sanitizeInput(userInput);
    const config = $.extend(true, {}, sanitizedInput);
    ```

    *   **Pros:**  Allows deep cloning while mitigating the vulnerability.
    *   **Cons:**  Can be complex to implement correctly, especially for deeply nested objects.  Performance overhead.  Risk of overlooking edge cases.
    *   **Best Practice:**  Use a well-tested sanitization library if possible.  Thoroughly test your sanitization function with various malicious payloads.

*   **4. Use a Safer Cloning Library:**  Consider using a dedicated deep cloning library that is specifically designed to prevent prototype pollution.  Libraries like `lodash.cloneDeep` are generally safer alternatives.

    ```javascript
    const _ = require('lodash');

    const userInput = JSON.parse(req.body.data);
    const config = _.cloneDeep(userInput); // Use lodash's cloneDeep
    ```

    *   **Pros:**  Provides a robust and well-tested solution.
    *   **Cons:**  Adds an external dependency.
    *   **Best Practice:**  Choose a reputable and actively maintained library.

*   **5. Input Validation (Strict):** Implement strict input validation to ensure that the data received from the user conforms to an expected schema.  This can help prevent unexpected properties from being included in the input.  Use a validation library like `ajv` or `joi`.

    ```javascript
    const Ajv = require('ajv');
    const ajv = new Ajv();

    const schema = {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        name: { type: 'string' },
        age: { type: 'integer' },
      },
      additionalProperties: false, // Important: Disallow extra properties
    };

    const validate = ajv.compile(schema);
    const data = JSON.parse(req.body.data);

    if (!validate(data)) {
      console.error(validate.errors);
      // Handle validation errors
    } else {
      const config = $.extend(true, {}, data); // Now safer due to validation
    }
    ```

    *   **Pros:**  Reduces the attack surface by limiting the possible values of user input.
    *   **Cons:**  Requires defining a schema for all input data.  May not catch all prototype pollution attempts if the schema is not strict enough.
    *   **Best Practice:**  Use `additionalProperties: false` in your schema to prevent unexpected properties.

#### 2.5 Tooling and Detection

*   **Static Analysis Tools:**  Linters like ESLint with security plugins (e.g., `eslint-plugin-security`) can often detect potentially vulnerable code patterns.  Configure your linter to flag uses of `$.extend(true, ...)` with potentially untrusted input.

*   **Dynamic Analysis Tools:**  Web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) can be used to test for prototype pollution vulnerabilities.  These tools can send crafted payloads to your application and analyze the responses for signs of successful pollution.

*   **Code Review:**  Manual code review is crucial.  Train developers to recognize and avoid vulnerable code patterns.

* **Runtime protection:** Use a solution that freezes the Object.prototype.
    ```javascript
    Object.freeze(Object.prototype);
    ```
    *   **Pros:** Prevents any modification of Object.prototype.
    *   **Cons:** Can break the application if it relies on modifying Object.prototype.

#### 2.6 False Positives/Negatives

*   **False Positives (Sanitization):**  A sanitization function might incorrectly remove legitimate properties that happen to have names similar to `__proto__` or `constructor`.  This is unlikely but possible.

*   **False Negatives (Sanitization):**  A poorly written sanitization function might miss edge cases or be bypassed by cleverly crafted payloads.  For example, using a regular expression that is not comprehensive enough.

*   **False Negatives (Input Validation):**  If the input validation schema is not strict enough, an attacker might still be able to inject malicious properties.

*   **False Negatives (Update jQuery):** If you are using a very old version of jQuery and have heavily modified it, simply updating might not be sufficient. You need to carefully review the changes and ensure the fix is applied correctly.

* **False Positives (Runtime protection):** Freezing Object.prototype can break the application if it relies on modifying Object.prototype.

### 3. Conclusion

Prototype pollution via `$.extend(true, ...)` is a serious vulnerability that can have significant consequences.  The best mitigation is to **update jQuery to the latest version**.  If updating is not immediately feasible, a combination of other mitigation strategies, such as avoiding deep cloning of untrusted input, sanitizing input, using safer cloning libraries, and implementing strict input validation, should be employed.  Regular security audits, code reviews, and the use of static and dynamic analysis tools are essential for identifying and preventing this vulnerability.  Developers must be educated about the risks of prototype pollution and the importance of secure coding practices.
