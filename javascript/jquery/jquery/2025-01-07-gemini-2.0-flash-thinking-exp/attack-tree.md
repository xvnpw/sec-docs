## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via jQuery (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_jquery__critical_node_.md)

This represents the overarching goal of the attacker and serves as the entry point for all potential compromise paths related to jQuery.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via jQuery (High-Risk Path) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_jquery__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This category encompasses attacks where malicious scripts are injected into web pages viewed by other users, leveraging jQuery's functionalities. It's a high-risk area due to the potential for session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script via DOM Manipulation (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_script_via_dom_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers exploit the use of user-controlled data within jQuery's DOM manipulation functions (like `.html()`, `.append()`, `.prepend()`). If this data is not properly sanitized, malicious scripts can be injected and executed in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Application Uses User-Controlled Data in jQuery DOM Manipulation Functions (.html(), .append(), etc.) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/target_application_uses_user-controlled_data_in_jquery_dom_manipulation_functions___html_____append__1d0fb4ec.md)

This node highlights a common programming error where data originating from user input or external sources is directly used to modify the structure of the web page using jQuery's DOM manipulation methods.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data is Not Properly Sanitized (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/data_is_not_properly_sanitized__critical_node_.md)

This critical flaw refers to the absence or inadequacy of measures to remove or neutralize potentially harmful code (like JavaScript) from user-provided data before using it in DOM manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Vulnerabilities in jQuery Plugins (High-Risk Path) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_vulnerabilities_in_jquery_plugins__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Applications often extend jQuery's functionality with third-party plugins. These plugins can contain their own vulnerabilities, which attackers can exploit to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Uses a Vulnerable jQuery Plugin (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/application_uses_a_vulnerable_jquery_plugin__critical_node_.md)

This node indicates the presence of a jQuery plugin with known security flaws within the application's codebase.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known jQuery Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_jquery_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

jQuery, like any software, has had its share of security vulnerabilities discovered over time. Using an outdated version of jQuery exposes the application to these known exploits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Target Application Uses an Outdated or Vulnerable Version of jQuery (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/target_application_uses_an_outdated_or_vulnerable_version_of_jquery__critical_node_.md)

This node represents the critical vulnerability of running an older version of the jQuery library that contains known security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise jQuery Source or Delivery (High-Risk Path) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_jquery_source_or_delivery__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This path involves attackers compromising the actual jQuery file that the application loads. If successful, they can inject malicious code that will execute on every page loading the compromised file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack on CDN Delivery (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attack_on_cdn_delivery__high-risk_path_.md)

If the application loads jQuery from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) over an insecure connection (HTTP or a misconfigured HTTPS), an attacker can intercept the request and replace the legitimate jQuery file with a malicious one.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Loads jQuery from a CDN over HTTP (or insecure HTTPS configuration) (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/application_loads_jquery_from_a_cdn_over_http__or_insecure_https_configuration___critical_node_.md)

This node highlights the risky practice of loading jQuery over an unencrypted connection, making it susceptible to interception and modification.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise of Self-Hosted jQuery File (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_of_self-hosted_jquery_file__high-risk_path_.md)

If the application hosts the jQuery file on its own server, an attacker who gains access to the server can replace the legitimate file with a malicious version.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker Gains Access to the Server Hosting the jQuery File (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_gains_access_to_the_server_hosting_the_jquery_file__critical_node_.md)

This node represents a significant security breach where an attacker manages to gain unauthorized access to the server where the application's files, including the jQuery library, are stored.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via jQuery AJAX (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__via_jquery_ajax__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers can leverage jQuery's AJAX functionality to trick authenticated users into making unintended requests on the application, if proper CSRF protections are not in place.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application Does Not Implement Proper CSRF Protections (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/application_does_not_implement_proper_csrf_protections__critical_node_.md)

This node indicates the absence of security measures (like anti-CSRF tokens) to prevent attackers from forging requests on behalf of legitimate users.
