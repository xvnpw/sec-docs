### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Path Traversal and potentially Client-Side Injection via Custom SVG Icons
- Description:
    1. A user can configure custom file, folder, or language icon associations in VS Code settings for the Material Icon Theme extension.
    2. In the settings, they can specify a path to a custom SVG icon file.
    3. If the extension doesn't properly validate or sanitize the provided path, an attacker could potentially use path traversal techniques (e.g., `../../`) to access files outside the intended directory.
    4. Furthermore, if VS Code renders the SVG content without proper sanitization, a malicious SVG file could contain embedded scripts that execute in the context of VS Code, potentially leading to client-side injection or other security issues.
- Impact:
    - An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files on the user's system if path traversal is successful.
    - If client-side injection is possible, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the VS Code environment, leading to information disclosure, modification of VS Code settings, or other malicious actions within the VS Code context.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - Unknown. Based on the provided documentation, there is no mention of path validation or SVG sanitization for custom icons. It is assumed that no mitigations are currently implemented within the project itself for this specific vulnerability related to custom icon paths and SVG content.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement robust path validation to ensure that user-provided paths for custom SVG icons are restricted to a safe and intended directory within the extension's context. Prevent path traversal attempts using techniques like canonicalization and path prefix checking.
    - Implement SVG sanitization to remove any potentially malicious scripts or code embedded within custom SVG files before they are rendered by VS Code. Utilize a trusted SVG sanitization library to parse and clean the SVG content.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the Material Icon Theme extension installed in VS Code.
    - An attacker needs to convince the user to add a malicious custom icon association to their VS Code settings. This could be achieved through social engineering, by providing a malicious workspace configuration file, or by other means of tricking the user into manually adding the malicious configuration.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Source code is not provided, so detailed analysis is not possible.
    - Based on the description in `/code/README.md`, the vulnerability likely exists in the code that handles custom icon associations defined in user settings (e.g., `"material-icon-theme.files.associations"`).
    - The code should be examined to see how it processes the paths provided in these settings when loading custom SVG icons.
    - Specifically, look for:
        - Lack of path validation before loading SVG files.
        - Lack of SVG sanitization before rendering SVG content in VS Code.
    - Without access to the source code, a precise step-by-step analysis is not feasible. Further investigation requires access to the codebase to pinpoint the vulnerable code sections.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Prepare a malicious SVG file named `malicious.svg` with the following content to test for client-side injection:
       ```xml
       <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
         <script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>
       </svg>
       ```
    2. Choose a location to place this `malicious.svg` file on your system. For example, your user home directory `/home/user/malicious.svg`.
    3. Open VS Code and navigate to `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` (or `Code` > `Settings` > `Settings` on macOS).
    4. In the Settings editor, switch to the `User` settings scope to ensure the custom setting applies globally or to your current workspace.
    5. Search for "Material Icon Theme" to find the extension's settings.
    6. Locate or manually add the setting `material-icon-theme.files.associations` and click "Edit in settings.json".
    7. Add a custom file association to your `settings.json` file that points to the `malicious.svg` file using a path traversal sequence. For example, if you placed `malicious.svg` in your home directory and the expected icon directory is within `.vscode/extensions`, you might use a path like this (adjust the number of `../` based on the actual directory structure):
       ```json
       "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
           "test.file": "../../malicious"
       }
       ```
       - Note: The path `../../malicious` is relative to the extension's expected location for icons, likely within the `dist` folder of the extension in your `.vscode/extensions` directory. You may need to adjust the number of `../` to correctly reach your `malicious.svg` file. If you are unsure of the relative path, you can try placing `malicious.svg` directly in your home directory and use `"~"` or an absolute path if VS Code settings allow it, though relative path traversal is the primary vulnerability being tested.
    8. Create a new file named `test.file` in any folder opened in VS Code.
    9. Observe if an alert dialog box appears with the message 'XSS Vulnerability!'. If it does, this confirms client-side injection vulnerability.
    10. To test for path traversal and arbitrary file read (which might be harder to directly observe in VS Code UI without code execution in the extension), you would need to examine the extension's behavior more deeply, possibly through debugging if source code were available, or by observing network requests or file system access if the extension's actions were externally visible. A more direct file read test would require modifying the extension code to log or display the content of a file accessed via a potentially traversed path. Since direct file system access observation from an external attacker perspective within VS Code is limited, the XSS test is more practical as an initial validation step based on the provided information.
