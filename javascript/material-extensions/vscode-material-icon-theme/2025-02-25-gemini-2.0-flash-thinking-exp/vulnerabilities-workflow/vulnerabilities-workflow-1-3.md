### Vulnerability List:

* Vulnerability Name: Local File Access via Custom SVG Icons
* Description:
    1. Attacker crafts a malicious VS Code settings.json file.
    2. The malicious settings.json file contains a custom file association within `"material-icon-theme.files.associations"`.
    3. The file association is configured to use a custom SVG icon.
    4. The path to the custom SVG icon is set to a path that attempts to traverse outside the allowed `extensions` directory of the `.vscode` folder in the user directory and points to a sensitive file on the local file system. For example: `"../../../../sensitiveFile"`.
    5. The victim installs and activates the "Material Icon Theme" extension in VS Code.
    6. The victim opens a workspace that includes or is configured to use the malicious settings.json, or the attacker directly modifies the victim's user settings.
    7. When VS Code processes the settings and attempts to display icons, the "Material Icon Theme" extension, due to insufficient path validation, attempts to access the file specified by the attacker-controlled path.
* Impact:
    An attacker can potentially achieve local file access on the victim's machine. By crafting malicious settings, the attacker can induce the "Material Icon Theme" extension to attempt to read arbitrary files outside of the intended VS Code workspace and extension directories. While this may not directly lead to remote code execution or immediate data exfiltration, it can expose sensitive information about the file system, potentially reveal file contents if processed further by the extension, and serve as a stepping stone for more complex attacks.
* Vulnerability Rank: High
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    The documentation states a restriction: "However, the restriction applies that the directory in which the custom icons are located must be within the `extensions` directory of the `.vscode` folder in the user directory." This suggests an intended mitigation to limit custom icon paths. However, based on the description and lack of explicit code analysis, it's unclear if this mitigation is effectively implemented and enforced in the codebase to prevent path traversal.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Strict input validation and sanitization of user-provided file paths for custom icons in settings.json.
    - Implementation of path normalization to resolve relative paths and prevent directory traversal attempts (e.g., using a secure path joining function that resolves paths relative to a defined allowed base directory and rejects paths that escape this base).
    - Robust enforcement mechanism to ensure that the extension strictly restricts custom icon file access to within the intended `extensions` directory and prevents any file system operations outside of it.
* Preconditions:
    - The victim has the "Material Icon Theme" extension installed and activated in VS Code.
    - The attacker can influence the victim's VS Code user settings or workspace settings. This could be achieved through social engineering (e.g., sending a malicious workspace configuration), by compromising a shared workspace, or by other methods that allow modification of VS Code settings.
* Source Code Analysis:
    To perform a detailed source code analysis, we would need to examine the project's codebase. Key areas to investigate include:
    1. **Settings Processing:** Locate the code responsible for reading and processing VS Code settings, specifically settings related to `"material-icon-theme.files.associations"` and custom icon paths.
    2. **Path Construction:** Identify how the extension constructs the full file paths for custom SVG icons based on the user-provided paths from settings.
    3. **File System Access:** Pinpoint the code that performs file system operations to load the custom SVG icon files.
    4. **Path Validation/Sanitization:** Analyze if there are any validation or sanitization steps applied to the user-provided file paths before attempting to access the file system. Check for path normalization, checks against allowed directories, or any other security measures.
    5. **Error Handling:** Examine how the extension handles errors during file access. Insufficient error handling might inadvertently reveal information about file existence or permissions.

    Without access to the live codebase and stepping through the execution, a precise step-by-step code analysis to trigger the vulnerability is not possible. However, the vulnerability hinges on the absence of proper path validation when handling custom SVG icon paths from user settings.

* Security Test Case:
    1. Set up a test environment with VS Code and the "Material Icon Theme" extension installed.
    2. Create a dummy sensitive file on your local file system for testing purposes (e.g., `sensitive-test-file.txt`) at a location you want to attempt to access from VS Code (e.g., your user home directory).
    3. Open VS Code user settings (settings.json).
    4. Add the following configuration to your settings.json, attempting to associate a file extension with a custom icon path that traverses upwards and targets your dummy sensitive file. Replace `"../../../../sensitive-test-file"` with a path appropriate for your test environment:

    ```json
    "material-icon-theme.files.associations": {
        "testfile.vuln": "../../../../sensitive-test-file"
    }
    ```

    5. Create a new file in your VS Code workspace named `testfile.vuln`.
    6. Observe if VS Code shows any errors or attempts to access the `sensitive-test-file.txt`. You can use system monitoring tools (like `Process Monitor` on Windows or `fs_usage` on macOS/Linux) to observe file system access attempts by VS Code or the extension process when the `testfile.vuln` is created or when VS Code is reloaded.
    7. If file access to `sensitive-test-file.txt` is observed (or if VS Code shows errors indicating an attempt to load from that path), it indicates a potential local file access vulnerability.
    8. To further verify, try different traversal paths and target different files to assess the extent of the vulnerability and bypass attempts.
