# Attack Tree Analysis for juliangruber/isarray

Objective: To manipulate application logic or data flow by influencing the outcome of `isarray` checks, leading to actions the application was not intended to perform.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Logic Based on isarray's Output](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_logic_based_on_isarray's_output.md)

Attackers focus on how the application uses the boolean result of `isarray` to make decisions. By influencing this outcome, they can manipulate application behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Type Confusion Leading to Incorrect Logic](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_type_confusion_leading_to_incorrect_logic.md)

The attacker's primary goal is to make the application misinterpret the type of a variable, specifically making it believe a non-array is an array, or vice versa. This is the core enabler for subsequent attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Input Passed to isarray](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_input_passed_to_isarray.md)

Attackers attempt to control the data being passed to the `isarray` function. This can be achieved through various means, such as exploiting input validation vulnerabilities or manipulating data sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Non-Array Object that Mimics Array](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_non-array_object_that_mimics_array.md)

Leveraging JavaScript's flexibility, attackers craft non-array objects that possess array-like characteristics (e.g., a `length` property and indexed elements). When `isarray` is used without further validation, these objects can be mistaken for true arrays.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Loose Type Checking in Application Logic](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_loose_type_checking_in_application_logic.md)

The application logic does not perform strict type checking beyond the `isarray` check. This allows the mimicking non-array object to bypass further validation and be treated as a legitimate array.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Bypass Access Controls](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_bypass_access_controls.md)

If access control decisions are based on whether a variable is an array (verified by `isarray`), injecting a mimicking object can trick the application into granting unauthorized access to resources or functionalities intended for arrays.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Trigger Incorrect Data Processing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_trigger_incorrect_data_processing.md)

Application functions designed to process arrays are invoked with the mimicking non-array object. This can lead to unexpected behavior, errors, data corruption, or incorrect calculations due to the object lacking expected array methods or properties.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Application Logic Fails to Handle False Positives](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_application_logic_fails_to_handle_false_positives.md)

Although less likely with the actual `isarray` function, if custom logic or flawed assumptions lead the application to believe a non-array is an array, this can open attack vectors.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Bypass Array-Specific Security Measures](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_bypass_array-specific_security_measures.md)

Security mechanisms designed to protect array data or operations are bypassed because the application incorrectly identifies a malicious input (which might be an array) as a non-array, thus skipping the security checks.
