# Threat Model Analysis for juliangruber/isarray

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion Attack Substituting Malicious `isarray`](./threats/dependency_confusion_attack_substituting_malicious__isarray_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could publish a malicious package with the same name (`isarray`) to a public or private package registry. If the application's dependency management system is not configured correctly or if there's a vulnerability in the resolution process, the build process might inadvertently download and use the attacker's malicious package instead of the legitimate `juliangruber/isarray`. The attacker's package *is the `isarray` library being used*, but it contains arbitrary malicious code that executes within the application's build or runtime environment.

**Impact:** This could lead to a supply chain attack, where the attacker gains control over parts of the application's functionality or infrastructure. The malicious `isarray` package could steal secrets, inject backdoors, or perform other harmful actions *as if it were the legitimate library*.

**Affected Component:** The `isarray` module itself, as the malicious package replaces the intended one. The application's dependency management system (e.g., `npm`, `yarn`, `pnpm`) and the build process are also affected in facilitating this substitution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use dependency pinning or lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`) to ensure the exact version of `isarray` is installed.** This prevents automatic updates to a malicious version.
* **Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or other verification mechanisms provided by the package manager.** This can help detect if a downloaded package has been tampered with.
* **If using a private package registry, enforce strict access controls and security policies.** This limits who can publish packages and reduces the risk of malicious uploads.
* **Be vigilant about typosquatting and similar-looking package names when adding dependencies.** Attackers might try to trick developers into installing malicious packages with slightly different names.
* **Consider using tools that scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities and potential indicators of malicious packages.**
