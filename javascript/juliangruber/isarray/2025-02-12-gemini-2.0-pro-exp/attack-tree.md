## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Add a property to `Array.prototype` that mimics array behavior (e.g., length, numeric indices) `[CRITICAL]`](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_add_a_property_to__array_prototype__that_mimics_array_behavior__e_g___length__numeric_indices__0d1aaa56.md)

*   **Description:** This attack relies on the application being vulnerable to prototype pollution.  If an attacker can add properties to `Array.prototype`, they can make a non-array object appear array-like to code that doesn't perform strict type checking. While `isarray` itself is designed to be resistant to this by using `Object.prototype.toString.call()`, the *application* might still be vulnerable if it relies on other, less robust methods of array detection *before* or *instead of* calling `isarray`.
    *   **Action:** The application treats a non-array object as an array, leading to unexpected behavior or errors in subsequent array operations. This could manifest as crashes, incorrect data processing, or potentially other vulnerabilities if the application logic relies on the assumption that the variable is a genuine array.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (This depends entirely on the *application* being vulnerable to prototype pollution. `isarray` itself mitigates this specific attack.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Unexpected behavior and potential crashes are likely.  Directly achieving RCE is unlikely, but the unexpected behavior could create opportunities for further exploitation depending on the application's logic.)
    *   **Effort:** Medium (The attacker needs to find and exploit a prototype pollution vulnerability within the application. This requires understanding the application's code and input handling.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires knowledge of prototype pollution techniques and JavaScript internals.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Prototype pollution can be subtle and difficult to detect.  It often requires a combination of code review, static analysis, and dynamic analysis to identify.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   The primary mitigation is to prevent prototype pollution vulnerabilities in the application itself. This involves careful input validation, sanitization, and avoiding unsafe object manipulation practices.
        *   Using secure coding practices and frameworks that are resistant to prototype pollution is crucial.
        *   Regular security audits and code reviews can help identify potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 Pass a specially crafted Proxy object (Version <= 2.0.4) `[HIGH RISK]` `[CRITICAL]`](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_pass_a_specially_crafted_proxy_object__version_=_2_0_4____high_risk_____critical__.md)

*   **Description:** This attack exploits a known vulnerability in `isarray` versions prior to 2.0.5.  These older versions did not correctly handle JavaScript Proxy objects, allowing an attacker to create a Proxy that mimics an array and bypass the `isarray` check.
    *   **Action:** `isarray` returns `true` for a non-array object (the crafted Proxy).  This leads to the application treating the Proxy as if it were a genuine array, resulting in unexpected behavior or errors when the application attempts to perform array operations on it.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (This depends on whether the application is using an outdated version of `isarray`. If it is, the likelihood is high.)
    *   **Impact:** Medium (Unexpected behavior and potential crashes are the most likely outcomes. The specific impact depends on how the application uses the result of the `isarray` check.)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Creating a Proxy object that mimics an array is relatively straightforward.)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of JavaScript Proxy objects and how to mimic array behavior.)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Detecting this requires checking the `isarray` version used by the application and potentially analyzing the application's input handling to see if it's susceptible to accepting Proxy objects where arrays are expected.)
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   **Upgrade `isarray` to version 2.0.5 or later.** This is the *most critical* and direct mitigation. The vulnerability is patched in these later versions.
        *   Input validation in the application can also help, although it shouldn't be relied upon as the sole defense. Even if `isarray` is patched, the application should still validate that inputs are of the expected type and structure.
