# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for juliangruber/isarray

## Mitigation Strategy: [Replace `isarray` with Defensively Copied `Array.isArray`](./mitigation_strategies/replace__isarray__with_defensively_copied__array_isarray_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Capture Original Function:** At the very beginning of your application's main entry point (e.g., `index.js`, `app.js`), *before any other code*, capture the original `Array.isArray` function:
    ```javascript
    const originalIsArray = Array.isArray;
    ```
2.  **Remove `isarray` Dependency:** Remove the `isarray` package from your project's dependencies.  This is a crucial step to eliminate any potential (however small) risk from the package itself. Use your package manager (e.g., `npm uninstall isarray` or `yarn remove isarray`).
3.  **Replace All Usages:**  Systematically replace *every* instance of `isarray(...)` in your codebase with `originalIsArray(...)`.  This ensures that you are using the protected, original implementation.
4.  **Thorough Testing:**  Run your complete test suite to verify that all array checks are functioning correctly after the replacement and that no regressions have been introduced.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities *within* the `isarray` package itself (extremely unlikely, but theoretically possible).
        *   **Severity:** Very Low. `isarray` is extremely simple, but removing it eliminates this risk entirely.
    *   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks targeting `isarray`.
        *   **Severity:** Very Low. While unlikely, removing the dependency eliminates the risk of a compromised version of `isarray` being introduced.
    *   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution or Overriding of `Array.isArray` affecting `isarray`'s behavior.
        *   **Severity:** High (in the context of this specific vulnerability). By using the defensively copied `originalIsArray`, you ensure that even if the global `Array.isArray` is compromised, your array checks remain reliable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **`isarray` Vulnerabilities:** Risk is *eliminated* (by removing the dependency).
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk is *eliminated* (by removing the dependency).
    *   **Prototype Pollution/Overriding:** Risk is *significantly reduced*. The application uses the original, untainted function.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Examples (adapt to your project):
        *   "Yes, fully implemented. `isarray` has been removed, and all uses have been replaced with `originalIsArray`."
        *   "Partially implemented. `isarray` has been removed, but some files still use `Array.isArray` directly (without the defensive copy)."
        *   "No, not currently implemented. `isarray` is still a dependency and is used directly."

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Examples (adapt to your project):
        *   "Missing implementation. `isarray` is still a dependency and is used throughout the codebase."
        *   "Partially missing. `isarray` has been removed, but the defensive copying strategy is not consistently applied (some files use `Array.isArray` directly)."
        *   "Fully implemented; no missing implementation."
This single, focused strategy directly addresses the use of `isarray` by removing it and replacing it with a protected, built-in alternative. This is the most effective way to mitigate any potential risks associated with the package itself, while also addressing the broader concern of prototype pollution.
