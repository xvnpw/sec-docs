## Threat: [Malicious Package Substitution (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/malicious_package_substitution__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Package Substitution (Supply Chain Attack)

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `isarray` package on the npm registry (or another package repository) and publishes a malicious version. This malicious version could return incorrect results (e.g., always `true`, always `false`, or conditionally incorrect based on attacker-controlled input). The attacker could achieve this by compromising the maintainer's account, finding vulnerabilities in the npm infrastructure, or using social engineering. This directly affects the functionality of `isarray` by replacing its legitimate code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Bypassed security checks that rely on accurate array detection.
        *   Potential for denial-of-service (DoS) if the application's logic depends on the array check and enters an infinite loop or consumes excessive resources.
        *   Potential for elevation of privilege if array checks are used for authorization.
        *   Data corruption or unexpected application behavior.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `isarray` module (`index.js` or equivalent). The attacker would replace the entire module's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on how `isarray` is used).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Package Lock Files:** Employ `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` (Yarn) to ensure that the exact same versions of dependencies (including `isarray`) are installed every time. These files contain cryptographic hashes of the package contents.
        *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep dependencies up-to-date to benefit from security patches and bug fixes. Use tools like `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated` to identify outdated packages.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Utilize SCA tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities. These tools can alert developers to compromised or vulnerable packages.
        *   **Package Signing (Advanced):** If possible, use packages that are digitally signed by their authors. This provides an additional layer of assurance that the package hasn't been tampered with. (This is less common for small utility libraries like `isarray`.)
        *   **Mirroring/Proxying (Advanced):** For highly sensitive environments, consider using a private npm registry or a proxy that caches known-good versions of packages. This reduces reliance on the public npm registry.

## Threat: [Indirect Elevation of Privilege via Compromised `isarray`](./threats/indirect_elevation_of_privilege_via_compromised__isarray_.md)

* **Threat:** Indirect Elevation of Privilege via Compromised `isarray`
    *   **Description:** This is a *direct consequence* of a compromised `isarray` as described above. If the application uses the *direct output* of a compromised `isarray` to make authorization decisions (e.g., granting administrative access based on whether a configuration object is an array), and `isarray` is modified to return an incorrect result (e.g., always `true`), an attacker could bypass security checks. The threat originates *directly* from the compromised `isarray` code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
        *   Potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `isarray` module (compromised). The application's authorization logic is also indirectly affected, but the root cause is the compromised `isarray`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical, depending on the authorization logic).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **All mitigations for "Malicious Package Substitution" apply.** This is the primary mitigation, as it prevents the compromised `isarray` from being used in the first place.
        *   **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Implement MFA.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant users only the minimum necessary privileges.
        *   **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security checks. Don't rely solely on `isarray` (or any single check) for authorization.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user-provided data.

## Threat: [Indirect Denial of Service (DoS) via Compromised `isarray`](./threats/indirect_denial_of_service__dos__via_compromised__isarray_.md)

*   **Threat:** Indirect Denial of Service (DoS) via Compromised `isarray`

    *   **Description:** This is a *direct consequence* of a compromised `isarray` (see "Malicious Package Substitution"). If `isarray` is modified to return `true` for a very large, non-array object, and the application then attempts to iterate over this object *as if it were an array* based on the *direct output* of the compromised `isarray` function, it could lead to excessive resource consumption (memory or CPU).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Application slowdown or unresponsiveness.
        *   Potential for complete application crash.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire `isarray` module (compromised). The application code that *uses* `isarray` is also indirectly affected, but the root cause is the compromised `isarray`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on application logic and the size of the manipulated object, could be critical in some cases).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **All mitigations for "Malicious Package Substitution" apply.** This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Input Validation:** Sanitize and validate all inputs *before* using them, even if they are expected to be arrays. Limit the size of arrays that the application processes.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (e.g., memory limits, timeouts) to prevent runaway loops or excessive memory allocation.
        *   **Defensive Programming:** Write code that is robust to unexpected input types.
