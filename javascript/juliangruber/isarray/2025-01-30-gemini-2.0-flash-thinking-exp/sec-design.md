# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - The primary goal of the `isarray` project is to provide a reliable and efficient utility function for Javascript developers to determine if a given value is an array. This enhances code quality and reduces potential errors in Javascript applications by ensuring accurate array type checking. The project prioritizes simplicity, performance, and correctness.
- Business Risks:
  - Dependency Risk: Although `isarray` has no dependencies, projects that depend on `isarray` might be indirectly affected if `isarray` were to introduce a bug or vulnerability.
  - Code Quality Risk: Bugs or inaccuracies in the `isarray` function could lead to incorrect array checks in dependent applications, potentially causing unexpected behavior or errors.
  - Supply Chain Risk: While unlikely for such a small, standalone library, there is a theoretical risk of supply chain attacks if the distribution mechanism (e.g., npm) were compromised.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Publicly accessible code repository on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - security control: Version control using Git, providing history and traceability of code changes. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
  - accepted risk: Limited formal security testing or code review processes are explicitly documented for this small, open-source utility library.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions and issue reporting for identifying and addressing potential vulnerabilities.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement basic static analysis (linting) in the development and build process to catch potential code quality issues and simple security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Establish a basic automated test suite, including unit tests, to ensure the correctness of the `isarray` function and prevent regressions.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for a utility library. No authentication is required for usage.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for a utility library. No authorization is required for usage.
  - Input Validation: The `isarray` function itself performs input validation by checking the type of the input value to determine if it is an array.
  - Cryptography: Not applicable for a utility library that performs type checking. Cryptographic operations are not within the scope of this project.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For a utility library like `isarray`, the critical business process is the reliable execution of Javascript code in applications that depend on it. Incorrect array checks due to bugs in `isarray` could lead to functional errors in dependent applications. However, the impact is generally low due to the library's simplicity and narrow scope.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - The `isarray` library itself does not handle sensitive data. The data it processes are Javascript values passed to the `isArray` function, which are not inherently sensitive. The sensitivity of data depends on the applications that use `isarray`, not `isarray` itself. The library's code is publicly available and not considered sensitive.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Are there any specific performance requirements for the `isarray` library beyond general efficiency?
  - Is there a formal process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in this project, even though it's a small utility library?
  - Are there any specific coding standards or linting rules that are enforced for this project?
- Assumptions:
  - Assumption: The primary goal is to provide a correct and efficient `isArray` function. Security is a secondary consideration due to the library's simplicity and low risk profile.
  - Assumption: Standard open-source development practices are followed, including public code repository and community contributions.
  - Assumption: The library is intended for general use in Javascript environments and does not have specific deployment environment constraints beyond standard Javascript compatibility.
