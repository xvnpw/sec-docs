# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
 - Provide a reliable and easy-to-use HTTP client for browsers and Node.js environments.
 - Enable developers to easily integrate HTTP communication into their applications.
 - Maintain a widely adopted and actively supported library.
 - Ensure compatibility across different JavaScript environments.
- Most important business risks:
 - Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by attackers, leading to data breaches or other security incidents in applications using axios.
 - Performance issues or instability in axios could negatively impact the performance and reliability of applications using it.
 - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the library becoming outdated and insecure over time.
 - Compatibility issues with new JavaScript environments or browser versions could limit the usability of axios.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
 - security control: Open source code, publicly available on GitHub for community review. Implemented: GitHub repository.
 - security control: Regular updates and bug fixes contributed by maintainers and community. Implemented: GitHub repository, npm registry.
 - security control: Vulnerability reporting process via GitHub issues or security channels. Implemented: GitHub repository.
 - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
 - accepted risk: Potential for delays in security patch releases due to open-source development model.
- Recommended security controls:
 - security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
 - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the library.
 - security control: Establish a clear security policy and incident response plan.
 - security control: Promote and enforce secure coding practices among contributors.
- Security requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to axios library itself, as it's a client. Authentication is handled by the applications using axios and the backend services they communicate with. Axios should support various authentication methods (e.g., Basic Auth, Bearer tokens) provided by backend services.
 - Authorization: Not directly applicable to axios library itself. Authorization is handled by the applications using axios and the backend services. Axios should correctly transmit authorization tokens or credentials provided by the application.
 - Input validation: Axios needs to perform input validation on configuration options and request parameters to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This is especially important when accepting user-provided data to configure requests.
 - Cryptography: Axios relies on underlying TLS/SSL implementations in browsers and Node.js for secure communication (HTTPS). Axios itself does not implement cryptographic algorithms but should ensure proper handling of HTTPS connections and potentially support features like certificate pinning if needed (though not a common requirement for a general HTTP client).

 - Deployment of applications using axios varies widely depending on the type of application (web application, Node.js server, etc.).
 - For web applications, deployment typically involves serving static files (including JavaScript bundles containing axios) from web servers or CDNs, and execution in users' browsers.
 - For Node.js applications, deployment can be on cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP), virtual machines, or on-premise servers.

- Build Process Description:
 - Developer makes code changes and commits them to the GitHub Repository.
 - GitHub Actions CI pipeline is triggered on code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
 - Build & Test step compiles the code, runs unit tests and integration tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
 - Security Scans step performs static application security testing (SAST) to identify potential code vulnerabilities and dependency scanning to check for vulnerable dependencies.
 - If build, tests, and security scans are successful, the library is published to the npm Registry.
 - If any step fails, developers are notified to investigate and fix the issues.

 - security control: Publishing to npm Registry, which has its own security measures. Implemented: npm Registry.
 - security control: Code review process for pull requests to ensure code quality and security before merging. Implemented: GitHub Repository, development workflow.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
 - Secure and reliable HTTP communication for applications using axios.
 - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the axios library for the developer community.
 - Preventing vulnerabilities in axios that could be exploited in downstream applications.
- Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
 - Data transmitted via HTTP requests made using axios. This data can be highly sensitive depending on the application and the API being accessed (e.g., user credentials, personal information, financial data).
 - Integrity of the axios library code itself to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure users are using a safe and trustworthy library.
 - Confidentiality of potential vulnerability information before patches are released to prevent exploitation.
