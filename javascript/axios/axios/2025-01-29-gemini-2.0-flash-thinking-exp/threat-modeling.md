# Threat Model Analysis for axios/axios

## Threat: [Vulnerable Axios Dependency](./threats/vulnerable_axios_dependency.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability present in the `axios` library itself or one of its dependencies. This could allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access, execute arbitrary code within the application's context, or cause a denial of service. Attackers often target applications using outdated versions of libraries with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, denial of service, potentially remote code execution.
*   **Affected Axios Component:** Core `axios` library, or its dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the specific vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `axios` to the latest stable version.
    *   Implement automated dependency scanning in your CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerable dependencies.
    *   Monitor security advisories for `axios` and its dependencies.
    *   Apply security patches and updates promptly.

## Threat: [Disabled TLS/SSL Verification](./threats/disabled_tlsssl_verification.md)

*   **Description:** Developers misconfigure `axios` to disable TLS/SSL certificate verification (e.g., by setting `rejectUnauthorized: false` in Node.js). This allows man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker can intercept and decrypt communication between the application and the server. The attacker can then steal sensitive data transmitted in requests and responses or inject malicious content.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, man-in-the-middle attacks, data breach, potential injection of malicious content.
*   **Affected Axios Component:** `axios` request configuration options, specifically `httpsAgent` and `rejectUnauthorized`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never** disable TLS/SSL verification in production environments.
    *   Ensure `rejectUnauthorized` is set to `true` (or rely on the default secure behavior).
    *   Enforce HTTPS for all requests, especially when handling sensitive data.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate potential content injection risks.

## Threat: [Insecure HTTP Usage for Sensitive Data](./threats/insecure_http_usage_for_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** Developers use `axios` to transmit sensitive data (like passwords, API keys, personal information) over insecure HTTP connections instead of HTTPS. An attacker performing network eavesdropping can intercept this unencrypted traffic and steal the sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Data interception, data breach, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Affected Axios Component:** `axios` request configuration, specifically the URL protocol (http vs https).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use HTTPS for transmitting sensitive data.
    *   Enforce HTTPS-only communication for the entire application.
    *   Implement HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) to force browsers to use HTTPS.
    *   Regularly audit code to ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently sent over HTTP.

## Threat: [Malicious Interceptor](./threats/malicious_interceptor.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manages to inject or modify `axios` interceptors. This could be achieved through compromised dependencies, developer error, or a supply chain attack. A malicious interceptor can then intercept and manipulate all requests and responses made by `axios`, potentially stealing data, injecting malicious code into responses, or altering the application's intended behavior in harmful ways.
*   **Impact:** Data manipulation, unauthorized access, information leakage, application malfunction, potential remote code execution if malicious code is injected.
*   **Affected Axios Component:** `axios` interceptor mechanism (`axios.interceptors.request`, `axios.interceptors.response`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test all `axios` interceptors for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement strict code review processes for any changes to interceptor logic.
    *   Control access to the codebase and configuration where interceptors are defined, especially in production environments.
    *   Utilize dependency scanning and Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to detect compromised dependencies that might introduce malicious code, including interceptors.

## Threat: [Interceptor Data Leakage](./threats/interceptor_data_leakage.md)

*   **Description:** Developers create `axios` interceptors that unintentionally log or expose sensitive data from requests or responses. This can happen if interceptors are not carefully designed and implemented, leading to sensitive information being written to logs, error messages, or other unintended outputs.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, privacy violations due to exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Affected Axios Component:** `axios` interceptor logic, specifically request and response interceptor functions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of the leaked data).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply strict data sanitization and secure logging practices within interceptor functions.
    *   Carefully review interceptor code to ensure it does not unintentionally expose sensitive information.
    *   Educate developers on secure coding practices within interceptors, emphasizing data handling and logging.
    *   Perform security code reviews specifically focused on interceptor implementations to identify potential data leakage points.
