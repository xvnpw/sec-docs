# Attack Surface Analysis for axios/axios

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the server-side application to make requests to unintended locations, often internal resources or external services, by manipulating input that controls the request destination.
*   **Axios Contribution:** Axios is the library used to execute HTTP requests. If user-controlled input is used to construct the URL or path for these requests, Axios becomes the tool that performs the SSRF attack.
*   **Example:** An application takes a URL parameter to fetch content using Axios. An attacker modifies this parameter to `http://localhost:6379/` (Redis default port). The server using Axios makes a request to its own Redis instance, potentially exposing internal data or allowing unauthorized actions.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data exfiltration, denial of service, potential remote code execution in vulnerable internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided input that influences URLs or paths used in Axios requests. Use allowlists of permitted domains or URL schemes.
    *   Use secure URL parsing libraries to validate and normalize URLs before using them in Axios requests.
    *   Implement network segmentation to isolate backend services.
    *   Apply the principle of least privilege to the application's execution environment.

## Attack Surface: [Request Parameter and Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/request_parameter_and_header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious parameters or headers into HTTP requests by manipulating user input that is used to construct these request components.
*   **Axios Contribution:** Axios allows developers to programmatically construct request parameters and headers. If this construction uses unsanitized user input, Axios will send requests with attacker-injected content.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to set a "language" preference, which is then added as a custom header `X-Language` in Axios requests. An attacker could inject malicious content into the language preference, like `English\r\nX-Malicious-Header: evil`. Depending on backend processing, this could lead to header injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure, bypassing security controls, potential for further exploitation depending on how backend systems process injected headers or parameters.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Sanitize and encode user input before using it to construct request parameters or headers for Axios.
    *   Utilize Axios features for parameterized requests to minimize manual string concatenation.
    *   Implement robust header validation and sanitization on backend systems.

## Attack Surface: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection (if XML is processed)](./attack_surfaces/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection__if_xml_is_processed_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsers to access local files, internal network resources, or cause denial of service by injecting malicious XML entities.
*   **Axios Contribution:** If the application uses Axios to fetch XML responses and processes them with a vulnerable XML parser, Axios is the transport mechanism for the malicious XML.
*   **Example:** An application uses Axios to fetch XML data from an external source. If the XML parser used to process the response is not configured to disable external entity processing, an attacker could control the external source to return malicious XML containing an external entity definition that reads local files.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (reading local files), SSRF, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Crucially**, disable external entity processing and DTD processing in the XML parser used to handle Axios responses.
    *   Validate XML input to ensure it conforms to expected schemas and does not contain malicious entity definitions.
    *   Prefer safer data formats like JSON over XML whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [Proxy Configuration Issues](./attack_surfaces/proxy_configuration_issues.md)

*   **Description:** Insecure proxy configurations or reliance on user-provided proxy settings without validation can be exploited to intercept or manipulate network traffic.
*   **Axios Contribution:** Axios supports proxy configurations. If these configurations are not handled securely, or if user input influences proxy settings without validation, Axios can be used to route traffic through attacker-controlled proxies.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to configure a proxy for Axios requests. If the application doesn't validate the proxy address, an attacker could provide a malicious proxy server. All Axios requests will then be routed through the attacker's proxy, allowing them to intercept or modify traffic, potentially including sensitive credentials.
*   **Impact:** Man-in-the-middle attacks, interception of sensitive data, manipulation of requests and responses, potential credential theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid allowing users to directly configure proxy settings for Axios requests, especially for sensitive operations.
    *   If proxy configuration is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize user-provided proxy addresses against a known good list.
    *   Ensure communication with proxy servers is encrypted (e.g., using HTTPS proxies).
