# Threat Model Analysis for axios/axios

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Axios Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_axios_library.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known security vulnerabilities present within the Axios library itself. This could involve sending specially crafted requests or manipulating responses in ways that trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, information disclosure, or other forms of compromise.
    *   **Affected Axios Component:** Various modules and functions within the `axios` library depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Axios updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reported issues in Axios.
        *   Implement a software composition analysis (SCA) process to track dependencies and identify vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Axios's Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_axios's_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit security vulnerabilities present in libraries that Axios depends on. Axios might indirectly be affected by these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to exploitable conditions.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from information disclosure and denial of service to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Axios Component:** Indirectly affects the `axios` library through its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Axios and its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use dependency management tools to track and manage dependencies.
        *   Implement a software composition analysis (SCA) process to identify vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Threat: [Malicious or Compromised Interceptors](./threats/malicious_or_compromised_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who gains the ability to modify the application's code could inject malicious Axios interceptors or compromise existing ones. These malicious interceptors could then intercept all requests and responses made by Axios, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, modify requests before they are sent, or alter responses before they reach the application.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of data transmitted by Axios, manipulation of application logic, potential for injecting malicious content or redirecting users to attacker-controlled sites.
    *   **Affected Axios Component:** `interceptors.request`, `interceptors.response`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong input validation and output encoding to prevent code injection vulnerabilities that could be used to inject malicious interceptors.
        *   Secure the development environment and restrict access to code repositories to prevent unauthorized modification of interceptors.
        *   Regularly review and audit the implementation of Axios interceptors.
        *   Implement integrity checks for application code to detect unauthorized modifications, including changes to interceptors.
