# Attack Surface Analysis for axios/axios

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can induce the application to make HTTP requests to arbitrary destinations, potentially internal resources or external systems.
    *   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios is the mechanism used by the application to make these HTTP requests. If the target URL for an Axios request is derived from user-controlled input without proper validation, an attacker can manipulate it.
    *   **Example:** An application takes a URL as input from a user to fetch content. This user-provided URL is directly passed to `axios.get(userInput)`. An attacker could provide an internal IP address or a URL to a sensitive internal service.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, port scanning of internal networks, potential for further exploitation of internal services, denial of service against internal or external systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of internal resources).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize any user-provided input that influences the URLs used in Axios requests.
        *   **URL Allowlisting:** Maintain a list of allowed destination URLs or domains and only permit requests to those.
        *   **Use Relative Paths:** Where possible, use relative paths for internal API calls instead of full URLs.
        *   **Network Segmentation:** Implement network segmentation to limit the impact of SSRF by restricting access from the application server to internal resources.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into requests made by the application.
    *   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios allows setting custom headers via the `headers` option in request configurations. If the values for these headers are derived from user input without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious headers.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to set a custom "User-Agent" header. If the user input is directly used in the `headers` object for an Axios request, an attacker could inject headers like `X-Forwarded-For` or even attempt HTTP Response Splitting by injecting newline characters.
    *   **Impact:** HTTP Response Splitting (leading to cross-site scripting or cache poisoning), cache poisoning, session fixation, bypassing certain security checks based on headers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (depending on the injected header and its impact).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize user input intended for HTTP headers.
        *   **Header Allowlisting:** Only allow setting a predefined set of safe headers.
        *   **Avoid User-Controlled Headers:**  Minimize or eliminate the ability for users to directly control HTTP headers.
        *   **Use Dedicated Header Setting Functions:** If available, use specific functions or libraries designed to set headers safely.

## Attack Surface: [Data Injection](./attack_surfaces/data_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the data sent in the request body of an HTTP request made by the application.
    *   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios is used to send data in the request body (e.g., JSON, form data). If the data being sent is constructed using unsanitized user input, an attacker can inject malicious data.
    *   **Example:** An application takes user input for a search query and includes it directly in the JSON payload of a POST request made using Axios. An attacker could inject malicious JSON structures or code that could be interpreted by the server-side application.
    *   **Impact:** Command injection on the server-side, SQL injection on the server-side (if the data is used in database queries), manipulation of server-side logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the server-side processing of the data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side Input Validation and Sanitization:**  The primary defense is robust validation and sanitization of all data received by the server-side application.
        *   **Parameterized Queries:** If the data is used in database queries, use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the server-side application has the minimum necessary permissions to perform its tasks.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information via Request/Response Interceptors](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_via_requestresponse_interceptors.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information can be unintentionally logged or exposed through improperly implemented Axios interceptors.
    *   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios provides interceptors to modify requests and responses. If these interceptors are not carefully implemented, they might log sensitive data (like API keys, authentication tokens) or inadvertently expose it in error messages.
    *   **Example:** An interceptor logs the entire request object, including authorization headers containing API keys, to a general application log.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive credentials, API keys, personal data, or other confidential information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Interceptor Implementation:**  Thoroughly review and test interceptor logic.
        *   **Avoid Logging Sensitive Data:**  Be mindful of what data is being logged within interceptors. Sanitize or redact sensitive information before logging.
        *   **Secure Logging Practices:** Ensure logs are stored securely and access is restricted.
        *   **Use Specific Logging Mechanisms:** Utilize logging libraries that allow for filtering and redaction of sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks due to Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_due_to_insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** The application might be vulnerable to MITM attacks if TLS/SSL is not configured securely when using Axios.
    *   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios provides options to configure TLS/SSL settings, such as disabling certificate validation (`rejectUnauthorized: false`). If these options are misused, it can weaken the security of HTTPS connections.
    *   **Example:** An application sets `rejectUnauthorized: false` in the Axios request configuration, allowing connections to servers with invalid or self-signed certificates, making it susceptible to MITM attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Eavesdropping on communication, interception and modification of data in transit, potential compromise of sensitive information.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Enforce Strict TLS/SSL:** Ensure `rejectUnauthorized` is set to `true` (or not explicitly set, as `true` is the default).
        *   **Use Secure Protocols:**  Ensure the application and server are configured to use strong and up-to-date TLS protocols.
        *   **Avoid Disabling Certificate Validation:**  Never disable certificate validation in production environments.

## Attack Surface: [Bypass of Security Measures via Request Forgery](./attack_surfaces/bypass_of_security_measures_via_request_forgery.md)

*   **Description:** If the application relies on the origin of requests made by Axios for security checks, an attacker might be able to bypass these checks.
    *   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios allows making requests from the application's server-side. If the server-side application incorrectly assumes that all requests to certain internal endpoints originate from within the server itself, an attacker might be able to forge requests using Axios.
    *   **Example:** An internal API endpoint is protected by checking the source IP address, assuming all requests come from the local server. An attacker could potentially use Axios to make requests to this endpoint, bypassing the IP-based check.
    *   **Impact:** Bypass of authentication or authorization checks, access to restricted resources or functionalities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Do Not Rely Solely on Request Origin:** Avoid relying solely on the origin of a request (e.g., IP address) for security checks.
        *   **Implement Proper Authentication and Authorization:** Use robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., API keys, JWTs) to verify the identity and permissions of the requester.
        *   **Mutual TLS (mTLS):** For highly sensitive internal communication, consider using mutual TLS to verify the identity of both the client and the server.
