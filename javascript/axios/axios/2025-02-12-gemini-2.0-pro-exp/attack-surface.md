# Attack Surface Analysis for axios/axios

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - via Axios on the Server](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__-_via_axios_on_the_server.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers control the URL used in a server-side Axios request, causing the server to make requests to unintended destinations (internal network, external malicious sites).
*   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios, when used on the server, will make requests to whatever URL it's given.  This is the *direct* mechanism of the attack.
*   **Example:**  A server-side application uses Axios to fetch an image from a URL provided by the user: `axios.get(userProvidedURL)`.  The attacker provides `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` to access AWS metadata.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal services, sensitive data, or metadata; potential for remote code execution; ability to scan internal networks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict URL Allow-list:**  Maintain a strict allow-list of permitted URLs or domains.  Reject any request that doesn't match.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate any user-supplied data that influences the URL.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the server making the Axios requests.
    *   **Avoid User-Controlled URLs:**  If possible, avoid using user-supplied data directly in URLs.
    *   **Dedicated Proxy (if necessary):** Use a dedicated, well-configured proxy server with strict access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) - Due to Misconfiguration](./attack_surfaces/man-in-the-middle__mitm__-_due_to_misconfiguration.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers intercept and modify communication due to disabled or improperly configured HTTPS certificate validation *within the Axios configuration*.
*   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios supports HTTPS, but incorrect configuration (e.g., disabling certificate verification) *directly* removes this protection, making Axios the vulnerable component.
*   **Example:**  Using `httpsAgent: { rejectUnauthorized: false }` in production.
*   **Impact:**  Interception and modification of requests and responses, leading to data breaches, credential theft, and session hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never Disable Certificate Validation in Production:**  Ensure `rejectUnauthorized` is set to `true` (the default).
    *   **Proper `httpsAgent` Configuration (for testing):**  Use a properly configured `httpsAgent` with the CA certificate for testing, and *restrict this to development/testing only*.
    *   **HTTPS Everywhere:**  Enforce HTTPS on both client and server.
    *   **HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security):** Implement HSTS.

## Attack Surface: [Data Exposure via Logging (Axios Request/Response Data)](./attack_surfaces/data_exposure_via_logging__axios_requestresponse_data_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data within Axios *requests or responses* are logged without redaction.
*   **How Axios Contributes:** The sensitive data is *contained within* the Axios request or response objects.  The logging of these objects is the direct cause of the exposure.
*   **Example:**  Logging the entire Axios `request` object, including headers with an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` value.
*   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, leading to unauthorized access and data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the data).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Log Redaction:**  Implement robust logging with automatic redaction of sensitive information.
    *   **Selective Logging:**  Log only necessary, non-sensitive parts of requests and responses.
    *   **Axios Interceptors:** Use Axios interceptors to selectively log or modify data *before* it's logged (e.g., remove the `Authorization` header).
    *   **Secure Log Storage:**  Store logs securely and restrict access.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Request Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/client-side_request_manipulation.md)

*    **Description:** Attackers modify client-side data used to construct Axios requests (URLs, headers, data), leading to unintended requests being sent to the server.
*   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios executes the request as constructed by the application code; it doesn't inherently validate the inputs.
*   **Example:** An attacker changes a hidden form field containing a product ID to access information about a different, unauthorized product. `axios.get('/api/products/' + userInput)` where `userInput` is manipulated.
*    **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential for other attacks depending on the backend API.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*    **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Rigorously validate *all* user-supplied data on the client-side *and* the server-side. Use allow-lists (whitelist) rather than deny-lists (blacklist).
        *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize data to remove or encode potentially harmful characters.
        *   **URL Building Libraries:** Use dedicated URL building libraries to ensure proper encoding and prevent parameter injection.
        *  **Server-Side Validation:** *Never* rely solely on client-side validation. Always re-validate all data on the server.

## Attack Surface: [CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) - Lack of Protection](./attack_surfaces/csrf__cross-site_request_forgery__-_lack_of_protection.md)

* **Description:** Application is vulnerable to CSRF because it uses Axios to make state-changing requests without including necessary CSRF tokens.
* **How Axios Contributes:** Axios is the mechanism for making the request; it doesn't automatically handle CSRF protection.
* **Example:** An attacker tricks a user into clicking a malicious link that makes a POST request via Axios to change the user's password, without including a CSRF token.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user, such as changing passwords, making purchases, or deleting data.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **CSRF Tokens:** Implement CSRF protection on the server-side, typically by generating and validating CSRF tokens.
    * **Include Tokens in Axios Requests:** Ensure that Axios requests include the CSRF token, usually in a header (e.g., `X-CSRF-Token`) or as a parameter in the request body.
    * **`withCredentials`:** Use the `withCredentials: true` option in Axios when working with cookies and CSRF protection, as the token is often stored in a cookie.
    * **Synchronizer Token Pattern:** Use a well-established CSRF protection pattern, such as the Synchronizer Token Pattern.
