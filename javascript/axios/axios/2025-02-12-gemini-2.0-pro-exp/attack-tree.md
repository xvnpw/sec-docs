## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Known CVEs in Axios [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_known_cves_in_axios__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers actively search for and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in software. If the application uses a version of Axios with a known, unpatched vulnerability, an attacker can leverage published exploits or create their own based on the vulnerability details. Examples include Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), prototype pollution, and Remote Code Execution (RCE).
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Known vulnerabilities are public, and exploits are often available).
*   **Impact:** High (Can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or denial of service).
*   **Effort:** Low (Exploits are often readily available).
*   **Skill Level:** Low-Medium (Script kiddies can use pre-built exploits; more skilled attackers can adapt them).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (IDS/IPS and WAFs can often detect known exploit patterns, but obfuscation is possible).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Immediate Action:** Implement a robust vulnerability management process. Regularly update Axios to the latest version. Use dependency management tools (npm, yarn) with automated updates.
    *   **Continuous Monitoring:** Subscribe to security advisories and CVE databases (NVD, Snyk, etc.) to be alerted to new Axios vulnerabilities.
    *   **Automated Scanning:** Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to automatically detect vulnerable versions of Axios and its dependencies in your codebase and build pipelines.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Include testing for known Axios vulnerabilities in your regular penetration testing schedule.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Axios, like most libraries, depends on other packages.  If a dependency has a vulnerability, it can be exploited through Axios, even if Axios itself is secure.  A prime example is `follow-redirects`, a common Axios dependency, which has had vulnerabilities in the past.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Dependencies are often overlooked, increasing the chance of unpatched vulnerabilities).
*   **Impact:** High (Similar to direct Axios vulnerabilities, dependency issues can lead to severe consequences).
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Exploits for dependency vulnerabilities are often publicly available).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High (Requires understanding of dependency chains and potentially reverse engineering).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires comprehensive dependency scanning, which is not always performed).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit *all* dependencies, not just Axios, using tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated SCA tools.
    *   **Automated Dependency Updates:** Configure automated dependency updates (e.g., Dependabot, Renovate) to receive pull requests for security patches.  *Thoroughly test* these updates before merging.
    *   **Dependency Locking (with caution):** Consider using a lockfile (`package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.  However, be aware that this can prevent automatic security updates, so you *must* have a process for regularly updating the lockfile.
    *   **Vulnerability Database Monitoring:** Monitor vulnerability databases for issues in *all* your dependencies, not just Axios.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Insecure Defaults/Configuration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/4__insecure_defaultsconfiguration__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Using Axios with insecure default settings or misconfiguring it can create vulnerabilities.  Examples include:
    *   **Ignoring Timeouts:**  Failing to set appropriate timeouts can lead to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks where the application hangs indefinitely waiting for a response.
    *   **Disabling HTTPS Validation:**  Turning off certificate validation makes the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
    *   **Overly Permissive CORS:**  Incorrectly configured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) can allow unauthorized access to data.
    *   **Unsafe `baseURL` Handling:** If the `baseURL` is constructed from user input without proper sanitization, it can lead to SSRF.
    *   **Ignoring `maxRedirects`:** Not setting a limit on redirects can lead to infinite redirect loops.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Very common due to developer oversight or lack of security awareness).
*   **Impact:** High (Can range from information disclosure to complete system compromise, depending on the misconfiguration).
*   **Effort:** Low (Exploiting misconfigurations often requires minimal effort).
*   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic understanding of HTTP and web security is sufficient).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Easily detected by security scanners and during code reviews).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Secure Configuration Review:**  Thoroughly review and understand all Axios configuration options.  Follow the principle of least privilege.
    *   **Mandatory Timeouts:**  *Always* set appropriate timeouts for all requests.
    *   **Enforce HTTPS:**  *Never* disable HTTPS certificate validation in production.
    *   **Strict CORS Policies:**  Implement strict CORS policies, allowing only necessary origins.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Sanitize and validate all user-supplied data used in Axios configurations, especially `baseURL`.
    *   **Limit Redirects:** Set a reasonable value for `maxRedirects` to prevent infinite loops.
    *   **Configuration Hardening Checklist:** Create and follow a checklist for secure Axios configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Client-Side Request Manipulation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/5__client-side_request_manipulation__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** When Axios is used in a browser environment, attackers can modify requests using browser developer tools or by intercepting and altering network traffic. This can lead to:
    *   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):**  If a GET request has side effects (e.g., deleting data), an attacker can trick a user into making that request.
    *   **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):**  If the server reflects user-supplied data from an Axios request without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious scripts.
    *   **Open Redirects:**  If Axios follows redirects based on user input, an attacker can redirect the user to a malicious site.
*   **Likelihood:** High (Client-side code is inherently vulnerable to manipulation).
*   **Impact:** Medium (Depends on the application's functionality; can range from data modification to account takeover).
*   **Effort:** Low-Medium (Requires understanding of the application's API and how to manipulate requests).
*   **Skill Level:** Medium-High (Requires knowledge of web security vulnerabilities and browser manipulation techniques).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Server-side validation and monitoring are crucial, but can be challenging to implement perfectly).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **CSRF Protection:** Implement robust CSRF protection (e.g., synchronizer tokens) for *all* state-changing requests, regardless of the HTTP method (even GET).
    *   **Input Validation (Server-Side):**  *Never* trust client-side input.  Always validate and sanitize all data received from Axios requests on the server-side.
    *   **Output Encoding:**  Properly encode all data rendered in the browser to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Redirect Validation:**  If your application uses redirects based on Axios responses, strictly validate the target URL to prevent open redirect attacks.  Use a whitelist of allowed redirect destinations if possible.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
    * **Don't use GET for state changes:** Follow RESTful principles. Use POST, PUT, DELETE for actions that modify data.
