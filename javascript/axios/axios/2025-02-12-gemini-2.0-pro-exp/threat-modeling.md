# Threat Model Analysis for axios/axios

## Threat: [Threat: Sensitive Data Exposure via Logging](./threats/threat_sensitive_data_exposure_via_logging.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information (API keys, tokens, PII, internal URLs) if developers inadvertently log full request/response objects or headers using Axios interceptors. This could happen through insecure log storage, compromised logging services, or exposed developer consoles. The attacker might monitor logs, access log files, or exploit vulnerabilities in logging infrastructure. This is *directly* related to Axios because the interceptor mechanism is a core Axios feature.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Compromise of user accounts.
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   Exposure of internal network architecture.
    *   Reputational damage.
    *   Legal and compliance violations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
*   **Axios Component Affected:** `interceptors.request`, `interceptors.response`, `axios.create` (if default logging is configured).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Redaction:** Implement strict redaction of sensitive data within interceptors *before* logging. Use regular expressions or dedicated redaction libraries.
    *   **Selective Logging:** Log only essential, non-sensitive information. Avoid logging entire request/response objects.
    *   **Secure Log Storage:** Ensure logs are stored securely with appropriate access controls and encryption.
    *   **Log Monitoring:** Implement monitoring and alerting for suspicious log activity.
    *   **Environment-Specific Logging:** Disable verbose logging in production environments.
    *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review interceptor code for potential logging vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Threat: Unintentional Header Forwarding](./threats/threat_unintentional_header_forwarding.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to a third-party service if Axios is configured to send sensitive headers (e.g., `Authorization`) globally, and these headers are unintentionally forwarded to untrusted domains. The attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the third-party service or intercept the request. This is a *direct* threat because it stems from how Axios handles default headers.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to third-party resources.
    *   Data breaches on third-party services.
    *   Potential for account takeover on third-party services.
*   **Axios Component Affected:** `axios.defaults.headers`, `axios.create` (if default headers are configured).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Global Sensitive Headers:** Do not set sensitive headers globally using `axios.defaults.headers`.
    *   **Instance-Specific Headers:** Use instance-specific headers or interceptors to add sensitive headers only to requests intended for trusted domains.
    *   **Request Context:** Use request-specific configurations to override default headers when necessary.
    *   **Careful `baseURL` Usage:** Be mindful of the `baseURL` configuration and how it interacts with relative URLs.

## Threat: [Threat: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - Node.js](./threats/threat_server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__-_node_js.md)

*   **Description:** If user-supplied input is directly used in the URL passed to Axios on the server-side, an attacker can craft a request to access internal resources or services. The attacker might provide a URL pointing to localhost, internal IP addresses, or cloud metadata endpoints. This is a *direct* threat because the vulnerability lies in how the URL is constructed and passed to Axios.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Access to internal services and data.
    *   Exposure of sensitive information (e.g., cloud credentials).
    *   Potential for remote code execution.
    *   Bypassing of network security controls.
*   **Axios Component Affected:** The URL passed to `axios.get()`, `axios.post()`, or any other Axios method that accepts a URL.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize user-provided input using a whitelist approach. Allow only specific, known-safe URLs or URL components.
    *   **Avoid Direct User Input:** Do not use user input directly in the URL. Use predefined URLs or API endpoints.
    *   **Proxy/API Gateway:** Use a proxy or API gateway to mediate requests and block access to internal resources.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Limit the application server's ability to access internal resources.
    *   **URL Construction Library:** Use a dedicated library for URL construction and validation.

## Threat: [Threat: Dependency Confusion/Substitution (Node.js)](./threats/threat_dependency_confusionsubstitution__node_js_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package to a public registry (e.g., npm) with a name similar to a private or internal package used by your application (or a dependency of Axios). Your application might inadvertently install the malicious package, leading to code execution. While Axios itself isn't *directly* vulnerable, the way Node.js resolves dependencies, and the fact that Axios *has* dependencies, makes this a relevant threat to consider. If a core Axios dependency were compromised, it would be a direct threat.
* **Impact:**
    * Remote code execution on the server.
    * Data exfiltration.
    * Complete system compromise.
* **Axios Component Affected:** Indirectly affects Axios through its dependencies or any custom interceptors/adapters that use third-party libraries.
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Private Package Registry:** Use a private package registry for internal packages.
    * **Scoped Packages:** Use scoped packages (e.g., `@myorg/mypackage`) to reduce naming collisions.
    * **Package Lock Files:** Use `package-lock.json` (npm) or `yarn.lock` (Yarn) to ensure consistent and reproducible builds.
    * **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    * **Vetting Dependencies:** Carefully vet all third-party dependencies, including their source code and maintainers.
