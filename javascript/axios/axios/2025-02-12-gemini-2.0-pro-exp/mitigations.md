# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for axios/axios

## Mitigation Strategy: [Axios CSRF Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/axios_csrf_configuration.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`xsrfCookieName` and `xsrfHeaderName`:** Configure Axios to use the correct cookie and header names that your backend expects for CSRF protection. This ensures Axios properly includes the CSRF token in requests.
        ```javascript
        axios.defaults.xsrfCookieName = 'XSRF-TOKEN'; // Name of the cookie the backend uses.
        axios.defaults.xsrfHeaderName = 'X-XSRF-TOKEN'; // Name of the header the backend uses.
        ```
    2.  **`withCredentials`:**  Carefully manage the `withCredentials` setting.
        *   If you *don't* need to send cookies or other credentials with your requests, explicitly set `withCredentials: false`. This is the default, but setting it explicitly is good practice and reduces the attack surface.
        *   If you *do* need to send credentials, ensure your backend has robust CSRF protection in place (Synchronizer Token Pattern, Double Submit Cookie, etc.).  *Never* use `withCredentials: true` without proper backend protection.
    3.  **Per-Request or Per-Instance Configuration:** Avoid setting global defaults for CSRF-related settings if different parts of your application have different requirements.  Configure these settings on a per-request or per-instance basis for greater control and security.  For example:

        ```javascript
        const instance = axios.create({
          xsrfCookieName: 'MY_CSRF_COOKIE',
          xsrfHeaderName: 'X-My-CSRF-Header',
          withCredentials: true, // Only if absolutely necessary and backend is protected!
        });

        instance.post('/some-api', data)
          .then(response => { ... });
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (when `withCredentials` is used or interacting with the same origin):** Severity: High. Axios's default behavior of sending cookies can exacerbate existing CSRF vulnerabilities if the backend isn't properly protected.
    *   **Session Riding:** Severity: High. A form of CSRF.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF:**  When combined with proper backend protection, reduces risk from High to Very Low.  Without backend protection, this setting alone does *not* prevent CSRF.
    *   **Session Riding:** Same as CSRF.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `xsrfHeaderName` is set in `[File: src/api/axiosConfig.js]`.
    *   `xsrfCookieName` is *not* explicitly set.
    *   `withCredentials` is not explicitly set (defaults to `false`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `xsrfCookieName` needs to be explicitly set in `[File: src/api/axiosConfig.js]` to match the backend's cookie name.
    *   Review all uses of Axios to ensure that `withCredentials` is only set to `true` when absolutely necessary and with corresponding backend CSRF protection. Consider per-request configuration instead of global defaults.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Axios Request Configuration for SSRF Prevention (Limited Scope)](./mitigation_strategies/axios_request_configuration_for_ssrf_prevention__limited_scope_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`maxRedirects`:**  Limit the number of redirects Axios will follow.  This helps prevent attacks that rely on redirecting to internal resources.  Set a reasonable limit (e.g., 5).
        ```javascript
        axios.defaults.maxRedirects = 5; // Or set per-request/instance.
        ```
    2.  **`timeout`:** Set a reasonable timeout for requests.  This prevents attackers from tying up your application with slow or non-responsive requests, and can indirectly mitigate some SSRF attempts.
        ```javascript
        axios.defaults.timeout = 5000; // 5 seconds (adjust as needed).
        ```
    3. **Custom `validateStatus`:** While not a direct SSRF prevention, you can use a custom `validateStatus` function to *additionally* check the response status code. This is more of a defense-in-depth measure. For example, you could reject any responses that indicate a redirect (3xx) if you *know* redirects should not be happening for a particular endpoint.
        ```javascript
        axios.get('/some-url', {
            validateStatus: function (status) {
              return status >= 200 && status < 300; // Default behavior, but you can customize.
              // Example: Reject all redirects:
              // return status >= 200 && status < 300;
            }
        });
        ```
    4. **Proxy Configuration (Careful Consideration):** If you *must* use a proxy, ensure the proxy itself is configured securely and does not allow access to internal resources.  Avoid using proxies if possible, as they add complexity and potential security risks.  If using a proxy, validate the proxy URL itself using the same strict validation as you would for any user-provided URL.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (limited mitigation):** Severity: High.  These Axios settings provide *limited* protection against SSRF.  The primary mitigation *must* be strict URL validation and allowlisting on the server-side or within your application logic before calling Axios.
    *   **Slowloris-type attacks (partially):** The `timeout` setting helps.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SSRF:**  Reduces the risk, but *does not eliminate it*.  These are secondary measures; proper URL validation is essential.
    *   **Slowloris:** `timeout` provides some mitigation.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `timeout` is implemented globally in `[File: src/api/axiosConfig.js]` with a timeout of 5 seconds.
    *   `maxRedirects` is not implemented.
    *   `validateStatus` is not customized.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implement `maxRedirects` in `[File: src/api/axiosConfig.js]`.
    *   Review the `timeout` value to ensure it's appropriate for all API endpoints.
    *   Consider adding a custom `validateStatus` function for specific endpoints where redirects are unexpected.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Axios Error Handling](./mitigation_strategies/secure_axios_error_handling.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sanitize Axios Error Objects:**  Before logging or displaying error messages, *remove* sensitive information from the Axios error object.  This is crucial.  Do *not* log the entire `error` object directly.  Specifically, avoid logging:
        *   `error.config.url`:  May contain sensitive parameters or internal URLs.
        *   `error.config.headers`:  May contain API keys, authorization tokens, or CSRF tokens.
        *   `error.response.data`:  May contain sensitive data from the server's response.
        *   `error.request`: May expose internal details of the request.
    2.  **Create a Sanitization Function:**  Write a utility function to sanitize Axios error objects.  This function should extract only the necessary, non-sensitive information (e.g., status code, a generic error message).
    3.  **Apply Sanitization Consistently:**  Use this sanitization function in *all* Axios `.catch()` blocks and error handling interceptors.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Error Messages:** Severity: Medium.  Sensitive data (API keys, internal URLs, etc.) could be leaked through poorly handled error messages.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Reduces risk from Medium to Low, provided the sanitization is thorough and consistently applied.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not consistently implemented. Some error handlers log the entire Axios error object.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Create a utility function to sanitize Axios error objects in `[File: src/utils/errorHandling.js]`.
    *   Apply this sanitization function in *all* Axios `.catch()` blocks and any error handling interceptors.  This should be applied in `[Files: All files with Axios .catch() blocks and interceptors]`.
