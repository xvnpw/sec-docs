Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the Axios library:

*   **Threat:** Malicious URL Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the URL used in an Axios request by injecting malicious characters or paths if the URL is constructed using unsanitized user input. This causes Axios to send requests to unintended servers or access unauthorized resources. For example, if `axios.get('/users/' + userId)` is used and `userId` is attacker-controlled, they could inject `../admin` to try and access admin endpoints.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, potential execution of unintended actions on other servers, information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Axios Component:** `axios.get`, `axios.post`, `axios` instance configuration (baseURL).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Always validate and sanitize user-provided input before incorporating it into URLs. Use parameterized requests or URL construction methods that prevent injection. Avoid directly concatenating user input into URLs.

*   **Threat:** HTTP Header Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious HTTP headers if header values are constructed using unsanitized user input. This causes Axios to send requests with crafted headers, potentially leading to security bypass, cache poisoning, or exploiting vulnerabilities in backend systems that process headers. For example, injecting `\r\n\r\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\nContent-Type: text/html\r\n\r\n<script>/* malicious script */</script>` could lead to unexpected responses.
    *   **Impact:** Security bypass, cross-site scripting (XSS) if the injected content is reflected, server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Axios Component:** `axios.defaults.headers`, custom header configurations in request options.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Sanitize and validate all user-provided input before setting it as header values. Use secure header setting methods provided by Axios and avoid direct string concatenation.

*   **Threat:** Insecure Deserialization via Custom Response Transformers
    *   **Description:** If the application uses custom response transformers in Axios and these transformers deserialize data in an unsafe manner (e.g., using `eval()` or similar functions on untrusted data), an attacker controlling the upstream server could send malicious data that, when processed by Axios's transformer, executes arbitrary code on the client or server (depending on where the transformation happens).
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, complete compromise of the application or user's environment.
    *   **Affected Axios Component:** `transformResponse` configuration option.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Avoid using custom response transformers that perform unsafe deserialization. If custom transformation is necessary, use secure and well-vetted libraries for parsing and deserialization. Treat data from external sources as untrusted.

*   **Threat:** Disabling TLS/SSL Certificate Verification
    *   **Description:** Axios allows disabling TLS/SSL certificate verification. If this option is used (e.g., `httpsAgent: new https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false })`), Axios will not validate the server's certificate, making the application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. An attacker could intercept and modify communication between the application and the remote server without Axios detecting it.
    *   **Impact:** Data interception, data manipulation, credential theft, impersonation of the server.
    *   **Affected Axios Component:** `httpsAgent` configuration option.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Never disable TLS/SSL certificate verification in production environments. Ensure that the application properly validates the server's certificate.

*   **Threat:** Leaking Sensitive Information in Request Logs
    *   **Description:** If request details configured within Axios, including sensitive data like API keys or authentication tokens in headers, are logged without proper redaction by the application's logging mechanisms, this information could be exposed to attackers who gain access to the logs.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, API keys, or personal data, leading to unauthorized access or further attacks.
    *   **Affected Axios Component:**  Axios request configuration (headers), logging mechanisms used by the application (triggered by Axios requests).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:** Implement secure logging practices. Avoid logging sensitive information in request details. If logging is necessary, redact sensitive headers before logging.

*   **Threat:** Misconfiguration of Proxy Settings
    *   **Description:** If proxy settings are configured within Axios and are misconfigured (e.g., using an open proxy or a compromised proxy), Axios will route the application's requests through an attacker-controlled server. This could allow the attacker to intercept, modify, or log the requests and responses handled by Axios.
    *   **Impact:** Data interception, data manipulation, potential injection of malicious content, exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Axios Component:** `proxy` configuration option.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Carefully configure proxy settings. Only use trusted and necessary proxy servers. Secure the proxy server itself to prevent compromise.
