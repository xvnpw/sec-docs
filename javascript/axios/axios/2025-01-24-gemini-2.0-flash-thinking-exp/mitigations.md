# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for axios/axios

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Disable or Restrict URL Redirection Following](./mitigation_strategies/1__disable_or_restrict_url_redirection_following.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Disable or Restrict URL Redirection Following
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Evaluate Necessity:** Determine if your application truly requires `axios` to automatically follow HTTP redirects.
    2.  **Disable Redirects:** If redirects are not needed, configure `axios` to disable automatic redirection. This can be done globally for an `axios` instance or per request using the `maxRedirects: 0` option in the request configuration.
    3.  **Restrict Redirects (If Necessary):** If redirects are required but need control:
        *   **Manual Handling:**  Set `maxRedirects` to a small number (e.g., `maxRedirects: 1`) to limit redirect hops.
        *   **Intercept and Validate:** Use `axios` interceptors to inspect the response and the `Location` header after each redirect. Implement custom logic within the interceptor to validate the redirect destination before allowing `axios` to follow it.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - **Severity: High** (Prevents attackers from potentially using open redirects on external sites to bypass destination host restrictions and target internal resources via SSRF).
    *   Open Redirect - **Severity: Medium** (Reduces the risk of open redirect vulnerabilities if your application handles redirects based on `axios` responses and user interaction).
*   **Impact:** **Medium Reduction** (Reduces the risk of SSRF and Open Redirect by preventing or controlling automatic redirection to potentially malicious or unintended destinations. Requires careful validation if redirects are still needed).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Default `axios` configuration allows redirects. Redirection following is generally used without specific restrictions or validation in `axios` configuration.
    *   *Location:* Default `axios` configuration across the application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Global or request-specific configuration using `maxRedirects: 0` to disable `axios` redirect following where appropriate.
    *   Implementation of `axios` interceptors to validate redirect destinations before following them when redirects are necessary.
    *   Documentation of redirection handling policies and `axios` configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Implement Request Timeouts](./mitigation_strategies/2__implement_request_timeouts.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Request Timeouts
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure `timeout` Option:** For all `axios` requests, explicitly set the `timeout` option in the request configuration. This sets a combined timeout in milliseconds for the entire request lifecycle (connection, sending, receiving). Choose a value appropriate for expected response times.
    2.  **Separate `connectTimeout` and `responseTimeout`:** For finer control, use `connectTimeout` (time to establish a connection) and `responseTimeout` (time to wait for a response after connection) options in milliseconds. Configure these separately based on your needs.
    3.  **Global Defaults (Optional):** Set default timeouts for `axios` instances using `axios.defaults.timeout`, `axios.defaults.connectTimeout`, and `axios.defaults.responseTimeout` to ensure consistent timeout behavior across the application.
    4.  **Error Handling:** Implement error handling in your `axios` request logic to catch `ECONNABORTED` errors, which are thrown when a timeout occurs.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - **Severity: Medium** (Prevents your application from becoming unresponsive or hanging indefinitely due to slow or unresponsive external services, mitigating a potential DoS vulnerability).
*   **Impact:** **Medium Reduction** (Reduces the risk of DoS by preventing resource exhaustion due to prolonged waiting for responses. Improves application resilience and responsiveness by using `axios` timeout configurations).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Default `axios` timeout is used (which might be very long or non-existent depending on the environment). Explicit timeouts using `timeout`, `connectTimeout`, or `responseTimeout` options are not consistently configured in `axios` requests.
    *   *Location:* Default `axios` configuration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent configuration of explicit `timeout`, `connectTimeout`, and `responseTimeout` options for all relevant `axios` requests.
    *   Setting appropriate global default timeouts for `axios` instances.
    *   Implementation of error handling specifically for timeout errors (`ECONNABORTED`) in `axios` request error handling.
    *   Documentation of timeout policies and `axios` configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Explicitly Configure HTTPS](./mitigation_strategies/3__explicitly_configure_https.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Explicitly Configure HTTPS
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use `https://` Protocol in URLs:**  Always use `https://` in the URLs you provide to `axios` for both external and internal service requests.
    2.  **Base URL Configuration:** When setting a base URL for `axios` instances using `axios.create({ baseURL: ... })`, ensure the base URL starts with `https://`.
    3.  **HTTPS Proxy Configuration (if needed):** If using a proxy, configure `axios` to use an HTTPS proxy using the `proxy` option in request configuration or `axios.defaults.proxy`. Ensure the proxy URL starts with `https://` if the proxy itself requires HTTPS. Consider using the `https-proxy` option for more specific HTTPS proxy settings.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks - **Severity: High** (Protects data in transit from eavesdropping and tampering by ensuring `axios` communication is encrypted using HTTPS).
    *   Data Breaches - **Severity: High** (Reduces the risk of sensitive data being intercepted during transmission by enforcing HTTPS in `axios` requests).
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** (Significantly reduces the risk of MitM attacks and data breaches by ensuring encrypted communication through explicit HTTPS configuration in `axios`).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented - Most `axios` requests are made over HTTPS, but there might be instances where HTTP is still used, especially for internal services or during development. HTTPS proxy configuration is not consistently applied where proxies are used with `axios`.
    *   *Location:* HTTPS is used for most external API calls and public-facing application parts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review and enforcement of `https://` protocol in all URLs used with `axios`, including base URLs and proxy configurations.
    *   Explicit configuration of HTTPS proxies using `axios` `proxy` or `https-proxy` options where applicable.
    *   Documentation of HTTPS enforcement policies for `axios` requests and proxy usage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Validate TLS Certificates (Default Behavior)](./mitigation_strategies/4__validate_tls_certificates__default_behavior_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Validate TLS Certificates (Default Behavior)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Maintain Default `axios` Configuration:**  `axios` defaults to validating TLS/SSL certificates. **Do not disable this default behavior in production environments.**
    2.  **Avoid `httpsAgent` with `rejectUnauthorized: false` in Production:**  Never set the `rejectUnauthorized: false` option within the `httpsAgent` configuration (or directly in request options) in production. This disables crucial certificate validation.
    3.  **Development/Testing Exceptions (Cautiously):** If you must disable certificate validation for testing with self-signed certificates, use `httpsAgent` with `rejectUnauthorized: false` **only in development or controlled testing environments.** Ensure this is never deployed to production.
    4.  **Review `httpsAgent` Configuration:** Regularly review your `axios` configuration, especially any custom `httpsAgent` settings, to ensure `rejectUnauthorized` is not set to `false` in production.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks - **Severity: High** (Certificate validation in `axios` is crucial for preventing MitM attacks by ensuring you are communicating with the legitimate server).
    *   Data Breaches - **Severity: High** (Disabling certificate validation in `axios` weakens HTTPS security and significantly increases the risk of data interception).
*   **Impact:** **High Reduction** (Maintaining default TLS certificate validation in `axios` provides a fundamental security control against MitM attacks and data breaches. It is essential for secure HTTPS communication).
*   **Currently Implemented:** Implemented by Default - `axios` defaults to validating TLS certificates. No explicit configuration to disable validation is currently present in production `axios` configurations.
    *   *Location:* Default `axios` behavior.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Explicit documentation of the policy to always validate TLS certificates in production `axios` configurations and to avoid disabling validation unless absolutely necessary in controlled non-production environments.
    *   Regular audits of `axios` configurations, particularly `httpsAgent` settings, to ensure certificate validation remains enabled and `rejectUnauthorized: false` is not present in production.
