# Threat Model Analysis for axios/axios

## Threat: [Malicious Request Interceptors](./threats/malicious_request_interceptors.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious code into a request interceptor. This could happen if the application allows untrusted input to define interceptors or if a vulnerability in another part of the application allows code injection. The attacker could modify outgoing requests to exfiltrate data, perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attacks by changing the request destination, or bypass authentication by manipulating headers. This directly utilizes Axios's interceptor mechanism.

**Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to internal resources, compromise of backend systems.

**Affected Axios Component:** `interceptors.request.use` (module and function for adding request interceptors)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input used to define or configure request interceptors.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit the ability to define or modify interceptors to only trusted parts of the application.
* **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code that defines or uses interceptors for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Response Interceptors](./threats/malicious_response_interceptors.md)

**Description:** Similar to request interceptors, an attacker could inject malicious code into a response interceptor. This could allow them to modify the data received from the server before it's processed by the application, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) by injecting malicious scripts into the response, or manipulating the application's logic based on altered data. This directly utilizes Axios's interceptor mechanism.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting attacks, manipulation of application behavior, potential data corruption on the client-side.

**Affected Axios Component:** `interceptors.response.use` (module and function for adding response interceptors)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any input used to define or configure response interceptors.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Limit the ability to define or modify interceptors to only trusted parts of the application.
* **Code Reviews:** Regularly review code that defines or uses interceptors for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Data Transformation](./threats/insecure_data_transformation.md)

**Description:** If the application uses `transformRequest` or `transformResponse` functions with insecure logic, an attacker might be able to manipulate the data being sent or received. For example, if `transformRequest` doesn't properly escape data, it could lead to injection vulnerabilities on the server-side. Similarly, insecure `transformResponse` could introduce vulnerabilities when processing the server's response. This directly involves Axios's data transformation features.

**Impact:** Server-side injection vulnerabilities, data corruption, unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Axios Component:** `transformRequest` and `transformResponse` (configuration options within the Axios request configuration)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Secure Data Handling:** Implement secure data handling practices within the transformation functions, including proper encoding, escaping, and validation.
* **Avoid Custom Transformations When Possible:**  Rely on built-in Axios features or well-vetted libraries for common data transformations.
* **Code Reviews:** Carefully review the logic within `transformRequest` and `transformResponse` functions.

## Threat: [Insecure Proxy Configuration](./threats/insecure_proxy_configuration.md)

**Description:** If the application uses Axios's proxy settings and the configured proxy server is compromised or malicious, an attacker controlling the proxy can intercept, modify, or log all requests and responses passing through it. This directly involves Axios's proxy configuration.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, data exfiltration, credential theft, manipulation of requests and responses.

**Affected Axios Component:** `proxy` (configuration option within the Axios request configuration)

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Trusted Proxies:** Only use proxy servers that are known to be secure and trustworthy.
* **Secure Communication to Proxy:** Ensure communication with the proxy server is encrypted (e.g., HTTPS proxy).
* **Avoid Hardcoding Proxy Credentials:**  Store proxy credentials securely and avoid hardcoding them in the application.

## Threat: [Ignoring TLS/SSL Verification Errors](./threats/ignoring_tlsssl_verification_errors.md)

**Description:** Disabling or improperly configuring TLS/SSL certificate verification (e.g., using `rejectUnauthorized: false` in Node.js or similar browser configurations) makes the application vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker can intercept communication between the application and the server, potentially stealing sensitive data or injecting malicious content. This directly involves Axios's configuration options for HTTPS.

**Impact:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, data breaches, interception of sensitive information.

**Affected Axios Component:** `httpsAgent` (configuration option in Node.js environment)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enable Strict TLS/SSL Verification:**  Ensure TLS/SSL certificate verification is enabled and configured correctly.
* **Use HTTPS:** Always communicate with servers over HTTPS.

## Threat: [Using Insecure Protocols](./threats/using_insecure_protocols.md)

**Description:** Explicitly configuring Axios to use insecure protocols like HTTP instead of HTTPS exposes communication to eavesdropping and tampering. An attacker on the network can intercept and modify the data being transmitted. This directly involves how Axios is configured to make requests.

**Impact:** Data breaches, interception and modification of sensitive information.

**Affected Axios Component:** `httpAgent`, `httpsAgent`, or explicitly specifying `http://` in the request URL.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Enforce HTTPS:**  Always use HTTPS for communication.
* **Avoid Explicitly Configuring HTTP:** Do not explicitly configure Axios to use HTTP unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Axios Library](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_axios_library.md)

**Description:** Like any software, Axios itself might contain security vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability is discovered and exploited, it could allow attackers to compromise the application.

**Impact:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Affected Axios Component:** Entire Axios library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Axios Updated:** Regularly update Axios to the latest version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
* **Monitor Security Advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories related to Axios.
