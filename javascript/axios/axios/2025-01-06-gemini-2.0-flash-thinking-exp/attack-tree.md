## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Axios Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_axios_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies the specific version of Axios used by the application. They then search for publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with that version. If a suitable vulnerability exists (e.g., allowing remote code execution or arbitrary file read), the attacker crafts an exploit to leverage this flaw and compromise the application.

**Steps:**
* Identify Axios version.
* Search for CVEs for that version.
* Develop or find an existing exploit.
* Execute the exploit against the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Unvalidated URLs [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_unvalidated_urls__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application takes user-controlled input (e.g., a URL parameter) and uses it to construct a URL that is then passed to Axios for making an HTTP request. If the application does not properly validate or sanitize this user-provided input, an attacker can inject arbitrary URLs. This allows the attacker to make requests to internal services or external resources from the application's server, potentially bypassing firewalls or accessing sensitive data.

**Steps:**
* Identify an application feature that uses user input to construct Axios request URLs.
* Inject a malicious URL targeting internal resources or external services.
* Observe the application's behavior or the response from the targeted resource.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Request Headers/Body [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_request_headersbody__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Developers may inadvertently include sensitive information like API keys, authentication tokens, or personal data directly within the headers or body of HTTP requests made by Axios. If these requests are intercepted (e.g., via network sniffing or a compromised proxy), the attacker gains access to this sensitive information.

**Steps:**
* Identify Axios requests made by the application.
* Intercept network traffic (e.g., using Wireshark or a proxy).
* Examine the headers and body of the intercepted requests for sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Response Data](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_response_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application receives data in the response from an Axios request and directly renders this data in the user's web browser without proper sanitization or encoding. If the attacker can control part of this response data (e.g., through a compromised external API or a manipulated internal service), they can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.

**Steps:**
* Identify an application feature that renders data from Axios responses.
* Control or influence the content of the Axios response.
* Inject malicious JavaScript code into the response.
* Observe the execution of the injected script in a user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Deserialization Issues](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__via_deserialization_issues.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application deserializes data received in the response from an Axios request without proper validation, and the deserialization process is vulnerable, an attacker can craft a malicious serialized object. When this object is deserialized by the application, it can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.

**Steps:**
* Identify an application feature that deserializes data from Axios responses.
* Determine the deserialization library and its potential vulnerabilities.
* Craft a malicious serialized object.
* Send a response containing the malicious object to the application.
* Trigger the deserialization process and achieve code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Axios Requests [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_axios_requests__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application does not enforce HTTPS for its Axios requests or does not properly validate SSL/TLS certificates, an attacker positioned between the application and the server it's communicating with can intercept the network traffic. This allows the attacker to read sensitive data being transmitted, modify the requests being sent, or even inject malicious responses.

**Steps:**
* Position an attacker-controlled machine on the network path between the application and the target server.
* Intercept the HTTP traffic.
* Decrypt the traffic (if HTTPS is not properly implemented or certificates are not validated).
* Read or modify the requests and responses as needed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Outdated or Vulnerable Axios Version [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/using_outdated_or_vulnerable_axios_version__critical_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses an older version of the Axios library that contains known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can easily find information about these vulnerabilities and develop or utilize existing exploits to compromise the application. This is often a low-effort attack if the vulnerability is well-documented and easily exploitable.

**Steps:**
* Identify the Axios version used by the application.
* Search for known vulnerabilities (CVEs) associated with that version.
* Utilize existing exploits or develop new ones to target the identified vulnerabilities.
