# Attack Surface Analysis for axios/axios

## Attack Surface: [URL Injection](./attack_surfaces/url_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can control or influence the destination URL of an HTTP request made by the application.
    *   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios directly uses the provided URL string in its request methods (`axios.get(url)`, `axios.post(url, ...)`, etc.). If this URL is constructed using unsanitized user input or data from untrusted sources, an attacker can inject a malicious URL.
    *   **Impact:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), where the application can be tricked into making requests to internal resources or external malicious sites. This can lead to data breaches, internal network scanning, or interaction with unintended APIs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided data or external data used to construct URLs. Use allow-lists or URL parsing libraries to ensure the URL is within expected boundaries.
        *   Avoid string concatenation for URLs. Use URL builder libraries or functions that handle URL encoding and parameterization correctly to prevent injection.

## Attack Surface: [Header Injection](./attack_surfaces/header_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTTP headers into a request made by the application.
    *   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios allows setting custom headers through the `headers` option in the request configuration. If header values are constructed using unsanitized input, attackers can inject malicious headers.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Bypassing security measures on the target server.
        *   Cache poisoning.
        *   Information disclosure from the target server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strictly validate and sanitize header values. Enforce allowed characters and formats.
        *   Avoid constructing headers from untrusted input.
        *   Utilize Axios' built-in mechanisms for setting standard headers rather than manually constructing them with user input.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Redirects](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_redirects.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker can manipulate the application into making requests to unintended internal or external resources by exploiting how Axios handles HTTP redirects.
    *   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios, by default, follows HTTP redirects. If the application doesn't validate the target of a redirect, an attacker can cause the application to make requests to arbitrary URLs.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, or further exploitation of internal systems.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure Axios to limit the number of redirects it follows using the `maxRedirects` option.
        *   Implement logic to validate the target URL of redirects before allowing Axios to follow them. Allow only specific domains or paths.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure TLS/SSL Configuration](./attack_surfaces/insecure_tlsssl_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Misconfiguring TLS/SSL settings in Axios can weaken the security of HTTPS connections, making them vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.
    *   **How Axios Contributes:** Axios provides options to configure TLS settings, such as `rejectUnauthorized` (to control certificate verification). Disabling certificate verification in production environments is a significant security risk.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data transmitted over HTTPS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure `rejectUnauthorized` is set to `true` (or not explicitly set, as `true` is the default) in production environments to enforce strict certificate verification.
        *   Ensure the system's CA certificates are up-to-date.
        *   Consider certificate pinning for highly sensitive applications.
