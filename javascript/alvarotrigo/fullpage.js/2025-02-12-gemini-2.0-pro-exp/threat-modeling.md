# Threat Model Analysis for alvarotrigo/fullpage.js

## Threat: [Exploitation of `scrollOverflow` Option Vulnerability](./threats/exploitation_of__scrolloverflow__option_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:**  Exploitation of `scrollOverflow` Option Vulnerability (if present in a specific version)

    *   **Description:**  If a specific version of fullPage.js contains a vulnerability in how it handles the `scrollOverflow` option (and potentially related internal functions like `iscrollHandler` if custom scrollbars are used), an attacker could exploit this vulnerability directly. This would likely involve crafting malicious input designed to trigger the vulnerability, even without direct user interaction within the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Could range from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to more severe consequences, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. The attacker might be able to execute arbitrary code or manipulate the scrolling behavior to bypass security controls *within the context of fullPage.js's functionality*.
    *   **Affected Component:** `scrollOverflow` option, and potentially related internal functions like `iscrollHandler` (especially if custom scrollbars are used).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if a severe vulnerability exists).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediately update** fullPage.js to the latest stable version. This is the *primary* mitigation.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, Snyk, GitHub Security Advisories) specifically for fullPage.js.
        *   If a vulnerable version must be used temporarily, consider disabling the `scrollOverflow` option if it's not essential, or implementing strict input validation and sanitization *even if the content appears to be static*.

## Threat: [Zero-Day Vulnerability in Core fullPage.js Functionality](./threats/zero-day_vulnerability_in_core_fullpage_js_functionality.md)

*   **Threat:**  Zero-Day Vulnerability in Core fullPage.js Functionality

    *   **Description:**  An attacker discovers and exploits a previously unknown (zero-day) vulnerability in a core component of fullPage.js, such as its event handling, DOM manipulation, or animation logic. This is a general threat to *any* software, but is included here because it directly impacts fullPage.js.
    *   **Impact:**  Highly variable, depending on the nature of the vulnerability. Could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution (XSS or worse). The attacker could potentially gain complete control over the fullPage.js component's behavior.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Potentially any core component of fullPage.js, including event handling, DOM manipulation, animation logic, or internal utility functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Proactive:**
            *   Keep fullPage.js updated to the latest stable version.  While this won't protect against a true zero-day, it reduces the window of vulnerability.
            *   Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF) with rules designed to detect and block common web attacks, which might provide some protection even against unknown vulnerabilities.
        *   **Reactive:**
            *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases *very closely*.
            *   If a zero-day is announced, immediately apply any available patches or workarounds provided by the fullPage.js developers.
            *   If no patch is available, consider temporarily disabling fullPage.js or the affected features until a fix is released.  This is a drastic measure, but may be necessary to protect the application.
            * Implement emergency security measures, such as increased logging and monitoring, to detect and respond to potential exploitation attempts.
