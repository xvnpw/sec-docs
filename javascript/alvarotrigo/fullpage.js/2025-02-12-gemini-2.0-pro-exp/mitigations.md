## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization with DOMPurify (for fullPage.js callbacks and options)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_with_dompurify__for_fullpage_js_callbacks_and_options_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Input Points:** Identify all points where user-supplied data is used within fullPage.js *callbacks* (e.g., `afterLoad`, `onLeave`, `afterRender`) and *options* that can accept JavaScript code or influence DOM manipulation.
2.  **Implement DOMPurify:** Integrate the DOMPurify library.
3.  **Sanitize Before Use:** Before using *any* user-supplied data in a fullPage.js callback or option, pass the data through DOMPurify's `sanitize()` method: `let sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);`.
4.  **Configure DOMPurify:** Configure DOMPurify to allow safe HTML tags/attributes needed for your fullPage.js implementation, disallowing dangerous ones. Start restrictively.
5.  **Type Validation:** Perform strict type validation. If a fullPage.js option expects a number, ensure the input is a number. Use regular expressions for specific string formats.
6.  **Encode for Context:** If outputting sanitized data within a specific context (e.g., HTML attribute), use appropriate encoding.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious JavaScript into fullPage.js callbacks or options.
    *   **DOM Manipulation Vulnerabilities (related to fullPage.js):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces risk of DOM manipulation *through* fullPage.js's functionality.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (nearly eliminated with correct implementation).
    *   **DOM Manipulation:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Implemented in `comments.js` when displaying user comments within a fullPage.js section's `afterLoad` callback.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Missing in `profile.js` where user profile data is used in the `onLeave` callback.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Indirect Callback Handling (within fullPage.js)](./mitigation_strategies/indirect_callback_handling__within_fullpage_js_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Direct Embeddings:** Find all instances where user input is *directly* embedded within fullPage.js callback function strings or options.
2.  **Use Data Attributes:** Store *sanitized* user data in data attributes of the relevant HTML elements (sections, slides) that fullPage.js manages.
3.  **Predefined Callbacks:** Create predefined, safe callback functions that retrieve data from these data attributes *within* the fullPage.js context.
4.  **Refactor fullPage.js Callbacks:** Refactor the fullPage.js configuration to use these predefined callbacks, passing data indirectly via data attributes.  This keeps the callback logic itself safe.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (via fullPage.js callbacks):** (Severity: High) - Reduces XSS risk by avoiding direct embedding of user input in fullPage.js's executable code.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Partially implemented; used in `navigation.js` but not in `formHandler.js` for fullPage.js callbacks.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Missing in `formHandler.js` where user input is directly used in fullPage.js's `afterLoad` callback.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Animation Complexity and Provide Disable Option (within fullPage.js)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_animation_complexity_and_provide_disable_option__within_fullpage_js_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review fullPage.js Animations:** Review all animations and transitions *configured within fullPage.js* for excessive complexity.
2.  **Simplify Animations:** Simplify or optimize animations used *by fullPage.js*. Consider CSS transitions where appropriate, controlled through fullPage.js options.
3.  **Detect Device Capabilities:** Use JavaScript to detect device capabilities and adjust fullPage.js's animation settings (e.g., `easing`, `scrollingSpeed`) accordingly.
4.  **User Setting (linked to fullPage.js):** Provide a user setting to disable or reduce animations, and use this setting to modify fullPage.js's configuration (e.g., set `animateAnchor` to `false`, increase `scrollingSpeed`).
5.  **Accessibility:** Ensure fullPage.js animations don't violate accessibility guidelines.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (via fullPage.js):** (Severity: Low) - Reduces performance issues exploitable for DoS, specifically related to fullPage.js's animations.
    *   **Accessibility Issues (within fullPage.js):** (Severity: Medium) - Improves accessibility.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduced.
    *   **Accessibility:** Significantly improved.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Partially implemented; fullPage.js animations are optimized, but no disable option that directly interacts with fullPage.js settings.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Missing user option to disable animations that modifies fullPage.js's configuration. Missing device capability detection to adjust fullPage.js settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate and Use Predefined Anchor Names (for fullPage.js navigation)](./mitigation_strategies/validate_and_use_predefined_anchor_names__for_fullpage_js_navigation_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Avoid User-Defined Anchors:** Do *not* allow users to directly define or modify the anchor names used by fullPage.js for navigation.
2.  **Predefined Anchors:** Use a predefined, static set of anchor names (e.g., `#section1`, `#section2`) hardcoded in your application and used in the fullPage.js configuration.
3.  **Validation (if absolutely necessary):** If user input *must* influence anchor names (strongly discouraged), strictly validate the input to ensure it's safe and compatible with fullPage.js.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unexpected Navigation Behavior (within fullPage.js):** (Severity: Low) - Prevents manipulation of fullPage.js's navigation.
    *   **Potential XSS (in combination with other vulnerabilities, via fullPage.js):** (Severity: Low) - Reduces a potential attack vector.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unexpected Navigation:** Risk eliminated.
    *   **Potential XSS:** Risk reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Implemented; using predefined anchor names in the fullPage.js configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Not applicable (predefined anchors are used with fullPage.js).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Debugging in Production (specifically fullPage.js options)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_debugging_in_production__specifically_fullpage_js_options_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Debugging Options:** Review fullPage.js *documentation* and your application code to identify any fullPage.js-specific debugging options (e.g., verbose logging, developer tools integration).
2.  **Configuration:** Configure fullPage.js (through its options) to disable these features in the production environment. This might involve setting environment variables or using conditional code.
3.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test the production configuration to ensure fullPage.js debugging is disabled.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (through fullPage.js):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents exposure of sensitive information via fullPage.js's debugging output.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk significantly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Implemented; fullPage.js debugging options are disabled in production via environment variables that affect the fullPage.js configuration.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Not applicable (fullPage.js debugging is disabled).
