## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Callbacks/Events (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_callbacksevents__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary entry point for high-risk attacks. fullPage.js's extensive use of callbacks creates opportunities for attackers to inject malicious code or manipulate application behavior if these callbacks are not handled securely.
*   **Overall Risk:** High
*   **Why it's Critical:** This node is the gateway to several high-impact attacks, making it a crucial point of defense.

## Attack Tree Path: [Hijack Navigation Callbacks](./attack_tree_paths/hijack_navigation_callbacks.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers attempt to modify the `window.location` object within a fullPage.js callback (e.g., `onLeave`, `afterLoad`). This redirects the user to a malicious website controlled by the attacker.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application uses a callback function whose behavior is influenced by user-supplied data *without* proper sanitization or validation.  For example, a URL parameter might be directly used to construct part of the callback's code.
*   **Overall Risk:** High
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Highly dependent on application implementation)
*   **Impact:** High (Leads to phishing, malware distribution)
*   **Effort:** Low (Basic JavaScript injection)
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify window.location (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/modify_window_location__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The core mechanism of the navigation hijack.  Directly changing `window.location` forces the browser to load a new page.
*   **Overall Risk:** High
*   **Why it's Critical:** This is the direct action that causes the redirection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Redirect to Malicious Page (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_to_malicious_page__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The user is sent to a website designed to look like a legitimate site (e.g., a bank login page) or to deliver malware.
*   **Overall Risk:** High
*   **Why it's Critical:** This is the immediate, harmful consequence of the hijack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Phishing (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/phishing__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker attempts to steal user credentials (usernames, passwords, credit card details) by tricking them into entering information on the fake website.
*   **Overall Risk:** High
*   **Why it's Critical:** This represents a significant data breach and potential financial loss for the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Unintended Actions (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_unintended_actions__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit callbacks to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application. This gives them a high degree of control over the client-side behavior.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   Similar to navigation hijacking, this relies on user-supplied data being used to construct or modify callback functions without proper sanitization.  The attacker injects JavaScript code that will be executed by the callback.
*   **Overall Risk:** Very High
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Highly dependent on application implementation)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Complete client-side control, potential for data exfiltration, session hijacking)
*   **Effort:** Low (If a vulnerability exists, exploitation is trivial)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Why it's Critical:** This represents the highest level of compromise on the client-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary JavaScript (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_javascript__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker's injected code is executed by the browser, allowing them to perform actions they shouldn't be able to.
*   **Overall Risk:** Very High
*   **Why it's Critical:** This is the core mechanism of the attack, giving the attacker full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker crafts and inserts the JavaScript payload that will be executed.
*   **Overall Risk:** Very High
*   **Why it's Critical:** This is the step where the malicious code enters the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [XSS, if combined with other vulnerabilities (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/xss__if_combined_with_other_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** While fullPage.js itself might not be *directly* vulnerable to XSS, its callbacks can be a vector *if* the application has other input sanitization flaws.  The attacker uses the fullPage.js callback as a way to execute their XSS payload.
*   **Overall Risk:** High
*   **Why it's Critical:** XSS is a major web vulnerability with severe consequences.
