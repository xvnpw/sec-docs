## Attack Surface: [Potential XSS in Callback Functions](./attack_surfaces/potential_xss_in_callback_functions.md)

* **Attack Surface: Potential XSS in Callback Functions**
    * Description: `fullpage.js` provides various callback functions like `afterLoad`, `onLeave`, etc. If developers implement custom logic within these callbacks that directly renders user-controlled data without proper sanitization, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    * How fullpage.js Contributes: `fullpage.js` triggers these callbacks and can pass information about the current and previous sections. If this information includes unsanitized user input, it becomes a vector for XSS.
    * Example: The `afterLoad` callback is used to display a welcome message that includes the name of the section, which is derived from user input. If this name is not sanitized, a malicious user could inject JavaScript code within the section name.
    * Impact:  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    * Risk Severity: High
    * Mitigation Strategies:
        * Strict output encoding: Always encode user-controlled data before rendering it within callback functions. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML encoding for HTML content, JavaScript encoding for JavaScript strings).
        * Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
        * Regular security audits: Review the code within callback functions to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities.
