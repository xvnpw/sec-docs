# Threat Model Analysis for alvarotrigo/fullpage.js

## Threat: [DOM Manipulation for Content Injection (XSS)](./threats/dom_manipulation_for_content_injection__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in the application's handling of dynamic content within `fullpage.js` sections. If the application renders unsanitized user-provided data or data from untrusted sources within a section managed by `fullpage.js`, an attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser. While the vulnerability lies in the application's data handling, `fullpage.js`'s role in rendering the content makes it a direct component involved in the exploitation.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to potential session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected Component:** The application's code interacting with the DOM elements managed by `fullpage.js` to inject content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided data or data from untrusted sources before rendering it within `fullpage.js` sections.
*   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
*   Regularly review and update the application's code to identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in fullpage.js Dependencies](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_fullpage_js_dependencies.md)

**Description:** `fullpage.js` might rely on other JavaScript libraries or have its own dependencies. If these dependencies contain known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them through the application's use of `fullpage.js`. This is a direct involvement of `fullpage.js` as it includes and utilizes these dependencies.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.

**Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable dependency included within the `fullpage.js` library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Regularly update `fullpage.js` to the latest version, which often includes updates to its dependencies.
*   Utilize tools like npm audit or Yarn audit to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies, including those of `fullpage.js`.
*   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to continuously monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Abuse of Callbacks and Event Handlers](./threats/abuse_of_callbacks_and_event_handlers.md)

**Description:** `fullpage.js` provides various callbacks and event handlers. If the application's implementation of these callbacks contains vulnerabilities, such as directly rendering unsanitized user input, it could be exploited. The vulnerability lies in how the application uses `fullpage.js`'s features, making it a direct component in the threat.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) if callbacks are used to render unsanitized data, or other application-level vulnerabilities depending on the callback's functionality.

**Affected Component:** The application's JavaScript code that defines and implements the callback functions provided by `fullpage.js` (e.g., `afterLoad`, `onLeave`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Treat data received within `fullpage.js` callbacks as potentially untrusted and apply appropriate sanitization and validation.
*   Avoid performing security-sensitive operations directly within client-side callbacks without proper authorization and validation.
*   Follow secure coding practices when implementing callback functions.
