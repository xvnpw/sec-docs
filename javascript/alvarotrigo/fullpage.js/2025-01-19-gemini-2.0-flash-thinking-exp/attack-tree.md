## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using fullpage.js (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_fullpage_js__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. All subsequent paths aim to achieve this.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit fullpage.js Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fullpage_js_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* This category focuses on exploiting inherent weaknesses or bugs within the fullpage.js library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [DOM Manipulation Issues (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/dom_manipulation_issues__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Elements (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_elements__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages fullpage.js's DOM manipulation capabilities to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the page.
    * **Mechanism:** This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in how fullpage.js handles dynamically added content, or by manipulating data passed to fullpage.js that is then rendered into the DOM without proper sanitization.
    * **Impact:** Successful injection leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via fullpage.js (CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_fullpage_js__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Script via Anchor Links (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_script_via_anchor_links__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into anchor links that are processed by fullpage.js.
    * **Mechanism:** If fullpage.js doesn't properly sanitize or escape anchor link attributes (e.g., `href`), a crafted link can execute JavaScript when the user interacts with it or when fullpage.js processes it.
    * **Impact:** Leads to XSS, with the same potential consequences as above.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Callbacks or Event Handlers (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_callbacks_or_event_handlers__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in how fullpage.js handles callbacks or event handlers to inject malicious scripts.
    * **Mechanism:** If fullpage.js allows passing unsanitized data to callback functions or event handlers, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript through these parameters. When the callback is executed, the injected script runs.
    * **Impact:** Leads to XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Application's Use of fullpage.js (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_application's_use_of_fullpage_js__high-risk_path_.md)

* This category focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates and configures fullpage.js, rather than flaws in the library itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_configuration.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Expose Sensitive Information via Configuration (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_information_via_configuration__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application inadvertently exposes sensitive information within the fullpage.js configuration.
    * **Mechanism:** This could involve hardcoding API keys, secrets, or other sensitive data directly in the HTML attributes used to configure fullpage.js, or in easily accessible JavaScript variables.
    * **Impact:** Direct exposure of sensitive data can lead to account compromise, unauthorized access to resources, or other security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Callback Abuse (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/callback_abuse__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Unintended Actions via Callbacks (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_unintended_actions_via_callbacks__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates user interactions or directly calls fullpage.js callbacks to trigger unintended actions within the application.
    * **Mechanism:** If the application relies on fullpage.js callbacks (e.g., `afterLoad`, `onLeave`) to trigger server-side requests or other critical actions without proper authorization or validation, an attacker can exploit this to perform unauthorized operations.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation, or other unintended consequences depending on the application's logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Injection via Callbacks (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/data_injection_via_callbacks__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious data through parameters passed to fullpage.js callback functions.
    * **Mechanism:** If the application doesn't properly validate the data received in fullpage.js callbacks before using it in application logic or server-side requests, an attacker can inject malicious data to manipulate the application's behavior.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to various issues depending on how the injected data is used, including data corruption, security breaches, or further exploitation.
