Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving `fullPage.js`, with high and critical risk severity:

**Key Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration Options**

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the application through dynamically generated `fullPage.js` configuration options.
*   **How fullPage.js contributes:** `fullPage.js` accepts various configuration options, some of which might be dynamically generated by the application. If user-supplied data is used to construct these options without proper sanitization, it can introduce XSS vulnerabilities. Callbacks like `afterLoad` or `onLeave` are particularly susceptible if their function bodies are built dynamically.
*   **Example:** An attacker could manipulate a URL parameter that is used to set the `afterLoad` callback in the `fullPage.js` configuration. For instance, `afterLoad: function(origin, destination, direction){ eval(getParameterByName('callback')); }` where `callback` is a URL parameter. An attacker could then craft a URL like `?callback=alert('XSS')`.
*   **Impact:** Successful XSS can lead to various malicious activities, including stealing user credentials, session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious websites, and defacing the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never use `eval()` or similar functions to dynamically construct JavaScript code from user input.**
    *   **Avoid dynamically generating `fullPage.js` configuration options based on user input whenever possible.**
    *   **If dynamic configuration is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided data before using it in `fullPage.js` options.** Use appropriate encoding techniques for JavaScript strings.
    *   **Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, which can help mitigate the impact of XSS.**

**Key Attack Surface: DOM-Based XSS through Section Content**

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the HTML content of sections managed by `fullPage.js`.
*   **How fullPage.js contributes:** `fullPage.js` renders and manages the display of HTML content within its sections. If this content is sourced from untrusted sources or dynamically generated without proper encoding, it can be a vector for DOM-based XSS.
*   **Example:** An application might fetch section content from a database or API and directly inject it into the DOM within a `fullPage.js` section. If this data contains unsanitized HTML with malicious scripts (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`), it will be executed when the section is rendered.
*   **Impact:** Similar to reflected XSS, DOM-based XSS can lead to credential theft, session hijacking, redirection, and application defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always sanitize and encode any user-provided or untrusted data before inserting it into the HTML content of `fullPage.js` sections.** Use context-aware output encoding techniques appropriate for HTML.
    *   **Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the risk of executing unintended scripts.**
    *   **Regularly review and audit the sources of content used within `fullPage.js` sections.**
