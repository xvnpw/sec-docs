# BUSINESS POSTURE

*   Business Priorities and Goals
    *   Provide web developers with a user-friendly and efficient JavaScript library to create full-screen scrolling websites.
    *   Enable visually engaging and interactive web experiences for website visitors.
    *   Maintain a lightweight and performant library to ensure fast loading times and smooth scrolling.
    *   Offer a customizable and flexible solution to cater to diverse website design requirements.
*   Business Risks
    *   Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by malicious actors, potentially affecting websites that implement it.
    *   Performance issues or bugs in the library could negatively impact the user experience and website functionality.
    *   Lack of compatibility with certain browsers or devices could limit the reach and usability of websites using the library.
    *   Poor documentation or lack of community support could hinder adoption and developer satisfaction.

# SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing Security Controls
    *   security control: Code hosted on GitHub, allowing for community review and contributions. Implemented: GitHub repository.
    *   security control: Open-source license, promoting transparency and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented: LICENSE file in repository.
*   Accepted Risks
    *   accepted risk: Reliance on client-side security measures implemented by websites using the library.
    *   accepted risk: Potential for misuse of the library by website developers leading to insecure configurations or implementations.
*   Recommended Security Controls
    *   security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect potential vulnerabilities in the code.
    *   security control: Regularly update dependencies to address known security issues in underlying libraries.
    *   security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices in the documentation for developers using the library.
*   Security Requirements
    *   Authentication: Not applicable for a client-side JavaScript library. Authentication is the responsibility of the web application using the library.
    *   Authorization: Not applicable for a client-side JavaScript library. Authorization is the responsibility of the web application using the library.
    *   Input Validation: The library should handle configuration options and user interactions safely. Input validation should be implemented to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities arising from malformed input. This primarily applies to configuration options passed to the library during initialization.
    *   Cryptography: Not applicable for the core functionality of this client-side JavaScript library. Cryptographic operations are the responsibility of the web application if needed.

*   Build Process Description
    *   Developer writes and modifies code in a code editor on their local machine.
    *   Code changes are committed and pushed to the GitHub repository.
    *   A webhook in GitHub triggers the CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions) upon code changes.
    *   The CI/CD system checks out the code from the repository.
    *   The build process includes:
        *   Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanner to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
        *   Linter to enforce code style and quality standards.
        *   Build steps to compile, minify, and package the JavaScript library.
    *   The build artifacts (minified JavaScript files, distribution packages) are published to an artifact repository (e.g., npm if it were a package, or a designated storage for distribution).
*   Build Process Security Controls
    *   security control: Code review process before merging code changes to the main branch. Implemented: GitHub Pull Requests.
    *   security control: Automated SAST scanning integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities early in the development cycle. Implemented: CI/CD system.
    *   security control: Code linting to enforce coding standards and reduce potential code quality issues. Implemented: CI/CD system.
    *   security control: Dependency scanning to identify and manage vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by the project (if any, though less relevant for a standalone library like this). Can be added to CI/CD.
    *   security control: Secure build environment for the CI/CD system, ensuring isolation and preventing unauthorized access. Implemented: CI/CD platform security configurations.
    *   security control: Access control to the artifact repository to prevent unauthorized modifications or access to published artifacts. Implemented: Artifact repository access controls.
    *   security control: Signing of artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity of the published library. Can be added to build process and artifact repository.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes
    *   Ensuring the availability and integrity of the Fullpage.js library for web developers.
    *   Maintaining the performance and functionality of websites that utilize the Fullpage.js library.
    *   Protecting the reputation and brand associated with the Fullpage.js library.
*   Data Sensitivity
    *   Data being protected: The source code of the Fullpage.js library and the compiled library files.
    *   Data sensitivity: Low to Medium. The source code is publicly available on GitHub. However, unauthorized modification or malicious injection into the library could have a medium impact on websites using it. Compiled library files served via CDN should be protected from tampering to ensure integrity.
