## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using fullpage.js](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_fullpage_js.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Configuration Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_configuration_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**Malicious Custom Selectors**](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_custom_selectors.md)

This node is critical because it represents a vulnerability stemming from the developer's potential use of user-controlled input directly within `fullpage.js` selectors. This can lead to two high-risk paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Inject Malicious CSS Selector***](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_css_selector.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker crafts a malicious CSS selector by injecting code into a user-controlled input field that is subsequently used by the developer in a `fullpage.js` selector.
    *   **Mechanism:** `fullpage.js` uses these selectors to target specific elements. The malicious selector can be designed to apply arbitrary CSS styles to unintended elements.
    *   **Consequences:** This can lead to UI manipulation, such as hiding or altering content, potentially for phishing purposes or to mislead the user. It can also be used for information disclosure by making hidden elements visible.

## Attack Tree Path: [***Inject Malicious JavaScript Selector***](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_javascript_selector.md)

**Attack Vector:** Similar to the CSS selector injection, but the attacker injects a malicious JavaScript selector.
    *   **Mechanism:** If the developer uses selectors in JavaScript code to interact with elements identified by `fullpage.js`, a malicious selector can be used to target unintended elements and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
    *   **Consequences:** This results in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or redirecting the user to malicious websites.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Event Handlers and Callbacks](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_event_handlers_and_callbacks.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**Inject Malicious Code into Event Handlers**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_into_event_handlers.md)

**Attack Vector:** A developer uses `fullpage.js` event handlers (e.g., `onLeave`, `afterLoad`) and incorporates user-controlled input into the logic executed within these handlers without proper sanitization.
    *   **Mechanism:** When the corresponding event is triggered by `fullpage.js`, the unsanitized user input is treated as executable code.
    *   **Consequences:** This leads to XSS, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, with the same potential consequences as described above.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate DOM/CSS via fullpage.js](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_domcss_via_fullpage_js.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**Inject Malicious Content via Developer-Controlled Areas**](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_via_developer-controlled_areas.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application dynamically loads content into `fullpage.js` sections based on user input or external data, and this content is not properly sanitized before being rendered.
    *   **Mechanism:** An attacker can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code into the data source or input field that feeds the dynamic content.
    *   **Consequences:** The injected code is rendered within the `fullpage.js` section, leading to XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Potential Library Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_potential_library_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [**Discover and Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in fullpage.js**](./attack_tree_paths/discover_and_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_fullpage_js.md)

**Attack Vector:** The application uses an outdated version of the `fullpage.js` library that contains known security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers can leverage publicly available information and exploits for these vulnerabilities.
    *   **Consequences:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. Common consequences include XSS, DOM manipulation, and potentially even more severe attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Social Engineering Targeting fullpage.js Features](./attack_tree_paths/social_engineering_targeting_fullpage_js_features.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Mislead User with Controlled Scrolling/Navigation](./attack_tree_paths/mislead_user_with_controlled_scrollingnavigation.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [***Craft Phishing Attacks Disguised as Legitimate Sections***](./attack_tree_paths/craft_phishing_attacks_disguised_as_legitimate_sections.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the ability to control the content within `fullpage.js` sections to create fake login forms or other deceptive content that mimics legitimate parts of the application.
    *   **Mechanism:** By carefully controlling the scrolling and navigation flow provided by `fullpage.js`, the attacker can guide the user through a seemingly legitimate sequence of sections, ultimately leading them to the phishing content.
    *   **Consequences:** This can lead to the theft of user credentials, personal information, or other sensitive data.
