# Attack Surface Analysis for alvarotrigo/fullpage.js

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Configuration Options](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_configuration_options.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code through `fullpage.js` configuration options if the application doesn't properly sanitize user-provided data used to construct these options.
    *   **How fullpage.js Contributes:** Options like `anchors`, `menu`, or custom selectors, when dynamically generated based on unsanitized user input, can embed malicious scripts that `fullpage.js` processes, leading to their execution.
    *   **Example:** An application uses a URL parameter to set a custom anchor name. An attacker crafts a URL like `example.com/#<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`. If the application directly uses this parameter in the `anchors` configuration without sanitization, `fullpage.js` will render this, causing the script to execute.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or other malicious actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all user-provided data before using it to construct `fullpage.js` configuration options. Use appropriate encoding functions for HTML and JavaScript contexts.
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Configuration Based on Untrusted Input:** If possible, avoid dynamically generating configuration options based directly on user input. Use a predefined set of options or validate and sanitize thoroughly.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based XSS through Manipulated Selectors](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_xss_through_manipulated_selectors.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts by manipulating selectors used by `fullpage.js` if the application allows user-controlled input to influence these selectors without proper validation.
    *   **How fullpage.js Contributes:** `fullpage.js` uses selectors to target specific elements for its functionality. If an attacker can control or influence these selectors through unsanitized input, they might be able to target unintended elements and inject malicious content that `fullpage.js` then interacts with.
    *   **Example:** An application allows users to customize navigation elements by providing CSS selectors. An attacker provides a selector like `'); alert('XSS'); //`. If the application uses this directly in `fullpage.js` initialization, `fullpage.js` will use this selector, potentially leading to script execution within its context.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, similar to the previous XSS scenario.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrict Selector Input:** Avoid allowing users to directly provide arbitrary CSS selectors. Offer a predefined set of options or use indirect methods for customization.
        *   **Validate and Sanitize Selectors:** If user input is used to generate selectors, rigorously validate and sanitize them to ensure they only target intended elements and don't introduce malicious code.

## Attack Surface: [Manipulation of Dynamically Added Content within fullpage.js Sections (Leading to XSS)](./attack_surfaces/manipulation_of_dynamically_added_content_within_fullpage_js_sections__leading_to_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application dynamically adds or modifies content within the sections managed by `fullpage.js` without proper sanitization, it can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
    *   **How fullpage.js Contributes:** `fullpage.js` is responsible for displaying and managing the transitions between these sections. If the content within these sections is vulnerable to XSS, `fullpage.js` directly presents this vulnerable content to the user as they navigate through the sections.
    *   **Example:** An application fetches user-generated comments and displays them within a `fullpage.js` section without sanitizing the HTML. A malicious user submits a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When a user navigates to the section containing this comment, `fullpage.js` renders it, and the malicious script executes.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Output Encoding:** Encode all dynamic content before inserting it into the DOM, especially within sections managed by `fullpage.js`. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML encoding for displaying text, JavaScript encoding for embedding in scripts).
        *   **Secure Content Handling Practices:** Implement robust security measures for handling user-generated content throughout the application, ensuring it's sanitized before being displayed within `fullpage.js` sections.
