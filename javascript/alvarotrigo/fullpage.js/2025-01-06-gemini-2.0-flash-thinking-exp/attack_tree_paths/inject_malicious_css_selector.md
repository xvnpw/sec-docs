## Deep Analysis: Inject Malicious CSS Selector in fullpage.js Application

This analysis delves into the "Inject Malicious CSS Selector" attack path within an application utilizing the `fullpage.js` library. We will dissect the attack vector, mechanism, and consequences, providing a comprehensive understanding for the development team to implement effective mitigations.

**Understanding the Context: fullpage.js and Selectors**

`fullpage.js` is a popular JavaScript library used to create full-screen scrolling websites. A core functionality involves using CSS selectors to identify and manipulate specific sections and elements within the page. Developers configure these selectors to target elements based on their IDs, classes, or other attributes. This reliance on selectors provided by the developer creates the potential for vulnerabilities if user-controlled input influences these selectors.

**Deep Dive into the Attack Tree Path:**

**Attack Vector: An attacker crafts a malicious CSS selector by injecting code into a user-controlled input field that is subsequently used by the developer in a `fullpage.js` selector.**

* **User-Controlled Input:** This is the entry point for the attack. The attacker leverages any input field where data is submitted by the user and later used by the application's JavaScript code to construct or manipulate `fullpage.js` selectors. Common examples include:
    * **Search bars:** If the search query is used to filter or highlight elements within a `fullpage.js` section.
    * **Form fields:** Data entered in forms, especially if used to dynamically update the UI or target specific elements.
    * **URL parameters:**  Data passed in the URL that influences how `fullpage.js` elements are selected or styled.
    * **Configuration settings:** Less common, but if user-configurable settings directly impact `fullpage.js` selectors, it presents a vulnerability.

* **Injection Point:** The crucial point is where the developer's code takes the user-provided input and incorporates it into a CSS selector used by `fullpage.js`. This could happen in several ways:
    * **Direct String Concatenation:**  The most vulnerable scenario where the user input is directly concatenated into a selector string without any sanitization or escaping. For example:
        ```javascript
        const userInput = getUserInput(); // Get user input
        const targetSelector = '.section-' + userInput; // Vulnerable concatenation
        fullpage_api.moveTo(targetSelector); // Using the crafted selector
        ```
    * **Templating Engines:** Even with templating engines, if proper escaping is not applied, malicious CSS can be injected.
    * **Dynamic Selector Generation:**  If the application dynamically builds selectors based on user input, it's a potential injection point.

**Mechanism: `fullpage.js` uses these selectors to target specific elements. The malicious selector can be designed to apply arbitrary CSS styles to unintended elements.**

* **Exploiting CSS Specificity and Combinators:** Attackers can leverage the power of CSS selectors to target elements beyond the intended scope. This involves using:
    * **Universal Selector (`*`):**  A simple but powerful way to target all elements on the page.
    * **Attribute Selectors (`[attribute]`, `[attribute="value"]`):**  Allows targeting elements based on their attributes and values.
    * **Combinators (` `, `>`, `+`, `~`):**  Enable targeting elements based on their relationships with other elements (descendant, child, adjacent sibling, general sibling).
    * **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements (`:hover`, `::before`):** While less directly impactful for information disclosure, they can contribute to UI manipulation.

* **Examples of Malicious Selectors:**
    * `*, .section { display: none !important; }`: Hides all elements and then attempts to hide elements with the class "section". The `!important` overrides other styles.
    * `[data-user-role="admin"] { visibility: visible !important; }`:  If an element with the attribute `data-user-role="admin"` is intended to be hidden, this selector makes it visible, potentially revealing sensitive information.
    * `.section-1 ~ * { opacity: 0.1; }`:  Makes all sibling elements after the element with class "section-1" almost transparent.
    * `body::before { content: 'You have been phished!'; position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: red; color: white; z-index: 9999; }`:  Overlays a phishing message on the entire page.

* **How `fullpage.js` is Involved:**  `fullpage.js` relies on the provided selectors to perform its core functionalities like scrolling, navigation, and applying specific styles. When a malicious selector is injected and used by `fullpage.js` (e.g., in `moveTo`, `silentMoveTo`, or when applying active states), the browser interprets and applies the CSS rules defined in that malicious selector.

**Consequences: This can lead to UI manipulation, such as hiding or altering content, potentially for phishing purposes or to mislead the user. It can also be used for information disclosure by making hidden elements visible.**

* **UI Manipulation and Defacement:**
    * **Hiding Critical Content:** Attackers can hide navigation elements, important information, or call-to-action buttons, disrupting the user experience and potentially hindering functionality.
    * **Altering Content Appearance:** Changing colors, fonts, sizes, or positioning of elements can make the website appear broken or unprofessional.
    * **Injecting Fake Content:** Using pseudo-elements like `::before` and `::after`, attackers can inject misleading text or images, potentially for phishing or spreading misinformation.
    * **Creating Denial-of-Service (Visual):**  By manipulating the layout or applying heavy CSS rules, the attacker can make the page appear unusable or unresponsive.

* **Phishing Attacks:**
    * **Overlaying Fake Login Forms:**  Attackers can inject a visually similar login form on top of the legitimate one, stealing user credentials.
    * **Redirecting Users:** While not directly through CSS, the UI manipulation can be a precursor to redirecting users to malicious websites.

* **Information Disclosure:**
    * **Revealing Hidden Elements:**  Attackers can target elements that are intentionally hidden (e.g., using `display: none` or `visibility: hidden`) and make them visible, potentially exposing sensitive data or internal information. This is particularly concerning if developers rely solely on CSS for hiding sensitive information instead of proper backend access controls.
    * **Highlighting Specific Data:** By strategically applying styles, attackers could highlight specific data points on the page, making them more prominent for other malicious activities.

**Illustrative Code Example (Vulnerable):**

```javascript
// Assuming user input comes from a search bar
const searchInput = document.getElementById('search-input');
const sectionIdPrefix = 'section-';

searchInput.addEventListener('input', () => {
  const searchTerm = searchInput.value;
  const targetSelector = `#${sectionIdPrefix}${searchTerm}`; // Vulnerable!

  // Attempt to move to the section based on the search term
  fullpage_api.moveTo(targetSelector);
});
```

In this example, if a user enters `1 *`, the `targetSelector` becomes `#section-1 *`, which will target all elements within the section with ID `section-1`. A more malicious input like `1, body { display: none; }` could have severe consequences.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    * **Identify potential injection points:** Carefully analyze where user input is used in constructing `fullpage.js` selectors.
    * **Whitelist allowed characters:** Restrict input to only alphanumeric characters and specific symbols if necessary.
    * **Sanitize special characters:** Escape or remove characters that have special meaning in CSS selectors (e.g., `*`, `[`, `]`, `#`, `.`, `:`, `,`, `>`, `+`, `~`).
    * **Regular expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate the input format and prevent malicious patterns.

* **Avoid Direct String Concatenation:**
    * **Use parameterized queries or safe APIs:** If possible, leverage APIs that handle selector construction safely.
    * **Abstract selector logic:** Create functions or modules that encapsulate selector generation and apply sanitization within them.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Restrict `style-src`:**  Implement a strict CSP that limits the sources from which stylesheets can be loaded and prevents inline styles. This can mitigate the impact of injected CSS.

* **Principle of Least Privilege:**
    * **Avoid relying solely on CSS for security:** Do not depend on CSS to hide sensitive information. Implement proper backend access controls and authorization mechanisms.

* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * Conduct regular security assessments to identify potential injection points and vulnerabilities in the application.

* **Educate Developers:**
    * Train developers on the risks of CSS injection and secure coding practices.

**Conclusion:**

The "Inject Malicious CSS Selector" attack path, while seemingly less critical than direct code injection, can have significant consequences for applications using `fullpage.js`. By understanding the attack vector, mechanism, and potential impact, development teams can implement robust mitigation strategies to protect their applications and users. The key is to treat user input with extreme caution and avoid directly incorporating it into CSS selectors without proper validation and sanitization. Prioritizing secure coding practices and leveraging security features like CSP are crucial in preventing this type of vulnerability.
