### Vulnerability: Arbitrary File Read via Custom Template Path

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Read via Custom Template Path

- **Description:**  
  The autoDocstring extension allows users to specify a custom docstring template via the configuration setting `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath`. This setting accepts an absolute or relative file path and—in its current design—appears not to validate or sanitize the supplied path. An external attacker who can influence the workspace configuration (for example, by pushing a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file in a public repository) may set this value to point to an arbitrary file on disk (such as system files or other sensitive files). When a developer opens the project and triggers docstring generation, the extension will read the file from the provided path and inject its content into the generated docstring, thereby disclosing sensitive information.

- **Impact:**  
  If exploited, an attacker can force the extension to read and reveal the contents of arbitrary files on the victim’s system. This may lead to leakage of confidential information such as system configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data accessible by the user.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  No mitigations are evident in the documentation or in the visible source/test files. The README and related documentation explain that a custom template may be specified using an arbitrary file path (absolute or relative) without mention of any path validation or sandboxing.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Validate and sanitize the input for `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath`.  
  - Restrict the allowed file paths to a safe, predefined directory (for example, only permitting files within the project’s own folder).  
  - Reject absolute paths or enforce a whitelist of allowed directories to prevent path traversal.

- **Preconditions:**  
  - The victim’s workspace settings are influenced by repository files (for example, a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` checked into a public repository).  
  - The extension is configured (or defaults) to load a custom template using the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` setting.  
  - A developer triggers the docstring generation command (via keyboard shortcut, command palette, or context menu), causing the extension to read the file from the provided path.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The README and documentation files explicitly state that users may supply a custom template file by setting `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` (which can be an absolute path or one relative to the project root).  
  - There is no indication in the provided files that the extension performs any sanity checks on the value of this setting before opening and reading the file.  
  - As a result, an attacker could specify a path (for example, `/etc/passwd` on Linux or an equivalent sensitive file on Windows) if they can add configuration files into the project. When the user later invokes docstring generation, the extension will open and process the file from that path.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Preparation:**  
     - Create a new VSCode workspace (or use an existing one) and add a file at `.vscode/settings.json`.
     - In the settings file, add the following configuration (for Linux; adjust the sensitive file path for other operating systems accordingly):
       ```json
       {
         "autoDocstring.customTemplatePath": "/etc/passwd"
       }
       ```
  2. **Trigger:**  
     - Open any Python file in the workspace.
     - Position the cursor immediately below a function definition where a docstring would be generated.
     - Execute the “Generate Docstring” command (using the configured keybinding or via the command palette).
  3. **Verification:**  
     - Inspect the newly generated docstring content.  
     - If the resulting docstring unexpectedly includes the contents of `/etc/passwd` (or the content of the targeted sensitive file), then the vulnerability is confirmed.
  4. **Cleanup:**  
     - Remove or override the malicious configuration to restore safe operation.
