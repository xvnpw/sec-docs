### Vulnerability List:

#### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Templates

- **Vulnerability Name:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Custom Templates
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious custom docstring template file containing JavaScript code. For example, the template could include: `{{#placeholder}}<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability in autoDocstring!")</script>{{/placeholder}}`.
    2. The attacker persuades a victim to set the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` setting in VSCode to point to this malicious template file. This could be achieved through social engineering or by providing a workspace configuration file that includes this setting.
    3. The victim uses the autoDocstring extension to generate a docstring for a Python function.
    4. The extension utilizes mustache.js to render the docstring based on the provided custom template.
    5. Due to the lack of proper HTML escaping or sanitization, the injected JavaScript code from the malicious template is executed when VSCode renders the generated docstring.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary JavaScript code execution within the victim's VSCode instance.
    - Potential for malicious actions such as data theft, session hijacking, or unauthorized access to resources within the VSCode environment, depending on the privileges of the extension context.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Based on the changelog entry "- Disable HTML-escaping behavior globally ([#235](https://github.com/NilsJPWerner/autoDocstring/issues/235))", it appears that HTML escaping might be disabled, meaning there are *no* current mitigations for XSS in custom templates.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust HTML escaping or sanitization of the output generated from custom templates before displaying it in VSCode. This would prevent the execution of injected JavaScript code.
    - Provide clear and prominent warnings in the extension documentation and settings UI about the security risks associated with using custom templates from untrusted sources. Emphasize that using templates from unknown sources could lead to arbitrary code execution.
    - Consider implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) or similar mechanism to restrict the capabilities of custom templates, limiting their ability to execute scripts or access sensitive resources.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The victim must configure the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` setting to point to a malicious template file. This can be done through social engineering, by including the setting in a shared workspace configuration, or other methods that lead the victim to set a malicious template path.
    - The victim must then use the autoDocstring extension to generate a docstring in a Python file after setting the malicious template path.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The extension reads the file path specified by the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` configuration setting.
    2. It loads the content of this file, expecting it to be a mustache template.
    3. When a docstring is generated, the extension uses the mustache.js library to render the template. It passes data about the function's parameters, return type, etc., to the template engine.
    4. If HTML escaping is disabled during the mustache rendering process (as suggested by the changelog), any JavaScript code embedded within the template will be rendered as raw HTML and executed by VSCode when displaying the generated docstring.
    5. The vulnerability arises because the extension trusts the content of the custom template file without sanitizing or escaping it, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Create a new file named `malicious_template.mustache` with the following content:
        ```mustache
        {{#placeholder}}<script>alert("XSS Vulnerability in autoDocstring!")</script>{{/placeholder}}
        ```
    2. Save this file to a location accessible by VSCode, for example, within your project directory or a temporary folder.
    3. Open VSCode and navigate to the settings for the autoDocstring extension.
    4. Locate the `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` setting and set its value to the path of the `malicious_template.mustache` file you created in step 2 (e.g., if the file is in the root of your project, you might set it to `./malicious_template.mustache`).
    5. Open a Python file in VSCode.
    6. Define a simple Python function (or use an existing one). Place your cursor on the line immediately below the function definition.
    7. Trigger the docstring generation by typing `"""` and pressing Enter, or by using the keyboard shortcut (e.g., `Ctrl+Shift+2`).
    8. Observe if an alert dialog box appears in VSCode with the message "XSS Vulnerability in autoDocstring!".
    9. If the alert box is displayed, this confirms the Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability. The JavaScript code from the malicious template was successfully executed within the VSCode environment.
