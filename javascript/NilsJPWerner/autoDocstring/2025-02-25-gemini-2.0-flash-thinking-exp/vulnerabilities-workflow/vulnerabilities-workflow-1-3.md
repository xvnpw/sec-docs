* Vulnerability Name: Docstring Template Injection

* Description:
    1. A developer configures the `autoDocstring` extension to use a custom docstring template, leveraging the mustache.js templating engine as described in the README.
    2. The custom template is designed to include function or parameter names, or descriptions directly in the generated docstring using mustache tags like `{{name}}`, `{{var}}`, `{{descriptionPlaceholder}}` etc.
    3. A threat actor crafts a malicious Python file. This file contains function or parameter names, or comments that are designed to be interpreted as malicious code (e.g., HTML, Javascript, or other scripting language) when inserted into the docstring template.
    4. A developer, unknowingly, opens this malicious Python file in VSCode and uses the `autoDocstring` extension to generate a docstring for a function within this file.
    5. The `autoDocstring` extension parses the Python code, extracts the function name, parameter names, and potentially descriptions from comments or type hints.
    6. The extension then uses the custom mustache template to generate the docstring. Crucially, if the extension does not properly sanitize or escape the extracted code elements before inserting them into the template, the malicious code from the Python file will be directly embedded into the generated docstring.
    7. When VSCode displays this generated docstring (e.g., in hovers, documentation panels, or other UI elements that render rich text), the malicious code embedded within the docstring is executed within the VSCode environment. This could potentially lead to various security issues, such as information disclosure, arbitrary code execution within the VSCode context, or UI manipulation.

* Impact: High. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the developer's VSCode environment. This could lead to sensitive information disclosure (e.g., access to files, environment variables, credentials managed by VSCode), modification of project files, or further exploitation of the developer's system via VSCode's capabilities.

* Vulnerability Rank: High

* Currently Implemented Mitigations: Based on the provided files, there is no explicit mention of input sanitization or output escaping implemented in the `autoDocstring` extension to prevent template injection. The CHANGELOG.md mentions "Disable HTML-escaping behavior globally ([#235](https://github.com/NilsJPWerner/autoDocstring/issues/235))". Disabling HTML escaping would *increase* the risk of this vulnerability, as it removes a potential layer of defense against injection attacks if it was previously in place.

* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The extension should sanitize any code elements extracted from the Python file (function names, parameter names, descriptions, etc.) before inserting them into the docstring template. This could involve HTML escaping, or using a templating engine feature that automatically escapes outputs by default (though mustache.js does not do this by default for `{{variable}}`, it does for `{{{variable}}}`).
    - Context-aware output escaping: Depending on where the generated docstrings are displayed in VSCode, the appropriate output escaping mechanism should be used to prevent execution of embedded code. If docstrings are rendered as HTML, HTML escaping is necessary. If rendered in markdown, markdown escaping might be needed for certain characters.

* Preconditions:
    1. The victim developer must have the `autoDocstring` extension installed in VSCode.
    2. The developer must configure the extension to use a custom docstring template. This is an optional feature, but the vulnerability is most relevant when custom templates are used.
    3. The developer must open a malicious Python file in VSCode and attempt to generate a docstring for a function in that file.
    4. The `autoDocstring` extension must not properly sanitize or escape the input data when using custom templates, especially if HTML escaping is disabled as suggested by the changelog.

* Source Code Analysis:
    - Based on the provided files, especially `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`, the extension uses mustache.js for templating. The `README.md` shows examples of using mustache tags like `{{name}}`, `{{var}}`, `{{descriptionPlaceholder}}` in custom templates.
    - The `CHANGELOG.md` entry about disabling HTML escaping raises a red flag. If HTML escaping was disabled globally, it strongly suggests that the extension might be vulnerable to injection if it's inserting user-controlled content into docstrings that are then rendered in a context that interprets HTML or similar markup.
    - Without access to the source code that handles template processing and input extraction, it's impossible to pinpoint the exact location of the vulnerability. However, the vulnerability likely resides in the code that takes the parsed Python code elements (names, descriptions) and feeds them into the mustache template engine for docstring generation, specifically in the absence of sanitization before this step.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Setup**:
        - Install the `autoDocstring` extension in VSCode.
        - Create a custom docstring template file (e.g., `custom_template.mustache`) in your project directory with the following content:
          ```mustache
          Function Name: {{name}}
          Summary: {{summaryPlaceholder}}
          ```
        - Configure the `autoDocstring` extension setting `autoDocstring.customTemplatePath` to point to the path of `custom_template.mustache` file.
    2. **Create Malicious Python File**: Create a Python file named `malicious.py` with the following content:
        ```python
        def malicious_function_name<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-Function-Name')>(arg1):
            """_summary_
            """
            pass
        ```
    3. **Generate Docstring**: Open `malicious.py` in VSCode. Place the cursor on the line immediately below the `def malicious_function_name<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-Function-Name')>(arg1):` line. Trigger docstring generation using the shortcut `ctrl+shift+2` (or `cmd+shift+2` on Mac), or by using the command palette "Generate Docstring".
    4. **Observe Docstring Output**: After generating the docstring, examine the generated docstring above the function definition in `malicious.py`. Check if the function name in the docstring is rendered with the HTML tag `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-Function-Name')>`. It should look something like:
        ```python
        def malicious_function_name<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-Function-Name')>(arg1):
            """Function Name: malicious_function_name<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-Function-Name')>
            Summary: _summary_
            """
            pass
        ```
    5. **Trigger Potential XSS**: Hover your mouse cursor over the function name `malicious_function_name<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS-Function-Name')>` in the editor. VSCode often displays documentation hovers or tooltips when hovering over code elements. Observe if an alert box with "XSS-Function-Name" appears. If it does, this confirms that the HTML code from the function name was not escaped and was interpreted by VSCode, indicating a successful template injection vulnerability.
