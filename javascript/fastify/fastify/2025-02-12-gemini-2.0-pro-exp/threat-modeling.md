# Threat Model Analysis for fastify/fastify

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious plugin to a public package repository (e.g., npm) or compromises a private repository.  A developer unknowingly installs this plugin. The malicious plugin could contain a backdoor that allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code, steal data, modify application behavior, or launch further attacks. The attacker might use social engineering or typosquatting (creating a plugin name similar to a popular one) to trick developers.
    *   **Impact:** Complete application compromise, data exfiltration, data modification, denial of service, lateral movement within the network, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fastify plugin system (`fastify.register`), package manager (npm, yarn, pnpm).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Vetting:** Thoroughly vet all plugins before installation. Examine source code, check reputation, look for red flags (obfuscation, excessive permissions).
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like `npm audit`, `snyk`, or `dependabot` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   **Private Registry:** For internal plugins, use a private registry with strict access controls and code signing.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure plugins only have necessary permissions. Leverage Fastify's encapsulation to limit the scope of a compromised plugin.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation](./threats/vulnerable_plugin_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a legitimate, but flawed, Fastify plugin.  This could involve a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability in a plugin that processes user input, an insecure default configuration, or an unhandled exception that crashes the application. The attacker crafts a specific input that triggers the vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application crash or unresponsiveness), potential for remote code execution (depending on the vulnerability), data corruption, or information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific vulnerable plugin, and potentially the Fastify core if the vulnerability affects request handling or error handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Vetting & Scanning:** Same as for Malicious Plugin Installation.
        *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in plugins.
        *   **Code Review:** Perform code reviews, focusing on the interaction between the application and plugins.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor plugin security advisories and community discussions.
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation *before* data reaches the plugin, reducing the attack surface.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive CORS Configuration](./threats/overly_permissive_cors_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a misconfigured CORS policy (typically using a plugin like `@fastify/cors`).  The application might allow requests from any origin (`*`), exposing APIs to malicious websites.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized API calls, potential for cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks (although CSRF is a broader web vulnerability).
    *   **Affected Component:** `@fastify/cors` plugin (or any other CORS implementation), Fastify route handlers.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Restrictive CORS:** Configure CORS with the most restrictive settings possible. Specify allowed origins explicitly.
        *   **Credentials:** Carefully consider the need for `allowCredentials`.
        *   **Method Restrictions:** Limit allowed HTTP methods.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs/Errors](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logserrors.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to log files or error messages that contain sensitive data (e.g., API keys, user credentials, session tokens). This could be due to overly verbose logging, insecure log storage, or error messages that reveal internal details.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, credential compromise, potential for further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fastify's logging (Pino by default), error handling (`setErrorHandler`), any custom logging or error reporting.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Structured Logging:** Use a structured logging library (like Pino) and configure it to redact or omit sensitive data.
        *   **Error Message Customization:** Customize error messages to avoid revealing sensitive information.
        *   **Secure Log Management:** Use a secure log management system with access controls and audit trails.
        *   **Log Rotation:** Implement log rotation and retention policies.
