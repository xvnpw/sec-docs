# Attack Surface Analysis for fastify/fastify

## Attack Surface: [1. Request Parsing & Handling Vulnerabilities (Fastify-Direct Aspects)](./attack_surfaces/1__request_parsing_&_handling_vulnerabilities__fastify-direct_aspects_.md)

    *   **Description:** Exploits targeting how Fastify *itself* parses and processes incoming HTTP requests, leading to bypass of security controls or denial of service. This excludes issues primarily caused by misconfigured reverse proxies.
    *   **How Fastify Contributes:** Fastify's core functionality is handling HTTP requests.  Its use of llhttp and its internal request handling logic are the direct contributors.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Large Payload DoS (without `bodyLimit`):** An attacker sends a request with a massive body. If Fastify's `bodyLimit` is *not* set (or is set too high), Fastify's internal buffering mechanisms will attempt to handle the entire request, leading to memory exhaustion and a DoS. This is *directly* controlled by Fastify's configuration.
        *   **ReDoS in Route Definitions:** A Fastify route is defined with a vulnerable regular expression (e.g., `/user/:id(^([a-z]+){1,10}$)`). An attacker sends a crafted request that triggers catastrophic backtracking in Fastify's *internal* route matching logic. This is a direct consequence of how Fastify handles route parameters.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service, potential for bypassing security controls (if ReDoS affects authentication/authorization logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Large Payload DoS:** *Always* set a reasonable `bodyLimit` in your Fastify server options. This is the *primary and direct* defense within Fastify.
        *   **ReDoS in Routes:**
            *   Carefully review and test *all* regular expressions used in Fastify route definitions. Avoid complex, nested, or potentially catastrophic regular expressions.
            *   Use tools to analyze regular expressions for ReDoS vulnerabilities.
            *   Consider using simpler string matching techniques instead of regular expressions for route parameters, if feasible. This is a *direct* mitigation within Fastify's routing mechanism.

## Attack Surface: [2. Plugin-Related Vulnerabilities (Fastify's Plugin System)](./attack_surfaces/2__plugin-related_vulnerabilities__fastify's_plugin_system_.md)

    *   **Description:** Security flaws introduced through Fastify's plugin system, specifically focusing on how Fastify *loads and manages* plugins, and the potential for plugin interactions to create vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Fastify Contributes:** Fastify's plugin architecture and loading mechanism are the direct contributors. This is *not* about vulnerabilities *within* a specific third-party plugin's code, but rather how Fastify's system could be exploited.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Plugin Loading Order (Bypassing Security):**  A security-critical plugin (e.g., authentication) is registered *after* a plugin that handles user input.  Fastify's execution order allows the input-handling plugin to run *before* authentication, leading to a bypass. This is a *direct* consequence of Fastify's plugin loading mechanism.
        *    **Plugin Scope and Encapsulation Failure:** If encapsulation is not correctly implemented, using `fastify-plugin`, a plugin could modify the shared `fastify` instance or use global variables, it could create unexpected side effects or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, unauthorized access, potentially other vulnerabilities depending on the interaction.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Loading Order:**
            *   *Carefully* plan and control the plugin loading order using Fastify's `register`, `after`, and `ready` methods.  Ensure security-critical plugins are loaded and executed *before* any plugins that handle user input or perform potentially risky operations. This is a *direct* mitigation using Fastify's API.
        *   **Plugin Scope and Encapsulation:**
            *   Use `fastify-plugin` to properly encapsulate the plugin.

## Attack Surface: [3. Hook-Related Vulnerabilities (Fastify's Hook System)](./attack_surfaces/3__hook-related_vulnerabilities__fastify's_hook_system_.md)

    *   **Description:** Exploits that leverage Fastify's hook system *itself* to bypass security checks or manipulate the request/response lifecycle.
    *   **How Fastify Contributes:** Fastify's hook mechanism and its execution order are the direct contributors.
    *   **Example:**
        *   **Bypassing Authentication (Hook Manipulation):** A malicious plugin (or compromised code) registers an `onRequest` hook that *always* sets `request.user`, bypassing Fastify's intended authentication flow. This is a *direct* exploitation of Fastify's hook system.
        *   **Data Tampering (preSerialization Hook):** A plugin uses a `preSerialization` hook to modify the response data *after* validation, potentially injecting malicious content. This leverages Fastify's hook execution order.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, data corruption, potentially other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Hook Manipulation (General):**
            *   Be extremely cautious when using hooks, especially in combination with any untrusted code.
            *   If you have security-critical logic in hooks, consider ways to make it tamper-proof or to verify its integrity. This is a *direct* consideration when using Fastify's hooks.
        *   **Data Tampering (preSerialization):**
            *   If possible, perform final validation *after* all `preSerialization` hooks have run. This is difficult, but highlights the risk.
            *   Minimize the use of `preSerialization` hooks for modifying already-validated data.
