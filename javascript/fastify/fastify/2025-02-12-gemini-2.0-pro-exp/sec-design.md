Okay, let's create a design document for the Fastify project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Fastify is a web framework highly focused on providing the best developer experience with the least overhead and a powerful plugin architecture.  It's designed to be fast and low-overhead, making it suitable for high-performance applications.  The project is open-source and community-driven.

Priorities:

*   Performance: Minimize overhead and maximize request throughput.
*   Developer Experience:  Provide a simple, intuitive API and clear documentation.
*   Extensibility:  Enable developers to easily extend functionality via plugins.
*   Stability and Reliability: Ensure the framework is robust and dependable.
*   Community Growth:  Maintain an active and engaged community.

Goals:

*   Provide a viable alternative to other Node.js web frameworks (like Express.js).
*   Become a preferred choice for building high-performance APIs and microservices.
*   Maintain a low barrier to entry for new developers.

Business Risks:

*   Performance Degradation:  Changes to the codebase or dependencies could negatively impact performance, a core value proposition.
*   Security Vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in the framework or its plugins could expose applications built with Fastify to attacks.
*   Breaking Changes:  Frequent or poorly managed breaking changes could alienate the community and hinder adoption.
*   Lack of Adoption:  If Fastify fails to gain sufficient traction, the project's long-term viability could be at risk.
*   Plugin Ecosystem Issues:  A poorly maintained or insecure plugin ecosystem could damage the framework's reputation and security.
*   Maintainer Burnout:  Reliance on a small number of maintainers could lead to burnout and project stagnation.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Input Validation: Fastify uses a schema-based validation approach (using `ajv`) to validate request inputs (query parameters, body, headers). Implemented in core and documented.
*   security control: Secure Defaults: Fastify encourages secure defaults where possible, but some configurations require explicit developer action.
*   security control: Regular Dependency Updates: The project actively manages dependencies to address security vulnerabilities.  Visible through GitHub's Dependabot and frequent releases.
*   security control: Security Policy: Fastify has a documented security policy (SECURITY.md) outlining how to report vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Code Reviews: All contributions go through a code review process.
*   security control: Testing: Extensive test suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: HTTP Headers Management: Fastify allows developers to manage HTTP headers, including security-related headers.
*   security control: Plugin Architecture: While providing extensibility, the plugin architecture also introduces a potential attack surface. Fastify provides mechanisms for plugin developers to write secure plugins.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Plugin Security: The security of third-party plugins is ultimately the responsibility of the plugin developers and the application developers who choose to use them. Fastify provides guidelines, but cannot guarantee the security of all plugins.
*   accepted risk: Ecosystem Dependencies: Fastify, like all Node.js projects, relies on a large number of npm packages. While efforts are made to keep these up-to-date, vulnerabilities in dependencies are an inherent risk.
*   accepted risk: Developer Error: Fastify provides tools and guidance, but developers can still write insecure code using the framework.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) Integration: Provide easier, built-in support for configuring CSP headers.
*   security control: Enhanced Input Sanitization: While validation is present, consider adding more robust sanitization options to mitigate XSS risks.
*   security control: Official Security Plugins: Develop and maintain a set of officially supported security plugins (e.g., for authentication, authorization, rate limiting).
*   security control: Supply Chain Security: Implement measures to verify the integrity of the build process and published packages (e.g., SLSA, provenance).

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Fastify itself does not provide built-in authentication mechanisms. This is typically handled by plugins or external services.  Requirements should be defined at the application level.
*   Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is left to the application or plugins.  Requirements should be defined at the application level.
*   Input Validation: Fastify provides robust input validation via schemas.  Applications should leverage this for all user-provided data.  Validation rules should be strict and specific.
*   Cryptography: Fastify does not directly handle cryptography, but applications using it should use appropriate cryptographic libraries and practices for secure communication (HTTPS), data storage, and password hashing.
*   Output Encoding: Applications built with Fastify should properly encode output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities. This is primarily the responsibility of the application developer.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Serving web requests: The core function of Fastify is to handle HTTP requests and provide responses.  Any disruption to this process directly impacts users.
*   Plugin ecosystem interaction: Fastify's extensibility relies on plugins.  Vulnerabilities or instability in plugins can affect the overall system.

Data to Protect:

*   User Data (Sensitivity: Varies greatly depending on the application):  Applications built with Fastify may handle a wide range of user data, from personally identifiable information (PII) to financial data.  The sensitivity depends on the specific application.
*   Application Data (Sensitivity: Varies):  This includes any data stored or processed by the application, such as business data, configuration settings, etc.
*   Authentication Credentials (Sensitivity: High):  If the application handles authentication, protecting user credentials (passwords, API keys, etc.) is critical.
*   Session Data (Sensitivity: Medium to High):  Session data may contain sensitive information about the user's state and activity.
*   Configuration Data (Sensitivity: Medium to High): Configuration may contain secrets.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific types of applications are most commonly built with Fastify (e.g., APIs, microservices, full-stack web apps)? This helps prioritize security considerations.
*   What is the typical deployment environment for Fastify applications? (Cloud provider, on-premise, etc.)
*   What is the level of security expertise within the Fastify community and among its users?
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that are commonly relevant to Fastify applications?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities in third-party plugins?
*   What level of logging and monitoring is typically implemented in Fastify applications?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a high-performance web framework.  Security is a high priority, but performance should not be significantly sacrificed.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: Developers using Fastify have a basic understanding of web security principles.  The Fastify core team is responsive to security reports.
*   DESIGN: Most Fastify applications will be deployed as containerized applications, likely using Docker and Kubernetes.  A reverse proxy (like Nginx) will often be used in front of the Fastify application.  The use of third-party plugins is common.
