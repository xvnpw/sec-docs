# Attack Tree Analysis for fastify/fastify

Objective: To cause a Denial of Service (DoS) or achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the application server by exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations specific to the Fastify framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [1a. Large Payload [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1a__large_payload__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends an HTTP request with an extremely large request body. If Fastify's `bodyLimit` is not configured correctly (set too high or disabled), the server will attempt to process the entire body, consuming excessive memory and CPU resources. This can lead to a Denial of Service (DoS), making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Common misconfiguration, especially in development or less-maintained environments.
*   **Impact:** Medium. Causes service disruption, but often easily mitigated with proper configuration.
*   **Effort:** Very Low. Trivial to execute with basic tools like `curl` or even a web browser.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice. Requires minimal technical knowledge.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy. High server resource usage (memory, CPU) and slow response times are easily detectable.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Enforce a reasonable `bodyLimit` in Fastify's server options. The specific limit should be determined based on the application's expected use cases.
    *   Implement rate limiting (e.g., using `fastify-rate-limit`) to prevent an attacker from sending numerous large requests in a short period.
    *   Monitor request sizes and server resource usage. Set up alerts for unusually large requests or high resource consumption.
    *   If large file uploads are required, use a streaming approach instead of buffering the entire request in memory.

## Attack Tree Path: [6a. Improperly Configured Logging/Error Handling [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/6a__improperly_configured_loggingerror_handling__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Fastify's logging and error handling mechanisms, if misconfigured, can leak sensitive information. This includes API keys, database credentials, internal IP addresses, stack traces, or other details about the application's internal workings. Attackers can use this leaked information to launch further, more targeted attacks.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. Common misconfiguration, especially in development environments or when developers are not following security best practices.
*   **Impact:** Medium/High. The leaked information can be used to escalate privileges, gain access to sensitive data, or compromise the entire system.
*   **Effort:** Very Low. Simply viewing logs or triggering error conditions can reveal the information.
*   **Skill Level:** Novice. Requires minimal technical knowledge.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy/Medium. Requires reviewing logs and error messages for sensitive information. Automated tools can help with this.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Configure logging to use a secure level in production (e.g., `warn` or `error`). Avoid using `debug` or `trace` levels in production.
    *   Sanitize log messages to remove sensitive data before it is written to the logs. Use regular expressions or dedicated sanitization libraries.
    *   Implement proper error handling to avoid exposing internal details to users. Return generic error messages to users and log detailed error information internally.
    *   Use a centralized logging system with appropriate access controls. Only authorized personnel should have access to the logs.
    *   Regularly review log configurations and error handling code to ensure they are secure.

## Attack Tree Path: [4a. Unsafe Hook Execution ***CRITICAL NODE*** (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/4a__unsafe_hook_execution_critical_node__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** Fastify's hook system allows developers to execute custom code at various points in the request lifecycle (e.g., `onRequest`, `preHandler`). If a hook executes arbitrary code based on user input *without proper sanitization*, this can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker could inject malicious code that would be executed by the server, giving them complete control.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low. This is a severe security flaw that should be caught by basic code review and security testing.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Direct RCE, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
*   **Effort:** Medium. Requires finding the vulnerable hook and crafting a suitable exploit payload.
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced. Requires a good understanding of code injection vulnerabilities and server-side scripting.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium/Hard. Code review should catch this, but dynamic analysis (e.g., penetration testing) might be needed to confirm exploitability.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Never** execute code directly based on user input within hooks. This includes avoiding functions like `eval()`, `new Function()`, or similar constructs that can execute arbitrary code.
    *   Sanitize and validate *all* data used within hooks, even if it has passed previous validation steps (defense-in-depth).
    *   Use a code linter (e.g., ESLint with security plugins) to detect potentially unsafe code patterns.
    *   Implement strict input validation and output encoding to prevent code injection.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.
