## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Action:** Define explicit and non-overlapping routes. Use consistent parameter naming. Thoroughly test route matching logic, especially with optional parameters and wildcards.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.2. Exploiting Custom Parsers [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_2__exploiting_custom_parsers__high-risk_path_.md)

**Action:** If using custom body parsers, ensure they are secure and well-tested against malicious inputs. Follow secure coding practices for parser development.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Action:** Regularly audit and update Fastify plugins. Subscribe to security advisories for used plugins. Consider using well-maintained and reputable plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.1. Vulnerable Fastify Plugins [HIGH-RISK NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_1__vulnerable_fastify_plugins__high-risk_node_.md)

**Action:** Regularly audit and update Fastify plugins. Subscribe to security advisories for used plugins. Consider using well-maintained and reputable plugins.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3.3. Malicious Plugins [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_3__malicious_plugins__critical_node_&_high-risk_path_.md)

**Action:** Only use plugins from trusted sources. Review plugin code before installation if possible. Implement a process for vetting new dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.5. Exploit Error Handling Mechanisms [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_5__exploit_error_handling_mechanisms__high-risk_path_.md)

**Action:** Configure custom error handlers to prevent the leakage of sensitive information in error responses (e.g., stack traces, internal paths).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.6. Exploit Default Configurations or Missing Security Best Practices [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_6__exploit_default_configurations_or_missing_security_best_practices__high-risk_path_.md)

**Action:** Review Fastify's default configurations and adjust them according to security best practices (e.g., setting appropriate timeouts, enabling security headers).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.6.2. Missing Security Headers [HIGH-RISK NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1_6_2__missing_security_headers__high-risk_node_.md)

**Action:** Utilize Fastify plugins or custom logic to set essential security headers (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-Frame-Options`).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.7. Exploit Ecosystem Dependencies (Indirectly via Fastify) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_7__exploit_ecosystem_dependencies__indirectly_via_fastify___high-risk_path_.md)

**Action:** Regularly update Fastify and its dependencies. Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attackers might try to manipulate how Fastify matches routes to handlers.
        * **1.1.1. Route Hijacking/Confusion:** Exploiting ambiguous or overlapping route definitions to execute unintended handlers.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2.2. Exploiting Custom Parsers [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_2__exploiting_custom_parsers__high-risk_path_.md)

If the application uses custom body parsers, vulnerabilities in these parsers can be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

* Fastify's plugin system introduces potential attack vectors.
        * **1.3.1. Vulnerable Fastify Plugins [HIGH-RISK NODE]:** Using plugins with known security vulnerabilities.
        * **1.3.3. Malicious Plugins [CRITICAL NODE & HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Using intentionally malicious plugins to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.5. Exploit Error Handling Mechanisms [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_5__exploit_error_handling_mechanisms__high-risk_path_.md)

* Misconfigured or insecure error handling can be exploited.
        * **1.5.1. Information Disclosure via Error Messages:** Leaking sensitive information through detailed error messages.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.6. Exploit Default Configurations or Missing Security Best Practices [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_6__exploit_default_configurations_or_missing_security_best_practices__high-risk_path_.md)

* Failing to configure Fastify securely.
        * **1.6.1. Insecure Default Settings:** Exploiting default settings that are not secure.
        * **1.6.2. Missing Security Headers [HIGH-RISK NODE]:** Taking advantage of missing security headers to perform attacks like XSS or clickjacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.7. Exploit Ecosystem Dependencies (Indirectly via Fastify) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/1_7__exploit_ecosystem_dependencies__indirectly_via_fastify___high-risk_path_.md)

* Vulnerabilities in Fastify's dependencies can indirectly compromise the application.
        * **1.7.1. Vulnerabilities in Fastify's Dependencies [HIGH-RISK NODE]:** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in the libraries Fastify relies on.
