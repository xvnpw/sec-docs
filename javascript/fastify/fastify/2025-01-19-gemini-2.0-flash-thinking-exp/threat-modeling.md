# Threat Model Analysis for fastify/fastify

## Threat: [Schema Validation Bypass](./threats/schema_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious request with data that violates the intended schema but exploits weaknesses in the validation logic or missing schema definitions **within Fastify's schema validation feature**. This allows the invalid data to be processed by the application.
    *   **Impact:** Unexpected application behavior, data corruption if the invalid data is written to a database, potential security vulnerabilities if the invalid data triggers exploitable code paths.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fastify's request handling pipeline, specifically the schema validation feature using libraries like `ajv`, and route handlers that rely on the validated data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define comprehensive and strict JSON schemas for all request bodies and query parameters.
        *   Avoid using overly permissive schema types (e.g., `type: 'object'` without properties).
        *   Carefully review and test schema definitions.
        *   Utilize schema keywords like `additionalProperties: false` where appropriate.
        *   Implement custom validation logic for complex scenarios if needed, ensuring it's robust.
        *   Regularly update Fastify and its dependencies (including schema validation libraries).

## Threat: [Route Hijacking/Shadowing](./threats/route_hijackingshadowing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits overlapping or ambiguous route definitions **within Fastify's routing mechanism** to access or manipulate resources they shouldn't. This occurs when a more general or poorly defined route unintentionally matches a request intended for a more specific route.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, bypassing security controls intended for specific routes, potential for data manipulation or execution of unintended code paths.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fastify's routing mechanism, specifically the route registration and matching logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Define routes with clear and unambiguous patterns.
        *   Avoid overly broad wildcard routes (`*`) unless absolutely necessary and ensure they are handled with extreme caution.
        *   Register more specific routes before more general ones.
        *   Thoroughly test route definitions to ensure they behave as expected.
        *   Utilize Fastify's route constraints for more precise matching if needed.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities present in a third-party Fastify plugin used by the application, or the plugin itself is intentionally malicious. This directly impacts the Fastify application due to its plugin architecture.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the plugin's functionality and the vulnerability, including data breaches, remote code execution, denial of service, and unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific third-party Fastify plugin and any parts of the application that interact with it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if remote code execution is possible), High (for other significant vulnerabilities)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit all third-party plugins before using them.
        *   Keep plugins up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for the plugins you use.
        *   Consider the principle of least privilege when granting permissions to plugins.
        *   Implement security measures within your application to mitigate potential damage from compromised plugins.

## Threat: [Insecure Plugin Configuration](./threats/insecure_plugin_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits insecure default configurations or misconfigured options of a Fastify plugin to gain unauthorized access or cause harm. This is a direct consequence of how Fastify utilizes plugins.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific plugin and its functionality, but could range from information disclosure to remote code execution or bypassing authentication/authorization.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific Fastify plugin and its configuration options.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if critical vulnerabilities are exposed)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Review the documentation and security recommendations for each plugin's configuration options.
        *   Avoid using default configurations in production environments.
        *   Implement the principle of least privilege when configuring plugins.
        *   Regularly review and audit plugin configurations.

## Threat: [Serialization Vulnerabilities (e.g., Prototype Pollution)](./threats/serialization_vulnerabilities__e_g___prototype_pollution_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in **Fastify's response serialization mechanisms** (often using `fast-json-stringify`) to inject malicious properties into objects being serialized, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security issues.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to bypassing security checks, modifying application logic, or even remote code execution in certain scenarios if the injected properties are later used in a vulnerable way.
    *   **Affected Component:** Fastify's response serialization pipeline, specifically the `fast-json-stringify` library or other custom serialization logic used within Fastify.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep `fast-json-stringify` and other serialization libraries up-to-date.
        *   Be cautious when serializing user-provided data or data from untrusted sources.
        *   Consider using alternative serialization methods if `fast-json-stringify` presents a concern.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization before serialization.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Fastify Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_fastify_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Fastify relies on various Node.js modules. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect Fastify applications.
    *   **Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but could range from denial of service to remote code execution or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** The vulnerable dependency and any parts of the Fastify application that utilize it.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability (can be Critical or High).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Fastify and all its dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address dependency vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Fastify and its dependencies.
