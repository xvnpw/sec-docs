## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerable or Malicious Fastify Plugin (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerable_or_malicious_fastify_plugin__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Compromise via Malicious Plugin Installation (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** An attacker convinces a developer or system administrator to install a Fastify plugin that contains malicious code. This could be through social engineering, typosquatting on package names in repositories, or compromising plugin developer accounts.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application. The malicious plugin can execute arbitrary code within the application's context, steal sensitive data, create backdoors, or disrupt services.
**Exploit Vulnerability in a Legitimate Plugin (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** A commonly used, legitimate Fastify plugin contains a security vulnerability (e.g., a remote code execution flaw, a cross-site scripting vulnerability). Attackers can exploit this known vulnerability by sending crafted requests or inputs that trigger the flaw.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, attackers could achieve remote code execution, gain unauthorized access to data, or perform actions on behalf of legitimate users.
**Plugin Dependency Vulnerability (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:** A Fastify plugin relies on other Node.js packages as dependencies. One of these dependencies contains a security vulnerability. Attackers can exploit this transitive dependency vulnerability even if the main Fastify plugin is considered secure.
    * **Potential Impact:** Similar to exploiting a direct plugin vulnerability, this can lead to remote code execution, data breaches, or other forms of compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Default Error Handling Verbosity (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_default_error_handling_verbosity__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** The default error handling in Fastify (especially in development or staging environments) might expose sensitive information in error responses, such as stack traces, internal file paths, or database connection details. Attackers can intentionally trigger errors to gather this information for reconnaissance and identify further vulnerabilities.
**Potential Impact:** Information disclosure. While not a direct compromise, this information can significantly aid attackers in planning and executing more sophisticated attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Fastify Server Configuration Issues (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_fastify_server_configuration_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

**Missing or Misconfigured Security Headers (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application is missing or has misconfigured critical security headers like HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security), CSP (Content Security Policy), and X-Frame-Options.
    * **Potential Impact:**
        * **Missing HSTS:**  Vulnerability to Man-in-the-Middle attacks and SSL stripping.
        * **Missing CSP:**  Increased risk of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
        * **Missing X-Frame-Options:** Vulnerability to Clickjacking attacks.
**Insecure Cookie Handling (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Steal or manipulate cookies due to missing HttpOnly or Secure flags (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Cookies used for session management or authentication are missing the `HttpOnly` flag (making them accessible to JavaScript) or the `Secure` flag (not restricting them to HTTPS). Attackers can exploit XSS vulnerabilities to steal these cookies or intercept them over insecure connections.
        * **Potential Impact:** Session hijacking, allowing attackers to impersonate legitimate users and gain unauthorized access.
    * **Exploit vulnerabilities in custom cookie handling logic (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Developers implement custom logic for handling cookies, which might contain security flaws such as predictable session IDs or improper encryption.
        * **Potential Impact:**  Circumventing authentication, gaining unauthorized access, or manipulating user sessions.
**Verbose Logging Exposing Sensitive Information (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application's logging configuration is overly verbose and includes sensitive data like API keys, passwords, or personal information in log files. Attackers who gain access to these logs (e.g., through a misconfigured server or a separate vulnerability) can retrieve this sensitive information.
    * **Potential Impact:** Information disclosure, potentially leading to further compromise of the application or related systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Fastify Request Handling](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_fastify_request_handling.md)

**Exploit vulnerabilities in the JSON Schema implementation itself (CRITICAL NODE):**
    * **Attack Vector:**  A vulnerability exists within the JSON Schema validation library used by Fastify. Attackers can craft specific requests that exploit this vulnerability, potentially bypassing all schema validation rules.
    * **Potential Impact:**  Circumventing input validation, leading to various attacks like code injection, data manipulation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Fastify Security Features](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_fastify_security_features.md)

**CORS Misconfiguration or Bypass (if using Fastify's CORS support) (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    * **Attack Vector:** The Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy is misconfigured, allowing requests from unintended origins. Attackers can leverage this to perform cross-origin attacks, such as stealing data from authenticated users or performing actions on their behalf.
    * **Potential Impact:** Data theft, unauthorized actions, and potentially compromising user accounts.
