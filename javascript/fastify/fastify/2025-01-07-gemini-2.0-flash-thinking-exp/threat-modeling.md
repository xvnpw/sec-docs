# Threat Model Analysis for fastify/fastify

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could convince a developer to install a malicious or compromised Fastify plugin. This could happen through social engineering, typosquatting in package names, or by compromising a legitimate plugin's repository. Once installed, the plugin, being part of the Fastify application's process, could execute arbitrary code during application startup or runtime due to Fastify's plugin registration mechanism.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, including data exfiltration, installation of malware, denial of service, or manipulation of application logic.

**Affected Fastify Component:** `Plugin System` (specifically the `register` function and the module loading mechanism).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly vet all plugins before installation. Check the plugin's repository for activity, maintainership, and known vulnerabilities.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify potential security issues in plugin dependencies.
* Implement a process for reviewing and approving new plugin installations.
* Consider using private package registries for internal plugins.
* Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) where applicable for dependencies.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_plugins.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits a known vulnerability (e.g., arbitrary code execution) within a third-party Fastify plugin used by the application. They craft malicious requests or inputs that target this vulnerability, leveraging Fastify's routing and request handling to reach the vulnerable plugin code.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

**Affected Fastify Component:** The specific `Plugin` that contains the vulnerability, and Fastify's `Routing` and `Request Handling` mechanisms that expose the plugin's endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep all plugin dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
* Regularly scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
* Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in plugin code.
* Implement strong input validation and sanitization at the application level, even if relying on plugin validation.

## Threat: [Logic Errors in Lifecycle Hooks Leading to Authorization Bypass](./threats/logic_errors_in_lifecycle_hooks_leading_to_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** Developers implement custom logic within Fastify's lifecycle hooks (e.g., `onRequest`, `preHandler`) for authentication or authorization. Errors or flaws in this logic, directly within the Fastify hook execution flow, could allow attackers to bypass these checks and access resources they shouldn't. For example, a missing `await` in an asynchronous hook could lead to the hook completing before authorization is finished, and Fastify continuing the request lifecycle prematurely.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Fastify Component:** `Lifecycle Hooks` (specifically the `onRequest`, `preHandler`, and potentially other hooks used for authentication/authorization).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test all custom hook implementations, especially those related to security.
* Follow secure coding practices within hooks, ensuring proper error handling and control flow within the Fastify lifecycle.
* Utilize established authentication and authorization libraries or patterns instead of implementing custom logic from scratch within hooks.
* Ensure proper handling of asynchronous operations within hooks using `async/await` to maintain the correct execution order within Fastify's request lifecycle.

## Threat: [Logging Sensitive Information](./threats/logging_sensitive_information.md)

**Description:** Incorrectly configured logging within the Fastify application might inadvertently log sensitive data like API keys, passwords, or personal information. This is a direct consequence of how logging is implemented and integrated within the Fastify application.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials or personal data, potentially leading to account compromise or data breaches.

**Affected Fastify Component:** `Logging` (specifically how logging is configured and used within the application, potentially involving Fastify's built-in logging or a logging plugin).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully configure logging within the Fastify application to avoid capturing sensitive data.
* Implement redaction or masking of sensitive information in logs within the logging configuration.
* Securely store and manage log files, restricting access to authorized personnel only.
