# BUSINESS POSTURE

Fastify is a fast and low overhead web framework for Node.js. It is designed to be performant and developer-friendly, making it suitable for building web applications and APIs where speed and efficiency are critical.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Primary goal: Provide a high-performance, efficient, and developer-friendly web framework for Node.js.
- Enable developers to build fast and scalable web applications and APIs quickly.
- Foster a strong and active open-source community around the framework.
- Maintain and improve the framework's performance, stability, and security.
- Offer a flexible and extensible framework through a plugin ecosystem.

Business Risks:
- Performance degradation due to vulnerabilities or inefficient code.
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework or its plugins could lead to application breaches.
- Lack of community support or maintainability could lead to project stagnation.
- Breaking changes in new versions could disrupt existing applications.
- Adoption risk if developers prefer other frameworks.
- Supply chain risks related to dependencies and build process.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open Source Security Audits - The project is open source, allowing for community review and security audits. Location: GitHub repository is publicly accessible.
- security control: Dependency Management -  Uses `npm` or `yarn` for dependency management, which includes mechanisms for vulnerability scanning of dependencies. Location: `package.json` and `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock`.
- security control: Code Reviews - Contributions are likely reviewed by maintainers before merging. Location: GitHub Pull Request process.
- security control: Static Analysis - Likely uses linters and code formatters to maintain code quality and potentially catch some basic security issues. Location: Project configuration files (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`).
- security control: Testing -  Includes unit and integration tests to ensure functionality and potentially catch regressions. Location: `test/` directory in the repository.
- security control: HTTPS enforcement -  Framework encourages and facilitates the use of HTTPS for secure communication. Location: Documentation and examples.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability discovery and patching.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in dependencies that are not immediately patched.
- accepted risk: Security of applications built with Fastify is ultimately the responsibility of the application developers.
- accepted risk: Open source nature means vulnerabilities are publicly disclosed once found.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- security control: Regular Penetration Testing - Conduct periodic penetration testing or security audits by external security experts.
- security control: Security Champions - Designate security champions within the core team to focus on security best practices and awareness.
- security control: Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
- security control: Signed Releases - Sign releases to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.
- security control: SBOM Generation - Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for releases to improve supply chain transparency.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Applications built with Fastify should implement robust authentication mechanisms to verify user identity. This is typically handled at the application level, but Fastify should provide tools and guidance to facilitate secure authentication.
- Authorization: Applications should implement fine-grained authorization to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions. Fastify should provide mechanisms to integrate authorization logic.
- Input Validation: Fastify applications must validate all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). Fastify should provide tools for input validation and sanitization.
- Cryptography: Applications should use cryptography appropriately to protect sensitive data in transit and at rest. Fastify should support or integrate with libraries for cryptographic operations.
- Secure Defaults: Fastify should have secure defaults to minimize the risk of misconfiguration leading to vulnerabilities.
- Error Handling:  Fastify should handle errors gracefully and avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages.
- Logging and Monitoring: Fastify applications should implement comprehensive logging and monitoring for security auditing and incident response.
- Rate Limiting and DoS Protection: Fastify applications should implement rate limiting and other mechanisms to protect against denial-of-service attacks.
- HTTP Security Headers: Fastify should facilitate the setting of HTTP security headers (e.g., Content-Security-Policy, Strict-Transport-Security, X-Frame-Options) to enhance application security.
