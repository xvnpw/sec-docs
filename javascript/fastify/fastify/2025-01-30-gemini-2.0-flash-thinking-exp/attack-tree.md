## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Fastify Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_fastify_application__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal. Success means the attacker has gained unauthorized access, control, or caused significant disruption to the Fastify application.

*   **Route Parameter Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Integer Overflow in Route Params:** Attacker manipulates integer route parameters to cause unexpected behavior due to overflow conditions in application logic.
    *   **Path Traversal via Route Params:** Attacker crafts route parameters to access files or directories outside the intended scope, potentially reading sensitive data or executing arbitrary code if the application processes these paths insecurely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH - Plugin Vulnerabilities]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities__critical_node___high-risk_path_-_plugin_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   Vulnerabilities related to how Fastify processes incoming HTTP requests.
    *   **Header Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH - Header Injection]:**
        *   **HTTP Response Splitting:** Injecting malicious headers to manipulate the HTTP response structure, potentially leading to XSS or cache poisoning.
        *   **Host Header Injection [HIGH-RISK PATH - Host Header Injection]:** Manipulating the Host header to bypass security checks or redirect requests to malicious sites if the application relies on the Host header for security decisions without proper validation.
    *   **Body Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH - Body Parsing Vulns]:**
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Request Bodies [HIGH-RISK PATH - Body Parsing DoS]:** Sending excessively large request bodies to exhaust server resources during parsing, leading to denial of service.
        *   **JSON/Schema Validation Bypass [HIGH-RISK PATH - Schema Validation Bypass]:** Circumventing or exploiting flaws in JSON schema validation to send invalid data that is not properly processed, potentially leading to application errors or vulnerabilities.
    *   **Cookie Handling Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH - Cookie Handling Vulns]:**
        *   **Cookie Injection/Manipulation [HIGH-RISK PATH - Cookie Injection]:** Injecting or manipulating cookies to hijack sessions, bypass authentication, or alter application behavior if cookies are not properly secured.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Cookie Values [HIGH-RISK PATH - Cookie XSS]:** Storing malicious scripts in cookies and then reflecting these cookie values in responses without proper encoding, leading to XSS attacks.
