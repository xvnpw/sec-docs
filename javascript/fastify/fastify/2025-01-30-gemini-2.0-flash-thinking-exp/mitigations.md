# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for fastify/fastify

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Schema-Based Input Validation (Fastify Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/1__schema-based_input_validation__fastify_feature_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Schema-Based Input Validation using Fastify's built-in validation.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define Schemas in Route Options:**  Within your Fastify route definitions, utilize the `schema` option to specify JSON schemas for request `body`, `querystring`, and `headers`. These schemas are defined using libraries like `ajv`, which Fastify integrates with.
    2.  **Utilize `ajv` Keywords for Constraints:**  Within your schemas, leverage `ajv` keywords (e.g., `type`, `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`, `enum`, `format`, `minimum`, `maximum`) to enforce strict data type and format validation on incoming requests.
    3.  **Configure `ajv` for Strictness:**  Customize `ajv` options within Fastify's configuration (e.g., using the `ajv` option in the Fastify constructor) to enhance validation strictness. Consider options like `removeAdditional: 'failing'` or `'true'` to reject or remove unexpected properties in request payloads.
    4.  **Apply Validation to All Input Sources:** Consistently apply schema validation to all relevant parts of incoming requests: request bodies, query parameters, headers, and route parameters across all your Fastify routes.
    5.  **Test Schema Enforcement:**  Thoroughly test your routes with both valid and invalid inputs to confirm that Fastify's schema validation is correctly enforcing your defined schemas and rejecting requests that do not conform.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (High Severity):** SQL Injection, NoSQL Injection, Command Injection, LDAP Injection - By enforcing data types and formats, schema validation prevents malicious code injection through request parameters processed by Fastify.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):**  While not a direct XSS prevention, schema validation helps by ensuring expected data structures and types, which can be a prerequisite for further sanitization to prevent XSS.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Prevents DoS attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in parsing or processing malformed or unexpected input data by rejecting invalid requests early in the Fastify request lifecycle.
    *   **Business Logic Errors (Medium Severity):** Reduces application errors and unexpected behavior caused by processing invalid or malformed data, ensuring data integrity within the Fastify application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** **Significant** risk reduction. Fastify's schema validation acts as a crucial first line of defense against injection vulnerabilities.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** **Partial** risk reduction. Complements sanitization efforts for XSS prevention within Fastify applications.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** **Medium** risk reduction. Mitigates DoS vectors related to malformed input handled by Fastify.
    *   **Business Logic Errors:** **High** risk reduction. Improves data quality and predictable application behavior within Fastify.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in API routes. Schemas are defined for request bodies in some POST and PUT routes, but query parameters and headers are not consistently validated across all routes within the Fastify application.
    *   **Location:** Route definitions in `routes` directory, specifically for POST and PUT methods in `/api/v1/*` routes within the Fastify application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Query Parameter Validation in Fastify:** Missing schema validation for GET requests and query parameters across all API routes within the Fastify application.
    *   **Header Validation in Fastify:** No schema validation implemented for request headers in any routes within the Fastify application.
    *   **Route Parameter Validation in Fastify:** While Fastify's route constraints offer basic validation, explicit schema validation for route parameters using the `schema` option is missing in some cases within the Fastify application.
    *   **Consistent Application Across Fastify Routes:** Validation is not consistently applied across all API endpoints within the Fastify application and needs to be expanded to all routes handling user input.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Custom Error Handling using `setErrorHandler` (Fastify Feature)](./mitigation_strategies/2__custom_error_handling_using__seterrorhandler___fastify_feature_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Custom Error Handling using Fastify's `setErrorHandler` hook.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement `setErrorHandler` Hook:**  Within your Fastify application setup (e.g., in `server.js` or your main application entry point), use Fastify's `setErrorHandler` hook to define a centralized custom error handling function.
    2.  **Generic Client Responses in Production:** Inside the `setErrorHandler`, for production environments, construct generic error responses to send back to clients (e.g., HTTP status 500 with a simple message like "Internal Server Error"). Avoid exposing sensitive error details like stack traces directly to clients.
    3.  **Detailed Error Logging within `setErrorHandler`:**  Within the `setErrorHandler`, implement secure and detailed logging of the error. This should include the original error object (including stack trace), request details (headers, URL, body if appropriate and sanitized), and any relevant context. Log this information to a secure logging system, not directly to console in production.
    4.  **Environment-Aware Error Handling:**  Implement conditional logic within `setErrorHandler` to differentiate between development/staging and production environments. In development/staging, you might choose to log more verbose errors or even expose limited error details for debugging purposes, while strictly limiting information exposure in production.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Default Fastify error handling or uncaught exceptions might expose stack traces and internal application details in production, potentially revealing sensitive information to attackers. `setErrorHandler` prevents this by controlling error responses.
    *   **Insufficient Logging for Security Incidents (Medium Severity):**  Without a centralized and secure error handling mechanism like `setErrorHandler` with logging, tracking and responding to errors, including security-related errors, becomes difficult within the Fastify application.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** **Medium** risk reduction. Fastify's `setErrorHandler` prevents accidental exposure of sensitive technical details in error responses.
    *   **Insufficient Logging for Security Incidents:** **High** risk reduction. `setErrorHandler` facilitates centralized and secure error logging, crucial for security monitoring and incident response within Fastify applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. A custom error handler using `setErrorHandler` is in place, but it might not fully prevent stack trace exposure in all error scenarios within the Fastify application, and logging within it might be basic and not fully secure.
    *   **Location:** `server.js` or main application entry point for `setErrorHandler` within the Fastify application. Logging is currently done using `console.error` within the error handler and potentially elsewhere.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Strict Production Error Response Handling in `setErrorHandler`:** Ensure `setErrorHandler` *consistently* prevents stack trace and detailed error information leakage in production across all error types within the Fastify application.
    *   **Secure Logging Integration within `setErrorHandler`:** Integrate `setErrorHandler` with a secure and robust logging system (not just `console.error`) to ensure reliable and secure error logging for security analysis within the Fastify application.
    *   **Sensitive Data Redaction in `setErrorHandler` Logging:** Implement logic within `setErrorHandler` to redact or hash sensitive data before logging error details to prevent accidental exposure in logs generated by the Fastify application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Rate Limiting using `fastify-rate-limit` Plugin (Fastify Plugin)](./mitigation_strategies/3__rate_limiting_using__fastify-rate-limit__plugin__fastify_plugin_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Rate Limiting for API Endpoints using the `fastify-rate-limit` plugin.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install `fastify-rate-limit`:** Install the `fastify-rate-limit` plugin as a dependency for your Fastify project using `npm install fastify-rate-limit` or `yarn add fastify-rate-limit`.
    2.  **Register `fastify-rate-limit` Plugin in Fastify:** Register the `fastify-rate-limit` plugin within your Fastify application using `fastify.register(require('fastify-rate-limit'), { /* options */ })`.
    3.  **Configure Rate Limit Options:** Configure the plugin options during registration. This includes setting `max` (maximum requests per window), `timeWindow` (duration of the window in milliseconds), and optionally customizing `errorResponseBuilder` for rate limit exceeded responses. You can set global defaults and override them per-route if needed.
    4.  **Apply Rate Limits Globally or Per-Route:** Configure rate limits either globally during plugin registration to apply to all routes, or configure them specifically for individual routes using the `config` option within route definitions.
    5.  **Test Rate Limit Enforcement:** Thoroughly test your API endpoints to verify that the `fastify-rate-limit` plugin is correctly enforcing the configured rate limits and that requests exceeding the limits are appropriately rejected with informative error responses.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) (High Severity):** Fastify's performance can make it vulnerable to DoS/DDoS attacks. `fastify-rate-limit` protects against this by limiting request rates.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity):**  Rate limiting using `fastify-rate-limit` slows down brute-force attempts against authentication endpoints or other sensitive actions within the Fastify application.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Medium Severity):**  Prevents excessive requests from exhausting server resources (CPU, memory, database connections) within the Fastify application, ensuring stability and availability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS/DDoS):** **Significant** risk reduction. `fastify-rate-limit` is a critical control for preventing availability attacks targeting Fastify applications.
    *   **Brute-Force Attacks:** **Medium** risk reduction. Makes brute-force attacks significantly less effective against Fastify endpoints.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** **High** risk reduction. Protects Fastify application infrastructure from overload due to excessive traffic.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Rate limiting using `fastify-rate-limit` is not currently enabled for any API endpoints within the Fastify application.
    *   **Location:** N/A
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Plugin Installation and Registration in Fastify:** Install and register the `fastify-rate-limit` plugin within the Fastify application.
    *   **Global Rate Limit Configuration in Fastify:** Implement a global rate limit using `fastify-rate-limit` to protect the entire Fastify application from excessive requests.
    *   **Per-Route Rate Limit Configuration in Fastify:** Implement specific rate limits for sensitive or resource-intensive API endpoints within the Fastify application using `fastify-rate-limit`'s per-route configuration options.
    *   **Rate Limit Configuration Tuning for Fastify Application:** Define and configure appropriate rate limits within `fastify-rate-limit` based on the Fastify application's expected usage patterns and performance testing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Security Headers Implementation using `fastify-helmet` Plugin (Fastify Plugin)](./mitigation_strategies/4__security_headers_implementation_using__fastify-helmet__plugin__fastify_plugin_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Security Headers using the `fastify-helmet` plugin for Fastify.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Install `fastify-helmet`:** Install the `fastify-helmet` plugin as a dependency for your Fastify project using `npm install fastify-helmet` or `yarn add fastify-helmet`.
    2.  **Register `fastify-helmet` Plugin in Fastify:** Register the `fastify-helmet` plugin within your Fastify application using `fastify.register(require('fastify-helmet'), { /* options */ })`.
    3.  **Review and Customize Headers (Optional):** Review the default security headers set by `fastify-helmet` (e.g., `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, `Strict-Transport-Security`, `X-XSS-Protection`). Customize the plugin options during registration to adjust header values or disable specific headers based on your Fastify application's specific security requirements and Content Security Policy (CSP) needs.
    4.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) Configuration:** Pay particular attention to the `contentSecurityPolicy` option of `fastify-helmet`. Define a robust and tailored Content Security Policy that aligns with your Fastify application's resource loading requirements to mitigate XSS risks effectively.
    5.  **Test Header Implementation:** Use browser developer tools (Network tab, Headers section) or online header checking tools to verify that the security headers are being correctly set in HTTP responses from your Fastify application. Ensure the CSP is correctly configured and not causing unintended blocking of legitimate resources.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity):** `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-XSS-Protection` headers, set by `fastify-helmet`, help mitigate XSS attacks in Fastify applications by controlling resource loading and enabling browser-based XSS filters.
    *   **Clickjacking (Medium Severity):** `X-Frame-Options` header, set by `fastify-helmet`, prevents the Fastify application from being embedded in iframes on other domains, mitigating clickjacking attacks.
    *   **MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities (Low Severity):** `X-Content-Type-Options` header, set by `fastify-helmet`, prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing responses from the Fastify application, reducing the risk of attackers injecting malicious content by manipulating MIME types.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks (Medium Severity):** `Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)` header, set by `fastify-helmet`, enforces HTTPS connections for the Fastify application, reducing the risk of downgrade attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** **Medium** risk reduction. `fastify-helmet` provides an additional layer of defense against XSS vulnerabilities in Fastify applications.
    *   **Clickjacking:** **Medium** risk reduction. `fastify-helmet` effectively prevents clickjacking attacks against Fastify applications.
    *   **MIME-Sniffing Vulnerabilities:** **Low** risk reduction. `fastify-helmet` addresses a less common but still potential vulnerability in Fastify applications.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks:** **Medium** risk reduction. `fastify-helmet` enforces secure HTTPS connections for Fastify applications.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented. Security headers are not currently configured for the Fastify application.
    *   **Location:** N/A
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Plugin Installation and Registration in Fastify:** Install and register the `fastify-helmet` plugin within the Fastify application.
    *   **Header Configuration and Testing for Fastify Application:** Review default headers provided by `fastify-helmet`, customize if needed for the Fastify application, and thoroughly test header implementation in different browsers.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Definition for Fastify Application:** Develop and implement a robust Content Security Policy tailored to the Fastify application's specific needs and configure it using `fastify-helmet` to further mitigate XSS risks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [5. Plugin Security Vetting (Fastify Ecosystem)](./mitigation_strategies/5__plugin_security_vetting__fastify_ecosystem_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Rigorous Plugin Vetting and Secure Plugin Management within the Fastify ecosystem.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Plugin Dependencies in Fastify:**  Within your Fastify application, strive to use only plugins that are strictly necessary for implementing required features. Avoid adding plugins for functionalities that can be implemented directly in your application code or are not essential.
    2.  **Review Plugin Code Before Adoption:** Before incorporating a new Fastify plugin into your project, conduct a review of its source code, typically available on GitHub or npm. Understand its functionality, dependencies, and identify any potential security flaws, vulnerabilities, or malicious code.
    3.  **Assess Plugin Maintainership and Community:**  Prioritize Fastify plugins that are actively maintained, have a strong and responsive community, and demonstrate a good security track record. Look for plugins with recent updates, active issue tracking, and timely responses to reported security concerns within the Fastify ecosystem.
    4.  **Monitor Plugin Vulnerabilities Regularly:**  Establish a process for staying informed about known vulnerabilities affecting the Fastify plugins used in your application. Subscribe to security advisories, monitor vulnerability databases (like npm advisory database), and utilize tools that can scan your `package.json` for known plugin vulnerabilities.
    5.  **Keep Fastify Plugins Updated:**  Maintain all Fastify plugins in your project updated to their latest versions. Regularly check for plugin updates and prioritize applying security patches and updates promptly to mitigate known vulnerabilities and benefit from security improvements within the Fastify ecosystem.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities Exploitation (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities present in Fastify plugins can be exploited to compromise the application, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breaches, and other severe impacts within the Fastify environment.
    *   **Malicious Plugins (High Severity):**  Using Fastify plugins that contain intentionally malicious code can directly compromise the application, steal data, or perform other malicious actions within the Fastify application context.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Plugins (Medium Severity):**  Compromised or vulnerable Fastify plugins can serve as a vector for supply chain attacks, allowing attackers to inject malicious code or gain unauthorized access through a seemingly trusted plugin dependency.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Plugin Vulnerabilities Exploitation:** **Significant** risk reduction. Proactive vetting and management of Fastify plugins significantly minimize the risk of using vulnerable components.
    *   **Malicious Plugins:** **Significant** risk reduction. Code review and community assessment of Fastify plugins reduce the likelihood of incorporating malicious components into the application.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Plugins:** **Medium** risk reduction. Reduces the attack surface related to plugin dependencies within the Fastify ecosystem and mitigates potential supply chain risks.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Plugin usage in the Fastify application is generally minimized, but formal code review and maintainership checks are not consistently performed for *all* plugins before adoption. Plugin updates are performed periodically but not always immediately upon release within the Fastify project.
    *   **Location:** Plugin decisions are made during development and are documented in `package.json` and potentially in development documentation related to the Fastify application.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal Plugin Vetting Process for Fastify:**  Establish a documented and consistently followed formal process for vetting new Fastify plugins before they are adopted. This process should include code review, maintainership checks, and vulnerability research specific to the Fastify ecosystem.
    *   **Plugin Vulnerability Monitoring System for Fastify:** Implement a system for actively monitoring for vulnerabilities in the Fastify plugins used in the application. This could involve subscribing to security advisories related to Fastify plugins and using automated tools to scan for known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Automated Plugin Update Process for Fastify:**  Explore and potentially implement automated processes for updating Fastify plugins, or establish a regular schedule for reviewing and updating plugins, particularly focusing on security patches and updates within the Fastify application lifecycle.
