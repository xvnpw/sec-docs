### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Route Parameter Manipulation

#### 4.1. Route Parameter Manipulation - Integer Overflow in Route Params [HIGH-RISK PATH]

##### 4.1.1. Integer Overflow in Route Params: Description

Integer overflow occurs when an arithmetic operation attempts to create a numeric value that is outside the range of values that can be represented by the data type used. In the context of route parameters, this vulnerability arises when an application uses an integer route parameter in calculations or logic without proper validation, and an attacker can manipulate this parameter to cause an overflow.

Fastify, by default, parses route parameters as strings. If your application logic then converts these string parameters to integers (e.g., using `parseInt()`, `Number()`, or unary `+` operator in JavaScript) and uses them in calculations, it becomes susceptible to integer overflow if not handled carefully.

**Example Scenario:**

Imagine a Fastify application with a route that calculates a resource ID based on a route parameter:

```javascript
const fastify = require('fastify')();

fastify.get('/resource/:id', async (request, reply) => {
  const id = parseInt(request.params.id, 10); // Convert route param to integer

  if (isNaN(id)) {
    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid ID' });
  }

  const calculatedId = id * 100; // Calculation using the integer parameter

  // ... Application logic using calculatedId ...
  return reply.send({ resourceId: calculatedId });
});

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err, address) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log(`Server listening on ${address}`);
});
```

##### 4.1.2. Exploitation in Fastify

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a large integer value as the `id` route parameter that, when multiplied by 100, results in an integer overflow.

For example, if the JavaScript number type is used (which is double-precision 64-bit binary format IEEE 754), the maximum safe integer is `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` (9007199254740991).  If an attacker sends a request like `/resource/9007199254740992`, the `parseInt()` function will still parse it as a number. However, when multiplied by 100, it will overflow, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in the application logic that relies on `calculatedId`.

**Attack Request Example:**

```
GET /resource/9007199254740992 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
```

The `calculatedId` in the example above might become a very small or negative number due to the overflow, which could lead to:

*   **Incorrect resource access:** If `calculatedId` is used to fetch data from a database or file system, an overflow could result in accessing unintended resources or failing to access the intended resource.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  If the overflow triggers an exception or causes the application to enter an unexpected state, it could lead to a denial of service.
*   **Security Bypass:** In more complex scenarios, an integer overflow could potentially bypass security checks or access control mechanisms if these mechanisms rely on calculations involving route parameters.

##### 4.1.3. Potential Impact

The impact of an integer overflow vulnerability in route parameters can range from minor application errors to significant security breaches, depending on how the overflowed value is used within the application. Potential impacts include:

*   **Data Integrity Issues:** Incorrect calculations due to overflow can lead to data corruption or inconsistencies.
*   **Application Instability:** Overflow can cause unexpected program behavior, crashes, or denial of service.
*   **Security Vulnerabilities:** In critical security contexts, overflow can bypass access controls, lead to privilege escalation, or enable other attacks.

##### 4.1.4. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate integer overflow vulnerabilities in Fastify applications, developers should implement the following strategies:

*   **Input Validation and Range Checking:**
    *   **Validate the input:** Before converting route parameters to integers, validate that they are indeed numeric strings.
    *   **Check for maximum allowed values:**  Implement checks to ensure that the integer value of the route parameter is within the expected range *before* performing any calculations.  Compare against `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` if you are working with JavaScript numbers and need to ensure safe integer arithmetic.
    *   **Use libraries for safe arithmetic:** Consider using libraries that provide safe integer arithmetic operations, especially if dealing with very large numbers or performing complex calculations.

*   **Use Appropriate Data Types:**
    *   **Consider using BigInt:** For scenarios where you need to handle very large integers that exceed the safe integer range of JavaScript numbers, consider using the `BigInt` data type. Be aware of browser and Node.js version compatibility and potential performance implications.

*   **Error Handling:**
    *   **Implement robust error handling:**  If input validation fails or an overflow is detected (even if prevented by validation), handle the error gracefully and return informative error responses to the client (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request). Avoid exposing internal error details that could aid attackers.

**Mitigation Example (Input Validation and Range Checking):**

```javascript
const fastify = require('fastify')();

fastify.get('/resource/:id', async (request, reply) => {
  const idStr = request.params.id;

  if (!/^\d+$/.test(idStr)) { // Validate if it's a numeric string
    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid ID format' });
  }

  const id = parseInt(idStr, 10);

  if (id > Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER / 100) { // Check for potential overflow before calculation
    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'ID value too large' });
  }

  if (isNaN(id)) { // Still check for NaN after parseInt for robustness
    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid ID' });
  }

  const calculatedId = id * 100;

  // ... Application logic using calculatedId ...
  return reply.send({ resourceId: calculatedId });
});

// ... (rest of the code) ...
```

#### 4.2. Route Parameter Manipulation - Path Traversal via Route Params [HIGH-RISK PATH]

##### 4.2.1. Path Traversal via Route Params: Description

Path traversal (also known as directory traversal) is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to access files and directories that are located outside the web root folder on the server. In the context of route parameters, this vulnerability occurs when an application uses a route parameter to construct file paths without proper sanitization or validation.

If a Fastify application uses a route parameter to dynamically determine a file path and then reads or serves files based on this path, an attacker can manipulate the route parameter to include path traversal sequences like `../` (dot-dot-slash) to navigate up the directory tree and access files outside the intended scope.

**Example Scenario:**

Consider a Fastify application that serves files based on a filename provided in the route parameter:

```javascript
const fastify = require('fastify')();
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

const baseDir = path.join(__dirname, 'public'); // Intended public directory

fastify.get('/files/:filename', async (request, reply) => {
  const filename = request.params.filename;
  const filePath = path.join(baseDir, filename); // Construct file path

  try {
    const data = await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
    reply.type('text/plain').send(data);
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
      reply.status(404).send({ error: 'File not found' });
    } else {
      console.error(err);
      reply.status(500).send({ error: 'Internal server error' });
    }
  }
});

fastify.listen({ port: 3000 }, (err, address) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }
  console.log(`Server listening on ${address}`);
});
```

In this example, the application intends to serve files from the `public` directory. However, it directly uses the `filename` route parameter to construct the file path without proper validation.

##### 4.2.2. Exploitation in Fastify

An attacker can exploit this path traversal vulnerability by crafting a malicious `filename` route parameter that includes path traversal sequences.

**Attack Request Example:**

To access the `/etc/passwd` file (on a Linux-based system), an attacker could send the following request:

```
GET /files/../../../../../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
```

The `filename` parameter `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd` will be joined with `baseDir` (`/path/to/your/app/public`) using `path.join()`. While `path.join()` attempts to normalize paths, it may not fully prevent path traversal if not used in conjunction with other security measures. In this vulnerable example, it might resolve to something like `/etc/passwd` (depending on the base directory and operating system), allowing the attacker to read the contents of the sensitive `/etc/passwd` file if the application server process has sufficient permissions.

**Potential Consequences of Successful Path Traversal:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can read sensitive files, including configuration files, source code, database credentials, and user data.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** In some scenarios, if the application allows writing files based on route parameters or if there are other vulnerabilities in conjunction with path traversal, attackers might be able to upload malicious files (e.g., web shells) and achieve remote code execution.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive files can lead to information disclosure, aiding further attacks.

##### 4.2.3. Potential Impact

The impact of path traversal vulnerabilities is typically high, as it can lead to severe security breaches, including:

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Access to sensitive data, leading to privacy violations and potential financial or reputational damage.
*   **Integrity Breach:** In cases where file writing is possible (less common with simple path traversal but possible in combination with other vulnerabilities), attackers could modify critical system files.
*   **Availability Breach:**  While less direct, information gained through path traversal can be used to plan denial-of-service attacks or other disruptions.

##### 4.2.4. Mitigation Strategies

To effectively mitigate path traversal vulnerabilities in Fastify applications, developers should implement the following strategies:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Whitelist allowed characters:**  Restrict the characters allowed in route parameters used for file paths. Disallow path traversal sequences like `../`, `./`, `..\\`, `.\\`, and any encoded variations.
    *   **Validate against a whitelist of allowed filenames:** If possible, instead of directly using the route parameter as a filename, map the route parameter to a predefined list of allowed filenames.
    *   **Use `path.basename()`:**  Extract the base filename from the route parameter using `path.basename()`. This helps remove directory components from the path, but it's not a complete solution on its own.

*   **Restrict Access to the File System (Principle of Least Privilege):**
    *   **Run the application with minimal privileges:** Ensure that the Fastify application process runs with the minimum necessary permissions to access only the required files and directories.
    *   **Chroot environment (advanced):** In highly sensitive environments, consider using a chroot environment to further restrict the application's access to the file system.

*   **Secure File Handling APIs:**
    *   **Avoid direct file path construction from user input:**  Whenever possible, avoid directly constructing file paths using user-provided route parameters.
    *   **Use secure file serving mechanisms:**  If serving static files, utilize Fastify's built-in static file serving capabilities or dedicated middleware that are designed to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    *   **Implement CSP headers:** While CSP primarily mitigates client-side vulnerabilities, it can provide an additional layer of defense by restricting the sources from which the application can load resources, potentially limiting the impact of certain types of attacks that might be facilitated by path traversal.

**Mitigation Example (Input Validation and `path.basename()`):**

```javascript
const fastify = require('fastify')();
const path = require('path');
const fs = require('fs');

const baseDir = path.join(__dirname, 'public');

fastify.get('/files/:filename', async (request, reply) => {
  let filename = request.params.filename;

  // Sanitize filename using path.basename()
  filename = path.basename(filename);

  // Input validation: Whitelist allowed characters (alphanumeric, underscore, hyphen, dot)
  if (!/^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]+$/.test(filename)) {
    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid filename format' });
  }

  const filePath = path.join(baseDir, filename);

  // Check if the resolved path is still within the intended base directory
  if (!filePath.startsWith(baseDir)) {
    return reply.status(400).send({ error: 'Invalid filename' }); // Prevent traversal outside baseDir
  }

  try {
    const data = await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
    reply.type('text/plain').send(data);
  } catch (err) {
    if (err.code === 'ENOENT') {
      reply.status(404).send({ error: 'File not found' });
    } else {
      console.error(err);
      reply.status(500).send({ error: 'Internal server error' });
    }
  }
});

// ... (rest of the code) ...
```

**Important Note:**  While `path.basename()` and input validation are helpful, the most robust mitigation is to avoid constructing file paths directly from user input whenever possible. Consider alternative approaches like using file IDs or database lookups to manage file access instead of relying on filenames directly provided in route parameters.
