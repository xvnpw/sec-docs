# Threat Model Analysis for fastify/fastify

## Threat: [Schema Validation Bypass or Weaknesses](./threats/schema_validation_bypass_or_weaknesses.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit flaws in how Fastify implements schema validation or weaknesses in poorly defined schemas. By crafting specific requests, they can send invalid data that bypasses validation and is processed by the application, potentially leading to backend vulnerabilities.
**Impact:** Data corruption, injection attacks (SQL, NoSQL, command injection) if validated data is used in backend operations, application crashes, or business logic bypass.
**Fastify Component Affected:** Schema validation module (core Fastify functionality, often used with `@fastify/sensible` or similar), route schema definitions.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Define strict and comprehensive JSON schemas for all routes using Fastify's schema validation features.
*   Regularly review and rigorously test schema definitions to ensure they accurately reflect expected data and prevent bypasses.
*   Avoid overly permissive schema configurations that might allow unexpected data types or formats.
*   Implement thorough input sanitization and validation within route handlers as a secondary defense layer, even with schema validation in place.

## Threat: [Schema Injection Vulnerabilities (Dynamic Schema Generation)](./threats/schema_injection_vulnerabilities__dynamic_schema_generation_.md)

**Description:** If application logic dynamically generates JSON schemas based on user input or external data *within Fastify routes*, attackers could inject malicious schema components. This manipulates the validation process itself, allowing malicious payloads to pass validation checks that would normally be blocked by correctly defined static schemas.
**Impact:** Circumvention of validation rules, enabling injection attacks, data manipulation, or other vulnerabilities that schema validation is intended to prevent.
**Fastify Component Affected:** Schema validation module, dynamic schema generation logic within Fastify route handlers.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid dynamic schema generation within Fastify routes if possible. Prefer static, pre-defined schemas for better security.
*   If dynamic schema generation is necessary, strictly sanitize and validate all input data used to construct schemas *before* it influences schema definition within Fastify.
*   Treat schema generation logic as security-sensitive code and apply rigorous input validation and output encoding principles.

## Threat: [Custom Serializer Vulnerabilities](./threats/custom_serializer_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  If developers implement custom serializers in Fastify to optimize response times, vulnerabilities can be introduced if these serializers are not carefully coded.  Attackers could exploit flaws in custom serializers to cause information disclosure, cross-site scripting (XSS) if serializers incorrectly handle data for response rendering, or potentially even code execution if serializers process untrusted data in unsafe ways during the serialization process within Fastify's response pipeline.
**Impact:** Information leakage, cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against application users, or in the most severe cases, remote code execution on the server if serializer logic is deeply flawed and processes untrusted data unsafely.
**Fastify Component Affected:** Custom serializers (Fastify's serialization feature), serialization logic within route handlers and reply objects.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Exercise extreme caution when implementing custom serializers in Fastify. Thoroughly review and test custom serializer code for security vulnerabilities.
*   Ensure all data rendered in responses by custom serializers is properly encoded and escaped to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Limit the complexity of custom serializers and avoid processing or transforming untrusted data within serializer logic.  Serializers should primarily focus on formatting and data structure transformation, not complex business logic or data manipulation.
*   Prefer using Fastify's default serialization whenever possible, as it is generally secure and well-tested.

## Threat: [Amplified Denial of Service due to High Performance](./threats/amplified_denial_of_service_due_to_high_performance.md)

**Description:** Fastify's inherent high performance, while a benefit, can amplify the impact of certain Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. Attackers can leverage Fastify's speed to send a significantly larger volume of malicious requests in a shorter timeframe compared to slower frameworks. This can overwhelm backend systems and dependencies more rapidly, leading to a quicker and potentially more severe service disruption.
**Impact:** Rapid and potentially severe denial of service, impacting application availability and potentially causing cascading failures in backend infrastructure due to the increased volume of malicious requests Fastify can process and forward.
**Fastify Component Affected:** Fastify core performance characteristics, request handling pipeline.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust and aggressive rate limiting at the Fastify layer to restrict the number of requests from individual IPs or users within defined time windows.
*   Deploy Fastify applications behind load balancers and Web Application Firewalls (WAFs) to distribute traffic and filter malicious requests before they reach the application.
*   Implement connection limits and request timeouts within Fastify to prevent resource exhaustion from a flood of connections or long-running requests.
*   Thoroughly test application resilience under high load and simulated DoS conditions to identify and address performance bottlenecks and potential points of failure.

## Threat: [Race Conditions in Asynchronous Code](./threats/race_conditions_in_asynchronous_code.md)

**Description:** Fastify's asynchronous nature, while enabling high concurrency, introduces the risk of race conditions if asynchronous operations within route handlers or application logic are not carefully synchronized. Attackers could exploit race conditions by sending concurrent requests designed to trigger unintended execution orders in asynchronous code, leading to data corruption or security bypasses.
**Impact:** Data corruption, inconsistent application state, authentication or authorization bypasses if race conditions affect security-critical logic, or other unpredictable and potentially exploitable application behavior.
**Fastify Component Affected:** Asynchronous request handling within Fastify, route handlers, asynchronous application logic.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully review and audit all asynchronous code within Fastify route handlers and application logic for potential race conditions.
*   Minimize the use of shared mutable state accessed by concurrent asynchronous operations.
*   Employ appropriate synchronization mechanisms (e.g., locks, mutexes, atomic operations) when shared mutable state is necessary in asynchronous contexts to prevent race conditions.
*   Thoroughly test application concurrency and use techniques like fuzzing and property-based testing to identify potential race conditions under load.
*   Favor immutable data structures and functional programming paradigms where possible to reduce the risk of race conditions in asynchronous code.
