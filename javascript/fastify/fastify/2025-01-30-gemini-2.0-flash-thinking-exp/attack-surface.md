# Attack Surface Analysis for fastify/fastify

## Attack Surface: [Schema Poisoning via AJV](./attack_surfaces/schema_poisoning_via_ajv.md)

Description: Attackers manipulate request/response schemas, often dynamically generated, to bypass validation or inject malicious data.

How Fastify Contributes: Fastify's core feature of schema validation using AJV makes it directly vulnerable if schema generation or modification is insecure. Dynamic schemas based on user input are a key Fastify-related risk factor.

Example: An application dynamically builds a schema based on user-provided field names in the route path. An attacker crafts a path with field names that inject malicious schema definitions, bypassing validation rules and allowing them to send invalid data.

Impact: Data corruption, injection attacks, bypassing security controls, unexpected application behavior.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Avoid dynamic schema generation based on untrusted input.
*   Strictly validate any input used to construct schemas.
*   Implement robust input sanitization and validation *before* schema construction.
*   Regularly review and test schema generation logic.
*   Use static, pre-defined schemas whenever possible.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable or Malicious Fastify Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_or_malicious_fastify_plugins.md)

Description: Using third-party Fastify plugins that contain vulnerabilities or are intentionally malicious introduces security risks directly into the Fastify application.

How Fastify Contributes: Fastify's plugin ecosystem is a core design element, and its ease of extensibility through plugins is a major feature. However, this directly introduces risk if plugins are not vetted, as they execute within the Fastify application context.

Example: A developer uses an outdated Fastify plugin for authentication that has a known vulnerability allowing authentication bypass. An attacker exploits this plugin vulnerability to gain unauthorized access. Or, a malicious plugin is installed that exfiltrates environment variables upon application startup.

Impact:  Various impacts depending on the plugin vulnerability, ranging from data breaches, remote code execution, to complete system compromise.

Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability)

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Thoroughly vet plugins before use: check maintainer reputation, community feedback, security audits, and source code.
*   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
*   Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
*   Implement a plugin security policy and review process for your development team.
*   Prefer using officially maintained or widely trusted plugins with strong community support.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Hook Logic](./attack_surfaces/insecure_hook_logic.md)

Description:  Vulnerabilities in custom logic implemented within Fastify hooks (e.g., `onRequest`, `preHandler`) can bypass security controls or introduce new flaws in the request processing flow managed by Fastify.

How Fastify Contributes: Fastify's hook system is a central part of its request lifecycle management.  Hooks are designed to intercept and modify request processing, making insecure hook logic a direct Fastify-related vulnerability.

Example: A `preHandler` hook intended to perform authorization has a flaw that allows bypassing authorization checks under specific request conditions. An attacker crafts requests to exploit this flaw and access protected resources.

Impact: Bypassing authentication/authorization, data breaches, injection attacks, unexpected application behavior, privilege escalation.

Risk Severity: High

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Thoroughly review and test all hook logic, especially security-critical hooks like those handling authentication, authorization, and input validation.
*   Follow secure coding practices when implementing hook logic, avoiding common vulnerabilities like injection flaws.
*   Use established security libraries and patterns within hooks instead of writing custom security implementations from scratch where possible.
*   Separate security-critical logic into dedicated, well-tested modules that are called from hooks, improving code organization and testability.

## Attack Surface: [Content Type Parser Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/content_type_parser_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities in libraries used by Fastify for parsing request bodies (e.g., `body-parser`, `multiparty`) can be exploited, leading to serious security issues.

How Fastify Contributes: Fastify relies on external parsers registered via `addContentTypeParser` to handle different request content types.  Vulnerabilities in these registered parsers directly impact the security of Fastify applications as they process incoming request data.

Example: A vulnerability in a registered `body-parser` version allows for prototype pollution or buffer overflows. An attacker sends a crafted request with a specific content type that exploits this parser vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server.

Impact:  Remote code execution, Denial of Service, data corruption, other parser-specific vulnerabilities, potentially complete server compromise.

Risk Severity: High to Critical (depending on the specific parser vulnerability)

Mitigation Strategies:
*   Keep Fastify and *all* its dependencies, including registered body parsers, updated to the latest versions.
*   Actively monitor security advisories for parser libraries used by Fastify and promptly update vulnerable dependencies.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization *after* parsing, to mitigate potential issues that might arise even from parser vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using alternative, more actively maintained and security-focused parsing libraries if available and suitable for your application's needs.
