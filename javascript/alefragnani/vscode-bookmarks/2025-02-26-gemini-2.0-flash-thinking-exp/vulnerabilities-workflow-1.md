The following list combines vulnerabilities from provided reports, removing duplicates and presenting them with detailed descriptions.

### Prototype Pollution in Workspace Bookmarks Storage

- **Description:**
  When the user’s settings enable saving bookmarks in the project (via the setting `"bookmarks.saveBookmarksInProject": true`), the extension stores bookmark data on disk (for example in a JSON file under the workspace’s “.vscode” folder). On activation, the extension loads this data by calling functions such as `loadBookmarks()` from the workspace state module (see the calls within the `loadWorkspaceState()` function in `/code/src/extension.ts`). If an attacker can supply a maliciously crafted bookmarks file (for instance, via a compromised repository or a malicious pull request), they may insert specially named keys (for example `__proto__`) into the JSON. Because the extension does not show any sanitization or filtering against dangerous keys during deserialization, these keys may pollute the prototype of plain objects used in the extension’s runtime. This “prototype pollution” can then alter the behavior of objects throughout the extension—and potentially the entire VS Code process—leading to unexpected logic, bypassed checks, or even arbitrary code execution if later code uses unsanitized properties.

  *Step by step triggering could be as follows:*
  1. An attacker publishes a project (or a pull request) containing a malicious `.vscode/bookmarks.json` file whose JSON object includes properties such as `"__proto__": { "polluted": "yes" }`.
  2. A victim opens this workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Bookmarks extension installed and with the setting to save bookmarks in the project enabled.
  3. During activation, the extension calls `loadWorkspaceState()` which in turn calls `loadBookmarks()`. The unsanitized JSON is deserialized and merged into its in‐memory bookmark state.
  4. Because of the polluted prototype, every plain object in the extension (and possibly beyond) now has an extra property (for example, `polluted`) that may be used later to alter application behavior or escalate privileges.

- **Impact:**
  Successful prototype pollution may allow an attacker to change critical internal behavior of the extension and even trigger further exploitation steps (for example, by bypassing checks or causing arbitrary code paths to execute). In the worst case, this could lead to arbitrary code execution inside the VS Code process (which runs with the user’s privileges), ultimately compromising the user’s system.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**
  Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - No explicit input validation or sanitization is found in the source code before deserializing bookmark data from disk (see calls to `loadBookmarks()` in `/code/src/extension.ts`).
  - The project does not appear to filter out dangerous keys (such as `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`) in the workspace state loading process.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Input validation/sanitization on deserialized JSON data from the bookmarks file.
  - Explicit filtering to disallow keys that can modify the prototype (e.g. rejecting any object keys named `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`) before merging the data into runtime state.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The user has enabled project‐based bookmark saving (i.e. the setting `"bookmarks.saveBookmarksInProject": true`).
  - An attacker is able to supply (or cause the user to open) a project whose bookmarks file is maliciously crafted to include prototype-polluting keys.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In the file `/code/src/extension.ts`, the function `loadWorkspaceState()` is responsible for loading bookmarks for one or more workspace folders. In both cases (with or without project–based saving) it calls an asynchronous function `loadBookmarks(workspaceFolder)` (imported from `"../vscode-bookmarks-core/src/workspaceState"`).
  - While the actual implementation of `loadBookmarks()` is not included in the provided files, its standard role is to read JSON data from disk and rebuild the in–memory bookmark state. No sanitization is applied to filter out dangerous keys.
  - As a result, if the JSON file contains a property with a key such as `__proto__`, then after JSON.parse the resulting object’s prototype can be altered. This polluted prototype is later used by the extension’s controller and file objects—for example when adding, removing, or sorting bookmarks.
  - Because the extension does not check for such dangerous keys, an attacker could have full control over object prototypes used in further operations.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a test workspace with the setting `"bookmarks.saveBookmarksInProject": true`, create or modify the bookmarks file (for example, `.vscode/bookmarks.json`) with a payload similar to:
     ```json
     {
       "__proto__": {
         "polluted": "yes"
       },
       "files": []
     }
     ```
  2. Open the test workspace in Visual Studio Code with the Bookmarks extension installed.
  3. In the Developer Console (Help → Toggle Developer Tools), run the following command:
     ```js
     console.log({}.polluted);
     ```
  4. If the output is `"yes"`, this demonstrates that the prototype was polluted by the unsanitized bookmarks data.
  5. Further tests (such as checking altered behavior in bookmark operations) can be performed to fully validate the exploitation impact.
