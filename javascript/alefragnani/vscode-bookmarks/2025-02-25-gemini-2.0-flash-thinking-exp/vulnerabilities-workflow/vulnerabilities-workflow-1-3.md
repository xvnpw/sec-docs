## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high or critical vulnerabilities introduced by the project itself and exploitable by an external attacker have been identified that meet the specified criteria.

After reviewing the provided files, which primarily consist of documentation, license information, and changelogs, and in the absence of any source code that would represent the core logic of a publicly accessible application component, there is no evidence to suggest any vulnerability of high or critical rank that an external attacker could exploit in a publicly available instance of this VSCode extension through its intended external interfaces.

The changelog mentions several security alerts related to dependencies. While these are important to address for the overall security posture of the project, they do not currently represent vulnerabilities that are directly exploitable by an external attacker against a publicly available instance of the *extension's functionality* in a way that would meet the inclusion criteria defined. Dependency vulnerabilities, in the context of a VSCode extension, would typically require a more complex attack vector, often involving local access or specific internal extension functionality, rather than being directly triggerable by an external attacker against a publicly accessible endpoint related to the extension itself.

Furthermore, considering the exclusion criteria:

*   **Vulnerabilities caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES**: The provided files are primarily documentation and changelogs. They do not contain code from a separate "project" that the developers of *this* project might be using insecurely.
*   **Vulnerabilities that are only missing documentation to mitigate**:  Without identifying any specific vulnerabilities, this exclusion is not applicable.
*   **Deny of service vulnerabilities**: No denial of service vulnerabilities have been identified based on the provided files.

Therefore, based on the provided PROJECT FILES and applying the given inclusion and exclusion criteria, there are no high or critical vulnerabilities to report in the requested markdown format at this time.
