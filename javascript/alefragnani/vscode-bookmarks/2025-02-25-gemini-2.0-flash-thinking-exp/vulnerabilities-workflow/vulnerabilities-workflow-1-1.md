## Vulnerability List

There are no vulnerabilities found in the provided project files that meet the required criteria (vulnerability rank at least: high, valid, not mitigated, introduced by project from PROJECT FILES, not caused by insecure code patterns, not only missing documentation, not deny of service vulnerabilities).

Based on the provided files, which consist primarily of documentation, license information, changelog, and issue templates, there is no source code available to analyze for vulnerabilities. The described functionalities of the Bookmarks extension, such as toggling bookmarks, navigation, listing, selection, side bar, and settings, are all related to editor features and bookmark management within VS Code.

Without access to the source code of the extension, it is impossible to identify specific code-level vulnerabilities. The documentation files themselves do not introduce vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based solely on the provided PROJECT FILES, there are no vulnerabilities to report that meet the specified criteria.
