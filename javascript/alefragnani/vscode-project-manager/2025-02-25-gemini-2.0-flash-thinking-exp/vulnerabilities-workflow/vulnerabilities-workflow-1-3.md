## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities have been identified within the scope defined.

**Reasoning:**

After reviewing the provided files, which primarily consist of documentation, license information, changelog, and GitHub issue templates, there is no source code available to analyze.  Without access to the source code, it is impossible to perform a detailed security assessment and identify specific vulnerabilities introduced by the project logic itself.

The changelog mentions several security alerts related to dependencies, which have been addressed through dependabot pull requests. These are dependency vulnerabilities and not directly vulnerabilities in the project's own code logic.

Based on the documentation, the extension manages project paths and configurations. While potential vulnerabilities like path traversal could theoretically exist in path handling within the source code, there is no concrete evidence or code snippets in the provided files to confirm such vulnerabilities.

Therefore, based solely on the provided project files and adhering to the constraints outlined in the prompt, no high-rank vulnerabilities can be confidently identified and reported.

It is recommended to perform a thorough source code audit to identify and assess potential vulnerabilities in the project.
