- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Access via Misconfigured `projectsLocation` Setting
  **Description:**
  An attacker who can modify the user or workspace configuration (for instance, on a publicly accessible remote/CodeSpaces instance) can set the configuration setting `projectManager.projectsLocation` to an arbitrary directory path. Because the extension uses this setting directly to compute the location of its projects file—by calling a helper (e.g. via `PathUtils.expandHomePath` and then joining with the fixed filename—all without further sanitization—an attacker can cause the extension to read from or write to an unintended file. One possible attack scenario would be:
  1. The attacker (or malicious workspace file) sets the configuration value to something like
     ```
     "../../../sensitive-data"
     ```
     so that when combined with the user’s home directory the computed path points outside the intended storage directory.
  2. The user or the extension later triggers a command that uses the projects file path (for example, “Edit Projects”), causing the extension to open a file not intended for modification by the extension user.
  **Impact:**
  This misconfiguration can lead to disclosure of sensitive files or even allow an attacker (or a malicious collaborator) to modify important configuration or system files if the underlying file system permissions allow. Once a sensitive file is opened in the editor (and possibly even inadvertently updated), this may lead to further exploitation.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  – The code simply uses the configuration value as provided (after a simple home–path expansion) in the function `getProjectFilePath()` (see below), with no range check or sanitization.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  – The extension should validate and constrain the value of `projectManager.projectsLocation` to a whitelist or at least limit it to directories within a safe application (or user-specific) data folder.
  **Preconditions:**
  – An attacker must be able to modify the workspace or user settings (for example, if the instance is deployed in a shared remote environment without proper isolation).
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  – In the file `src/extension.ts`, the helper function `getProjectFilePath()` does the following:
  ```ts
  function getProjectFilePath() {
      let projectFile: string;
      const projectsLocation: string = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration("projectManager").get<string>("projectsLocation");
      if (projectsLocation !== "") {
          projectFile = path.join(PathUtils.expandHomePath(projectsLocation), PROJECTS_FILE);
      } else {
          projectFile = PathUtils.getFilePathFromAppData(PROJECTS_FILE);
      }
      return projectFile;
  }
  ```
  Because no sanitization or even canonicalization is applied other than a simple string‐join, a maliciously crafted setting value may cause the extension to read from (or write to) an unintended file.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a controlled test environment, modify the workspace or user settings so that the setting
     `"projectManager.projectsLocation"` is set to a relative path using directory–traversal syntax (for example, `"../../../../etc/"` on a Unix–like system or an equivalent on Windows).
  2. Trigger the command “Project Manager: Edit Projects” (or another command that loads the projects file).
  3. Verify that instead of opening the expected projects file, the extension opens a file outside the intended directory (for example, `/etc/projects.json` or another sensitive file).
  4. Confirm that sensitive content is disclosed or that file–modification operations affect an unintended file.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unvalidated Project Path Leading to Arbitrary Folder Access
  **Description:**
  Saved project entries in the projects file (typically stored in JSON via the ProjectStorage code) supply a project “rootPath” that is later used to build a URI for opening folders in VS Code. The extension takes the path directly from the (user–modifiable) JSON file and passes it on to the VS Code command `vscode.openFolder` after converting it with a helper function (via `buildProjectUri`). While the project–picking UI does verify that the supplied path exists on disk (using an existence check), it does not verify that the path is within an “allowed” or expected location. An attacker who can modify the projects file (or cause a workspace to be loaded with an attacker–crafted projects file) could supply a malicious path—for example, a system directory or a file containing sensitive information. When the user later selects this project to open it, VS Code will be asked to open an arbitrary folder.
  **Impact:**
  This vulnerability can lead to arbitrary file or directory access. In a remote or shared environment the attacker may force the opening of sensitive directories (or even initiate operations on them), thereby disclosing sensitive file system structures or enabling further localized exploitation by tricking the user.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  – The quick–pick function (in `src/quickpick/projectsPicker.ts`) does check that the supplied project path exists using `fs.existsSync` before allowing selection. However, no check is made to ensure that the path is within an expected “safe” area.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  – Additional input validation should be carried out on any project paths sourced from the projects file. In particular, verify that:
    - The path is normalized and canonicalized.
    - The path falls within a restricted base directory (or a set of trusted base directories).
  **Preconditions:**
  – An attacker must be able to modify the projects file (for example, via a malicious project workspace file or through compromised configuration settings) so that a project entry with a malicious “rootPath” is present.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  – In `src/extension.ts`, the command for opening a project is registered as follows:
  ```ts
  vscode.commands.registerCommand("_projectManager.open", async (projectPath: string, projectName: string, profile: string) => {
      const uri = buildProjectUri(projectPath);
      if (!await canSwitchOnActiveWindow(CommandLocation.SideBar)) {
          return;
      }
      vscode.commands.executeCommand("vscode.openFolder", uri, { forceProfile: profile, forceNewWindow: false } )
          .then(
              value => ({}),
              value => vscode.window.showInformationMessage(l10n.t("Could not open the project!"))
          );
  });
  ```
  Here the `projectPath` comes directly from the persistent JSON storage (or as chosen from the quick pick). There is no further sanitization or validation that it does not point to a sensitive or unintended directory.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a test copy of the projects file (or via a workspace that loads a malicious projects file), add a project entry where the `"rootPath"` is set to a directory outside the expected scope (for example, on Linux, set it to `"/etc"` or `"/var/log"`).
  2. Use the Project Manager’s command (via the Command Palette or Side Bar) to “List Projects to Open” and pick the malicious entry.
  3. Observe that the command calls `vscode.openFolder` with the unintended folder path.
  4. Verify that VS Code opens the sensitive folder and (if possible) that its contents are visible to the user.
  5. Document that the folder opened falls outside the allowed/expected boundaries.
