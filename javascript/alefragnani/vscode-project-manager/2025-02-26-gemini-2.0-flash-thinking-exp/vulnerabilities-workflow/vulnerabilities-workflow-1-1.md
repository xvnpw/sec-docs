Okay, I understand the instructions. You want me to create a vulnerability list in markdown format, considering the perspective of an external attacker targeting a publicly available application instance.

Since the current list is empty, I will create an example of a vulnerability that meets all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. I will assume a hypothetical vulnerability for demonstration purposes as no vulnerabilities are provided in the initial list.

Here is an example of a vulnerability that fits your criteria:

## Vulnerability List

### SQL Injection in Product Search

**Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in Product Search

**Description:**
1. An external attacker can access the publicly available product search functionality.
2. The attacker crafts a malicious search query containing SQL injection payloads within the search term.
3. The application's backend directly incorporates this unsanitized search term into an SQL query executed against the database.
4. Due to lack of input sanitization or parameterized queries, the injected SQL code is executed by the database.
5. The attacker can manipulate the database query to extract sensitive data, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the system.

**Impact:**
Successful SQL injection can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data (customer information, product details, credentials), data modification or deletion, and in severe cases, complete compromise of the database server and underlying system.

**Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
None. The application directly uses user-provided input in SQL queries without any sanitization or parameterized queries in the product search functionality.

**Missing Mitigations:**
- Implementation of parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions, especially when user-provided input is involved.
- Input sanitization and validation to remove or escape potentially malicious SQL characters from user inputs before incorporating them into database queries.
- Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules to detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns.

**Preconditions:**
- The application must have a publicly accessible product search functionality.
- The product search functionality must interact with a database.
- The application's backend must be vulnerable to SQL injection due to insecure database query construction in the product search feature.

**Source Code Analysis:**
Let's assume the following simplified code snippet in `search_products.php`:

```php
<?php
$searchTerm = $_GET['query']; // User-provided search term from URL parameter
$dbConnection = connectToDatabase(); // Assume database connection is established

$query = "SELECT product_name, description, price FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%" . $searchTerm . "%' OR description LIKE '%" . $searchTerm . "%'";

$result = mysqli_query($dbConnection, $query); // Executing the query directly

// ... process and display results ...
?>
```

**Step-by-step analysis:**
1. The code retrieves the search term directly from the `query` GET parameter without any sanitization: `$searchTerm = $_GET['query'];`.
2. It then constructs an SQL query by directly concatenating the `$searchTerm` into the `WHERE` clause using `LIKE '%" . $searchTerm . "%'`.
3. `mysqli_query()` executes this dynamically constructed SQL query.
4. If an attacker provides a malicious payload in the `query` parameter (e.g., `' OR 1=1 --`), this payload will be directly inserted into the SQL query.
5. For example, if the attacker sets `query` to `' OR 1=1 --`, the resulting SQL query becomes:
   ```sql
   SELECT product_name, description, price FROM products WHERE product_name LIKE '%' OR 1=1 -- %' OR description LIKE '%' OR 1=1 -- %'
   ```
   The `OR 1=1 --` part will always evaluate to true, and `--` comments out the rest of the query. This bypasses the intended search logic and may return all products, or be further exploited for more complex attacks.

**Security Test Case:**
1. **Access the product search page:** Open a web browser and navigate to the publicly accessible product search page of the application (e.g., `https://example.com/search`).
2. **Craft a malicious search query:** In the search input field or directly in the URL parameter `query`, enter the following payload: `' OR 1=1 -- `. For example, if using the URL: `https://example.com/search?query=' OR 1=1 -- `
3. **Submit the search query.**
4. **Analyze the search results:** Observe the search results. If the SQL injection is successful, you might see:
    - A significantly larger number of results than expected for a normal search, potentially listing all products in the database because `1=1` condition made the WHERE clause always true.
    - Error messages related to the database if the injection causes syntax errors (though a blind injection might not show errors directly).
5. **Attempt data extraction (example - listing database users on MySQL):**  Try a more advanced payload to extract data. For example, try to list database users on MySQL (this is just an example, specific payloads depend on the database type):  `' UNION SELECT user(),null,null -- ` or `' UNION SELECT group_concat(user),null,null FROM mysql.user -- ` (URL encoded). Observe if you can retrieve user information or other sensitive data in the search results.

**Expected Result of Test Case:**
If the application is vulnerable, the test case will demonstrate the ability to manipulate the SQL query and potentially extract data or bypass normal search functionality, confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.
