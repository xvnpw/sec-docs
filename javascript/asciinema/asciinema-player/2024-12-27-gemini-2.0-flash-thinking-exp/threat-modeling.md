## High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Asciinema Player

This list details high and critical threats specifically related to the `asciinema-player` component.

| Threat | Description (Attacker Action & Method) | Impact | Affected Component | Risk Severity | Mitigation Strategies |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Malicious Asciicast Content Injection** | An attacker crafts a malicious asciicast JSON file and tricks the application into loading it. This file contains crafted terminal control sequences or data designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the player or the browser. | - **Client-Side Code Execution:** If the player has vulnerabilities, malicious JavaScript could be injected and executed in the user's browser. - **Browser Exploitation:** Crafted ANSI escape codes could trigger vulnerabilities in the browser's rendering engine. | - `src/player.js` (core rendering logic) - `src/terminal.js` (terminal emulation) - Browser's rendering engine | High | - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restrict the sources from which the player can load resources and limit the actions it can perform. - **Input Sanitization/Validation (Limited):** While fully sanitizing terminal output is complex, consider basic validation of the asciicast JSON structure and potentially dangerous control sequences. - **Regularly Update Player:** Ensure the application uses the latest version of `asciinema-player` to patch known vulnerabilities. - **Sandboxing:** Render the player within a sandboxed iframe to limit its access to the main application's context. - **Careful Source Selection:** Only load asciicasts from trusted and verified sources. |
| **Exploiting Player Vulnerabilities for DoS** | An attacker identifies and exploits a specific vulnerability within the `asciinema-player` code (e.g., a parsing error, infinite loop) by providing a specially crafted asciicast. This can cause the player to crash or hang. | - **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS):** The player fails to render, or the browser becomes unresponsive. | - Various modules within `asciinema-player` depending on the vulnerability (e.g., `src/parser.js`, `src/player.js`) | High | - **Regularly Update Player:** This is the most critical mitigation. Keeping the player updated patches known vulnerabilities. - **Security Audits:** Consider security audits of the player code or rely on the community's efforts in identifying and reporting vulnerabilities. |
| **Exploiting Player Vulnerabilities for Client-Side Code Execution** | A critical vulnerability in the `asciinema-player` allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser context when a malicious asciicast is played. This could be due to improper handling of certain terminal control sequences or vulnerabilities in the player's rendering logic. | - **Full Client-Side Compromise:** The attacker can perform actions on behalf of the user, access sensitive data stored in the browser (cookies, local storage), or redirect them to malicious websites. | - Various modules within `asciinema-player` depending on the vulnerability (e.g., `src/terminal.js`, `src/player.js`) | Critical | - **Regularly Update Player:** This is paramount to address known vulnerabilities. - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strong CSP can significantly limit the damage even if a vulnerability is exploited by restricting the actions the injected script can perform. - **Sandboxing:** Rendering the player in a sandboxed iframe can limit the scope of potential damage. |
