# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for asciinema/asciinema-player

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Sanitization and Validation (for asciicast content)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_sanitization_and_validation__for_asciicast_content_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Target `asciinema-player` Input:** Focus specifically on the data *passed to* the `asciinema-player` (the asciicast JSON).
2.  **ANSI Whitelist:** Before passing data to `asciinema-player`, implement a strict whitelist of allowed ANSI escape sequences and control characters.  This is *crucial* because `asciinema-player` renders terminal output, which can include potentially dangerous sequences.
3.  **Dedicated Parser:** Use (or create) a parser specifically designed for ANSI escape codes.  This parser should:
    *   Tokenize the asciicast data, separating text from escape sequences.
    *   Validate each token against the whitelist.
    *   Reject or sanitize any input containing non-whitelisted sequences.
    *   Handle malformed sequences gracefully.
4.  **Schema Validation:** Validate the structure of the asciicast JSON against the expected schema *before* passing it to `asciinema-player`.
5.  **Regular Updates:** Regularly update the whitelist and parser to address new bypasses.
6.  **Testing:** Thoroughly test with various inputs, including malicious sequences and edge cases. Use fuzzing.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: Critical):** Malicious JavaScript within escape sequences could be executed. Sanitization prevents this.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Escape sequences could trigger network requests or manipulate the DOM to steal data.
*   **UI Redressing (Severity: Medium):** Manipulation of the terminal display to overlay content.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Some DoS attacks are possible via malformed input.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Risk reduced from Critical to Low.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from High to Low.
*   **UI Redressing:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (for specific input-related DoS).

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status)
*   Basic HTML escaping is done before passing data to the player.
*   Schema validation is performed.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Replace with your project's status)
*   A dedicated ANSI escape code parser and whitelist are *missing*. This is the most critical gap.
*   Regular updates to sanitization logic are not automated.
*   Comprehensive testing (including fuzzing) is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration for Safe Defaults (within `asciinema-player`)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_for_safe_defaults__within__asciinema-player__.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review `asciinema-player` Options:** Thoroughly review all available configuration options for `asciinema-player`.  Look for options related to:
    *   Terminal size limits (rows, columns).
    *   Font loading (disable if possible, or restrict sources).
    *   Any options related to interactivity or external resource loading.
2.  **Restrictive Configuration:**  Configure `asciinema-player` with the most restrictive settings possible, *without* breaking essential functionality.  Prioritize security over features.
3.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If your application doesn't need certain features (e.g., specific terminal emulation modes), disable them if possible through configuration.
4. **Example:** If the player has options to limit the maximum number of rows or columns, or to disable certain escape sequences, use them.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Medium):** Limiting terminal size can prevent some DoS attacks.
*   **Code Injection (Severity: Low):** Disabling unnecessary features reduces the attack surface.
*   **Information Disclosure (Severity: Low):** Restricting font loading can prevent font-based fingerprinting.

**Impact:**
*   **DoS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (for specific DoS types).
*   **Code Injection:** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status)
*   Default `asciinema-player` configuration is used.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Replace with your project's status)
*   A thorough review of `asciinema-player` options and implementation of restrictive settings is needed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Handling of Player Events and Output](./mitigation_strategies/careful_handling_of_player_events_and_output.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Events:** Identify any events emitted by `asciinema-player` that your application handles (e.g., events related to user interaction, playback progress, or errors).
2.  **Validate Event Data:**  *Before* using any data received from these events, rigorously validate and sanitize it.  Treat this data as untrusted input.
3.  **Output Sanitization:** If your application extracts any text or data from the rendered output of `asciinema-player` (e.g., for copying to the clipboard), sanitize this output *again* before using it. Even if the initial asciicast data was sanitized, the player's rendering process could potentially introduce vulnerabilities.
4. **Example:** If the player emits an event when the user copies text, and your application uses that copied text, sanitize the text *before* placing it on the clipboard or using it elsewhere.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: Medium):**  If event data or extracted output is used to update the DOM, sanitization prevents XSS.
*   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: Low):** Sanitization prevents the use of event data for malicious purposes.

**Impact:**
*   **XSS:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk reduced from Low to Very Low.

**Currently Implemented:** (Example - Replace with your project's status)
*   The application handles the `copy` event from the player.

**Missing Implementation:** (Example - Replace with your project's status)
*   The copied text from the `copy` event is *not* sanitized before being used. This is a potential XSS vulnerability.
