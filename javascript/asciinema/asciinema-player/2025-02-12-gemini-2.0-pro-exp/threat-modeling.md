# Threat Model Analysis for asciinema/asciinema-player

## Threat: [Malicious Escape Sequence Execution within the Player](./threats/malicious_escape_sequence_execution_within_the_player.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in the player's escape sequence parsing or handling logic allows a crafted asciicast to execute unintended actions *within the player's virtual terminal emulation*. This is distinct from XSS in the hosting application; it's about exploiting the player's internal logic. This could lead to unexpected behavior *within the rendered terminal*, potentially setting the stage for further exploits.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical:** If the vulnerability allows escaping the virtual terminal and affecting the browser context (e.g., through a browser bug triggered by the player), this could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE). This is a low-probability but high-impact scenario.
        *   **High:**  Disruption of the player's internal state, leading to incorrect rendering, crashes, or denial of service.  This could also be a stepping stone to other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `src/terminal.js` (Virtual terminal emulation and escape sequence handling).
        *   Any component responsible for parsing and interpreting escape sequences (potentially within `terminal.js` or related modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if RCE is possible), High (for disruption of player state).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Escape Sequence Handling:** Implement a secure and well-defined escape sequence parser that strictly adheres to known standards and rejects any invalid or ambiguous sequences.
        *   **Formal Grammar:** Consider using a formal grammar (e.g., a parser generator) to define the allowed escape sequences, reducing the risk of parsing errors.
        *   **Fuzz Testing:** Extensively fuzz test the escape sequence parsing logic with a wide variety of valid and invalid inputs.
        *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code responsible for handling escape sequences, looking for potential vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, integer overflows, or logic errors.
        *   **Sandboxing (Browser Level):** While this threat is *within* the player, browser-level sandboxing (iframe) still provides a crucial layer of defense against potential escalation to RCE.

## Threat: [ReDoS via Malformed Escape Sequences (within Player)](./threats/redos_via_malformed_escape_sequences__within_player_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts an asciicast with specially designed escape sequences that trigger catastrophic backtracking in regular expressions used *internally by the player* for parsing or rendering (e.g., within the `terminal.js` component). This is a direct attack on the player's code.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Denial of Service (DoS) by causing the player to consume excessive CPU, leading to browser unresponsiveness. This directly impacts the player's functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Any component using regular expressions for parsing or rendering, particularly within `src/terminal.js` or related modules that handle escape sequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Expression Auditing:** Thoroughly audit all regular expressions used *within the player* for ReDoS vulnerabilities. Use automated tools to assist with this.
        *   **Regular Expression Simplification:** Simplify regular expressions where possible to reduce the risk of backtracking.
        *   **Timeout Mechanisms:** Implement timeouts for regular expression operations *within the player* to prevent them from running indefinitely.
        *   **Alternative Parsing:** Consider using alternative parsing techniques (e.g., parser combinators) that are less susceptible to ReDoS.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Excessive Memory Consumption (within Player)](./threats/denial_of_service_via_excessive_memory_consumption__within_player_.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability in the player's memory management allows a crafted asciicast (even if seemingly valid) to cause the player to allocate excessive amounts of memory, leading to browser crashes or unresponsiveness. This is a direct attack on the player's resource handling.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **High:** Denial of Service (DoS).
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `src/player.js` (Main player logic).
        *   `src/asciicast.js` (Asciicast data parsing).
        *   `src/terminal.js` (Virtual terminal emulation).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Memory Management Review:** Thoroughly review the player's code for potential memory leaks or inefficient memory allocation patterns.
        *   **Resource Limits (Within Player):**  If possible, implement internal limits on the amount of memory the player can allocate. This is challenging in JavaScript but can be explored.
        *   **Progressive Rendering:** Implement progressive rendering to avoid loading the entire asciicast into memory at once, if the player's architecture allows.
        *   **Garbage Collection Awareness:**  Write code that is mindful of JavaScript's garbage collection, avoiding patterns that might hinder garbage collection.

## Threat: [Bypassing Sanitization via Obfuscation (within Player's parsing logic)](./threats/bypassing_sanitization_via_obfuscation__within_player's_parsing_logic_.md)

* **Description:** An attacker crafts an asciicast that uses unusual or obfuscated escape sequences or control characters to bypass *the player's internal parsing logic*, even if the hosting application has its own sanitization. This targets vulnerabilities in how the *player itself* interprets the asciicast data.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Critical:** If the bypassed content allows escaping the virtual terminal and affecting the browser, it could lead to RCE (low probability, high impact).
        * **High:** Disruption of the player's internal state, leading to incorrect rendering, crashes, or DoS.
    * **Affected Component:**
        * `src/asciicast.js` (Asciicast data parsing and processing).
        * Any component handling escape sequence parsing within the player.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical/High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Whitelist-Based Parsing:** Within the player's parsing logic, use a strict whitelist of allowed escape sequences and control characters. Reject anything not explicitly allowed.
        * **Formal Grammar (Parser):** Use a formal grammar and a robust parser (e.g., generated by a parser generator) to define and enforce the allowed asciicast format.
        * **Fuzz Testing:** Extensively fuzz test the player's parsing logic with a wide range of unusual and unexpected inputs, including obfuscated sequences.
        * **Multiple Parsing Stages:** If feasible, consider multiple stages of parsing and validation within the player.
