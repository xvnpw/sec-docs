## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Cast File (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_cast_file__high-risk_path_.md)

This path represents attacks that leverage a compromised or attacker-controlled `.cast` file.

*   **Escape Sequence Injection (CSI, OSC, etc.):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker crafts a `.cast` file containing malicious ANSI escape sequences (CSI, OSC, etc.). These sequences, if not properly sanitized by `asciinema-player`, could be used to manipulate the terminal's behavior and, potentially, interact with the DOM in a way that leads to JavaScript execution. This is an indirect attack, relying on the player's internal handling of these sequences.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential for XSS)
    *   **Effort:** Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

*   **VT Sequence Manipulation:**
    *   **Description:** Similar to escape sequence injection, but focuses on Virtual Terminal (VT) sequences. The attacker uses malformed or malicious VT sequences within the `.cast` file to trigger unexpected behavior in the player, aiming for code execution.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High (Potential for XSS)
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Medium to High
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** High

*   **Data URI in `src` (Critical Node):**
    *   **Description:** The attacker provides a `data:` URI as the `src` attribute of the `asciinema-player` element. This `data:` URI contains malicious JavaScript disguised as a `.cast` file. If the application doesn't validate the `src` attribute and allows user-supplied values, the attacker can directly execute arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Very High (depending entirely on application implementation)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Direct JavaScript execution)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerable Player Version (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_player_version__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Known CVEs (e.g., XSS) (High-Risk and Critical):**
    *   **Description:** The application uses an outdated version of `asciinema-player` with known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs), particularly those related to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The attacker leverages these known vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_issues.md)

*   **Insecure Content-Security-Policy (CSP) (Critical Node):**
    *    **Description:** The application has a weak, misconfigured, or missing Content-Security-Policy (CSP).  A weak CSP (e.g., one that allows `unsafe-inline` for scripts) significantly reduces the difficulty of exploiting XSS vulnerabilities, regardless of their origin.  It acts as a force multiplier for other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** (Indirect) High (Amplifies the impact of other vulnerabilities)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Low
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low
