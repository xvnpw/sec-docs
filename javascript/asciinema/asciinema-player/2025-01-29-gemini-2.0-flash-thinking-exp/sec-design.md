# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: To provide a reusable, embeddable web component for playing asciicast recordings.
 - Priority: Ease of integration into websites, cross-browser compatibility, performance for smooth playback, customizable appearance, open-source and community-driven development.
 - Business Value: Enables users to easily showcase terminal sessions on websites, blogs, documentation, and educational platforms, enhancing content with interactive terminal recordings. For asciinema.org, it's a core component for displaying recordings. For others, it's a valuable tool for technical communication and demonstration.

- Business Risks:
 - Availability risk: If the player fails to load or function correctly, websites embedding it might display broken content, impacting user experience.
 - Compatibility risk: Incompatibility with certain browsers or devices could limit accessibility and reach.
 - Performance risk: Poor performance could lead to slow loading times and a negative user experience.
 - Security risk (low): While primarily a frontend component, vulnerabilities could potentially be exploited to inject malicious content or compromise the embedding website (though risk is low as it mainly renders data).
 - Open Source Sustainability risk: Reliance on community contributions for maintenance and updates.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Open Source Review - The project is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the code. Implemented and described in: Public GitHub repository.
 - security control: Dependency Management - Project uses `npm` for dependency management, which allows for tracking and updating of third-party libraries. Implemented and described in: `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Reliance on client-side security - As a frontend component, security largely depends on the security of the embedding website and the user's browser.
 - accepted risk: Limited input validation - Player primarily renders asciicast data, with limited user input, reducing input-based vulnerabilities.
 - accepted risk: Dependency vulnerabilities - Potential vulnerabilities in third-party JavaScript libraries used by the player.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Dependency Scanning - Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
 - security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA) - Regularly perform SCA to identify and manage open source components and their associated risks.
 - security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) - Encourage embedding websites to use CSP to mitigate potential cross-site scripting (XSS) risks, although the player itself is unlikely to introduce XSS.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not applicable. The player is a frontend component and does not handle user authentication.
 - Authorization: Not applicable. The player does not control access to resources. Authorization is handled by the website embedding the player and the source of the asciicast data.
 - Input Validation: Limited relevance. The player primarily processes asciicast data, which is expected to be in a specific format. However, basic validation of the asciicast data format can prevent unexpected errors.
 - Cryptography: Not applicable. The player does not handle sensitive data requiring encryption. Data in transit (asciicast data) should be secured by HTTPS of the embedding website.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Displaying asciicast recordings on websites. If the player is unavailable or malfunctioning, websites embedding it will fail to display intended content.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Asciicast data: Sensitivity depends on the content of the recordings. Some asciicasts might contain sensitive information (e.g., API keys, internal system details if recordings are not properly sanitized). However, for the player itself, it primarily handles rendering publicly available asciicast data. Sensitivity is generally considered low to medium.
 - Player code itself: Protecting the integrity and availability of the player code is important to ensure websites can reliably embed and use it. Tampering with the player code could potentially lead to malicious behavior on embedding websites, although the attack surface is limited.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
 - What is the intended target audience for websites embedding the player (developers, general public, specific industries)?
 - Are there any specific performance requirements or constraints for the player (e.g., support for very long asciicasts, low-bandwidth environments)?
 - Are there any plans to integrate the player with specific analytics or tracking tools?
 - What is the expected level of customization required by users embedding the player?
 - Are there any specific accessibility requirements for the player?

- Assumptions:
 - The primary use case is embedding the player on public-facing websites to display non-sensitive or sanitized terminal recordings.
 - The player is intended to be lightweight and performant, focusing on core playback functionality.
 - Security concerns are primarily focused on preventing supply chain vulnerabilities and ensuring the player does not introduce vulnerabilities into embedding websites.
 - The player is distributed as open-source software and relies on community contributions for maintenance and updates.
 - Asciicast data is assumed to be served over HTTPS from a separate data source.
