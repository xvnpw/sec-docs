# Attack Surface Analysis for asciinema/asciinema-player

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Asciicast Data](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_asciicast_data.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious JavaScript code is embedded within the asciicast JSON data. When the player renders this data, the script executes in the user's browser.
    *   **How asciinema-player Contributes:** The player parses and renders the content of the asciicast JSON. If this content is not sanitized and contains JavaScript, the player will execute it.
    *   **Example:** An attacker hosts a malicious asciicast file containing `<script>alert('You have been hacked!')</script>` and tricks a user into viewing a page that loads this file using the player.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the user's session, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the webpage, and potentially further attacks against the user's system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed. This can prevent the execution of inline scripts and scripts from untrusted domains.
        *   **Input Sanitization/Validation:** If the asciicast data is sourced from user input or untrusted sources, implement robust server-side sanitization to remove or escape any potentially malicious JavaScript code before it's served to the player.
        *   **Ensure Trusted Asciicast Sources:** Only load asciicast files from trusted and verified sources. Avoid loading user-provided or externally hosted asciicast files without thorough scrutiny.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Remote URL Loading](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_remote_url_loading.md)

*   **Description:**  If the application allows specifying a URL for the asciicast data, an attacker can manipulate this to make the server hosting the application make requests to arbitrary internal or external resources.
    *   **How asciinema-player Contributes:**  The player (or the application using it) might fetch the asciicast data from a URL provided in the configuration or by the user. This fetching mechanism can be abused.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL pointing to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`) as the asciicast source. The server hosting the application will then make a request to this internal service.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of internal services, access to sensitive data within the internal network, potential for further attacks on internal systems, and denial of service against other services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **URL Whitelisting:**  Implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains or specific URLs from which asciicast data can be loaded.
        *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided URLs to prevent manipulation.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate the server hosting the application from internal resources it doesn't need to access.
        *   **Disable or Restrict Remote URL Loading:** If possible, restrict the player to only load locally stored asciicast files.

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal (if loading local files)](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal__if_loading_local_files_.md)

*   **Description:** If the player is configured to load asciicast files from the local filesystem based on user-provided paths, an attacker might be able to access files outside the intended directory.
    *   **How asciinema-player Contributes:** The player's configuration or the application's logic might directly use user-provided input to construct file paths for loading asciicast data.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a path like `../../../../etc/passwd` as the asciicast source, potentially allowing access to sensitive system files on the server.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive files, potential for privilege escalation, and compromise of the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid User-Provided File Paths:**  Do not allow users to directly specify file paths for loading asciicast data.
        *   **Use Safe File Handling Practices:** If local file loading is necessary, use secure file handling methods that prevent path traversal (e.g., using whitelists of allowed files or canonicalizing paths).
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the application with the minimum necessary permissions to access files.
