# Threat Model Analysis for asciinema/asciinema-player

## Threat: [Malicious Asciicast Content Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/malicious_asciicast_content_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious asciicast recording. This recording contains sequences (e.g., within command outputs or filenames) that, when rendered by the asciinema player, are interpreted by the browser as JavaScript code. The attacker might achieve this by embedding `<script>` tags or manipulating event handlers within the asciicast data. This vulnerability resides within the player's interpretation and rendering of the asciicast data.
    *   **Impact:** Successful execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the hosting web application. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the web page, or exfiltration of sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **`src/player/render.js` (Rendering logic):**  The functions responsible for interpreting the asciicast data and updating the DOM.
        *   **Potentially `src/player/dom.js` (DOM manipulation):** Functions that directly interact with the browser's DOM to display the terminal output.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization within the Player:** Modify the asciinema player's code to thoroughly validate and sanitize all data within the asciicast recording before it is rendered. This includes escaping HTML characters and removing or neutralizing potentially malicious JavaScript constructs. This needs to be done *within* the player's codebase.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP on the hosting web application to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities. While this doesn't prevent the vulnerability in the player, it limits the damage.
        *   **Regularly Update Asciinema Player:** Keep the asciinema player library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches released by the maintainers.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Asciinema Player Code](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_asciinema_player_code.md)

*   **Description:** The asciinema player, being a JavaScript application, may contain its own security vulnerabilities within its codebase. An attacker could discover and exploit these vulnerabilities by crafting specific asciicast data or by directly interacting with the player's functions in unexpected ways. Examples include DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities within the player's JavaScript or logic errors that allow bypassing security checks.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution (XSS), denial of service, or other unintended and potentially harmful behavior within the user's browser.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   **Various JavaScript modules within the `src/player/` directory:**  Depending on the specific vulnerability, it could reside in any part of the player's core logic, rendering engine, or event handling mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Security Audits of Asciinema Player Code:** If feasible, conduct or commission security audits of the asciinema player's source code to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Keep Asciinema Player Updated:**  Staying up-to-date with the latest version is crucial to benefit from security patches released by the project maintainers.
        *   **Report Potential Vulnerabilities:** If you discover a potential vulnerability in the asciinema player, report it responsibly to the project maintainers.
        *   **Consider Sandboxing:** If the architecture allows, consider sandboxing the environment where the asciinema player operates to limit the potential impact of a successful exploit.
