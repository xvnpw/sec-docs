        print("**1. Insecure URL Handling:**")
        print("   - **Lack of URL Validation/Sanitization:** The application might directly use user-provided URLs or data to construct URLs for fetching asciicast files without proper validation. This can lead to:")
        print("     - **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Attacker manipulates the URL to make the application fetch resources from internal networks or arbitrary external sites.")

        print("     - **Injection Attacks:** Malicious characters in the URL could be interpreted by the server in unintended ways.")
        print("   - **Reliance on User-Controlled Hostnames/Paths:** If the application allows users to specify the hostname or path of asciicast files without strict control, attackers can point to malicious servers.\n")

        print("**2. Lack of Content Verification:**")
        print("   - **No Integrity Checks:** The application might not verify the integrity of the downloaded asciicast file, allowing for Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks.")
        print("     - **Absence of HTTPS Enforcement:** Fetching files over insecure HTTP allows interception and modification.")
        print("     - **Lack of Checksum Verification:** No mechanism to verify the downloaded file against a known good hash (e.g., SHA-256).")
