## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Asciicast Content -> Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Output Sequences](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_asciicast_content_-_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_output_sequences.md)

* Attack Vector: Inject malicious <script> tags or event handlers within terminal output of an asciicast file.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High (Account takeover, data theft, malicious actions)
    * Effort: Low to Medium
    * Skill Level: Low to Medium
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Contributing Factor (Critical Node): Application directly renders untrusted asciicast content.
        * Description: The application takes asciicast data from an untrusted source and directly renders it in the browser without any processing or sanitization.
    * Contributing Factor (Critical Node): Application insufficiently sanitizes or escapes asciicast output.
        * Description: The application attempts to sanitize or escape the asciicast output but does so improperly, allowing malicious code to bypass the filters.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in asciinema-player Code -> Leverage Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_asciinema-player_code_-_leverage_known_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific version of asciinema-player being used by the application.
    * Likelihood: Medium (if using an outdated version)
    * Impact: High (Depends on the specific vulnerability, could be RCE, XSS, etc.)
    * Effort: Low (if an exploit exists) to Medium (if adaptation is needed)
    * Skill Level: Low to Medium (if an exploit exists) to High (if exploit development is required)
    * Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Weaknesses -> Insecure Loading of Asciicast Files -> Application loads asciicast files from user-controlled URLs without validation](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_weaknesses_-_insecure_loading_of_asciicast_files_-_application_loads_asciicast_f_2fee2a86.md)

* Attack Vector: An attacker provides a URL to a malicious asciicast file hosted on their server. This file, when loaded by the application, executes malicious JavaScript in the user's browser.
    * Likelihood: Medium (if the application implements this functionality)
    * Impact: High (XSS, potential for further attacks)
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Asciicast Content](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_asciicast_content.md)

The attacker crafts a malicious asciicast file designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the player or the application's handling of it. This can encompass XSS, DoS, or other forms of attack.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Output Sequences](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_output_sequences.md)

The attacker's goal is to inject and execute malicious scripts within the user's browser by manipulating the terminal output rendered by the asciinema-player.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application directly renders untrusted asciicast content](./attack_tree_paths/application_directly_renders_untrusted_asciicast_content.md)

A fundamental security flaw where the application trusts and displays external data without any validation or sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application insufficiently sanitizes or escapes asciicast output](./attack_tree_paths/application_insufficiently_sanitizes_or_escapes_asciicast_output.md)

A vulnerability arising from flawed or incomplete attempts to remove or neutralize malicious content from the asciicast data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerabilities.md)

Exploiting publicly documented security flaws in specific versions of the asciinema-player library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Loading of Asciicast Files](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_loading_of_asciicast_files.md)

The application's mechanism for retrieving and loading asciicast files is vulnerable, allowing attackers to serve malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Application loads asciicast files from user-controlled URLs without validation](./attack_tree_paths/application_loads_asciicast_files_from_user-controlled_urls_without_validation.md)

A specific instance of insecure loading where the application directly uses user-provided URLs to fetch asciicast files, opening it up to the serving of malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insufficient Sanitization of Asciicast Data Before Passing to Player](./attack_tree_paths/insufficient_sanitization_of_asciicast_data_before_passing_to_player.md)

The application fails to properly clean or neutralize potentially harmful content within the asciicast data before providing it to the asciinema-player for rendering. This allows malicious code embedded in the asciicast to be processed and potentially executed.
