## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Malicious Recording Data](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_malicious_recording_data.md)

* Goal: Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the hosting application by injecting malicious content into an asciinema recording.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Inject Script Tags:
        * Description: An attacker crafts an asciinema recording file that includes `<script>` tags. When the asciinema-player renders this recording, the browser executes the embedded JavaScript code within the context of the hosting application.
        * Impact: Full compromise of the user's session, including the ability to steal cookies, access sensitive data, perform actions on behalf of the user, and potentially deface the application.
    * Inject Malicious HTML Attributes/Events:
        * Description: An attacker crafts an asciinema recording file that includes HTML elements with malicious attributes, such as `onload`, `onerror`, or event handlers like `onclick`. When the player renders these elements, the associated JavaScript code within the attributes is executed.
        * Impact: Similar to script tag injection, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution and potential compromise of the user's session.
    * Deliver Malicious Recording Data:
        * Description: After crafting a malicious recording, the attacker needs to deliver it to the victim's browser. This can be achieved by:
            * Compromise Recording Source: The attacker gains access to the server or storage where asciinema recording files are hosted and replaces legitimate recordings with their malicious ones.
            * Impact: Any user viewing the compromised recording will be subject to the injected malicious content, potentially leading to widespread compromise.
        * Description: Alternatively, the attacker can perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack to intercept the request for a legitimate recording and replace it with the malicious one.
            * Impact: Users viewing the recording during the MITM attack will be exposed to the injected malicious content.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Content into Recording Data](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_content_into_recording_data.md)

* Goal: Embed malicious JavaScript or HTML within the asciinema recording data itself.
* Attack Vectors: (Covered in the "Exploit Malicious Recording Data" high-risk path above)

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Deliver Malicious Recording Data](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_deliver_malicious_recording_data.md)

* Goal: Ensure the crafted malicious recording is served to the target user's browser.
* Attack Vectors: (Covered in the "Exploit Malicious Recording Data" high-risk path above)

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Compromise Recording Source](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_compromise_recording_source.md)

* Goal: Gain control over the storage or server hosting asciinema recording files.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in the server operating system or web server software.
    * Brute-forcing or stealing credentials used to access the recording storage.
    * Social engineering attacks targeting administrators of the recording source.
    * Exploiting misconfigurations in access controls or permissions on the recording storage.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Asciinema Player Code](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_asciinema_player_code.md)

* Goal: Execute arbitrary JavaScript code by exploiting inherent vulnerabilities within the asciinema-player's JavaScript code.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Player Logic:
        * Description: The attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability in the asciinema-player's JavaScript code that allows them to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript. This could involve manipulating parameters passed to the player or exploiting flaws in how the player handles or renders data.
        * Impact: Full compromise of the user's session, similar to injecting malicious content in the recording data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities in Player Logic](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities_in_player_logic.md)

* Goal: Find and exploit a flaw within the asciinema-player's JavaScript code that allows for the injection and execution of arbitrary scripts.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Identifying input sanitization failures in the player's code.
    * Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the player handles user-provided data or external data sources.
    * Finding flaws in the player's DOM manipulation logic that can be leveraged for script injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Misconfiguration of the Player](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_misconfiguration_of_the_player.md)

* Goal: Leverage improper configuration of the application using asciinema-player to facilitate an attack.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Allowing Untrusted Recording Sources:
        * Description: The application is configured to load asciinema recordings from sources that are not under the control of the application developers or are otherwise untrusted. This allows an attacker to host malicious recordings on their own server and have the application load and execute them.
        * Impact: Opens the door for the "Exploit Malicious Recording Data" attack path, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution.
    * Insufficient Security Headers:
        * Description: The hosting application lacks crucial security headers, such as Content Security Policy (CSP), HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS), or X-Frame-Options. This weakens the application's defenses and makes it easier for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities in the asciinema-player.
        * Impact: Increases the likelihood and impact of various attacks, including XSS, clickjacking, and MITM attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Allowing Untrusted Recording Sources](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_allowing_untrusted_recording_sources.md)

* Goal: Configure the application to load asciinema recordings from sources that are not verified or controlled by the application.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Directly configuring the player to load recordings from user-provided URLs without validation.
    * Using a configuration that defaults to loading from public or untrusted sources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Insufficient Security Headers](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_insufficient_security_headers.md)

* Goal: Fail to implement or properly configure security-related HTTP headers on the hosting application.
* Attack Vectors:
    * Simply not setting security headers in the web server configuration.
    * Implementing overly permissive or incorrect security header configurations.
