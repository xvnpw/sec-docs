# Attack Surface Analysis for asciinema/asciinema-player

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Asciicast Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_asciicast_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code within the text content or terminal control sequences of an asciicast file.
*   **How asciinema-player contributes:** If the player doesn't properly sanitize or escape the content of the asciicast before rendering it in the DOM, the injected script can execute in the user's browser within the context of the hosting application.
*   **Example:** An asciicast file containing the text `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` which, if not properly escaped, will execute the JavaScript alert.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session within the application, including access to cookies, local storage, and the ability to perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the `asciinema-player` library is up-to-date, as newer versions may contain XSS prevention measures.
    *   If possible, sanitize or escape the text content of asciicast files on the server-side before serving them.

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based XSS through Player's JavaScript](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_xss_through_player's_javascript.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities exist in the `asciinema-player`'s own JavaScript code that manipulates the DOM to render the asciicast, allowing for the execution of malicious scripts.
*   **How asciinema-player contributes:** The player's JavaScript code dynamically creates and modifies DOM elements based on the asciicast data. If this process is flawed, attacker-controlled data can be used to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Example:** A vulnerability in the player's code that allows an attacker to control the value of an attribute that is later used in a way that executes JavaScript (e.g., `element.innerHTML = userControlledValue`).
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session within the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `asciinema-player` library updated to the latest version, as developers actively patch such vulnerabilities.
    *   Developers integrating the player should carefully review the player's documentation and any available security guidelines.
