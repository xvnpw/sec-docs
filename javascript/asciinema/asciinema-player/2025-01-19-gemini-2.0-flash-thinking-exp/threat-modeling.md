# Threat Model Analysis for asciinema/asciinema-player

## Threat: [Malicious Asciicast Content Leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/malicious_asciicast_content_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious asciicast file containing terminal control sequences or other content that, when processed and rendered by the player, executes arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser. This could involve embedding `<script>` tags or manipulating DOM elements in a way that triggers JavaScript execution.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise (session hijacking), data theft (accessing cookies, local storage), redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the application embedding the player, and potentially further attacks on the user's system.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `src/player.js`: The core logic for parsing and rendering asciicast frames.
    *   `src/render.js`: The module responsible for updating the DOM based on the asciicast content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization of asciicast data *within the player* before rendering.
    *   Ensure the player properly escapes or neutralizes any potentially executable content within the asciicast data, especially terminal control sequences.
    *   Keep the `asciinema-player` library updated to the latest version, as security patches may address XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [DOM Manipulation Vulnerabilities](./threats/dom_manipulation_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits flaws in the player's JavaScript code that handles the manipulation of the Document Object Model (DOM). By providing a specially crafted asciicast, the attacker can cause the player to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the web page.
*   **Impact:** Similar to XSS, leading to account compromise, data theft, and application defacement. The attacker gains control over parts of the webpage through the player's actions.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   `src/render.js`: The primary module responsible for updating the DOM to reflect the asciicast content.
    *   Potentially other modules involved in handling specific terminal control sequences or rendering features.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly review the player's code for secure DOM manipulation practices, ensuring proper escaping and avoiding direct HTML injection where possible.
    *   Use browser APIs designed for safe DOM manipulation.
    *   Employ code linting and static analysis tools during player development to identify potential DOM manipulation vulnerabilities.
    *   Keep the `asciinema-player` library updated.

## Threat: [Client-Side Code Injection via Player Vulnerabilities](./threats/client-side_code_injection_via_player_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability within the `asciinema-player`'s JavaScript code itself. This could involve flaws in how the player parses the asciicast data, handles user interactions, or manages its internal state. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser context.
*   **Impact:** Full control over the client-side context, leading to data theft, session hijacking, performing actions on behalf of the user, and potentially further attacks.
*   **Affected Component:** Any part of the `asciinema-player` codebase could be affected depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `asciinema-player` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
    *   If possible, conduct security audits or penetration testing of the `asciinema-player` code.
    *   Report any discovered vulnerabilities to the maintainers of the library.
