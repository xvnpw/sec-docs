- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure WebSocket Authentication Leading to Arbitrary Expression Evaluation
  **Description:**
  - The VS Code Debug Visualizer extension establishes a websocket connection for evaluating expressions during a debug session. According to the README, the websocket server “is secured by a random token.” However, no further details (or safeguards) are provided regarding how the token is generated, transmitted, or bound to the connecting client. An external attacker with network access to this server may be able to guess or capture the token and then send unauthorized expression–evaluation commands.
  - **Steps to trigger:**
    1. Identify the port and endpoint on which the websocket server is running (this may be inferred from logs, configuration, or the connection URL shown in the webview).
    2. Observe network traffic or use a network scanner to determine whether the token is leaked (for example, via URL parameters or debug logs).
    3. Use a WebSocket client (e.g. wscat or a custom script) to try to connect using a guessed or captured token.
    4. Once connected, send specially crafted expression–evaluation requests to the backend debugging/evaluation API.

  **Impact:**
  - Bypassing the intended authentication can lead to arbitrary expression execution in the debugee process. In environments where the evaluation context controls sensitive operations or holds confidential data, this can escalate to remote code execution or unauthorized data disclosure.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The project documentation mentions that a “random token” secures the websocket connection. This indicates some basic measure was considered.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no evidence of additional safeguards such as:
    - Strong cryptographic randomness or proper entropy in token generation
    - Binding the token to the client’s IP address or session
    - Enforcing that the websocket server listens only on a loopback or otherwise tightly controlled interface
    - Rate limiting or logging to detect brute-force attempts
    - Secure lookup and transmission (e.g. via TLS) to prevent interception

  **Preconditions:**
  - The websocket server must be accessible from an external network interface (or by a local attacker able to view network traffic).
  - The token generation mechanism must be weak or leaking such that an attacker can guess or capture it.

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The README in the `/code/extension/README.md` explains that after the webview is loaded the client “connects to the websocket server” used for expression evaluation. No additional code or comments confirm robust token management. This lack of detail (and absence of code specifying strong binding or validation) suggests that if the token generation is predictable or if the token is inadvertently exposed (for example, in debug logs or query parameters), an adversary may bypass the intended authentication checks.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Deploy the extension and note the port/endpoint for the websocket server (inspect configuration or network traffic during a normal debug session).
  2. Attempt to capture or observe the token using a network sniffer (if transmitted in cleartext) or check application logs.
  3. Using a WebSocket client (for example, using the command-line tool “wscat”), attempt a connection to the endpoint without a valid token. Verify that the connection is rejected.
  4. If possible, based on observed token-generation details, craft a connection request including a guessed or leaked token.
  5. Send a benign test expression that returns a known result.
  6. Evaluate whether the backend processes the expression and returns output.
  7. Document if unauthorized evaluation is possible; if so, this confirms the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Directory Traversal via Insecure HTTP File Serving in the Webview
  **Description:**
  - To work around certain browser security restrictions (such as preventing lazy chunk loading and websockets from a file URL), the extension serves its webview assets from an HTTP server rather than directly from the filesystem. The README in `/code/extension/README.md` states that “the webview is served from an http server” without outlining how file requests are validated. If the HTTP server’s implementation does not properly sanitize file path inputs (for example, by rejecting path elements such as “../”), an attacker could craft a URL that escapes the intended asset directory and gains read access to sensitive files on the disk.
  - **Steps to trigger:**
    1. Determine the base URL and port at which the webview HTTP server is running (this may be visible in the browser’s address bar or through inspection of server logs).
    2. Construct an HTTP request that manipulates the file path using directory–traversal sequences (e.g., appending “../../” to the URL path).
    3. Send the crafted request and analyze the response.

  **Impact:**
  - Successful exploitation would lead to unauthorized disclosure of files, potentially including configuration files, source code, or other sensitive resources. In scenarios where the server is accessible from the wider network, this can considerably widen the attack surface by exposing internal application logic and secrets.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The documentation mentions serving files via HTTP to work around security mechanisms but does not indicate that there is any path‐validation or sandboxing in place.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no indication of:
    - Rigorous input validation or sanitization on the requested file paths
    - Use of a whitelist (or chroot-like restriction) ensuring that only files within a designated directory are served
    - Proper error handling that returns safe HTTP error codes (e.g., 404 or 403) for out–of–scope path requests

  **Preconditions:**
  - The HTTP server must be bound to a network interface where an attacker can reach it (rather than exclusively on localhost).
  - The file serving code must not enforce strict path restrictions, thereby allowing directory traversal.

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - While the actual implementation code for the HTTP server is not provided, the README in `/code/extension/README.md` explains that the webview is served from an HTTP server rather than from the local file system. The absence of discussion about input sanitation or whitelisting (and the fact that working around browser security was the primary driver) raises concerns that user–supplied URL paths could be exploited.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Identify the base URL where the webview assets are served (e.g., http://localhost:PORT/).
  2. Using a tool such as curl or a browser, append directory traversal sequences to the URL—for example:
     - `http://localhost:PORT/../../../../etc/passwd` (on UNIX systems) or a similar path for Windows.
  3. Send the HTTP GET request and observe the server’s response.
  4. Verify that the server either returns a proper HTTP error (403/404) or is unexpectedly returning file contents outside the designated directory.
  5. If unauthorized file contents are revealed, document the vulnerable behavior.
