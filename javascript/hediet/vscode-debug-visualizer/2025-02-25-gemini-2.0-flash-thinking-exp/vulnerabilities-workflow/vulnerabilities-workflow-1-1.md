- Vulnerability Name: Insecure WebSocket Authentication leading to Arbitrary Expression Evaluation
- Description:
    - The Debug Visualizer extension uses a WebSocket server for communication between the extension backend and the webview frontend.
    - Authentication to the WebSocket server is mentioned to be secured by a random token in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
    - If this random token is predictable, guessable, or exposed insecurely, an attacker could potentially connect to the WebSocket server.
    - Once connected, the attacker could send commands to the server, including commands to evaluate arbitrary expressions in the context of the debugging session.
    - This could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the debugging environment.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution within the debugging context. This could lead to:
    - Information disclosure: An attacker could execute code to read sensitive data accessible in the debug environment, such as environment variables, file contents, or application secrets.
    - Modification of program state: An attacker could alter the execution flow of the debugged application by modifying variables or calling functions.
    - Further exploitation: In a development environment, arbitrary code execution can be a stepping stone to compromise the developer's machine or the development infrastructure.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file mentions "The websocket server is used to evaluate expressions and is secured by a random token." This suggests that token-based authentication is intended as a mitigation. However, the security of this mitigation depends entirely on the implementation details of token generation, handling, and validation, which are not available in the provided files. Without source code, it's impossible to assess the effectiveness of this mitigation.
- Missing mitigations:
    - **Cryptographically Secure Token Generation:** Ensure the random token is generated using a cryptographically secure random number generator and is sufficiently long to prevent brute-force guessing.
    - **Secure Token Transmission:**  The method of transmitting the token to the webview should be secure. Avoid passing the token in the URL, as URLs can be easily logged and exposed. Consider using secure postMessage communication or a similar secure channel if available within the VS Code extension API.
    - **Robust WebSocket Authentication and Authorization:** Implement proper authentication on the WebSocket server to validate the token for each incoming connection and subsequent requests. Ensure that the token is securely associated with a specific debug session and user.
    - **Session Management:**  Implement proper session management for WebSocket connections. Terminate sessions when the debug session ends or after a period of inactivity.
    - **Rate Limiting and Brute-Force Protection:** Implement rate limiting on authentication attempts to mitigate potential brute-force token guessing attacks.
- Preconditions:
    - The "Debug Visualizer" extension must be installed and activated in VS Code.
    - A user must be actively engaged in a debugging session using VS Code with the "Debug Visualizer" extension enabled.
    - An attacker needs to be able to discover or guess the WebSocket token used for authentication. This could potentially be achieved if the token is exposed insecurely (e.g., in URLs, logs, network traffic) or if the token generation is weak.
- Source code analysis:
    - The provided files are mostly documentation and configuration. There is no source code available to analyze the WebSocket implementation and token handling directly.
    - The `CONTRIBUTING.md` file states: "The websocket server is used to evaluate expressions and is secured by a random token." This confirms the use of a WebSocket and token-based security, but without code, the implementation details are unknown.
    - The `extension/README.md` mentions: "After installing this extension, use the command `Debug Visualizer: New View` to open a new visualizer view." This indicates that a new webview is created when a Debug Visualizer view is opened, which is likely where the WebSocket connection is initiated and the token is used.

- Security test case:
    1. Install the "Debug Visualizer" extension in VS Code from the marketplace.
    2. Open VS Code and create or open a simple project (e.g., the JavaScript demo project provided in the repository, or any project suitable for debugging).
    3. Start a debugging session in VS Code.
    4. Open a "Debug Visualizer: New View" by using the command palette and executing "Debug Visualizer: New View". This will open the Debug Visualizer webview.
    5. **Attempt to identify the WebSocket connection details and token:**
        - **Inspect Network Traffic:** Use browser developer tools within the Debug Visualizer webview (if accessible) or an external network proxy (like Burp Suite or Wireshark) to monitor network traffic. Look for WebSocket handshake requests initiated by the webview. Examine the request headers and URL for any parameters that resemble a token or authentication key.  Specifically, look for query parameters or WebSocket `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` headers that might contain the token.
        - **Examine VS Code Extension Logs:** Check VS Code's "Output" panel. There might be logs from the "Debug Visualizer" extension that reveal WebSocket connection details, including the token. Look for output channels related to the extension.
        - **Inspect Webview URL (if applicable):** If the webview is loaded via a standard browser URL (which is less likely for VS Code extensions but worth checking), try to inspect the URL of the webview to see if the token is passed as a URL parameter.
    6. **If a potential token is identified:**
        - **Construct WebSocket Client:** Use a WebSocket client (like `wscat`, or a simple script using libraries like `ws` in Node.js or `websockets` in Python) to attempt to connect to the WebSocket server. You will need to determine the WebSocket server URL (the host and port, which might be localhost and a dynamically assigned port, or a fixed port if configured). You may need to guess or infer the base URL from the extension's behavior or documentation if it's not explicitly exposed.
        - **Include Token in Connection Request:** When initiating the WebSocket connection, include the identified token in the way you suspect it's used (e.g., as a query parameter in the URL, or in a `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header if that was observed in the network traffic).
    7. **Send Expression Evaluation Command:** Once a WebSocket connection is established (and if authentication appears to be successful using the token), send a JSON payload to the server to evaluate an expression. A typical command structure might look like:
        ```json
        {
          "type": "evaluateExpression",
          "expression": "1+1"
        }
        ```
        For JavaScript debugging, you could try expressions like `process.env` or `require('fs').readFileSync('/etc/passwd', 'utf8')` (if the debugged environment permits such operations).
    8. **Observe Response:** Monitor the WebSocket connection for a response from the server. If the expression is evaluated successfully, the response will likely contain the result of the expression.
    9. **Attempt Arbitrary Code Execution:** If expression evaluation is successful, try to evaluate more complex or potentially malicious expressions to assess the extent of code execution capabilities.
    10. **If successful in executing arbitrary code through the WebSocket:** This confirms the "Insecure WebSocket Authentication leading to Arbitrary Expression Evaluation" vulnerability.
