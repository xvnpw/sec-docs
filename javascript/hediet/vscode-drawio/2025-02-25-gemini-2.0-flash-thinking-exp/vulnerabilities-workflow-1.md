## Unvalidated Plugin Loading leading to Remote Code Execution / Malicious Plugin Injection via Workspace Plugin Configuration / Malicious Plugin Loading

This vulnerability describes a critical security flaw in the Draw.io VS Code Integration extension that allows for remote code execution through the loading of unvalidated or malicious plugins. The extension supports loading external Draw.io plugins, which are JavaScript files, to enhance its functionality. However, the mechanism for loading these plugins lacks sufficient security measures, making it susceptible to exploitation by attackers.

### Vulnerability Name
Unvalidated Plugin Loading leading to Remote Code Execution / Malicious Plugin Injection via Workspace Plugin Configuration / Malicious Plugin Loading

### Description
The Draw.io VS Code Integration extension allows users to enhance its functionality by loading external Draw.io plugins, which are essentially JavaScript files.  These plugins can be configured through the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting, using file paths that can include workspace variables like `${workspaceFolder}`.

1.  **Attacker crafts a malicious plugin:** An attacker prepares a malicious Draw.io plugin, which is a JavaScript file containing harmful code designed to execute arbitrary commands or perform malicious actions within the user's VS Code environment.
2.  **Plugin configuration manipulation:** The attacker needs to trick the user into configuring the Draw.io extension to load this malicious plugin. This can be achieved in several ways:
    *   **Social Engineering:** Convincing the user to manually add a malicious plugin configuration to their VS Code settings (either user or workspace settings).
    *   **Workspace Manipulation:** For shared workspaces (e.g., via Liveshare or Git repositories), an attacker with write access can inject or replace a plugin file with malicious JavaScript in the workspace and configure the workspace settings to load it.
    *   **Compromised Repository:** If the user opens a Draw.io diagram from a compromised repository containing a malicious plugin and corresponding workspace settings, the vulnerability can be triggered.
3.  **Diagram opening triggers plugin loading:** When the user opens a Draw.io diagram file (e.g., `.drawio`, `.drawio.svg`, `.drawio.png`) in VS Code, the Draw.io extension processes the plugin settings. It attempts to load the plugins defined in the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` configuration.
4.  **User confirmation prompt (initial load or change):**  Upon encountering a new plugin or a modification to an existing plugin file (detected by a change in its hash), the extension displays a dialog box prompting the user to either "Allow" or "Block" the loading of the plugin.
5.  **Malicious plugin execution upon user approval:** If the user, unaware of the risks or through social engineering, clicks "Allow" in the confirmation dialog, the malicious plugin's JavaScript code is loaded and executed within the Draw.io editor's webview context. Crucially, once a plugin is approved and its fingerprint stored in `hediet.vscode-drawio.knownPlugins`, subsequent modifications to the plugin file are not re-validated, and the modified malicious code can be executed without further prompts.
6.  **Arbitrary code execution:** The malicious plugin code runs with the privileges of the VS Code extension within the webview context. This allows the attacker to perform various malicious actions, including accessing sensitive files, exfiltrating data, manipulating workspace files, and potentially further compromising the user's local environment.

### Impact
Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the VS Code environment, leading to severe consequences:

*   **Full System Compromise (Potential):**  While the plugin runs in a webview, successful exploitation can potentially escalate to full system compromise depending on the capabilities exposed by the VS Code API and any vulnerabilities in VS Code itself or the extension's interaction with the API.
*   **Data Theft / Information Disclosure:** A malicious plugin can access and exfiltrate sensitive information including:
    *   Workspace files and project source code.
    *   VS Code configuration and settings.
    *   Environment variables.
    *   Potentially credentials, tokens, or secrets stored within the VS Code environment.
*   **Data Manipulation:** The plugin can modify workspace files, settings, and inject malicious code into other projects within the workspace, potentially leading to supply chain attacks or persistent compromise.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker gains unauthorized access to the user's VS Code session and the resources accessible within that context.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) like attacks within VS Code:** Operating within the webview, the malicious plugin can manipulate the Draw.io editor's UI and functionality, opening doors to XSS-like attacks within the VS Code environment.

### Vulnerability Rank
Critical / High (Ranked as Critical in one list and High in another, considering the potential for RCE and significant impact, it's reasonable to classify it as **Critical** or **High-Critical**).

### Currently implemented mitigations
The extension has implemented some mitigations, but they are insufficient to fully prevent the vulnerability:

*   **User Confirmation Dialog:** When a new plugin or a modified plugin is detected, the extension displays a dialog box prompting the user to "Allow" or "Block" its loading. This is intended to prevent automatic loading of untrusted plugins.
*   **Plugin Fingerprinting:** The extension calculates a SHA256 hash (fingerprint) of each plugin file. This fingerprint is used to identify plugins and detect changes. User's allow/disallow decisions are stored based on the plugin's path and fingerprint in the `hediet.vscode-drawio.knownPlugins` user setting. This aims to prevent repeated prompts for the same plugin and to detect modifications.

### Missing mitigations
Several critical mitigations are missing, leaving the extension vulnerable:

*   **Robust Plugin Path Validation:** The extension lacks strict validation and sanitization of plugin file paths specified in the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting. It should verify that paths are within the workspace or trusted locations to prevent loading plugins from arbitrary or unexpected file system locations.
*   **Robust Integrity Verification / Automated Re-validation:**  There is no cryptographic signature verification or robust integrity check on the plugin file beyond the initial hash. Once a plugin is approved, subsequent modifications to the file are not re-validated or re-prompted to the user, allowing an attacker to modify the plugin content post-approval without user awareness.
*   **Plugin Sandbox / Isolation:** The extension does not sandbox the plugin execution environment. Plugins run with full extension privileges within the webview, granting them broad access to the webview's capabilities and potentially the VS Code API. Isolating plugins in a restricted JavaScript sandbox would limit their access to system resources, the file system, and other VS Code functionalities, minimizing the impact of a malicious plugin.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a strict Content Security Policy for the Draw.io webview could significantly restrict the capabilities of loaded plugins. CSP can limit actions like loading external scripts, executing inline JavaScript, or accessing certain browser APIs, reducing the attack surface of malicious plugins.
*   **Enforced User Consent / Strengthened Consent Mechanism:** While a user confirmation dialog exists, the mechanism needs to be strengthened to guarantee plugins are never loaded and executed without explicit, informed, and ongoing user approval. This includes addressing potential bypasses through path manipulation or configuration issues and ensuring re-validation on plugin file modifications.
*   **Clearer Security Guidance and Warnings:** The extension should provide more prominent and explicit security warnings to users about the risks of loading external plugins. Documentation should emphasize the potential dangers of loading untrusted plugins and guide users on how to securely manage plugin configurations, highlighting the risks associated with adding plugin configurations from untrusted sources or shared workspaces.

### Preconditions
Several preconditions must be met for this vulnerability to be exploited:

*   **VS Code Draw.io Integration Extension Installed:** The user must have the VS Code Draw.io Integration extension installed and actively use it to open Draw.io diagram files.
*   **User Configuration Manipulation / Workspace Access:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting to include a malicious plugin. This can be achieved through:
    *   **Social Engineering:** Tricking the user into manually adding the malicious plugin configuration to their VS Code settings.
    *   **Workspace Write Access:** Gaining write access to the workspace directory (e.g., by compromising a collaborative Liveshare session, injecting files into a shared repository, or through other means).
*   **User Approval (Initial Load):** The user must click "Allow" in the plugin confirmation dialog when initially prompted by the extension to load the malicious plugin (or when the plugin's hash changes for the first time).

### Source code analysis
Due to the lack of provided source code, a detailed code analysis is not possible. However, based on the documentation, observed behavior, and configuration files, the following steps are inferred to be part of the plugin loading process:

1.  **Configuration Reading:** On startup or when a Draw.io file is opened, the extension reads the user or workspace setting `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins`. This setting is expected to be an array of plugin definitions, each containing a `file` property specifying the path to a JavaScript plugin file.
2.  **Path Resolution:** The extension resolves the absolute path for each plugin file specified in the configuration. It is assumed that workspace variables like `${workspaceFolder}` are correctly resolved.
3.  **File Loading:** The extension reads the content of the JavaScript file from the resolved path.
4.  **Hash Calculation:** A cryptographic hash (e.g., SHA-256) of the plugin file content is calculated to create a fingerprint of the plugin.
5.  **Known Plugin Check:** The extension checks the `hediet.vscode-drawio.knownPlugins` user setting. This setting stores a record of previously encountered plugins, including their paths, fingerprints, and user decisions (allow/block).
6.  **User Confirmation Dialog (Conditional):** If a plugin (identified by its path and fingerprint) is not found in `knownPlugins`, or if the calculated fingerprint differs from the stored fingerprint for a known plugin path, a confirmation dialog is presented to the user. This dialog displays the plugin file path and asks for permission to load it.
7.  **Plugin Loading and Execution (on Allow):** If the user clicks "Allow" in the confirmation dialog, or if the plugin was previously allowed and its fingerprint has not changed, the extension proceeds to load the plugin. This likely involves dynamically injecting the JavaScript code from the plugin file into the Draw.io editor's webview context.
8.  **JavaScript Code Execution:** Once injected, the JavaScript code within the plugin file executes within the webview environment, gaining access to the webview's context and potentially interacting with the VS Code API through the extension's communication bridge.
9.  **Missing Re-validation:** Crucially, after the initial approval and fingerprint storage, subsequent loads of the plugin file do not trigger a re-validation of the file's integrity or a new user prompt. If the plugin file is modified after approval, the modified code will be executed without further checks.

### Security test case
To verify the Malicious Plugin Loading vulnerability, perform the following steps:

1.  **Prepare Malicious Plugin:** Create a JavaScript file named `malicious-plugin.js` within your workspace folder. Add the following code to this file to demonstrate malicious activity (e.g., logging to console and displaying an alert):

    ```javascript
    console.warn("Malicious plugin is running!");
    alert("Malicious Plugin Executed!");
    ```

2.  **Configure Plugin Setting:** Open your workspace or user `settings.json` file and add the following configuration to the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting. Ensure the path to `malicious-plugin.js` is correct relative to your workspace root:

    ```json
    "hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins": [
        {
            "file": "${workspaceFolder}/malicious-plugin.js"
        }
    ]
    ```

3.  **Open Draw.io Diagram:** Open any `.drawio`, `.drawio.svg`, or `.drawio.png` file in VS Code to activate the Draw.io extension and trigger plugin loading.

4.  **Observe Confirmation Dialog:** A dialog should appear, prompting you to allow or disallow loading the plugin from `malicious-plugin.js`.

5.  **Click "Allow":** Click the "Allow" button in the dialog.

6.  **Verify Initial Code Execution:**
    *   Open the Developer Tools for the Draw.io webview (if available - otherwise, check VS Code's developer console for webview output).
    *   Check the console output. You should see the `console.warn("Malicious plugin is running!")` message.
    *   You should also see the alert dialog "Malicious Plugin Executed!" appear. This confirms the initial execution of the malicious plugin code.

7.  **Modify Malicious Plugin:**  Edit the `malicious-plugin.js` file and change the code to something different, for example:

    ```javascript
    console.error("Modified malicious plugin is running!");
    alert("Modified Malicious Plugin Executed!");
    ```

8.  **Reload Draw.io Diagram:** Reload the Draw.io diagram file in VS Code (e.g., close and reopen, or trigger a reload of the webview).

9.  **Observe Post-Modification Code Execution (Without Re-prompt):**
    *   Check the console output and observe if the new message `console.error("Modified malicious plugin is running!")` appears.
    *   Check if the new alert dialog "Modified Malicious Plugin Executed!" is displayed.
    *   Crucially, verify that **no new confirmation dialog** appeared when reloading the diagram after modifying the plugin file.

10. **Evaluation:** If the modified malicious payload is executed upon reloading without triggering a new approval prompt, this confirms that the extension does not enforce robust integrity verification or re-validation after the initial approval. This validates the vulnerability, demonstrating that an attacker can modify a plugin file after initial user approval and have the modified malicious code executed without the user being prompted again.
