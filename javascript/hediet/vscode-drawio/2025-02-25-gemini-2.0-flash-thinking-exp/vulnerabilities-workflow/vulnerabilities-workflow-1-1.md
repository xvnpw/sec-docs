- Vulnerability name: Unvalidated Plugin Loading leading to Remote Code Execution
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Draw.io plugin, which is a JavaScript file containing malicious code.
    2. The attacker needs to find a way to have a victim user open a Draw.io diagram file using the VS Code Draw.io Integration extension.
    3. Due to a hypothetical vulnerability in the plugin loading mechanism, specifically a potential bypass of user confirmation or insufficient path validation, the malicious plugin is loaded when the diagram is opened. This could happen if the extension incorrectly handles or validates the plugin path specified in settings or diagram data, or if the user consent mechanism can be circumvented.
    4. Once loaded, the malicious plugin executes arbitrary code within the VS Code environment. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as accessing sensitive files, installing malware, or controlling the user's system.
- Impact: Remote Code Execution (RCE). Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine, potentially leading to full system compromise, data theft, and other severe security breaches.
- Vulnerability rank: Critical
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - User confirmation dialog: The extension is supposed to display a dialog box prompting the user to allow or disallow the loading of plugins, as mentioned in `docs/plugins.md`.
    - Plugin fingerprinting: The extension tracks user's plugin approval decisions using plugin fingerprints to avoid repeated prompts for the same plugin, as described in `docs/plugins.md`.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Robust plugin path validation: Implement strict validation and sanitization of plugin file paths to prevent path traversal attacks and ensure that only intended plugin files are loaded.
    - Plugin sandbox: Isolate the plugin execution environment to restrict plugin capabilities. This would limit the access plugins have to system resources, the file system, and other VS Code functionalities, minimizing the impact of a malicious plugin.
    - Enforced user consent: Strengthen the user consent mechanism to guarantee that plugins are never loaded and executed without explicit and informed user approval, regardless of potential path manipulation attempts or configuration issues.
- Preconditions:
    - The user must have the VS Code Draw.io Integration extension installed and actively use it to open Draw.io diagram files.
    - The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a diagram that somehow triggers the loading of a malicious plugin without proper user consent. This relies on the hypothetical vulnerability in the plugin loading mechanism.
- Source code analysis:
    - Due to the project files provided being documentation, license, and configuration related files, there is no source code available to analyze the actual plugin loading implementation.
    - This vulnerability is hypothesized based on the description of the plugin feature in `docs/plugins.md` and assuming potential weaknesses in the implementation of user consent and path handling when loading external JavaScript plugins.
    - We assume a flaw exists where either the plugin path can be manipulated to load an unintended script, or the user consent mechanism can be bypassed, leading to automatic or silent loading of plugins.
- Security test case:
    1. Prepare a malicious Draw.io plugin: Create a JavaScript file (e.g., `malicious_plugin.js`) that contains code to demonstrate arbitrary code execution, such as displaying an alert, writing to a file in a protected location, or attempting to execute a system command.
    2. Host the malicious plugin: Make the `malicious_plugin.js` file accessible, either by placing it within the user's workspace or hosting it on a web server accessible by the user's machine.
    3. Craft a Draw.io diagram to load the malicious plugin: Create a Draw.io diagram file (`test_diagram.drawio`) and attempt to configure it (or the workspace settings, if possible externally) to load the `malicious_plugin.js`. This step is highly dependent on the hypothetical vulnerability and may involve manipulating plugin paths in settings or diagram data. For example, try to set a plugin path that bypasses validation or user confirmation.
    4. Open the crafted diagram: Have a victim user open the `test_diagram.drawio` file in VS Code with the Draw.io extension installed.
    5. Observe plugin loading and execution: Monitor if the malicious plugin is loaded and executed without the expected user confirmation dialog appearing, or even if the user denies the plugin loading request.
    6. Verify code execution: Check if the malicious actions defined in `malicious_plugin.js` are executed within the VS Code environment. For example, check for the alert dialog, the file written to a protected location, or the executed system command. Successful execution confirms the Remote Code Execution vulnerability.
