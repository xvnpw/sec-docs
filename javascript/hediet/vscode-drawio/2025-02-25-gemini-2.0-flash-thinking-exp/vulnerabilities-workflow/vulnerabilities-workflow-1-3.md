### Vulnerability: Malicious Plugin Loading

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Draw.io plugin, which is a JavaScript file containing harmful code.
    2. The attacker then tricks a user into adding a configuration to their VS Code settings (workspace or user settings) that instructs the Draw.io extension to load this malicious plugin. This is achieved by manipulating the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting and providing a file path to the malicious plugin.
    3. When the user opens a Draw.io diagram file (e.g., `.drawio`, `.drawio.svg`, `.drawio.png`), the Draw.io extension attempts to load the configured plugins.
    4. The extension detects a new or modified plugin (based on file hash) and presents a confirmation dialog to the user, asking whether to allow or disallow loading the plugin.
    5. If the user, unknowingly or through social engineering, clicks "Allow", the malicious plugin's JavaScript code is executed within the Draw.io editor's webview context.
    6. This malicious code can then perform actions within the security context of the VS Code extension, potentially leading to information disclosure, data manipulation, or further exploitation within the user's VS Code environment.

- **Impact:**
    Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the VS Code environment. This can have severe consequences:
    - **Information Disclosure:** The malicious plugin could access and exfiltrate sensitive data such as workspace files, VS Code configuration, environment variables, and potentially credentials or tokens stored within the VS Code environment.
    - **Data Manipulation:** The plugin could modify workspace files, settings, or even inject malicious code into other projects within the workspace.
    - **Privilege Escalation:** Although the webview context is somewhat sandboxed, vulnerabilities in VS Code or the extension's interaction with the VS Code API could potentially be exploited to escalate privileges and gain further access to the user's system.
    - **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) like attacks within VS Code:** The malicious plugin operates within the webview, which is essentially a browser environment. This opens doors to XSS-like attacks where the plugin could manipulate the Draw.io editor's UI or functionality to further compromise the user.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - **User Confirmation Dialog:** The extension displays a dialog box to the user when a new or modified plugin is detected. This dialog asks the user to explicitly allow or disallow the plugin.
    - **Plugin Fingerprinting:** The extension calculates a SHA256 hash (fingerprint) of each plugin file. This fingerprint is used to identify plugins and detect changes. User's allow/disallow decisions are stored based on the plugin's path and fingerprint in the `hediet.vscode-drawio.knownPlugins` user setting. This prevents silent loading of modified plugins after a user has made a decision about a specific plugin version.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Input Validation:** The extension lacks proper validation of the plugin file path specified in the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting. It should verify that the path is within the workspace or a trusted location, preventing loading of plugins from arbitrary locations on the user's file system.
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a strict Content Security Policy for the Draw.io webview could significantly limit the capabilities of loaded plugins. CSP can restrict actions like loading external scripts, executing inline JavaScript, or accessing certain browser APIs, thereby reducing the attack surface of malicious plugins.
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation:**  Further isolation of the plugin execution environment could be implemented. For example, running plugins in a more restricted JavaScript sandbox with limited access to the webview's full capabilities and the VS Code API.
    - **Clearer Security Guidance:**  The extension should provide more prominent and explicit security warnings to users about the risks of loading external plugins. Documentation should emphasize the potential dangers of loading untrusted plugins and guide users on how to securely manage plugin configurations.

- **Preconditions:**
    - **User Configuration Manipulation:** The attacker must be able to convince the user to add a malicious plugin configuration to their VS Code settings. This could be achieved through social engineering, by providing a malicious workspace configuration, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to modify the user's settings.
    - **User Approval:** The user must click "Allow" in the plugin confirmation dialog when prompted by the extension.

- **Source code analysis:**
    While the source code is not provided, based on the documentation and observed behavior, the following steps likely occur:
    1. **Setting Retrieval:** The extension reads the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting from VS Code configuration. This setting is expected to be an array of objects, each defining a plugin to load. Each object should contain a `file` property specifying the path to the plugin JavaScript file.
    2. **Path Resolution:** For each plugin configuration, the extension resolves the `file` path. It's assumed that `${workspaceFolder}` variable is correctly resolved to the current workspace root.
    3. **Plugin File Reading:** The extension reads the content of the JavaScript file from the resolved path.
    4. **Fingerprint Calculation:**  A SHA256 hash (or similar) is calculated for the plugin file content to create a fingerprint.
    5. **Known Plugin Check:** The extension checks the `hediet.vscode-drawio.knownPlugins` user setting. This setting stores a list of previously encountered plugins, along with their fingerprints and user's allow/disallow decisions.
    6. **Confirmation Dialog (Conditional):** If the plugin (identified by path and fingerprint) is not found in `knownPlugins` or if the fingerprint has changed since the last known entry, a confirmation dialog is displayed to the user. This dialog typically shows the plugin file path and asks for permission to load it.
    7. **Plugin Loading (on Allow):** If the user clicks "Allow" in the confirmation dialog (or if the plugin was previously allowed and its fingerprint hasn't changed), the extension proceeds to load the plugin. This likely involves injecting the JavaScript code from the plugin file into the Draw.io editor's webview context.
    8. **JavaScript Execution:** Once injected, the JavaScript code within the plugin file executes within the webview, gaining access to the webview's environment and potentially interacting with the VS Code API through the extension's bridge.

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Create Malicious Plugin:** Create a JavaScript file named `malicious-plugin.js` in your workspace folder. Add the following code to this file to demonstrate malicious activity (e.g., logging to console, attempting to access VS Code API - in a real attack, this would be more sophisticated):
        ```javascript
        console.warn("Malicious plugin is running!");
        // Example of potentially malicious action (depending on webview context and VS Code API access)
        // alert("Workspace path: " + vscode.workspace.rootPath);
        ```
    2. **Configure Plugin Setting:** Open your workspace or user `settings.json` file and add the following configuration to the `hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins` setting. Ensure the path to `malicious-plugin.js` is correct relative to your workspace root.
        ```json
        "hediet.vscode-drawio.plugins": [
            {
                "file": "${workspaceFolder}/malicious-plugin.js"
            }
        ]
        ```
    3. **Open Draw.io Diagram:** Open any `.drawio`, `.drawio.svg`, or `.drawio.png` file in VS Code to activate the Draw.io extension and trigger plugin loading.
    4. **Observe Confirmation Dialog:** A dialog should appear, prompting you to allow or disallow loading the plugin from `malicious-plugin.js`.
    5. **Click "Allow":** Click the "Allow" button in the dialog.
    6. **Verify Malicious Code Execution:**
        - Open the Developer Tools for the Draw.io webview (usually by right-clicking in the editor and selecting "Inspect" or similar, if available - otherwise, check VS Code's developer console if webview console output is forwarded).
        - Check the console output. You should see the `console.warn("Malicious plugin is running!")` message, confirming that the malicious plugin code has been executed.
        - If you included VS Code API access attempts in your malicious plugin, observe if those actions are successful or if errors are generated. In a real exploit, an attacker would try to leverage any accessible APIs to further their malicious goals.

This test case demonstrates that by configuring the plugin setting and tricking the user into allowing the plugin, arbitrary JavaScript code from a user-controlled file can be executed within the Draw.io extension's webview, confirming the Malicious Plugin Loading vulnerability.
