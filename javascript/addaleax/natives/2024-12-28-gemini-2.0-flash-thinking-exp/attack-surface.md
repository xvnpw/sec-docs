* **Exposure of Sensitive Internal APIs**
    * **Description:**  Internal Node.js modules, not intended for public use, might expose sensitive information or functionalities.
    * **How `natives` Contributes:** `natives` provides direct access to these internal modules, making them accessible to application code and potentially to attackers if vulnerabilities exist.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses `natives` to access the internal `process` module and retrieves environment variables containing API keys or database credentials.
    * **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, potential for further attacks using exposed credentials.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using `natives` unless absolutely necessary.
        * If `natives` is required, restrict its usage to the minimum necessary internal modules.
        * Regularly audit the codebase for any usage of `natives` and its potential security implications.
        * Implement strong access controls and input validation even when dealing with data from internal modules.

* **Bypassing Security Checks and Abstractions**
    * **Description:** Internal modules might operate at a lower level, bypassing security checks or abstractions implemented in user-land code or public APIs.
    * **How `natives` Contributes:** `natives` allows direct interaction with these lower-level functionalities, enabling attackers to circumvent intended security measures.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses `natives` to access an internal timer module to bypass rate limiting implemented in the application's public API.
    * **Impact:** Integrity compromise, unauthorized access to resources, circumvention of intended application logic.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Design application logic to be resilient even if lower-level functionalities are accessed directly.
        * Implement security checks at multiple layers, not relying solely on user-land abstractions.
        * Carefully consider the security implications of exposing internal functionalities, even indirectly.

* **Code Injection and Remote Code Execution (RCE) Potential**
    * **Description:** While less direct, access to certain internal modules could potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve code injection or RCE.
    * **How `natives` Contributes:** `natives` provides access to internal modules that might offer functionalities that, if combined with other weaknesses (e.g., insufficient input sanitization elsewhere in the application), could lead to code execution.
    * **Example:** An attacker uses `natives` to access an internal file system module and, combined with a path traversal vulnerability in another part of the application, overwrites critical system files or executes arbitrary code.
    * **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data breach, malware installation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Practice secure coding principles throughout the application, including robust input validation and output encoding.
        * Minimize the use of `natives` and carefully audit any code that uses it.
        * Implement strong security boundaries and least privilege principles.
