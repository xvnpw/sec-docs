# Threat Model Analysis for addaleax/natives

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via `process` module access through `natives`](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via__process__module_access_through__natives_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could leverage the `natives` library to directly access the internal `process` module. They might manipulate properties or call functions within this module to execute arbitrary commands on the server. This could involve spawning new processes or modifying the current process's behavior.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, including data exfiltration, installation of malware, denial of service, and potential lateral movement within the network.

**Affected Component:** `natives.require` (to access the internal `process` module), potentially specific functions or properties within the `process` module.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Eliminate `natives` Usage for `process`:**  Completely avoid using the `natives` library to access the `process` module. Explore secure alternatives within the standard Node.js API.
* **Strict Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all input that could influence the code path leading to `natives` usage and interaction with the `process` module.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run the application with the minimum necessary privileges. The user account running the Node.js process should have restricted permissions.
* **Sandboxing:**  Run the application or the specific code using `natives` in a sandboxed environment with limited system access to contain potential damage.
* **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting the usage of `natives`.

## Threat: [File System Access and Manipulation via `fs` module access through `natives`](./threats/file_system_access_and_manipulation_via__fs__module_access_through__natives_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could utilize the `natives` library to directly access the internal `fs` module. This allows them to read, write, create, or delete arbitrary files on the server's file system, bypassing standard Node.js access controls.

**Impact:** Data breaches through unauthorized file reading, data tampering or loss through unauthorized file writing or deletion, application malfunction by modifying critical files, and potential escalation of privileges by manipulating configuration files.

**Affected Component:** `natives.require` (to access the internal `fs` module), potentially specific functions within the `fs` module (e.g., `readFileSync`, `writeFileSync`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid Direct `fs` Access via `natives`:**  Refrain from using the `natives` library to interact with the file system. Utilize the standard Node.js `fs` module, which provides more secure and controlled access.
* **Restrict File System Operations (If `natives` is Absolutely Necessary):** If using `natives` for `fs` operations is unavoidable, implement extremely strict path validation and sanitization to prevent access to unauthorized files or directories. Limit the allowed operations.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:**  The Node.js process should run with minimal file system permissions, only granting access to necessary files and directories.
* **Regular Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for unusual file system activity that might indicate exploitation.
* **Immutable Infrastructure:** Consider an infrastructure where the file system is largely read-only, minimizing the impact of potential write operations.

## Threat: [Accessing Sensitive Environment Variables via `process` module through `natives`](./threats/accessing_sensitive_environment_variables_via__process__module_through__natives_.md)

**Description:** An attacker could use the `natives` library to directly access the internal `process` module and retrieve environment variables. These variables might contain sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or other secrets.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials leading to unauthorized access to other systems, data breaches, and potential financial loss.

**Affected Component:** `natives.require` (to access the internal `process` module), specifically the `env` property of the `process` module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Never Access Environment Variables via `natives`:**  Completely avoid using `natives` to access environment variables.
* **Secure Secret Management:**  Do not store sensitive information directly in environment variables. Utilize secure secret management solutions.
* **Restrict `natives` Usage:** Limit the parts of the application that have access to the `natives` library.
* **Regularly Rotate Secrets:** Implement a robust secret rotation policy.

## Threat: [Exploiting Unpatched Vulnerabilities in Internal Modules Accessed via `natives`](./threats/exploiting_unpatched_vulnerabilities_in_internal_modules_accessed_via__natives_.md)

**Description:** Internal Node.js modules, when accessed directly via `natives`, expose the application to potential vulnerabilities within those modules that might not be readily apparent or patched in typical web application contexts. An attacker could leverage these vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability within the internal module. It could range from denial of service and information disclosure to arbitrary code execution.

**Affected Component:** Any internal Node.js module accessed through `natives.require`.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Minimize or Eliminate `natives` Usage:** The primary mitigation is to avoid using `natives` altogether, thereby reducing exposure to internal module vulnerabilities.
* **Stay Updated with Node.js Security Releases:** While internal module vulnerabilities might not always be highlighted, keeping Node.js updated is crucial for patching known issues.
* **Careful Code Review and Security Analysis:**  Thoroughly review any code that uses `natives` and conduct security analysis to identify potential attack vectors through internal modules.
* **Consider Feature Flags and Rollback Strategies:** If using a potentially risky internal module, implement feature flags to allow for quick disabling of the functionality in case a vulnerability is discovered. Have rollback strategies in place for Node.js version updates.
