# Attack Surface Analysis for addaleax/natives

## Attack Surface: [Direct Access to Internal Node.js Modules](./attack_surfaces/direct_access_to_internal_node_js_modules.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Direct Access to Internal Node.js Modules
    * **Description:** The `natives` library allows direct access to internal Node.js modules that are typically not exposed to userland JavaScript. These modules often have powerful functionalities and lower-level access.
    * **How `natives` Contributes:** `natives` is the mechanism that explicitly bypasses the standard module loading process to expose these internal modules. Without it, this access would be restricted.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `process` module, allowing them to manipulate environment variables, potentially injecting malicious paths or configurations.
    * **Impact:** Privilege escalation, denial of service (by manipulating process behavior), information disclosure (by accessing process-related data).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Minimize Exposure: Only expose the absolutely necessary internal modules. Avoid exposing the entire set of available modules.
        * Input Validation:  Thoroughly validate any data passed to functions within the exposed native modules to prevent unexpected behavior or exploits.
        * Principle of Least Privilege:  Ensure the application runs with the minimum necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful exploit.
        * Regular Audits: Conduct security audits to identify any unintended or insecure usage of exposed internal modules.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Native Modules](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_vulnerabilities_in_native_modules.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Native Modules
    * **Description:** Internal Node.js modules are written in C/C++ and may contain vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free errors, or other memory safety issues. Direct access can make these vulnerabilities more easily exploitable from JavaScript.
    * **How `natives` Contributes:** By providing direct access, `natives` removes the layers of abstraction and safety checks that the standard JavaScript API might provide, making it easier to trigger these underlying native vulnerabilities.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts specific input that, when passed to a function in an exposed `fs` module, triggers a buffer overflow, leading to arbitrary code execution.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, application crashes, data corruption.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep Node.js Updated: Regularly update Node.js to benefit from security patches in the underlying native modules.
        * Careful Usage: Avoid passing untrusted or unsanitized data directly to functions within exposed native modules.
        * Consider Sandboxing: If feasible, consider sandboxing the application or the parts that utilize `natives` to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in `natives`](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_vulnerabilities_in__natives_.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Supply Chain Vulnerabilities in `natives`
    * **Description:** The `natives` library itself is an external dependency. If the library is compromised (e.g., through a malicious update), any application using it could be vulnerable.
    * **How `natives` Contributes:**  Introducing an external dependency inherently introduces supply chain risks.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor gains control of the `natives` repository and injects malicious code into a new version, which is then installed by applications.
    * **Impact:** Full compromise of the application, data breaches, supply chain attacks affecting downstream users.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Dependency Scanning: Use tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        * Verify Source:  Ensure the `natives` library is being downloaded from a reputable source.
        * Security Reviews:  Conduct security reviews of the `natives` library code if feasible or rely on community reviews and reputation.
        * Consider Alternatives: Evaluate if there are alternative approaches that don't rely on exposing internal Node.js modules directly.
