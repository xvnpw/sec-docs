## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Direct Access to Internal Modules](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_direct_access_to_internal_modules.md)

*   Attack Vector: Application Exposes Native Module Access
    *   Description: The application's design or configuration allows external influence over which internal Node.js modules are loaded or how they are accessed. This could be through configuration files, API endpoints, or plugin systems.
    *   Critical Node: Load Arbitrary Native Module [CRITICAL]
        *   Description: An attacker can provide the name or path of an arbitrary internal module (e.g., 'process', 'fs'). Due to insufficient input validation, the application loads this attacker-controlled module.
        *   Risk: High likelihood due to potential misconfigurations or overly flexible plugin systems. Critical impact as it grants access to powerful internal functionalities.
    *   Critical Node: Execute arbitrary code via the accessed module [CRITICAL]
        *   Description: Once a malicious or sensitive module is loaded, the attacker leverages its functionalities to execute arbitrary code on the server. For example, using `require('child_process').exec()` via the 'process' module.
        *   Risk: High likelihood if arbitrary module loading is possible. Critical impact as it directly achieves Remote Code Execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities within Accessed Native Modules](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_within_accessed_native_modules.md)

*   Attack Vector: Application Uses a Native Module with Known Vulnerabilities
    *   Description: The application utilizes internal Node.js modules that have known, publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities.
    *   Critical Node: Leverage Known Vulnerabilities in Accessed Modules [CRITICAL]
        *   Description: An attacker identifies the specific internal modules used by the application and checks for known vulnerabilities in those versions.
        *   Risk: Medium likelihood, dependent on the age of the Node.js version and the specific modules used. Critical impact as these vulnerabilities can often lead directly to RCE.
    *   Critical Node: Consequence: Exploit the vulnerability to achieve code execution or gain unauthorized access [CRITICAL]
        *   Description: The attacker crafts specific inputs or interactions with the application to trigger the known vulnerability in the internal module. This successful exploitation leads to code execution or unauthorized access.
        *   Risk: High likelihood if a known vulnerability exists and is reachable through the application's functionality. Critical impact as it directly leads to compromise.
