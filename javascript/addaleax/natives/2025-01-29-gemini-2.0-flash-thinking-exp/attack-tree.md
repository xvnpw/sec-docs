## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Vulnerabilities in Loaded Native Modules (MOST LIKELY PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_loaded_native_modules__most_likely_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the code of the native modules loaded by the `natives` library. Since native modules are often written in memory-unsafe languages like C/C++, they are prone to various vulnerabilities. This is considered the most likely path because the security of the application heavily depends on the security of these external, often less scrutinized, native modules.

    *   **Risk Breakdown:**
        *   Likelihood: High
        *   Impact: High to Critical (Code Execution, Data Breach, Denial of Service)
        *   Effort: Low to Medium (Depending on vulnerability complexity)
        *   Skill Level: Low to Advanced (Depending on vulnerability type)
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to Low

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities (COMMON)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__memory_corruption_vulnerabilities__common_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This sub-path within "Exploit Vulnerabilities in Loaded Native Modules" specifically targets memory corruption vulnerabilities in native module code. These vulnerabilities arise from improper memory management in C/C++, such as buffer overflows, use-after-free, heap overflows, and integer overflows. Attackers can trigger these by providing crafted input from JavaScript to the native module.

    *   **Risk Breakdown:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium-High (Common in C/C++ native code)
        *   Impact: High (Code Execution)
        *   Effort: Medium to High (Exploitation can be complex)
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to Low

    *   **Critical Node: [CRITICAL NODE] Buffer Overflow in input processing from JS**
        *   **Specific Attack:**  An attacker sends overly long input from JavaScript to a native module function that doesn't properly check buffer boundaries when copying this input into a fixed-size buffer in native memory. This overwrites adjacent memory regions, potentially allowing code execution.
        *   **Risk Breakdown:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium-High
            *   Impact: High (Code Execution)
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate-Advanced
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium-Low

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Input Validation Vulnerabilities in Native Module (COMMON)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_native_module__common_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This sub-path targets vulnerabilities arising from insufficient or improper input validation within native modules. Native modules must carefully sanitize and validate all data received from JavaScript to prevent various injection attacks.

    *   **Risk Breakdown:**
        *   Likelihood: Medium (Common if developers don't prioritize input validation in native modules)
        *   Impact: Medium to High (Command Injection, Path Traversal, Data Breach, depending on vulnerability)
        *   Effort: Low to Medium
        *   Skill Level: Low to Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

    *   **Critical Node: [CRITICAL NODE] Command Injection via unsanitized input from JS**
        *   **Specific Attack:** An attacker crafts JavaScript input that, when passed to a native module, is used to construct and execute a system command without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.
        *   **Risk Breakdown:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium (If native module executes system commands based on JS input)
            *   Impact: High (Code Execution on Server)
            *   Effort: Low-Medium
            *   Skill Level: Low-Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Malicious Native Module Injection/Substitution (SUPPLY CHAIN RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__malicious_native_module_injectionsubstitution__supply_chain_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on supply chain attacks where an attacker aims to replace legitimate native modules with malicious ones. This can happen at various stages of the software supply chain, from compromising the source code repository to manipulating the distribution channels.

    *   **Risk Breakdown:**
        *   Likelihood: Low to Medium (Depends on supply chain security measures)
        *   Impact: High to Critical (Malicious code execution, widespread compromise)
        *   Effort: Medium to High (Depending on the target and attack method)
        *   Skill Level: Intermediate to Advanced
        *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to Low (Especially for source and distribution attacks)

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Supply Chain Attack on Native Module Source**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Compromising the source code repository (e.g., Git repository) of a native module to inject malicious code directly into the module's codebase.
        *   **Risk Breakdown:**
            *   Likelihood: Low (Depends on repository security)
            *   Impact: Critical (Malicious code in module updates)
            *   Effort: High
            *   Skill Level: Advanced
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low

        *   **Critical Node: [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise of Native Module's Git Repository**
            *   **Specific Attack:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to the Git repository of a native module (e.g., through stolen credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities in the repository platform). They then inject malicious code into the repository, which gets included in subsequent releases of the module.
            *   **Risk Breakdown:**
                *   Likelihood: Low
                *   Impact: Critical (Malicious code in module updates)
                *   Effort: High
                *   Skill Level: Advanced
                *   Detection Difficulty: Low (Until malicious updates are deployed)

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Local File System Manipulation to Replace Native Module**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Gaining write access to the application's file system, specifically the `node_modules` directory, to directly replace legitimate native modules with malicious ones.
        *   **Risk Breakdown:**
            *   Likelihood: Low-Medium (Depends on application and system security)
            *   Impact: High (Malicious module execution)
            *   Effort: Medium (If other vulnerabilities exist to gain write access)
            *   Skill Level: Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

        *   **Critical Node: [CRITICAL NODE] Write access to application's `node_modules` directory**
            *   **Specific Attack:** An attacker exploits another vulnerability in the application or system to gain write access to the directory where native modules are stored (`node_modules`). They then replace a legitimate native module with a malicious one. When the application loads this module using `natives`, the malicious code is executed.
            *   **Risk Breakdown:**
                *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
                *   Impact: High (Malicious module execution)
                *   Effort: Medium (If other vulnerabilities exist to gain write access)
                *   Skill Level: Intermediate
                *   Detection Difficulty: Medium (File integrity monitoring can help)

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfiguration or Misuse of `natives` Library (APPLICATION LEVEL RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_misconfiguration_or_misuse_of__natives__library__application_level_risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by improper configuration or misuse of the `natives` library within the application code itself. This includes insecure module loading paths and lack of input validation on module names/paths at the application level.

    *   **Risk Breakdown:**
        *   Likelihood: Low to Medium (Depends on developer security awareness and practices)
        *   Impact: High (Malicious module loading, Code Execution)
        *   Effort: Low
        *   Skill Level: Low to Intermediate
        *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Module Loading Paths**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  The application allows user-controlled paths or uses overly permissive paths for loading native modules. This enables attackers to load malicious modules from locations they control.
        *   **Risk Breakdown:**
            *   Likelihood: Low-Medium (Bad practice, but possible)
            *   Impact: High (Malicious module loading, Code Execution)
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Low
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low

        *   **Critical Node: [CRITICAL NODE] Allowing user-controlled paths for module loading**
            *   **Specific Attack:** The application code allows users to specify the path from which native modules are loaded (e.g., through URL parameters, configuration files, etc.). An attacker can then provide a path to a malicious native module they have placed on the system or a network share, and the application will load and execute it using `natives`.
            *   **Risk Breakdown:**
                *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
                *   Impact: High (Malicious module loading, Code Execution)
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Low
                *   Detection Difficulty: Low

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Lack of Input Validation on Module Names/Paths**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application doesn't properly validate or sanitize module names or paths before passing them to `natives` for loading. This allows attackers to inject malicious paths or module names that could lead to loading unintended or malicious modules.
        *   **Risk Breakdown:**
            *   Likelihood: Low-Medium (Bad practice, but possible)
            *   Impact: High (Malicious module loading, Code Execution)
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Low to Intermediate
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low

        *   **Critical Node: [CRITICAL NODE] Allowing arbitrary module names/paths to be loaded without sanitization**
            *   **Specific Attack:** The application takes module names or paths as input without proper validation and directly passes them to `natives` for loading. An attacker can inject malicious paths (e.g., using path traversal techniques like `../../malicious_module`) or module names that resolve to malicious modules, leading to their execution.
            *   **Risk Breakdown:**
                *   Likelihood: Low-Medium
                *   Impact: High (Malicious module loading, Code Execution)
                *   Effort: Low
                *   Skill Level: Low
                *   Detection Difficulty: Low
