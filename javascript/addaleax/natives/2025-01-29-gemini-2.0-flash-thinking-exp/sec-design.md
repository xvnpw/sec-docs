# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, "natives", provides a collection of native JavaScript modules for Node.js. The primary business goal is to offer reusable, performant, and reliable native addons that extend the capabilities of standard JavaScript and Node.js environments. By providing these modules, the project aims to simplify development for Node.js developers who require native functionalities, potentially improving application performance and accessing system-level features.

The main business priorities are:
- Providing high-quality, stable native modules.
- Ensuring compatibility across different Node.js versions and operating systems.
- Maintaining the modules and addressing bug fixes and security vulnerabilities promptly.
- Growing a community around the project to foster contributions and wider adoption.

Key business risks associated with this project include:
- security risk: Vulnerabilities in native modules could lead to serious security breaches in applications using them.
- stability risk: Incompatibility issues or bugs in native modules can cause application crashes or unexpected behavior.
- maintenance risk: Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates can lead to modules becoming outdated, insecure, or incompatible with newer environments.
- adoption risk: Low adoption rates would limit the project's impact and potentially hinder its long-term sustainability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open Source Code - The project is open source, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the code. Implemented in: GitHub repository.
- security control: Dependency Management - Project uses `npm` for dependency management, which includes mechanisms for vulnerability scanning of JavaScript dependencies (though not directly for native dependencies). Implemented in: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community for security audits and vulnerability discovery.
- accepted risk: Potential delay in vulnerability patching due to reliance on maintainers and contributors.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Automated Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST) - Implement SAST tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically scan the C/C++ code for potential vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Dependency Scanning for Native Libraries - Integrate tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in external native libraries used by the modules.
- recommended security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits of the codebase, potentially by external security experts.

Security requirements:
- authentication: Not directly applicable to a library project. However, ensure the integrity and authenticity of the published npm package to prevent supply chain attacks.
- authorization: Not directly applicable to a library project.
- input validation: Critical for native modules that handle external input. All modules should rigorously validate inputs to prevent vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, injection attacks, etc.
- cryptography: If any modules handle sensitive data or cryptographic operations, ensure proper and secure implementation of cryptographic algorithms and key management practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Secure and reliable execution of Node.js applications that depend on "natives" modules.
- Integrity and availability of the "natives" modules package in the npm registry.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Integrity of the native modules code: High sensitivity. Compromised code can lead to widespread vulnerabilities in applications using these modules.
- Availability of the native modules package: Medium sensitivity. Unavailability can disrupt development and deployment processes for users.
- Confidentiality of source code (less critical for open source, but still relevant for development process): Low sensitivity. Project is open source, but protecting development infrastructure and secrets is important.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the intended scope and breadth of the "natives" modules? Are there specific categories of native functionalities being targeted?
- Are there any specific security testing practices currently in place beyond open source community review?
- What is the process for handling reported security vulnerabilities?
- What is the target audience for these modules? Are they intended for general use or specific types of Node.js applications?

Assumptions:
- The project aims to provide general-purpose, reusable native modules for a broad range of Node.js developers.
- Security is a significant concern for the project, given the nature of native modules and their potential impact on application security.
- The project intends to leverage open source principles for community contribution and code review, including security aspects.
- The project will be distributed through the npm registry as the primary distribution channel.
