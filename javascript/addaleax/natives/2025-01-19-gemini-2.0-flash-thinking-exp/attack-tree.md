## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in 'natives' Library [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_'natives'_library__critical_node_.md)

This category encompasses attacks that directly target weaknesses within the `natives` library's code itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal Vulnerability [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a specially crafted module name that includes path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../`). If the `natives` library doesn't properly sanitize or validate this input, it might resolve to a file path outside the intended directory of internal Node.js modules.
    * **Gain access to sensitive files or execute arbitrary code [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:**  Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read sensitive configuration files, application code, or even execute arbitrary code if they can reach an executable file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain access to sensitive files or execute arbitrary code [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_sensitive_files_or_execute_arbitrary_code__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

Successful exploitation allows the attacker to read sensitive configuration files, application code, or even execute arbitrary code if they can reach an executable file.

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Vulnerability in Module Name Handling [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/injection_vulnerability_in_module_name_handling__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides a module name that contains malicious code or commands. This could occur if the `natives` library or the application using it constructs commands or file paths by directly embedding the provided module name without proper escaping or sanitization.
    * **Execute arbitrary code [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** If the injected code is executed, the attacker gains the ability to run arbitrary commands within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute arbitrary code [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

If the injected code is executed, the attacker gains the ability to run arbitrary commands within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Logic Flaw in Module Resolution [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/logic_flaw_in_module_resolution__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker discovers and exploits a subtle logical error or edge case in how the `natives` library resolves module names. This could allow them to bypass intended security checks and gain access to internal modules that should not be accessible.
    * **Access sensitive internal APIs or execute privileged operations [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** By accessing unintended internal modules, the attacker might gain access to sensitive APIs or functions that allow them to perform privileged operations, potentially compromising the application's integrity or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access sensitive internal APIs or execute privileged operations [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/access_sensitive_internal_apis_or_execute_privileged_operations__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

By accessing unintended internal modules, the attacker might gain access to sensitive APIs or functions that allow them to perform privileged operations, potentially compromising the application's integrity or data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misuse of 'natives' in the Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misuse_of_'natives'_in_the_application__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities introduced by how the application integrates and uses the `natives` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsanitized User Input for Module Name [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/unsanitized_user_input_for_module_name__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application allows user-controlled input to directly determine which internal module is accessed via `natives` without proper sanitization or validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access to Sensitive Internal Modules [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/access_to_sensitive_internal_modules__critical_node_.md)

* **Gain access to environment variables, file system operations, etc. [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker can specify module names like `process` or `fs` to gain access to environment variables, file system operations, and other sensitive functionalities.
            * **Read sensitive data, modify files, or cause denial of service [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** This access can be used to read sensitive data, modify application files, or cause a denial of service by manipulating system resources.

* **Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's context [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker can specify module names like `vm` or internal require mechanisms to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's process.
            * **Full application compromise [HIGH-RISK PATH]:** Successful code execution can lead to complete control over the application and potentially the underlying server.

An attacker can specify module names like `vm` or internal require mechanisms to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overly Broad Access to Internal Modules [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/overly_broad_access_to_internal_modules__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** The application provides access to a wide range of internal modules through `natives`, even if not directly controlled by user input. This increases the attack surface.
    * **Achieve arbitrary code execution or data access [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]:** An attacker can leverage access to a vulnerable or powerful internal module within the allowed set to exploit specific vulnerabilities and achieve arbitrary code execution or access sensitive data.
