# Threat Model Analysis for addaleax/natives

## Threat: [Arbitrary Internal Module Loading](./threats/arbitrary_internal_module_loading.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the application, potentially through input injection or exploiting a vulnerability in how the application handles module names, to load internal Node.js modules not intended for public use. This is achieved by controlling the argument passed to `require('natives').require()`. 

**Impact:**  Access to privileged operations within Node.js, potential for remote code execution if a vulnerable internal module is loaded, information disclosure by accessing sensitive internal data, or denial of service by loading modules that can consume excessive resources or crash the application.

**Affected Component:** `require('natives').require()` function.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize any input that could influence the module name passed to `require('natives').require()`.
*   Implement a whitelist of allowed internal modules that the application is permitted to load.
*   Avoid using user-controlled input directly in the `require('natives').require()` call.
*   Regularly audit the code that uses `natives` for potential injection points.

## Threat: [Circumvention of Security Measures](./threats/circumvention_of_security_measures.md)

**Description:** An attacker could bypass security checks implemented in the application's regular code by directly accessing internal modules that lack the same level of security hardening or input validation. This involves using `require('natives').require()` to access these less protected modules.

**Impact:** Successful exploitation of vulnerabilities that would normally be prevented by application-level security measures, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data manipulation, or other malicious actions.

**Affected Component:**  The specific internal module being accessed via `require('natives').require()`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Minimize the use of `natives` and prefer public Node.js APIs with established security practices.
*   Thoroughly understand the security implications of any internal module being accessed.
*   Implement additional security checks even when using internal modules, as they might not have sufficient built-in protection.
*   Isolate the usage of `natives` to specific, well-audited parts of the application.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion via Internal Modules](./threats/resource_exhaustion_via_internal_modules.md)

**Description:** An attacker could use `require('natives').require()` to load internal modules that provide access to functionalities that can be abused to consume excessive system resources (CPU, memory, etc.). This might involve triggering synchronous operations that block the event loop or allocating large amounts of memory.

**Impact:** Denial of service, application slowdown, or instability due to resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** The specific internal module being accessed via `require('natives').require()` that allows resource manipulation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using internal modules known to have potential for resource exhaustion.
*   Implement resource limits and timeouts within the application to prevent excessive resource consumption.
*   Monitor application resource usage to detect and respond to potential resource exhaustion attacks.

## Threat: [Code Injection via Internal Modules](./threats/code_injection_via_internal_modules.md)

**Description:** An attacker could potentially leverage `require('natives').require()` to access internal modules that offer functionalities that, if misused, could allow the injection and execution of arbitrary code within the application's process. This might involve modules related to code compilation or evaluation.

**Impact:** Full control over the application, data breaches, system compromise, potentially allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Affected Component:** The specific internal module being accessed via `require('natives').require()` that allows code execution.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Exercise extreme caution when using internal modules related to code execution or compilation.
*   Never pass untrusted or user-controlled input directly to such modules.
*   Implement strict input validation and sanitization if interaction with such modules is absolutely necessary.
*   Consider alternative approaches that do not involve directly using these sensitive internal modules.
