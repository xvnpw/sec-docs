# Attack Surface Analysis for addaleax/natives

## Attack Surface: [Direct Access to Internal APIs and Functionality](./attack_surfaces/direct_access_to_internal_apis_and_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** The application can directly access and invoke internal, non-publicly documented APIs and functions within Node.js core modules.
    *   **How `natives` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `natives` is the mechanism that enables this direct access, bypassing the standard module loading and exposing these internal functionalities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could use `natives` to access the internal `process.binding('util').getEnvVars()` function (if it exists and is accessible) to retrieve environment variables that might contain sensitive information.
    *   **Impact:**  Circumventing intended security boundaries, potential for arbitrary code execution if internal functions have vulnerabilities, access to sensitive internal data, unexpected application behavior or crashes.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the specific internal API accessed and its potential for exploitation).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid using `natives` entirely if possible.**  Refactor code to use supported public APIs.
        *   **Strictly limit the use of `natives` to the absolute minimum necessary.** Isolate the code that uses `natives` and carefully review its functionality.
        *   **Implement robust input validation and sanitization** even for interactions with internal modules, as their behavior might be unpredictable.
        *   **Regularly review the Node.js changelogs and security advisories** for any changes or vulnerabilities related to the internal modules being accessed.

## Attack Surface: [Circumvention of Module Loading Security](./attack_surfaces/circumvention_of_module_loading_security.md)

*   **Description:** The standard Node.js module loading process might have security checks or restrictions. `natives` bypasses this mechanism.
    *   **How `natives` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By directly accessing internal modules, `natives` circumvents any security measures implemented within the standard `require()` function or module resolution process.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could potentially use `natives` to load a modified or malicious version of an internal module, replacing the legitimate one and gaining control over its functionality.
    *   **Impact:**  Loading of malicious code, manipulation of the module cache, bypassing security checks intended for module loading, potential for arbitrary code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Prioritize using the standard `require()` mechanism.** Avoid `natives` unless absolutely necessary.
        *   **Implement integrity checks** on the application's dependencies and potentially even on the Node.js installation itself to detect unauthorized modifications.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Risks Amplification](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_risks_amplification.md)

*   **Description:** If the `natives` library itself is compromised, it could be used to inject malicious code or manipulate the application at a very low level due to its privileged access.
    *   **How `natives` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** As a dependency that grants access to internal Node.js components, a compromised `natives` library has a significant potential for harm.
    *   **Example:** A malicious version of `natives` could be published that injects backdoor code into the application's process or intercepts sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application, data breaches, arbitrary code execution, and other severe security incidents.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use dependency scanning tools** to detect known vulnerabilities in the `natives` library.
        *   **Verify the integrity of the `natives` package** using checksums or other verification methods.
        *   **Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)** to track dependencies and potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Stay informed about security advisories** related to the `natives` library and its dependencies.
