## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse getSource() Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_getsource___functionality.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary attack vector, focusing on exploiting the `getSource()` function of the `natives` library. The attacker aims to leverage this function to gain access to information they shouldn't have.
*   **Why Critical:** This is the entry point for the most severe potential vulnerabilities, leading to information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leak Sensitive Source Code](./attack_tree_paths/leak_sensitive_source_code.md)

*   **Description:** This sub-vector focuses specifically on using `getSource()` to leak sensitive information. The attacker tries to trick the application into revealing source code or other data that should be protected.
*   **Why Critical & High-Risk:** Information disclosure is a high-impact vulnerability that can lead to further compromise of the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Files Outside Intended Scope](./attack_tree_paths/read_files_outside_intended_scope.md)

*   **Description:** This is a path traversal attack within the context of `getSource()`. The attacker provides manipulated input (e.g., `../../../etc/passwd` â€“ although this specific example wouldn't work directly, it illustrates the concept) to try to access files or modules outside the intended scope of the application's `getSource()` implementation. The vulnerability lies in the *application's* lack of input validation, not in `natives` itself.
*   **Example:** If the application has a function like `getNativeModuleSource(userInput)`, and `userInput` is not sanitized, an attacker could try to access a module that contains sensitive information or even attempt a (likely unsuccessful) path traversal to a system file.
*   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends heavily on application implementation.)
*   **Impact:** High to Very High (Disclosure of source code, configuration files, etc.)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Read Environment Variables (if exposed via getSource())](./attack_tree_paths/read_environment_variables__if_exposed_via_getsource___.md)

*   **Description:** This attack relies on a highly unlikely scenario: environment variables being exposed within the source code of a native module *and* that module being accessible via `getSource()`. The attacker would use `getSource()` to retrieve the source code of that module, hoping to find sensitive information like API keys or database credentials.
*   **Example:** If a poorly configured native module included a hardcoded secret (which it *shouldn't*), and the application allowed access to that module's source via `getSource()`, the attacker could retrieve the secret.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** High to Very High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse isNative() Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_isnative___functionality.md)

* **Description:** This attack vector focuses on exploiting the `isNative()` function.
* **Why Critical:** This is the entry point for the bypass security checks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Checks](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_checks.md)

*   **Description:** This sub-vector focuses specifically on using `isNative()` to bypass security checks.
    *   **Why Critical & High-Risk:** Bypassing security checks is a high-impact vulnerability that can lead to further compromise of the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Spoof isNative() to Bypass Checks](./attack_tree_paths/spoof_isnative___to_bypass_checks.md)

*   **Description:** This attack targets applications that incorrectly rely *solely* on the `isNative()` function for security-critical decisions.  The attacker would try to find a way to make a non-native module appear native, or to load a malicious native module, to bypass security checks that are intended to apply only to native modules. The vulnerability is in the *application's* flawed logic, not in `natives` itself.
*   **Example:** If the application has a rule like "only native modules can access this sensitive resource," and the attacker can somehow load a malicious module that *is* considered native (or trick the application into thinking a non-native module is native), they could bypass this check.
*   **Likelihood:** Low (Requires poor application security design.)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depends on the bypassed security check.)
*   **Effort:** Medium to High
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
