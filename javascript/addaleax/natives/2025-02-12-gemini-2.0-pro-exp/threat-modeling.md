# Threat Model Analysis for addaleax/natives

## Threat: [Overwrite Built-in Function Prototype](./threats/overwrite_built-in_function_prototype.md)

*   **Threat:**  Overwrite Built-in Function Prototype

    *   **Description:** An attacker, having gained some level of code execution, uses `natives` to access and modify the prototype of a core JavaScript built-in function (e.g., `Array.prototype.push`, `String.prototype.replace`, `Object.defineProperty`).  They replace the original function with a malicious version that performs additional actions, such as stealing data, altering control flow, or injecting further malicious code. This affects *all* subsequent uses of that function within the application.  This is a *direct* use of `natives` to manipulate core engine functionality.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive data processed by the modified function can be leaked.
        *   **Code Injection:** The attacker can inject arbitrary code that executes whenever the modified function is called.
        *   **Application Logic Corruption:** The application's behavior becomes unpredictable and unreliable.
        *   **Bypass Security Checks:**  If the modified function is part of a security mechanism, the attacker can bypass it.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `natives` module itself, allowing access to any JavaScript built-in object and its prototype (e.g., `Array.prototype`, `String.prototype`, `Object.prototype`, etc.).  Specifically, the attacker would likely use `natives` to get a reference to the built-in object, then directly modify its properties (e.g., `Array.prototype.push = ...`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Freeze Prototypes (Best Practice):**  Immediately after application startup (and *before* any untrusted code can execute), use `Object.freeze()` on all critical built-in prototypes (e.g., `Object.freeze(Array.prototype)`, `Object.freeze(String.prototype)`).  This prevents modification of these prototypes.  This is the *most effective* mitigation.
        *   **Isolate Untrusted Code:** If you must run untrusted code, use a robust sandboxing solution. Node.js's built-in `vm` module is *not* sufficient.
        *   **Code Review:** Thoroughly review any code that interacts with `natives`.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run with minimal privileges.

## Threat: [Access and Leak Internal V8 Data](./threats/access_and_leak_internal_v8_data.md)

*   **Threat:**  Access and Leak Internal V8 Data

    *   **Description:** An attacker uses `natives` *directly* to access internal V8 data structures that are not normally exposed.  This could include object layouts, garbage collection metadata, internal caches, or memory regions. This is a *direct* exploitation of `natives`'s intended purpose.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Leakage of sensitive data.
        *   **Fingerprinting:** The attacker can gain information about the V8 version.
        *   **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Leaked information could reveal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:**  `natives` module, providing access to internal V8 objects and data structures. The specific components accessed would depend on the attacker's knowledge of V8 internals.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Unnecessary Access:** Only use `natives` for the *absolute minimum* necessary internal data.
        *   **Data Sanitization:** Rigorously sanitize any data obtained through `natives` before exposing it.
        *   **Process Isolation:** Run different parts of the application in separate processes.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Node.js (and thus V8) up to date.

## Threat: [Trigger Denial-of-Service via Garbage Collection Manipulation](./threats/trigger_denial-of-service_via_garbage_collection_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:**  Trigger Denial-of-Service via Garbage Collection Manipulation

    *   **Description:** An attacker uses `natives` *directly* to interfere with V8's garbage collection.  This could involve forcing frequent GC cycles, creating uncollectible objects, or disabling GC mechanisms. This leverages `natives` to access and manipulate core engine components.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Unavailability:** The application becomes unresponsive or crashes.
        *   **Performance Degradation:** Significant performance reduction.
    *   **Affected Component:** `natives` module, providing access to V8's garbage collection APIs and internal data structures. The attacker might use functions like `%CollectGarbage()` (if exposed) or manipulate object properties.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Resource Limits:** Use OS or containerization features to limit CPU and memory.
        *   **Avoid `natives` for GC Control:** Do not use `natives` to directly control garbage collection.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor memory usage and garbage collection behavior.

## Threat: [Modify Internal Timers or Event Loop](./threats/modify_internal_timers_or_event_loop.md)

*   **Threat:**  Modify Internal Timers or Event Loop

    *   **Description:** An attacker uses `natives` *directly* to access and modify internal V8 timers or the event loop, disrupting normal operation. This is a *direct* attack on core engine functionality through `natives`.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Application Unavailability:** The application becomes unresponsive or hangs.
        *   **Disruption of Functionality:** Time-dependent features stop working.
        *   **Denial of Service:** The application is unable to process requests.
    *   **Affected Component:** `natives` module, providing access to V8's internal timer management and event loop mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `natives` for Timer/Event Loop Manipulation:** Do not use `natives` for this purpose.
        *   **Timeouts:** Implement timeouts for operations that rely on timers or the event loop.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor event loop performance.

## Threat: [Bypass Security Mechanisms via Internal Modification](./threats/bypass_security_mechanisms_via_internal_modification.md)

*   **Threat:**  Bypass Security Mechanisms via Internal Modification

    *   **Description:** An attacker uses `natives` *directly* to modify internal V8 security mechanisms, such as code signing checks, sandbox escapes, or other internal security features. This is a highly sophisticated, *direct* attack leveraging `natives`'s access to low-level internals.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Complete System Compromise:** The attacker can bypass fundamental security protections.
        *   **Undetectable Malware:** The attacker can install persistent, hard-to-detect malware.
    *   **Affected Component:** `natives` module, providing access to low-level V8 internals, including security-related code and data structures.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `natives` if at all possible:** This is the primary mitigation.
        *   **Strong Sandboxing:** If `natives` *must* be used, use a highly restricted sandbox.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular audits and penetration testing by V8 experts.
        *   **Keep Node.js Updated:** Regularly update Node.js.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run with minimal privileges.
