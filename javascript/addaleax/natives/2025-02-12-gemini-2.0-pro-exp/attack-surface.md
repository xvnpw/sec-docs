# Attack Surface Analysis for addaleax/natives

## Attack Surface: [1. Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) via Internal API Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/1__arbitrary_code_execution__ace__via_internal_api_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit `natives` to modify or call internal, undocumented Node.js functions, leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the Node.js process.
*   **How `natives` Contributes:** Provides *direct* access to internal functions and objects that are not part of the public, secured API. This is the *core* enabling factor.
*   **Example:**
    *   Using `natives` to overwrite the `Buffer.from` function's internal implementation with malicious code, causing any subsequent buffer creation to execute the attacker's code.
    *   Modifying internal functions of the `child_process` module to execute arbitrary shell commands without any sanitization.
    *   Directly manipulating the `vm` module's internal state to escape a sandbox.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise. The attacker gains full control over the Node.js process and potentially the underlying operating system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoidance (Primary):** Do not use `natives`. This is the *only* truly effective mitigation.
    *   **Strict Input Validation (Extremely Limited):** If `natives` is *absolutely* unavoidable, implement extremely rigorous input validation (whitelist-only) to prevent attackers from specifying arbitrary module names, property names, or values. This is *highly* unlikely to be fully effective.
    *   **Code Reviews (Mandatory):** In-depth code reviews focusing *exclusively* on any code that touches `natives`.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Node.js process with the absolute minimum necessary privileges.
    *   **Sandboxing (Limited Effectiveness):** Use `vm`, containers (Docker), and process isolation, but understand that `natives` is *designed* to bypass these boundaries within the Node.js process. Multi-layered sandboxing is essential, but not a guarantee.
    *   **Monitoring:** Implement robust monitoring and logging to detect unusual activity, such as unexpected module access or modifications. This is for detection, not prevention.

## Attack Surface: [2. Denial of Service (DoS) via Internal API Instability](./attack_surfaces/2__denial_of_service__dos__via_internal_api_instability.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers leverage `natives` to call internal APIs in ways that cause the Node.js process to crash or become unresponsive.
*   **How `natives` Contributes:** Provides *direct* access to unstable, undocumented APIs that may have unexpected behavior or crash when called with invalid inputs or in specific states. This is the *core* enabling factor.
*   **Example:**
    *   Calling an internal function with incorrect argument types, deliberately triggering a segmentation fault.
    *   Accessing internal data structures in a way that corrupts memory, leading to a crash.
    *   Modifying internal state in a way that causes an infinite loop within a core Node.js module.
*   **Impact:** Application downtime, service unavailability.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoidance (Primary):** Do not use `natives`.
    *   **Input Validation (Limited):** Rigorous input validation, even for seemingly non-code-execution scenarios. This is difficult to achieve comprehensively.
    *   **Error Handling (Limited):** Implement error handling, but be aware that many internal errors may be uncatchable.
    *   **Process Monitoring:** Use process monitoring tools (e.g., PM2, systemd) to automatically restart the Node.js process. This is a reactive measure, not preventative.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent attackers from repeatedly triggering crashes. This is also reactive.

## Attack Surface: [3. Security Mechanism Bypass](./attack_surfaces/3__security_mechanism_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers use `natives` to disable or circumvent security features built into Node.js or its modules.
*   **How `natives` Contributes:** Allows *direct* manipulation of internal modules and functions, bypassing security checks or altering security-related behavior. This is the *core* enabling factor.
*   **Example:**
    *   Modifying the `crypto` module's internal functions to disable signature verification or force the use of weak ciphers.
    *   Disabling or altering module loading mechanisms to load malicious code, bypassing integrity checks.
    *   Bypassing file system permission checks by directly modifying internal `fs` functions.
*   **Impact:** Compromised application security, increased vulnerability to other attacks.  This can enable other attack vectors.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoidance (Primary):** Do not use `natives`.
    *   **Code Reviews (Mandatory):** Focus specifically on identifying any potential security bypasses.
    *   **Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.
    *   **Hardening:** Implement system-level hardening measures to limit the impact of a successful bypass. This is a defense-in-depth strategy.
