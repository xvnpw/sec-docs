### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Potential Tag Injection via Crafted Long Tag Name in Sublime Text 3 Mode
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts an XML or HTML file.
    2. In this file, the attacker includes an opening tag with an extremely long tag name, specifically designed to exploit a potential vulnerability in the extension's tag parsing logic when in "Sublime Text 3 Mode".
    3. A user with the "Auto Close Tag" extension installed and "SublimeText3Mode" enabled opens this malicious file in VS Code.
    4. When the user types the closing bracket `>` of the opening tag, the extension, while attempting to generate the closing tag, might encounter issues due to the crafted long tag name. This could potentially lead to incorrect tag insertion or unexpected behavior.
- Impact:
    The impact is high because if the extension mishandles very long tag names, it could lead to incorrect or malformed HTML/XML structure in the user's document. This could cause rendering issues in browsers or parsing errors in other tools that process these files. While not direct code execution, it can lead to significant disruption and unexpected behavior for users working with affected file types.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None apparent from the provided files. The provided files are documentation and CI configuration, not source code, so it's impossible to determine implemented mitigations from them.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for tag names, especially when handling "Sublime Text 3 Mode".
    - Robust error handling for cases with excessively long tag names or malformed tags to prevent unexpected behavior.
    - Security review of tag parsing and insertion logic, particularly in "Sublime Text 3 Mode", to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities related to handling unusual tag names.
    - Fuzz testing with various tag inputs, including very long tag names and malformed tags, to proactively discover potential issues.
- Preconditions:
    1. User has the "Auto Close Tag" extension installed in VS Code.
    2. User has enabled "SublimeText3Mode" in the extension's settings (`"auto-close-tag.SublimeText3Mode": true`).
    3. User opens a crafted XML/HTML file containing an extremely long tag name in VS Code.
- Source code analysis:
    Source code is not provided, so detailed source code analysis is not possible. However, based on the extension's functionality described in `README.md`, the vulnerability would hypothetically reside in the JavaScript code responsible for parsing tag names and inserting closing tags, specifically when the "SublimeText3Mode" is enabled. The extension might have assumptions about the maximum length of tag names, and these assumptions could be violated by a crafted long tag name, leading to unexpected behavior in the tag insertion logic.
- Security test case:
    1. Install the "Auto Close Tag" extension in VS Code.
    2. Enable "SublimeText3Mode" in the extension settings by adding `"auto-close-tag.SublimeText3Mode": true` to your VS Code `settings.json` file.
    3. Create a new file, for example, `test.xml`, and set the language mode to XML.
    4. In `test.xml`, insert the following opening tag, replacing `[LONG_TAG_NAME]` with a very long string (e.g., 1000+ characters): `<[LONG_TAG_NAME]>`
    5. Type the closing bracket `>` to complete the opening tag.
    6. Observe the behavior of VS Code and the extension. Check for:
        - Unresponsiveness or slowdown in VS Code.
        - Incorrect or missing closing tag insertion.
        - Errors or exceptions in VS Code's developer console (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools).
    7. Examine the inserted closing tag. Is it correctly formed? Is it excessively long or malformed in any way?
    8. If VS Code becomes unresponsive, crashes, or inserts a malformed closing tag, or if errors appear in the developer console, this indicates a potential vulnerability related to handling long tag names in "SublimeText3Mode".
