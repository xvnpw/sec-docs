- **Vulnerability Name:** Insufficiently Pinned GitHub Actions Dependencies
  - **Description:**
    The CI workflow defined in `/code/.github/workflows/main.yml` uses mutable version tags for critical GitHub Actions dependencies (for example, `actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/setup-node@v1`). An attacker who is able to compromise one of these actions (or the upstream repositories behind these version tags) could update the tag with malicious code. When the workflow is triggered (by a push, pull request, or manual dispatch), the runner would fetch and execute this malicious code—thereby compromising the CI build and any published artifacts.
    **Step by Step Trigger:**
    1. The attacker targets one of the referenced GitHub Actions repositories and manages to push a malicious update under a mutable tag (such as `v2` or `v1`).
    2. A build is triggered by an external pull request or commit to the public repository.
    3. The workflow fetches the GitHub Action using the mutable tag, unknowingly retrieving the compromised code.
    4. As the runner executes the malicious instructions during the CI process, arbitrary code execution becomes possible, potentially leading to the distribution of a tampered extension.

  - **Impact:**
    If exploited, the CI pipeline could be hijacked to run arbitrary commands. This incident could lead to the build process being compromised and malicious code being embedded into the generated extension package. When end users download and install the extension, they might then run code that was not intended by the developers—resulting in a severe loss of integrity and potentially remote code execution in users’ environments.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The workflow currently references stable version tags (`@v2` for checkout and `@v1` for Node setup) which rely on the reputation and maintenance practices of the upstream projects.
    - GitHub automatically isolates each job in its runner environment and applies default security policies; however, this does not protect against the risk of a malicious update to a mutable tag.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no explicit pinning to immutable commit SHAs for the GitHub Actions dependencies.
    - Adding explicit commit hash references (for example, `actions/checkout@<commit-sha>`) would prevent any unexpected changes even if an upstream tag is compromised.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The repository is public and its CI pipeline is triggered by external contributions (pushes, pull requests, or manual dispatch).
    - An attacker must be able to compromise one of the upstream GitHub Actions repositories in a way that malicious code is published under the mutable version tag in use.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/.github/workflows/main.yml` the workflow steps are defined as follows:
      - **Checkout Step:**
        ```yaml
        - name: Checkout
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        ```
        This uses the mutable tag `@v2` without a commit SHA.
      - **Node Setup Step:**
        ```yaml
        - name: Install Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v1
          with:
            node-version: 16.x
        ```
        Similarly, the version `@v1` here is not pinned to a specific commit.
    - Because these tags can be updated in the upstream repositories without any change in the version string in this workflow, an attacker controlling or compromising one of these actions can inject arbitrary code into the CI process.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:**
       - In an isolated testing repository (or using a fork), modify the workflow file `/code/.github/workflows/main.yml` to simulate a malicious GitHub Action. Replace one of the action references with a pointer to a test repository (or a deliberately modified version) that outputs a distinct marker (e.g., printing “MALICIOUS ACTION EXECUTED”) or runs a harmless command that demonstrates arbitrary code execution.
    2. **Trigger the Workflow:**
       - Push a commit or open a pull request that will trigger the CI pipeline.
    3. **Observation:**
       - Monitor the CI logs to check if the simulated malicious action executes its payload.
       - Confirm that the runner executes the expected marker command, demonstrating that the action reference is mutable and can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    4. **Conclusion:**
       - This test case shows that without pinning actions to immutable commit hashes, the CI pipeline is at risk—validating the vulnerability.
