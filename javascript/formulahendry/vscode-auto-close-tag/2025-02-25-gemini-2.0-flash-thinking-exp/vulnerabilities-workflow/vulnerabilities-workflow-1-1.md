## Vulnerability list:

- **Vulnerability name:** SQL Injection in User Search Functionality

- **Description:** The application's user search functionality is vulnerable to SQL Injection. User-provided input in the search query parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the search parameter, potentially manipulating the database query execution. By crafting specific SQL injection payloads, an attacker can bypass intended query logic, extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the database server itself.

- **Impact:**
    - **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, personal details, or confidential business data.
    - **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data integrity issues and potential business disruption.
    - **Account Takeover:** In some cases, attackers might be able to extract credentials or manipulate data to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, including administrative accounts.
    - **Database Server Compromise:** Depending on database permissions and the extent of the vulnerability, an attacker could potentially gain command execution on the database server, leading to full system compromise.

- **Vulnerability rank:** High

- **Currently implemented mitigations:** No input sanitization or parameterized queries are implemented in the user search functionality. The application directly incorporates user input into raw SQL queries.

- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization to remove or escape potentially malicious characters from user-provided search terms before incorporating them into SQL queries.
    - **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not as executable SQL code, effectively preventing SQL injection attacks.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary privileges required for its operation, limiting the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
    - **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall to detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must have a publicly accessible user search functionality that interacts with a database.
    - The search functionality must process user input from a query parameter (e.g., GET or POST request) and use this input to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    - The database user account used by the application must have sufficient permissions to allow data retrieval or manipulation that is valuable to an attacker.

- **Source code analysis:**
    Let's assume the following simplified code snippet (e.g., in Python, PHP, or Node.js) is responsible for handling the user search functionality:

    ```python
    # Example in Python (vulnerable code)
    import sqlite3  # Or other database library

    def search_users(search_term):
        conn = sqlite3.connect('app.db') # Assume database connection is established
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%" + search_term + "%'" # VULNERABLE: String concatenation
        cursor.execute(query)
        results = cursor.fetchall()
        conn.close()
        return results

    # ... (Application code that calls search_users with user input from request) ...
    ```

    **Step-by-step analysis:**
    1. **User Input:** The `search_users` function takes `search_term` as input, which is assumed to originate from user input via a web request (e.g., from a GET parameter like `?query=`).
    2. **Query Construction (Vulnerable):** The code constructs an SQL query string by directly concatenating the `search_term` into the `WHERE` clause of the SQL query.  It uses string concatenation (`"..." + search_term + "..."`) to embed the user-provided `search_term` within the SQL query.
    3. **SQL Execution:** The constructed query is then executed against the database using `cursor.execute(query)`.
    4. **Vulnerability:** Because the `search_term` is directly inserted into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code within the `search_term`. For example, if an attacker provides `search_term` as `admin' OR '1'='1`, the resulting SQL query becomes:

       ```sql
       SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%admin' OR '1'='1%'
       ```
       The injected `OR '1'='1'` condition will always be true, effectively bypassing the intended search logic and potentially returning all users in the database. More sophisticated injection techniques can be used to extract data, modify data, or even execute database commands.

- **Security test case:**
    1. **Identify the User Search Functionality:** Locate the user search feature in the publicly accessible application. This might be a search bar on the website or a specific URL endpoint that handles search queries (e.g., `/search` or `/users/find`).
    2. **Craft a Basic SQL Injection Payload:**  Use a simple SQL injection payload in the search query parameter. A common starting point is to try to break out of the string context and add a universally true condition.  For example, if the search parameter is `query`, try the following URL:
       `https://example.com/search?query=test' OR '1'='1`  (or `https://example.com/search?query=test'--` for comment-based injection, or `https://example.com/search?query=test' OR 1=1 -- -+`)
    3. **Analyze the Application's Response:**
        - **Unexpected Results:** If the application returns a significantly larger number of results than expected for the search term "test", or if it returns results that are not related to "test" at all, it could indicate a successful SQL injection. For instance, if searching for "test" normally returns a few users, and the injected payload returns all users in the database, this is a strong indication of SQL injection.
        - **Database Errors:** If the application returns a database error message in the response (e.g., SQL syntax error, database connection error), it could also indicate that the injected SQL code is being processed by the database, and the application is vulnerable.  However, production systems often hide error messages, so the absence of errors doesn't mean the vulnerability is not present.
    4. **Advanced Payloads (if basic test is promising):** If the basic test shows signs of vulnerability, try more advanced SQL injection payloads to confirm the vulnerability and assess its severity. This could involve:
        - **Data Extraction:** Use `UNION SELECT` statements to attempt to retrieve data from other database tables or system tables (e.g., `query=test' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`).  This requires knowledge of the database schema, which might be obtained through further exploitation or information gathering.
        - **Error-Based Injection:** If error messages are visible, try payloads that intentionally cause database errors to leak information about the database structure or data.
        - **Boolean-Based Blind Injection:** In cases where no data is directly returned, use boolean-based blind SQL injection techniques to infer information bit by bit based on the application's response (e.g., timing differences or subtle changes in response content based on true/false conditions in injected SQL).

    **Success Condition:** If the security test case reveals that by injecting SQL code into the search query, an attacker can manipulate the search results, retrieve unauthorized data, or cause database errors, then the SQL Injection vulnerability is confirmed.
