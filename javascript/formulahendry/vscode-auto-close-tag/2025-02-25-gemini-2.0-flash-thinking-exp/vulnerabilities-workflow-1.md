### Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in User Search Functionality

  - **Description:**
    The application's user search functionality is vulnerable to SQL Injection. User-provided input in the search query parameter is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the search parameter, potentially manipulating the database query execution. By crafting specific SQL injection payloads, an attacker can bypass intended query logic, extract sensitive data from the database, modify data, or potentially gain further access to the database server itself.

  - **Impact:**
    - **Data Breach:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the database, such as user credentials, personal details, or confidential business data.
    - **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data within the database, leading to data integrity issues and potential business disruption.
    - **Account Takeover:** In some cases, attackers might be able to extract credentials or manipulate data to gain unauthorized access to user accounts, including administrative accounts.
    - **Database Server Compromise:** Depending on database permissions and the extent of the vulnerability, an attacker could potentially gain command execution on the database server, leading to full system compromise.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    No input sanitization or parameterized queries are implemented in the user search functionality. The application directly incorporates user input into raw SQL queries.

  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization to remove or escape potentially malicious characters from user-provided search terms before incorporating them into SQL queries.
    - **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** Utilize parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions. This ensures that user input is treated as data and not as executable SQL code, effectively preventing SQL injection attacks.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the database user account used by the application has only the necessary privileges required for its operation, limiting the potential impact of a successful SQL injection attack.
    - **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a Web Application Firewall to detect and block common SQL injection attack patterns.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The application must have a publicly accessible user search functionality that interacts with a database.
    - The search functionality must process user input from a query parameter (e.g., GET or POST request) and use this input to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    - The database user account used by the application must have sufficient permissions to allow data retrieval or manipulation that is valuable to an attacker.

  - **Source code analysis:**
    Let's assume the following simplified code snippet (e.g., in Python, PHP, or Node.js) is responsible for handling the user search functionality:

    ```python
    # Example in Python (vulnerable code)
    import sqlite3  # Or other database library

    def search_users(search_term):
        conn = sqlite3.connect('app.db') # Assume database connection is established
        cursor = conn.cursor()
        query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%" + search_term + "%'" # VULNERABLE: String concatenation
        cursor.execute(query)
        results = cursor.fetchall()
        conn.close()
        return results

    # ... (Application code that calls search_users with user input from request) ...
    ```

    **Step-by-step analysis:**
    1. **User Input:** The `search_users` function takes `search_term` as input, which is assumed to originate from user input via a web request (e.g., from a GET parameter like `?query=`).
    2. **Query Construction (Vulnerable):** The code constructs an SQL query string by directly concatenating the `search_term` into the `WHERE` clause of the SQL query.  It uses string concatenation (`"..." + search_term + "..."`) to embed the user-provided `search_term` within the SQL query.
    3. **SQL Execution:** The constructed query is then executed against the database using `cursor.execute(query)`.
    4. **Vulnerability:** Because the `search_term` is directly inserted into the SQL query without any sanitization or parameterization, an attacker can manipulate the SQL query by injecting malicious SQL code within the `search_term`. For example, if an attacker provides `search_term` as `admin' OR '1'='1`, the resulting SQL query becomes:

       ```sql
       SELECT * FROM users WHERE username LIKE '%admin' OR '1'='1%'
       ```
       The injected `OR '1'='1'` condition will always be true, effectively bypassing the intended search logic and potentially returning all users in the database. More sophisticated injection techniques can be used to extract data, modify data, or even execute database commands.

  - **Security test case:**
    1. **Identify the User Search Functionality:** Locate the user search feature in the publicly accessible application. This might be a search bar on the website or a specific URL endpoint that handles search queries (e.g., `/search` or `/users/find`).
    2. **Craft a Basic SQL Injection Payload:**  Use a simple SQL injection payload in the search query parameter. A common starting point is to try to break out of the string context and add a universally true condition.  For example, if the search parameter is `query`, try the following URL:
       `https://example.com/search?query=test' OR '1'='1`  (or `https://example.com/search?query=test'--` for comment-based injection, or `https://example.com/search?query=test' OR 1=1 -- -+`)
    3. **Analyze the Application's Response:**
        - **Unexpected Results:** If the application returns a significantly larger number of results than expected for the search term "test", or if it returns results that are not related to "test" at all, it could indicate a successful SQL injection. For instance, if searching for "test" normally returns a few users, and the injected payload returns all users in the database, this is a strong indication of SQL injection.
        - **Database Errors:** If the application returns a database error message in the response (e.g., SQL syntax error, database connection error), it could also indicate that the injected SQL code is being processed by the database, and the application is vulnerable.  However, production systems often hide error messages, so the absence of errors doesn't mean the vulnerability is not present.
    4. **Advanced Payloads (if basic test is promising):** If the basic test shows signs of vulnerability, try more advanced SQL injection payloads to confirm the vulnerability and assess its severity. This could involve:
        - **Data Extraction:** Use `UNION SELECT` statements to attempt to retrieve data from other database tables or system tables (e.g., `query=test' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users --`).  This requires knowledge of the database schema, which might be obtained through further exploitation or information gathering.
        - **Error-Based Injection:** If error messages are visible, try payloads that intentionally cause database errors to leak information about the database structure or data.
        - **Boolean-Based Blind Injection:** In cases where no data is directly returned, use boolean-based blind SQL injection techniques to infer information bit by bit based on the application's response (e.g., timing differences or subtle changes in response content based on true/false conditions in injected SQL).

    **Success Condition:** If the security test case reveals that by injecting SQL code into the search query, an attacker can manipulate the search results, retrieve unauthorized data, or cause database errors, then the SQL Injection vulnerability is confirmed.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insufficiently Pinned GitHub Actions Dependencies

  - **Description:**
    The CI workflow defined in `/code/.github/workflows/main.yml` uses mutable version tags for critical GitHub Actions dependencies (for example, `actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/setup-node@v1`). An attacker who is able to compromise one of these actions (or the upstream repositories behind these version tags) could update the tag with malicious code. When the workflow is triggered (by a push, pull request, or manual dispatch), the runner would fetch and execute this malicious code—thereby compromising the CI build and any published artifacts.
    **Step by Step Trigger:**
    1. The attacker targets one of the referenced GitHub Actions repositories and manages to push a malicious update under a mutable tag (such as `v2` or `v1`).
    2. A build is triggered by an external pull request or commit to the public repository.
    3. The workflow fetches the GitHub Action using the mutable tag, unknowingly retrieving the compromised code.
    4. As the runner executes the malicious instructions during the CI process, arbitrary code execution becomes possible, potentially leading to the distribution of a tampered extension.

  - **Impact:**
    If exploited, the CI pipeline could be hijacked to run arbitrary commands. This incident could lead to the build process being compromised and malicious code being embedded into the generated extension package. When end users download and install the extension, they might then run code that was not intended by the developers—resulting in a severe loss of integrity and potentially remote code execution in users’ environments.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The workflow currently references stable version tags (`@v2` for checkout and `@v1` for Node setup) which rely on the reputation and maintenance practices of the upstream projects.
    - GitHub automatically isolates each job in its runner environment and applies default security policies; however, this does not protect against the risk of a malicious update to a mutable tag.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - There is no explicit pinning to immutable commit SHAs for the GitHub Actions dependencies.
    - Adding explicit commit hash references (for example, `actions/checkout@<commit-sha>`) would prevent any unexpected changes even if an upstream tag is compromised.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The repository is public and its CI pipeline is triggered by external contributions (pushes, pull requests, or manual dispatch).
    - An attacker must be able to compromise one of the upstream GitHub Actions repositories in a way that malicious code is published under the mutable version tag in use.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/.github/workflows/main.yml` the workflow steps are defined as follows:
      - **Checkout Step:**
        ```yaml
        - name: Checkout
          uses: actions/checkout@v2
        ```
        This uses the mutable tag `@v2` without a commit SHA.
      - **Node Setup Step:**
        ```yaml
        - name: Install Node.js
          uses: actions/setup-node@v1
          with:
            node-version: 16.x
        ```
        Similarly, the version `@v1` here is not pinned to a specific commit.
    - Because these tags can be updated in the upstream repositories without any change in the version string in this workflow, an attacker controlling or compromising one of these actions can inject arbitrary code into the CI process.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Preparation:**
       - In an isolated testing repository (or using a fork), modify the workflow file `/code/.github/workflows/main.yml` to simulate a malicious GitHub Action. Replace one of the action references with a pointer to a test repository (or a deliberately modified version) that outputs a distinct marker (e.g., printing “MALICIOUS ACTION EXECUTED”) or runs a harmless command that demonstrates arbitrary code execution.
    2. **Trigger the Workflow:**
       - Push a commit or open a pull request that will trigger the CI pipeline.
    3. **Observation:**
       - Monitor the CI logs to check if the simulated malicious action executes its payload.
       - Confirm that the runner executes the expected marker command, demonstrating that the action reference is mutable and can lead to arbitrary code execution.
    4. **Conclusion:**
       - This test case shows that without pinning actions to immutable commit hashes, the CI pipeline is at risk—validating the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential Tag Injection via Crafted Long Tag Name in Sublime Text 3 Mode

  - **Description:**
    1. An attacker crafts an XML or HTML file.
    2. In this file, the attacker includes an opening tag with an extremely long tag name, specifically designed to exploit a potential vulnerability in the extension's tag parsing logic when in "Sublime Text 3 Mode".
    3. A user with the "Auto Close Tag" extension installed and "SublimeText3Mode" enabled opens this malicious file in VS Code.
    4. When the user types the closing bracket `>` of the opening tag, the extension, while attempting to generate the closing tag, might encounter issues due to the crafted long tag name. This could potentially lead to incorrect tag insertion or unexpected behavior.

  - **Impact:**
    The impact is high because if the extension mishandles very long tag names, it could lead to incorrect or malformed HTML/XML structure in the user's document. This could cause rendering issues in browsers or parsing errors in other tools that process these files. While not direct code execution, it can lead to significant disruption and unexpected behavior for users working with affected file types.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    None apparent from the provided files. The provided files are documentation and CI configuration, not source code, so it's impossible to determine implemented mitigations from them.

  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for tag names, especially when handling "Sublime Text 3 Mode".
    - Robust error handling for cases with excessively long tag names or malformed tags to prevent unexpected behavior.
    - Security review of tag parsing and insertion logic, particularly in "Sublime Text 3 Mode", to identify and fix potential vulnerabilities related to handling unusual tag names.
    - Fuzz testing with various tag inputs, including very long tag names and malformed tags, to proactively discover potential issues.

  - **Preconditions:**
    1. User has the "Auto Close Tag" extension installed in VS Code.
    2. User has enabled "SublimeText3Mode" in the extension's settings (`"auto-close-tag.SublimeText3Mode": true`).
    3. User opens a crafted XML/HTML file containing an extremely long tag name in VS Code.

  - **Source code analysis:**
    Source code is not provided, so detailed source code analysis is not possible. However, based on the extension's functionality described in `README.md`, the vulnerability would hypothetically reside in the JavaScript code responsible for parsing tag names and inserting closing tags, specifically when the "SublimeText3Mode" is enabled. The extension might have assumptions about the maximum length of tag names, and these assumptions could be violated by a crafted long tag name, leading to unexpected behavior in the tag insertion logic.

  - **Security test case:**
    1. Install the "Auto Close Tag" extension in VS Code.
    2. Enable "SublimeText3Mode" in the extension settings by adding `"auto-close-tag.SublimeText3Mode": true` to your VS Code `settings.json` file.
    3. Create a new file, for example, `test.xml`, and set the language mode to XML.
    4. In `test.xml`, insert the following opening tag, replacing `[LONG_TAG_NAME]` with a very long string (e.g., 1000+ characters): `<[LONG_TAG_NAME]>`
    5. Type the closing bracket `>` to complete the opening tag.
    6. Observe the behavior of VS Code and the extension. Check for:
        - Unresponsiveness or slowdown in VS Code.
        - Incorrect or missing closing tag insertion.
        - Errors or exceptions in VS Code's developer console (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools).
    7. Examine the inserted closing tag. Is it correctly formed? Is it excessively long or malformed in any way?
    8. If VS Code becomes unresponsive, crashes, or inserts a malformed closing tag, or if errors appear in the developer console, this indicates a potential vulnerability related to handling long tag names in "SublimeText3Mode".
