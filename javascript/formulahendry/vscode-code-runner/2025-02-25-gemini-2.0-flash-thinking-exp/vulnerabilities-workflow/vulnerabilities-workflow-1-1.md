### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Command Execution via Executor Configuration
- Description:
    1. A user can configure the Code Runner extension to use custom executors for various languages and file types through settings like `code-runner.executorMap`, `code-runner.executorMapByGlob`, `code-runner.executorMapByFileExtension`, and `code-runner.customCommand`.
    2. A malicious actor can trick a user into setting a malicious command within these configuration settings. This could be achieved through social engineering, phishing, or by compromising the user's VS Code settings.
    3. When the user subsequently attempts to run code using the Code Runner extension for a language or file type associated with the malicious executor, or uses the custom command feature, the configured malicious command will be executed by the system instead of the intended code execution.
- Impact:
    - Full system compromise.
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine with the privileges of the VS Code process.
    - This can lead to:
        - Data theft: Access to sensitive files and information stored on the user's system.
        - Malware installation: Installation of viruses, trojans, ransomware, or other malicious software.
        - System disruption: Modification or deletion of critical system files, leading to system instability or denial of service.
        - Account takeover: Creation of new user accounts or modification of existing ones to gain persistent access.
- Vulnerability Rank: Critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None. The Code Runner extension, as described in the provided files, does not implement any input validation, sanitization, or security warnings related to the user-configurable executor paths and custom commands. It directly uses the user-provided strings as commands to be executed by the system shell.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: Implement checks to validate and sanitize user-provided executor paths and custom commands to prevent injection of malicious commands. This could include:
        - Whitelisting allowed characters or commands.
        - Blacklisting known dangerous commands or patterns.
        - Escaping special characters to prevent command injection.
    - Security warnings: Display a clear warning message to the user when they are configuring custom executors or commands, explicitly highlighting the potential security risks associated with executing untrusted code or commands.
    - Principle of least privilege: Explore options to execute code in a sandboxed environment or with reduced privileges to limit the potential impact of malicious commands. This might involve using containerization or virtualization technologies, or operating system-level security features.
- Preconditions:
    - User must have the Code Runner extension installed in VS Code.
    - Attacker must be able to trick the user into modifying the Code Runner extension's settings to include a malicious command in one of the executor configuration options or custom command.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided project files do not include the source code of the extension itself, but the `README.md` file clearly documents the configuration options that lead to this vulnerability.
    - The `README.md` demonstrates how users can customize execution commands using `code-runner.executorMap`, `code-runner.executorMapByGlob`, `code-runner.executorMapByFileExtension`, and `code-runner.customCommand`.
    - For example, the `code-runner.executorMap` configuration example in `README.md` shows:
    ```json
    {
        "code-runner.executorMap": {
            "javascript": "node",
            "php": "C:\\php\\php.exe",
            "python": "python",
            "perl": "perl",
            "ruby": "C:\\Ruby23-x64\\bin\\ruby.exe",
            "go": "go run",
            "html": "\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe\"",
            "java": "cd $dir && javac $fileName && java $fileNameWithoutExt",
            "c": "cd $dir && gcc $fileName -o $fileNameWithoutExt && $dir$fileNameWithoutExt"
        }
    }
    ```
    - A malicious user can replace any of these executor commands with arbitrary system commands.
    - The extension utilizes these user-defined strings directly when executing code, leading to the execution of the potentially malicious commands without any intermediate security checks or sanitization.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prepare Malicious Command:** Choose a simple but effective malicious command. For example, to create a file named "pwned.txt" in the temporary directory with the content "Vulnerable":
        - On Linux/macOS: `bash -c "echo 'Vulnerable' > /tmp/pwned.txt"`
        - On Windows: `cmd /c "echo 'Vulnerable' > %TEMP%\pwned.txt"`
    2. **Configure Malicious Executor:** Open VS Code settings (JSON format). Add or modify the `code-runner.executorMap` setting to associate JavaScript with the malicious command prepared in step 1. For example, on Linux/macOS:
    ```json
    {
        "code-runner.executorMap": {
            "javascript": "bash -c \"echo 'Vulnerable' > /tmp/pwned.txt\""
        }
    }
    ```
    3. **Create JavaScript File:** Create a new JavaScript file (e.g., `test.js`) with any simple JavaScript code or even an empty file.
    4. **Run JavaScript File:** Open the `test.js` file in VS Code and execute it using Code Runner (e.g., by pressing `Ctrl+Alt+N` or right-clicking and selecting "Run Code").
    5. **Verify Command Execution:** Check for the existence of the "pwned.txt" file in the temporary directory (`/tmp/` on Linux/macOS, `%TEMP%` on Windows) and verify that it contains the text "Vulnerable".
    6. **Expected Result:** If the vulnerability is present, the "pwned.txt" file will be created with the content "Vulnerable", demonstrating successful arbitrary command execution instead of JavaScript code execution.
