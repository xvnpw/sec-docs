After reviewing the provided vulnerability description "Command Injection via Filename in Code Runner" against the given instructions, here's the assessment:

**Analysis against exclusion criteria:**

*   **Caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns when using project from PROJECT FILES:** This vulnerability is within the Code Runner extension itself, not in user projects or due to user code. It stems from how the extension processes filenames and constructs commands. Therefore, it is **not excluded** by this criterion.
*   **Only missing documentation to mitigate:** The vulnerability requires code changes (input sanitization, secure command construction) to be mitigated, not just documentation. Documentation could advise users to be careful, but it wouldn't fundamentally fix the command injection issue within the extension. Therefore, it is **not excluded** by this criterion.
*   **Deny of service vulnerabilities:** This is a command injection vulnerability, allowing arbitrary command execution, not a denial of service. Therefore, it is **not excluded** by this criterion.

**Analysis against inclusion criteria:**

*   **Valid and not already mitigated:** The description clearly outlines a valid vulnerability with a detailed step-by-step trigger and test case. The "Currently implemented mitigations: None" section confirms that it is not currently mitigated. Therefore, it is **included** by this criterion.
*   **Vulnerability rank at least: high:** The vulnerability rank is "Critical", which is higher than "high". Therefore, it is **included** by this criterion.

**Conclusion:**

The vulnerability "Command Injection via Filename in Code Runner" meets all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria. Therefore, it should be included in the updated vulnerability list.

**Output:**

### Vulnerability List for Code Runner Extension

* Vulnerability Name: Command Injection via Filename in Code Runner

* Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a file with a malicious filename. For example, in a JavaScript project, they might name a file `test.js; touch /tmp/pwned`.
    2. The attacker opens this specially crafted project directory in VS Code, which has the Code Runner extension installed.
    3. The attacker then uses the Code Runner extension to execute the malicious JavaScript file, either by right-clicking in the editor and selecting "Run Code", using the shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+N`, or through the command palette.
    4. Code Runner, as configured, uses the filename as part of the command it executes in the shell. If the executor map for JavaScript is set to something like `node $fileName`, the filename is directly inserted into the command string.
    5. Due to the lack of sanitization of the filename, the semicolon `;` in the filename `test.js; touch /tmp/pwned` is interpreted by the shell as a command separator. This allows the execution of the injected command `touch /tmp/pwned` after the intended `node test.js` command.

* Impact:
    Arbitrary command execution on the user's machine. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute any shell command with the privileges of the VS Code user. This could lead to severe consequences, including:
    - Data exfiltration: Sensitive data can be stolen from the user's file system.
    - Malware installation: The attacker can install malware on the user's system.
    - System compromise: Full control of the user's machine can be achieved, leading to further attacks and data breaches.

* Vulnerability Rank: Critical

* Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. Review of the provided files (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, issue templates, CI workflow, and issue config) and based on the functionality described, there are no explicit mentions or configurations within the Code Runner extension that suggest any form of input sanitization or command injection prevention for filenames or other parameters used in executor commands. The documentation focuses on correct configuration of executor paths, but not on security best practices regarding user-provided input in filenames or workspace paths.

* Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization: The Code Runner extension needs to sanitize all user-provided inputs that are incorporated into shell commands. Specifically, filenames, directory names, and any other variables derived from the workspace or file paths (like `$fileName`, `$dir`, `$workspaceRoot`, etc.) must be properly sanitized or escaped before being used in shell commands. This should include escaping shell metacharacters such as semicolons, backticks, dollar signs, parentheses, etc.
    - Parameterized queries or command construction: Instead of directly embedding user inputs into command strings, the extension should consider using methods that prevent command injection, such as parameterized execution where the shell and the execution environment support it, or using libraries designed for safe command construction.
    - Security documentation: Documentation should be added to warn users about the risks of using unsanitized inputs in executor configurations and custom commands, and to recommend best practices for secure configurations.

* Preconditions:
    1. The user must have the Code Runner extension installed in VS Code.
    2. The user must open a VS Code workspace that contains a file with a maliciously crafted filename.
    3. The Code Runner extension's configuration must use filename parameters (like `$fileName`) in the executor command without proper sanitization. This is the default behavior if users configure executors as described in the README without additional security considerations.
    4. The user must execute the malicious file using the Code Runner extension.

* Source code analysis:
    Due to the lack of access to the source code, a direct code analysis is not possible. However, based on the extension's functionality and the configuration options described in `README.md`, the vulnerability can be inferred to exist in the code paths responsible for:
    1. Reading the executor map configurations from VS Code settings (`settings.json` or user/workspace settings).
    2. Constructing the command string to be executed based on the selected language, executor path, and parameters like `$fileName`, `$dir`, etc.
    3. Executing the constructed command string using a shell execution function (e.g., `child_process.exec` or `child_process.spawn` in Node.js if the extension is written in JavaScript, which is likely for a VS Code extension).

    The vulnerability arises if step 2 involves simple string concatenation or interpolation of parameters into the command string without any sanitization or escaping of shell-sensitive characters in the parameters.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Input (Malicious Filename) --> Code Runner Extension --> Command Construction (Unsafe String Interpolation of Filename) --> Shell Execution (Interprets Malicious Filename as Command) --> System Compromise
    ```

* Security test case:
    1. Set up a test environment with VS Code and the Code Runner extension installed.
    2. Create a new directory, e.g., `test-command-injection`.
    3. Inside `test-command-injection`, create a JavaScript file named `vuln.js; touch /tmp/pwned`.  (Filename contains a command injection payload).
    4. Open VS Code and open the `test-command-injection` directory as a workspace.
    5. Open the `vuln.js; touch /tmp/pwned` file in the editor.
    6. Configure Code Runner to use `node $fileName` as the executor for JavaScript. This can be done by adding the following to your `settings.json` (workspace or user settings):
       ```json
       {
           "code-runner.executorMap": {
               "javascript": "node $fileName"
           }
       }
       ```
    7. Execute the JavaScript file `vuln.js; touch /tmp/pwned` using Code Runner (e.g., right-click in the editor and select "Run Code", or use the shortcut `Ctrl+Alt+N`).
    8. After execution, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` has been created in the `/tmp` directory.
    9. **Expected Result:** If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, it confirms that the `touch /tmp/pwned` command injected through the filename was successfully executed by the system, demonstrating the command injection vulnerability. If the file does not exist, re-verify the setup and configuration. If it still doesn't exist, the vulnerability might be mitigated or not present in the way hypothesized, requiring further investigation of the code or execution environment.
