# Threat Model Analysis for ampproject/amphtml

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AMP Components](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_amp_components.md)

**Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AMP Components
*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into an AMP component through a vulnerability in its attributes or functionality. This could happen if user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or escaped before being used within a component. The attacker might manipulate component attributes or exploit parsing vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser within the context of the application's origin. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the page.
*   **Affected Component:** Specific AMP components like `<amp-bind>`, `<amp-script>`, or custom components. Vulnerabilities could reside in the component's JavaScript logic or how it handles attributes.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and escape user-provided data before using it in AMP component attributes or within `<amp-script>`.
    *   Keep AMP library versions updated to benefit from security patches.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom AMP components.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

## Threat: [AMP Cache Poisoning](./threats/amp_cache_poisoning.md)

**Threat:** AMP Cache Poisoning
*   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the content served by the Google AMP Cache (or other AMP caches). This might involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the cache's content fetching or update mechanisms, or compromising the origin server to inject malicious content that gets cached.
*   **Impact:** Serving malicious content to users accessing the AMP version of the page through the cache. This could lead to malware distribution, phishing attacks, or the spread of misinformation.
*   **Affected Component:** AMP Cache infrastructure, specifically the content fetching and caching logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong security measures on the origin server to prevent content injection.
    *   Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) for critical resources to ensure they haven't been tampered with.
    *   Monitor the AMP Cache for unexpected changes in content.
    *   Implement proper cache control headers to manage content freshness and invalidation.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Third-Party AMP Components](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_third-party_amp_components.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Third-Party AMP Components
*   **Description:**  AMP allows for the use of third-party components. If these components contain security vulnerabilities, attackers could exploit them to compromise the application. This could involve XSS, injection flaws, or other vulnerabilities within the component's code.
*   **Impact:**  Similar to XSS in core components, this can lead to arbitrary code execution, data theft, or manipulation within the AMP context. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability and the permissions of the component.
*   **Affected Component:**  Specific third-party AMP components.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and select reputable third-party AMP components.
    *   Keep third-party components updated to their latest versions.
    *   Monitor security advisories related to the third-party components used.
    *   Implement CSP to restrict the capabilities of third-party components.

## Threat: [Bypassing AMP Validation to Inject Malicious Code](./threats/bypassing_amp_validation_to_inject_malicious_code.md)

**Threat:** Bypassing AMP Validation to Inject Malicious Code
*   **Description:** An attacker might find ways to craft AMP pages that bypass the validation process but still contain malicious code or exploit vulnerabilities in AMP renderers. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in the validator itself or finding edge cases that the validator doesn't catch.
*   **Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts or exploitation of browser vulnerabilities when the invalid AMP page is rendered.
*   **Affected Component:** AMP Validator library and potentially the AMP runtime responsible for rendering.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always rely on the official AMP validator for validating AMP pages.
    *   Keep the AMP validator updated to the latest version.
    *   Be cautious about accepting AMP content from untrusted sources.
    *   Implement server-side validation of AMP content before serving it.

## Threat: [Signed Exchange (SXG) Signature Forgery](./threats/signed_exchange__sxg__signature_forgery.md)

**Threat:** Signed Exchange (SXG) Signature Forgery
*   **Description:** If the cryptographic signatures used in Signed Exchanges are compromised or improperly implemented, an attacker might be able to forge signatures and serve malicious content as if it originated from the legitimate domain. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in the signing process or compromising the private key.
*   **Impact:** Serving of malicious content with the authority of the original domain, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or defacement.
*   **Affected Component:**  The SXG signing mechanism and the cryptographic libraries used.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust key management practices, including secure storage and access control for private keys.
    *   Ensure proper implementation of the SXG signing process according to best practices.
    *   Regularly audit the SXG signing infrastructure and processes.
    *   Use Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) for key protection if feasible.
