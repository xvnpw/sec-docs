## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in AMP Components](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_amp_components.md)

**Description:** AMP relies on a set of pre-built components (e.g., `<amp-img>`, `<amp-carousel>`). These components, being complex pieces of code, can contain vulnerabilities.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities:** Attackers can search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of AMP components. If the application uses an outdated version, it becomes a target.
        * **Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** More sophisticated attackers might discover and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in AMP components.
        * **Inject Malicious AMP Component:** While less likely due to AMP's validation, attackers might try to bypass validation and inject their own malicious components or modify existing ones to introduce malicious behavior. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the build or deployment process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** AMP relies on a set of pre-built components (e.g., `<amp-img>`, `<amp-carousel>`). These components, being complex pieces of code, can contain vulnerabilities.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities:** Attackers can search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in specific versions of AMP components. If the application uses an outdated version, it becomes a target.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Exploit for Identified Vulnerability (in Components and Extensions)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_exploit_for_identified_vulnerability__in_components_and_extensions_.md)

**Description:**  This step involves using a known exploit to take advantage of a publicly disclosed vulnerability in an AMP component or extension.
    * **Attack Steps:**  The attacker leverages existing knowledge and potentially available exploit code to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Develop and Execute Exploit (Zero-Day)](./attack_tree_paths/develop_and_execute_exploit__zero-day_.md)

**Description:** This step involves the attacker first discovering a previously unknown vulnerability (zero-day) and then developing and executing an exploit to take advantage of it.
    * **Attack Steps:** This requires significant reverse engineering, vulnerability analysis, and exploit development skills.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass AMP Validation](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_amp_validation.md)

**Description:** This critical step involves successfully circumventing the AMP validation process, allowing the attacker to inject invalid or malicious markup.
    * **Attack Steps:** This could involve exploiting bugs in the validator, logic flaws in the validation rules, or leveraging undocumented features.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit AMP Validation Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_amp_validation_bypass.md)

**Description:** AMP enforces strict validation rules to ensure only valid AMP markup is rendered. Bypassing this validation can allow attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * **Craft AMP Page that Bypasses Validation:** Attackers can try to find weaknesses in the AMP validator itself, such as parser bugs, logic flaws in the validation rules, or leverage undocumented features that are not properly validated.
        * **Serve Invalid AMP Page to Users:** If the application fails to properly validate AMP content before serving it, or if there are vulnerabilities in how the validator is integrated, attackers can serve invalid AMP pages.
        * **Trigger Client-Side Vulnerabilities:** Once invalid HTML/JavaScript is rendered, it can be used to execute client-side attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Craft AMP Page that Bypasses Validation](./attack_tree_paths/craft_amp_page_that_bypasses_validation.md)

**Description:** This is the preparatory step for exploiting validation bypass vulnerabilities, where the attacker creates a specially crafted AMP page designed to evade the validation checks.
    * **Attack Steps:** This requires understanding the intricacies of the AMP validation process and identifying potential weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Client-Side Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_client-side_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Once an invalid AMP page is served, this step involves the execution of malicious scripts or the exploitation of other client-side vulnerabilities within the user's browser.
    * **Attack Steps:** This often involves Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, where injected JavaScript code is executed in the user's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit AMP Cache Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_amp_cache_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** AMP pages are often served from Google's AMP Cache or other third-party caches. Exploiting these caches can have a wide impact.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * **Cache Poisoning:** Attackers might try to inject malicious content into the AMP cache. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the cache's invalidation mechanisms or finding ways to associate malicious content with legitimate AMP URLs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cache Poisoning](./attack_tree_paths/cache_poisoning.md)

**Description:** AMP pages are often served from Google's AMP Cache or other third-party caches. Exploiting these caches can have a wide impact.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * **Cache Poisoning:** Attackers might try to inject malicious content into the AMP cache. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the cache's invalidation mechanisms or finding ways to associate malicious content with legitimate AMP URLs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content into Cache](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_into_cache.md)

**Description:** This step involves successfully inserting malicious content into the AMP cache, replacing legitimate content with attacker-controlled data.
    * **Attack Steps:** This could involve exploiting weaknesses in the cache's invalidation mechanisms or finding ways to associate malicious content with legitimate AMP URLs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit AMP Runtime Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_amp_runtime_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** The AMP runtime is a JavaScript library that powers AMP components and manages their behavior. Vulnerabilities in the runtime can have significant consequences.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in AMP JavaScript Runtime:** Attackers can target known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the AMP runtime itself. This could lead to XSS, prototype pollution, or other client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in AMP JavaScript Runtime](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_amp_javascript_runtime.md)

**Description:** The AMP runtime is a JavaScript library that powers AMP components and manages their behavior. Vulnerabilities in the runtime can have significant consequences.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in AMP JavaScript Runtime:** Attackers can target known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the AMP runtime itself. This could lead to XSS, prototype pollution, or other client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Exploit (e.g., XSS, Prototype Pollution) in AMP Runtime](./attack_tree_paths/execute_exploit__e_g___xss__prototype_pollution__in_amp_runtime.md)

**Description:** This step involves leveraging a vulnerability in the AMP JavaScript runtime to execute malicious code within the user's browser.
    * **Attack Steps:** This could involve injecting scripts that perform actions on behalf of the user, steal sensitive information, or manipulate the application's behavior.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage CORS to Access Sensitive Data or Perform Actions](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_cors_to_access_sensitive_data_or_perform_actions.md)

**Description:** This step involves exploiting a misconfigured Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy to make unauthorized requests to the application's backend, potentially accessing sensitive data or performing actions the user is authorized to do.
    * **Attack Steps:** The attacker crafts requests from a malicious origin that are unexpectedly allowed by the overly permissive CORS policy.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in AMP Extensions](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_amp_extensions.md)

**Description:** AMP allows for extending its functionality through extensions. These extensions, often developed by third parties, can introduce their own vulnerabilities.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        * **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Specific Extensions:** Similar to AMP components, attackers can target known vulnerabilities in specific AMP extensions used by the application.
        * **Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Extensions:** Attackers might discover and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in AMP extensions.
