# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ampproject/amphtml

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict AMP Component Auditing and Management](./mitigation_strategies/strict_amp_component_auditing_and_management.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory:** Create a comprehensive list of *all* AMP components used in the project, including their versions and source (official AMP, third-party).  This is AMP-specific because it deals with the `amp-*` components.
    2.  **Source Code Review:** For each *AMP component*:
        *   Obtain the source code.
        *   Examine the code for potential vulnerabilities, focusing on how the component handles user input, generates output, and interacts with other AMP components or external resources.  This is AMP-specific because the vulnerabilities are within the AMP component's logic.
        *   Document any identified vulnerabilities.
    3.  **Update Mechanism:** Establish a process for automatically updating all AMP components to their latest versions.  This is crucial because AMP components are frequently updated with security patches.
    4.  **Least Privilege (AMP-Specific):** Configure each AMP component with the minimum necessary attributes and data access.  For example, restrict `amp-list` to only fetch data from specific, trusted endpoints.  This leverages AMP's built-in restrictions.
    5.  **CVE Monitoring (AMP-Specific):** Actively monitor for CVEs specifically related to the used *AMP components*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS via AMP Components (High Severity):** Directly addresses vulnerabilities *within* AMP components that could lead to XSS.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via AMP Components (Medium to High Severity):** Limits the potential for compromised *AMP components* to leak data.
    *   **Component-Specific Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Addresses any other vulnerabilities specific to individual *AMP components*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk (e.g., by 70-90%) if implemented thoroughly.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Moderately reduces the risk (e.g., by 40-60%).
    *   **Component-Specific Vulnerabilities:** Reduces risk proportionally to the severity of the specific vulnerability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partial implementation in the `core-components` directory. Components are updated, but formal code review is inconsistent. CVE monitoring is in place for core AMP components.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal, documented code review process for *all* AMP components, including third-party.
    *   Consistent application of least privilege for AMP component attributes.
    *   Automated testing of AMP component updates is not fully implemented.
    *   Complete inventory of all used AMP components is incomplete.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Signed Exchanges (SXG) for AMP](./mitigation_strategies/signed_exchanges__sxg__for_amp.md)

*   **Description:** This entire strategy is inherently AMP-specific, as SXG is a technology designed to work with AMP Caches.
    1.  **Generate Key Pair:** Create a key pair for signing AMP pages.
    2.  **Configure Server:** Modify your server to generate SXG responses for AMP requests, including the necessary HTTP headers.
    3.  **Integrate with AMP Cache:** Ensure compatibility with the AMP Caches you use.
    4.  **Monitor and Rotate Keys:** Regularly monitor and rotate signing keys.
    5.  **Set short TTLs:** Set short cache Time-To-Live values.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning/Manipulation (High Severity):** Specifically targets the vulnerability of AMP pages being served from potentially compromised AMP Caches.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks (High Severity):** Protects AMP pages in transit between the origin and the AMP Cache.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cache Poisoning:** Near-complete mitigation (95-100%).
    *   **MitM Attacks:** Significant reduction in risk (80-90%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Entire SXG implementation is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [AMP-Specific Redirect Validation (within AMP Components)](./mitigation_strategies/amp-specific_redirect_validation__within_amp_components_.md)

*   **Description:** This focuses on validation *within* the context of AMP components, particularly `amp-form`.
    1.  **`amp-form` Attribute Validation:**  Scrutinize the `action` and `action-xhr` attributes of `amp-form`.  These attributes *directly* control where the form data is sent and are specific to AMP.
    2.  **Whitelist (within AMP Context):**  Ideally, use a whitelist approach *within the AMP component configuration* (if possible, depending on the server-side setup) to restrict allowed `action` and `action-xhr` URLs. This is more restrictive than general server-side validation.
    3.  **Avoid User Input in `action`:**  *Never* allow user-provided input to directly influence the `action` or `action-xhr` attributes. This is a common vulnerability pattern within AMP forms.
    4. **Sanitize and encode:** Sanitize and encode all data that is used in AMP components.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirects via `amp-form` (Medium to High Severity):** Directly addresses the misuse of `amp-form` for open redirect attacks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirects:** Significant reduction in risk (70-90%) when combined with server-side validation.  The AMP-specific focus prevents bypasses that might be possible with general validation alone.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. Basic validation exists, but a strict, AMP-context whitelist is not used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementation of a whitelist approach *within the AMP component configuration* (if feasible).
    *   More robust validation logic specifically targeting `amp-form` attributes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [AMP-Specific Content Security Policy (CSP)](./mitigation_strategies/amp-specific_content_security_policy__csp_.md)

*   **Description:** This is about crafting a CSP *specifically tailored* to the constraints and requirements of AMP.
    1.  **Define AMP-Tailored Policy:** Create a CSP with directives optimized for AMP:
        *   `script-src`: Restrict to `'self'` and the *required* AMP CDN URLs (e.g., `cdn.ampproject.org`).  This is crucial because AMP relies heavily on the CDN.
        *   `style-src`: Similar restrictions, allowing the AMP CDN and being very careful with `'unsafe-inline'`.
        *   `img-src`: Control image sources, allowing the AMP CDN and trusted origins.
        *   `connect-src`:  Restrict to the API endpoints *specifically used by your AMP components*.
        *   `frame-ancestors`: Use `'self'` to prevent framing, as AMP itself restricts framing.
    2.  **Implement Header:** Include the `Content-Security-Policy` header.
    3.  **Test with AMP Validator:** Use the AMP Validator to ensure your CSP doesn't violate AMP's requirements.  This is a key AMP-specific step.
    4.  **Use Reporting:** Use `report-uri` or `report-to` to monitor CSP violations.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **XSS (High Severity):** Provides a crucial layer of defense against XSS, even if AMP component vulnerabilities exist.  The AMP-specific CSP is more effective than a generic CSP.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Medium to High Severity):** Limits data exfiltration by restricting network connections made by AMP components.
    *   **Clickjacking/Framing (Medium Severity):** Reinforces AMP's built-in framing restrictions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Moderate to significant reduction (50-80%).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Moderate reduction (40-60%).
    *   **Clickjacking:** Near-complete mitigation (95-100%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A basic CSP is implemented, but it is not comprehensive or AMP-specific.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A strict, AMP-tailored CSP needs to be defined, implemented, and tested with the AMP Validator.
    *   CSP reporting needs to be configured.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `amp-analytics` and `amp-pixel` Configuration (AMP-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/secure__amp-analytics__and__amp-pixel__configuration__amp-specific_.md)

*   **Description:** This focuses on the security of AMP's built-in tracking components.
    1.  **Access Control (AMP Config):** Strictly control access to the *configuration of your `amp-analytics` and `amp-pixel` components*.  This is specific to how these AMP components are configured.
    2.  **Data Minimization (AMP Data):**  Collect only the minimum necessary data *within the context of `amp-analytics`*. Avoid collecting sensitive information that's not needed for AMP-specific tracking.
    3.  **Configuration Review (AMP-Specific):** Regularly review the *configuration of these AMP components* to ensure they are not sending data to unexpected destinations.
    4.  **Traffic Monitoring (AMP Traffic):** Monitor the network traffic *generated by `amp-analytics` and `amp-pixel`* to detect anomalies.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration via AMP Tracking (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the risk of these *AMP components* being misused for data theft.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Moderate reduction in risk (40-60%).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic access control is in place, but a formal review process is not consistently followed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal, documented review process for `amp-analytics` and `amp-pixel` configuration.
    *   Implementation of network traffic monitoring specifically for these AMP components.
    *   Consistent application of data minimization principles within the AMP analytics context.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit and Audit Third-Party AMP Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/limit_and_audit_third-party_amp_extensions.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Minimize Usage:** Only use third-party AMP extensions when absolutely necessary. Prefer official AMP components.
    2. **Trusted Sources:** Only obtain extensions from reputable sources.
    3. **Code Review:** Before using *any* third-party AMP extension, conduct a thorough code review.
    4. **Regular Updates:** Keep all third-party AMP extensions updated.
    5. **Dependency Management:** Use a dependency management system to track and manage third-party AMP extensions.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **XSS via Extensions (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of vulnerabilities introduced by third-party AMP code.
    * **Data Exfiltration via Extensions (Medium to High Severity):** Limits the potential for malicious AMP extensions to leak data.
    * **Other Extension-Specific Vulnerabilities (Variable Severity):** Addresses any vulnerabilities specific to the third-party AMP extension.

* **Impact:**
    * **XSS/Data Exfiltration/Other:** Significantly reduces risk (potentially 70-90% reduction).

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * No formal policy or process.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * All aspects of this mitigation strategy are currently missing.
