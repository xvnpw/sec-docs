Okay, let's create a design document for the AMP HTML project.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Improve web page loading speed and user experience, particularly on mobile devices.
*   Increase user engagement and reduce bounce rates for publishers.
*   Provide a standardized, open-source framework for creating fast-loading web pages.
*   Enhance the mobile web ecosystem and make it more competitive with native apps.
*   Improve SEO ranking.
*   Improve ad viewability and performance.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Compatibility issues with existing websites and web technologies.
*   Limited adoption by publishers and developers.
*   Negative impact on website functionality or design due to AMP restrictions.
*   Dependence on the AMP Cache and potential centralization concerns.
*   Security vulnerabilities within the AMP framework itself.
*   Keeping up with evolving web standards and browser technologies.
*   Negative perception or criticism from the web development community.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Strict Content Security Policy (CSP). Enforced by the AMP Validator and runtime.
*   security control: Limited use of JavaScript. Only AMP-approved JavaScript components are allowed, reducing the attack surface for XSS. Described in AMP documentation.
*   security control: Mandatory HTTPS. AMP pages must be served over HTTPS, ensuring encrypted communication. Enforced by the AMP Validator.
*   security control: Sandboxing of iframes. Third-party content in iframes is heavily sandboxed to prevent malicious behavior. Described in AMP documentation.
*   security control: Validation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The AMP Validator enforces strict rules to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Built-in protections against common XSS vectors. AMP components are designed with security in mind. Described in AMP documentation.
*   security control: Regular security audits and updates. The AMP Project undergoes regular security reviews.
*   security control: Open-source codebase. Allows for community scrutiny and vulnerability identification.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party AMP components. While AMP components are vetted, there's a residual risk associated with their use.
*   accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities in the AMP runtime or validator. Despite rigorous testing, complex software can have undiscovered flaws.
*   accepted risk: Limited customization due to AMP restrictions. This can impact the ability to implement certain security features or configurations.
*   accepted risk: Dependence on the AMP Cache. While it provides performance benefits, it also introduces a potential single point of failure or control.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a robust vulnerability disclosure program to encourage responsible reporting of security issues.
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing of the AMP framework and its components.
*   security control: Provide clear security guidance and best practices for developers building AMP components.
*   security control: Implement a mechanism for quickly patching and deploying security updates to the AMP runtime and validator.
*   security control: Explore the use of Subresource Integrity (SRI) for AMP components to further mitigate the risk of compromised third-party code.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Not directly applicable to the core AMP framework, as it focuses on content delivery. Authentication is handled by the origin server hosting the AMP pages.
*   Authorization: Not directly applicable to the core AMP framework. Authorization is handled by the origin server.
*   Input Validation: AMP strictly enforces input validation through the AMP Validator. All HTML, CSS, and JavaScript must conform to the AMP specification. This is a core security control.
*   Cryptography: AMP requires HTTPS, ensuring all communication is encrypted using TLS. The specific cryptographic protocols and ciphers are determined by the server configuration.
*   Output Encoding: AMP components are designed to properly encode output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer("Developer") --> CodeRepository("Code Repository (e.g., GitHub)")
    CodeRepository --> CIBuildServer("CI/Build Server (e.g., GitHub Actions)")
    CIBuildServer --> AMPValidator("AMP Validator")
    CIBuildServer --> Linters("Linters (HTML, CSS, JS)")
    CIBuildServer --> SAST("SAST Tools")
    CIBuildServer --> BuildArtifacts("Build Artifacts (AMP HTML Files)")
    BuildArtifacts --> Deployment("Deployment to Origin Server")

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write AMP HTML code and commit it to a code repository (e.g., GitHub).
2.  A CI/Build server (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) is triggered by the commit.
3.  The build server runs the AMP Validator to ensure the code conforms to the AMP specification.
4.  Linters (HTML, CSS, JS) are used to check for code style and potential errors.
5.  SAST (Static Application Security Testing) tools are used to scan for security vulnerabilities.
6.  If all checks pass, the build server produces build artifacts (AMP HTML files).
7.  The build artifacts are deployed to the origin server.

Security Controls:

*   security control: AMP Validator: Enforces AMP restrictions during the build process.
*   security control: Linters: Identify potential code quality issues that could lead to vulnerabilities.
*   security control: SAST Tools: Scan for security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: CI/Build Server: Automates the build process and ensures consistent security checks.
*   security control: Code Repository: Provides version control and access control for the codebase.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Tools to manage and vet third-party dependencies (if any are used, which is limited in AMP).
