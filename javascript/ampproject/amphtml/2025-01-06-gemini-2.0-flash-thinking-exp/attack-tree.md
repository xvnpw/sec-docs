# Attack Tree Analysis for ampproject/amphtml

Objective: To compromise the application using AMPHTML by exploiting its weaknesses or vulnerabilities. More specifically, the refined goal is to gain unauthorized access to application resources or manipulate application behavior through vulnerabilities introduced by the AMPHTML implementation.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit AMP Feature Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_amp_feature_vulnerabilities.md)

This node represents the overarching category of attacks that target inherent weaknesses or bugs within the AMP framework's features and components. Success here can lead to a wide range of compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Exploit Vulnerabilities in AMP Components](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_amp_components.md)

This path focuses on exploiting specific weaknesses within individual AMP components.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Trigger XSS via vulnerable AMP component (e.g., amp-bind, amp-script)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_trigger_xss_via_vulnerable_amp_component__e_g___amp-bind__amp-script_.md)

Attackers aim to inject malicious JavaScript code by leveraging vulnerabilities in how AMP components handle attributes or data. This can lead to:

*   Account takeover by stealing session cookies or credentials.
*   Data theft by accessing sensitive information on the page.
*   Redirection to malicious websites.
*   Execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Trigger Resource Injection/Abuse](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_trigger_resource_injectionabuse.md)

Attackers attempt to inject malicious resources or abuse the resource loading mechanisms of AMP. This can involve:

*   Injecting malicious scripts via components like `<amp-img>` by manipulating the `src` attribute or other resource loading parameters. This can lead to XSS.
*   Injecting iframes or other content to perform clickjacking or other UI-based attacks.
*   Exhausting server resources by making excessive requests for AMP resources, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit AMP Cache Related Issues](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_amp_cache_related_issues.md)

This node encompasses attacks that target the Google AMP Cache and the application's interaction with it. The cache's role in serving content introduces unique vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Cache Poisoning](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_cache_poisoning.md)

Attackers aim to serve malicious AMP content that gets cached by the Google AMP Cache and subsequently served to other users. This typically involves:

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Serve malicious AMP content to the Google AMP Cache](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_serve_malicious_amp_content_to_the_google_amp_cache.md)

Exploiting vulnerabilities or misconfigurations on the origin server to inject malicious content.
*   Exploiting weaknesses in the AMP Cache update mechanism (though less common).
*   Success here can lead to widespread distribution of malware, phishing pages, or other malicious content, all appearing to originate from the legitimate domain.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Data Leakage through AMP Cache](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_data_leakage_through_amp_cache.md)

Attackers exploit situations where sensitive information is unintentionally cached by the Google AMP Cache, making it publicly accessible. This can happen if:

*   The application fails to properly control what content is marked as cacheable.
*   Sensitive data is included in URLs or other cacheable elements.
*   Error messages or debugging information containing sensitive data are cached.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Leveraging SXG for phishing or content spoofing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_leveraging_sxg_for_phishing_or_content_spoofing.md)

Attackers exploit the Signed Exchange (SXG) mechanism to deliver malicious content while maintaining the appearance of a legitimate origin. This can involve:

*   Compromising the origin server to serve malicious content signed with the legitimate origin's key.
*   Exploiting vulnerabilities in how browsers handle or verify SXG to serve malicious content that appears to be from a trusted source. This can be highly effective for phishing attacks as the URL in the address bar will match the legitimate site.

## Attack Tree Path: [CRITICAL NODE: Exploit Misconfigurations in AMP Implementation](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_misconfigurations_in_amp_implementation.md)

This node highlights the risks associated with incorrect or insecure configuration of the application's AMP implementation.

## Attack Tree Path: [HIGH-RISK PATH: Incorrect Content Security Policy (CSP) for AMP](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_incorrect_content_security_policy__csp__for_amp.md)

A poorly configured or overly permissive Content Security Policy (CSP) for AMP pages can undermine its security. If the CSP allows:

*   `unsafe-inline` for scripts or styles, it opens the door to classic XSS attacks.
*   Loading resources from untrusted origins, it allows injection of malicious scripts or other content.
*   Missing or weak CSP directives can leave the application vulnerable to various attacks. This is a common misconfiguration with a high potential impact.
