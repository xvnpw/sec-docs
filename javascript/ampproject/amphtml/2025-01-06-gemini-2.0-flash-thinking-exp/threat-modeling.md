# Threat Model Analysis for ampproject/amphtml

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Vulnerable AMP Component](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_vulnerable_amp_component.md)

- **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that exploits a vulnerability within a specific AMP component provided by the `ampproject/amphtml` library. This allows them to inject arbitrary JavaScript into the AMP page, which is then executed in the context of the user's browser. The attacker might manipulate the DOM, steal cookies, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, defacement of the page, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
- **Affected AMP Component:** Specific AMP components within the `ampproject/amphtml` library (e.g., older versions of `<amp-bind>`, `<amp-mustache>`, `<amp-script>`).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Regularly update the `ampproject/amphtml` library and all used AMP components to the latest versions.
  - Carefully review the release notes and security advisories for AMP components within the `ampproject/amphtml` repository.
  - Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) directives to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and the actions that scripts can perform.
  - Avoid using deprecated or vulnerable AMP components from the `ampproject/amphtml` library.

## Threat: [AMP Cache Poisoning](./threats/amp_cache_poisoning.md)

- **Description:** An attacker compromises the process of updating content in the Google AMP Cache, which is a core part of the AMP ecosystem. They might exploit vulnerabilities in the origin server's handling of AMP updates or manipulate DNS records to redirect the cache to serve malicious content. This results in the AMP Cache serving a modified, attacker-controlled version of the page to users.
- **Impact:** Widespread distribution of malicious content, phishing attacks, malware distribution, defacement of the application's AMP pages served through the AMP Cache.
- **Affected AMP Component:** AMP Cache infrastructure (part of the AMP ecosystem, though not directly within the `ampproject/amphtml` library code itself, but a consequence of using AMPHTML).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Implement strong server-side validation of AMP content before it is served to the cache.
  - Utilize Signed Exchanges (SXG) to cryptographically sign AMP content, ensuring its integrity and origin when served from the AMP Cache.
  - Secure the DNS infrastructure to prevent DNS hijacking.
  - Monitor AMP Cache updates for unexpected changes.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Custom AMP Components](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_amp_components.md)

- **Description:** Developers create custom AMP components using mechanisms provided by `ampproject/amphtml` such as `<amp-script>`. These custom components may contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, injection flaws) if not developed with security in mind. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the user's browser or the application.
- **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), data breaches, unauthorized actions within the application.
- **Affected AMP Component:** Custom AMP components created using features of `ampproject/amphtml` (e.g., `<amp-script>`).
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - Apply secure coding practices when developing custom AMP components.
  - Conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing of custom components.
  - Implement input validation and output encoding within custom components.
  - Minimize the use of custom components and prefer well-vetted, official AMP components from `ampproject/amphtml` when possible.

## Threat: [Bypassing AMP Validation for Malicious Code Injection](./threats/bypassing_amp_validation_for_malicious_code_injection.md)

- **Description:** An attacker discovers a way to create an AMP page that contains malicious code but still passes the AMP validation process, which is a core security feature of the AMP framework defined by `ampproject/amphtml`. This could involve exploiting bugs in the validator or finding loopholes in the validation rules.
- **Impact:** Allows for the injection of arbitrary JavaScript or other malicious content into AMP pages, bypassing the security benefits that AMP validation, enforced by the `ampproject/amphtml` validator, is intended to provide.
- **Affected AMP Component:** AMP validator (part of the `ampproject/amphtml` ecosystem).
- **Risk Severity:** Critical
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
  - This is primarily the responsibility of the `ampproject/amphtml` project maintainers to ensure the robustness of the validator.
  - Stay updated with the latest AMP specifications and validation rules from the `ampproject/amphtml` project.
  - Report any potential validation bypasses to the `ampproject/amphtml` project.
  - Implement additional security measures beyond AMP validation, such as CSP.
