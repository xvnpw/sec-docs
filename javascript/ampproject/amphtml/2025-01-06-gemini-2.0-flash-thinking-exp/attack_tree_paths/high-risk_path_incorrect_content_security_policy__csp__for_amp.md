## Deep Analysis: Incorrect Content Security Policy (CSP) for AMP

This analysis delves into the "Incorrect Content Security Policy (CSP) for AMP" attack tree path, outlining the risks, potential exploitation methods, and mitigation strategies. As a cybersecurity expert working with the development team, my goal is to provide a comprehensive understanding of this vulnerability and guide you in implementing robust security measures.

**Understanding the Vulnerability:**

The Content Security Policy (CSP) is a crucial security mechanism that allows web application developers to control the resources the browser is allowed to load for a given page. By defining a set of directives, the CSP helps mitigate various types of attacks, especially Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

In the context of AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages), a well-configured CSP is paramount. AMP inherently restricts JavaScript and certain HTML elements to ensure performance and security. However, a flawed CSP can inadvertently weaken these built-in protections, opening doors for attackers.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path:**

Let's examine each point in the attack path description in detail:

**1. `unsafe-inline` for scripts or styles:**

* **The Problem:** The `unsafe-inline` keyword in the `script-src` or `style-src` directives essentially tells the browser to trust and execute inline JavaScript and CSS code embedded directly within the HTML.
* **Why it's Dangerous:** This completely bypasses the core protection offered by CSP against inline script injection. If an attacker can inject arbitrary HTML into the page (through vulnerabilities like stored XSS or even a cleverly crafted URL in some scenarios), they can then include malicious inline `<script>` or `<style>` tags that will be executed by the browser.
* **Exploitation Scenario:**
    * **Stored XSS:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a database field that is later displayed on an AMP page. With `unsafe-inline` enabled, the browser will execute this injected script.
    * **DOM-based XSS (less likely in strict AMP but possible with relaxed CSP):**  While AMP restricts direct DOM manipulation, if the CSP is overly permissive and allows certain JavaScript libraries or functionalities, an attacker might manipulate the DOM in a way that introduces malicious inline scripts.
* **Impact:** Full XSS vulnerability, allowing attackers to:
    * Steal user cookies and session tokens.
    * Redirect users to malicious websites.
    * Deface the AMP page.
    * Execute arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.

**2. Loading resources from untrusted origins:**

* **The Problem:**  CSP directives like `script-src`, `img-src`, `style-src`, etc., control the origins from which the browser is allowed to load resources. If these directives are too broad or include wildcard domains (e.g., `*.example.com`) or allow `data:` or `blob:` schemes without careful consideration, it creates opportunities for attackers.
* **Why it's Dangerous:**
    * **Malicious Script Injection:** If `script-src` allows an attacker-controlled domain, they can host malicious JavaScript files on their server and inject a `<script>` tag pointing to it.
    * **Content Injection/Defacement:** If `img-src` allows untrusted origins, attackers can inject malicious images or even manipulate the visual appearance of the page.
    * **Data Exfiltration:**  If `connect-src` is too permissive, attackers might be able to send sensitive data to their own servers.
* **Exploitation Scenario:**
    * **Compromised CDN:** If a trusted CDN is compromised, and the CSP allows loading from that CDN, attackers can inject malicious code into the hosted files.
    * **Attacker-Controlled Subdomain:** If the CSP uses a wildcard like `*.example.com` and an attacker manages to compromise a subdomain (e.g., `attacker.example.com`), they can host malicious resources there.
    * **Open Redirects:** If the application has an open redirect vulnerability on a whitelisted domain, attackers could potentially use it to load malicious resources indirectly.
* **Impact:**
    * XSS through injected scripts.
    * Defacement and manipulation of the page content.
    * Potential data exfiltration.
    * Introduction of malware or phishing attempts.

**3. Missing or weak CSP directives:**

* **The Problem:**  A CSP is only as strong as its weakest link. Missing crucial directives or using overly permissive values can leave significant security gaps.
* **Why it's Dangerous:**
    * **Missing `object-src`:** Allows embedding plugins like Flash, which can be exploited for various attacks.
    * **Missing `frame-ancestors`:**  Makes the page vulnerable to Clickjacking attacks by allowing it to be framed on malicious websites.
    * **Permissive `base-uri`:** Can allow attackers to change the base URL of the page, potentially leading to resource loading from unexpected locations.
    * **Not using `require-sri-for`:**  Without Subresource Integrity (SRI), if a whitelisted CDN is compromised, the browser will still load the malicious code.
    * **Using `unsafe-eval` (generally discouraged):** While not explicitly mentioned in the attack path, it's a common misconfiguration that allows execution of strings as code, opening up XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Exploitation Scenario:**
    * **Clickjacking:** An attacker embeds the vulnerable AMP page in an iframe on their malicious site, tricking users into performing actions they didn't intend.
    * **Plugin Exploitation:** If `object-src` is missing or permissive, attackers can embed malicious Flash content.
    * **Bypassing SRI:** If a whitelisted CDN is compromised, the browser will load the malicious script if SRI isn't enforced.
* **Impact:**
    * Clickjacking attacks leading to unintended actions.
    * Exploitation of vulnerabilities in outdated plugins.
    * Failure to prevent execution of compromised CDN resources.

**Why this is a High-Risk Path for AMP:**

While AMP has built-in security features, a poorly configured CSP can negate these protections. The expectation with AMP is a higher level of security due to its restrictions. A weak CSP undermines this expectation and can lead to significant vulnerabilities. Furthermore, the performance-focused nature of AMP means that users often trust AMP pages to be safe, making them potentially more susceptible to attacks if the CSP is weak.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

To effectively address this high-risk path, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Implement a Strict CSP:**
    * **Avoid `unsafe-inline`:**  The primary goal should be to eliminate the need for inline scripts and styles. Refactor code to use external files and leverage techniques like `nonce` or `hash` for specific inline script requirements (though these should be minimized in AMP).
    * **Whitelist Specific Origins:**  Define a precise list of trusted origins for each resource type using directives like `script-src`, `img-src`, `style-src`, `connect-src`, etc. Avoid wildcards unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    * **Use `nonce` or `hash` for Inline Scripts (if absolutely necessary):** If inline scripts are unavoidable, use cryptographically secure nonces or hashes to explicitly authorize specific inline blocks.
    * **Enforce HTTPS:** Use `upgrade-insecure-requests` to instruct the browser to automatically upgrade insecure HTTP requests to HTTPS.
    * **Set `frame-ancestors`:**  Specify the domains that are allowed to embed the AMP page in an iframe to prevent clickjacking.
    * **Use `object-src 'none'`:**  Unless there's a specific need for plugins, disable them entirely to mitigate related vulnerabilities.
    * **Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use the `require-sri-for` directive to ensure that fetched resources from whitelisted origins haven't been tampered with.
    * **Consider `report-uri` or `report-to`:**  Configure CSP reporting to receive notifications when CSP violations occur, allowing for monitoring and identification of potential attacks or misconfigurations.

* **Regularly Review and Test the CSP:**
    * **Automated Testing:** Integrate CSP validation into the development pipeline to catch errors early.
    * **Manual Review:**  Periodically review the CSP configuration to ensure it aligns with security best practices and the application's requirements.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Include CSP bypass attempts in penetration testing activities to identify weaknesses.

* **Educate the Development Team:** Ensure the development team understands the importance of CSP and how to configure it correctly.

* **Leverage AMP Specific Security Features:** While CSP is crucial, remember to leverage other AMP security features and adhere to AMP's best practices.

**Conclusion:**

An incorrect Content Security Policy for AMP pages represents a significant security risk. By understanding the potential attack vectors and implementing a robust and well-configured CSP, the development team can effectively mitigate this threat and ensure the security and integrity of the application. This requires a proactive approach, continuous monitoring, and a commitment to security best practices.
