# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ampproject/amphtml

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) for AMP Runtime](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__for_amp_runtime.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate SRI Hash for `v0.js`:** Use a tool to generate an SRI hash for the official AMP runtime script (`v0.js`) from `https://cdn.ampproject.org/v0.js`.
    2.  **Integrate SRI Attribute in `<script>` Tag:** In your AMP pages, when including the AMP runtime script, add the `integrity` attribute to the `<script>` tag. Set its value to the generated SRI hash.
    3.  **Include `crossorigin="anonymous"`:** Ensure the `<script>` tag also includes the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute, necessary for SRI with cross-origin resources like CDNs.
    4.  **Deploy Updated AMP Pages:** Deploy the modified AMP pages with the SRI-enhanced `<script>` tag to your web server.
    5.  **Browser Integrity Check:** When a browser loads your AMP page, it fetches `v0.js` from the CDN and verifies its integrity against the SRI hash before execution. Mismatched hashes prevent script execution.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised AMP Runtime CDN (High Severity):** An attacker compromises the CDN serving the AMP runtime and injects malicious code. SRI prevents execution of this compromised runtime.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on AMP Runtime Delivery (Medium Severity):** An attacker intercepts the connection and injects malicious code into the AMP runtime during transit. SRI detects this tampering.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised AMP Runtime CDN:** **High Risk Reduction.**  Effectively blocks execution of a malicious AMP runtime, fully mitigating the threat.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on AMP Runtime Delivery:** **Medium Risk Reduction.** Significantly increases difficulty for attackers to inject code undetected during transit.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Yes, implemented in the base AMP template used for all AMP pages.
    *   Implemented in: `base.amp.html` template file.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   N/A - Currently implemented across all AMP pages.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) for Cached AMP Content](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__for_cached_amp_content.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define AMP-Specific CSP Directives:** Create a Content Security Policy (CSP) tailored for AMP pages, considering they are served from the AMP Cache origin. Focus on directives like `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, and crucially `frame-ancestors`.
    2.  **Restrict Script and Style Sources:**  Strictly limit `script-src` and `style-src` to trusted origins, including your domain and necessary AMP CDN origins. Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` where possible in AMP context.
    3.  **Configure `frame-ancestors` for AMP Viewers:**  Utilize `frame-ancestors` to control embedding of your AMP pages, specifically considering AMP viewers. Allow `https://*.ampproject.org` and your domain if embedding is needed, to mitigate clickjacking within AMP viewers.
    4.  **Implement CSP Header for AMP Pages:** Configure your web server to send the CSP header specifically for your AMP page routes.
    5.  **Test and Refine CSP in AMP Context:** Thoroughly test your CSP with AMP pages, both on your origin and when served via the AMP Cache. Use browser developer tools to identify and resolve CSP violations specific to AMP usage.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AMP Pages (High Severity):** CSP significantly reduces XSS risks within AMP pages by controlling script and style sources.
    *   **Clickjacking via AMP Viewers (Medium Severity):** `frame-ancestors` prevents or limits embedding of AMP pages in malicious iframes, especially within AMP viewer contexts.
    *   **Data Injection in AMP Context (Medium Severity):** CSP helps prevent certain data injection attacks by limiting resource sources in AMP pages.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in AMP Pages:** **High Risk Reduction.** A well-configured CSP is highly effective against many XSS forms in AMP pages.
    *   **Clickjacking via AMP Viewers:** **Medium Risk Reduction.** `frame-ancestors` provides strong protection against clickjacking in AMP viewer scenarios.
    *   **Data Injection in AMP Context:** **Medium Risk Reduction.** CSP offers a defense layer against specific data injection vectors within AMP pages.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. A basic CSP exists, but needs stricter directives and AMP-specific refinement, especially `frame-ancestors`.
    *   Implemented in: Web server configuration for AMP page routes.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Refine CSP for AMP pages to be stricter, particularly for `script-src`, `style-src`, and implement `frame-ancestors`.
    *   Regularly review and update the AMP-specific CSP.
