#### 2.3. Impact and Risk Reduction Assessment

The strategy effectively targets the identified threats and provides a reasonable level of risk reduction:

*   **Configuration Errors in AMP Implementation:** **Medium to High Risk Reduction.** Regular audits directly address misconfigurations by systematically reviewing AMP component and extension settings, CSP, and security headers.  The impact is high because misconfigurations can directly lead to vulnerabilities like XSS or data breaches.
*   **Logic Flaws in AMP-Specific Code:** **Medium to High Risk Reduction.** Manual code reviews and penetration testing are designed to uncover logic flaws in custom AMP code and integrations. The risk reduction is high as logic flaws can lead to significant vulnerabilities, depending on the code's functionality.
*   **Unforeseen AMP Vulnerabilities:** **Medium Risk Reduction.** Proactive audits, especially with AMP-aware tools and penetration testing, increase the likelihood of discovering previously unknown AMP-related vulnerabilities before they are exploited. The risk reduction is medium because unforeseen vulnerabilities are inherently unpredictable, but audits provide a mechanism for early detection.

The overall impact of implementing this strategy is **positive and significant** for enhancing the security of the AMP implementation.

#### 2.4. Current Implementation and Missing Elements
