# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ampproject/amphtml

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) for AMP Runtime and Components](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__for_amp_runtime_and_components.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify AMP Runtime and Component URLs:** Locate the `<script>` tags in your AMP HTML that load the AMP runtime (`v0.js`) and any AMP components (e.g., `amp-carousel-0.1.js`). These URLs are typically from CDN providers like `cdn.ampproject.org`.
    2.  **Generate SRI Hashes:** For each of these JavaScript files, generate an SRI hash using tools like `openssl` or `shasum` after downloading the files locally from the CDN URLs.
    3.  **Add `integrity` and `crossorigin` Attributes:** Modify the `<script>` tags in your AMP HTML to include the `integrity` attribute with the generated hash and `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute.
    4.  **Update Hashes on AMP Runtime/Component Updates:** When updating AMP versions, regenerate SRI hashes and update the `integrity` attributes in your HTML.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Compromised AMP Cache Serving Malicious Runtime/Components (High Severity):** Prevents execution of tampered AMP runtime or component files served from a compromised AMP cache, mitigating potential XSS or other attacks.
        *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks Modifying AMP Files (Medium Severity):** Prevents execution of AMP files modified during transit by MITM attacks.

    *   **Impact:**
