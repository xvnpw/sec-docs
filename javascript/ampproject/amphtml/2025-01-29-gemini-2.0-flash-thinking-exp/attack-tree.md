## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application Using AMPHTML (Root Node):](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_using_amphtml__root_node_.md)

*   **Why Critical:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success here means full or significant compromise of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, reputational damage, financial loss, and loss of user trust.
*   **Attack Vectors Summarized:** All subsequent paths in the tree are attack vectors contributing to this goal. The focused sub-tree highlights the most concerning ones: bypassing validation to inject malicious content and exploiting caching mechanisms.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Bypass AMP Validation & Inject Malicious Content:](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__bypass_amp_validation_&_inject_malicious_content.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** AMP validation is a core security feature. Bypassing it undermines AMP's security guarantees and allows attackers to inject arbitrary, potentially malicious, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into AMP pages. This can lead to a wide range of attacks, including XSS, malware distribution, and phishing.
*   **Attack Vectors within this Path:**
    *   **Identify Validation Weakness:** Exploiting flaws in the validator's logic, differences between validator implementations (server-side vs. client-side), or using encoding/obfuscation to circumvent validation.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Payload:** Once validation is bypassed, the attacker can inject various payloads. This node is critical because it represents the point where the malicious action is executed.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] XSS via AMP Components:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how AMP components handle user-provided data (e.g., attributes like `alt` in `amp-img`, iframe sources in `amp-ad`). This is high-risk because AMP components are often considered trusted, and XSS through them can be particularly effective and difficult to detect.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Payload:](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_malicious_payload.md)

*   **Why Critical:** This node represents the culmination of bypassing validation. Successful injection of a malicious payload is the direct action that leads to exploitation.
*   **Attack Vectors within this Node (focused on High-Risk):**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] XSS via AMP Components:** As detailed above, XSS through AMP components is a significant risk due to the perceived trust in these components and the potential for widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit AMP Caching Mechanisms:](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_amp_caching_mechanisms.md)

*   **Why High-Risk:** AMP caching, especially Google AMP Cache, is designed for performance and wide distribution. Exploiting caching mechanisms can lead to large-scale attacks with critical impact because malicious content can be served to a vast number of users from the cache, bypassing origin server defenses and potentially affecting users even if the origin server is secured later.
*   **Attack Vectors within this Path:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Target Google AMP Cache (or other AMP Caches):**  Directly targeting the cache is critical because successful attacks here have amplified impact.
        *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Cache Poisoning:** Serving malicious AMP content to the cache. This is a high-risk attack because once the cache is poisoned, all users accessing the cached version will receive the malicious content until the cache is purged or corrected. The impact can be critical due to the wide reach and potential for serving malicious content from a trusted domain (e.g., `google.com/amp/s/...`).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Target Google AMP Cache (or other AMP Caches):](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__target_google_amp_cache__or_other_amp_caches_.md)

*   **Why Critical:** Google AMP Cache (and other AMP caches) are central points of distribution for AMP content. Compromising these caches has a wide blast radius and can affect a large number of users.
*   **Attack Vectors within this Node (focused on High-Risk):**
    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Cache Poisoning:** As detailed above, cache poisoning is the most critical attack vector against AMP caches due to its potential for widespread and severe impact.
