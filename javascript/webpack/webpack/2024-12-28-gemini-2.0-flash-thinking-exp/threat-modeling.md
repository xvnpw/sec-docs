### High and Critical Webpack Threats

*   **Threat:** Malicious Dependency Inclusion
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency package on a public registry (e.g., npm) and injects malicious code. When developers install or update dependencies, Webpack's module resolution process (`NormalModuleFactory`) includes this compromised code in the bundle. The attacker might aim to steal secrets, inject further malicious scripts into the application, or perform cryptojacking.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application's frontend, potential access to user data or browser resources, and supply chain compromise affecting all users of the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `NormalModuleFactory` (module resolution)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities.
        *   Regularly update dependencies to patch known security flaws.
        *   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
        *   Consider using a private registry for internal packages.
        *   Verify the integrity of dependencies using checksums or signatures.

*   **Threat:** Loader Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts specific input files that exploit a vulnerability within a Webpack loader (e.g., a vulnerability in a CSS or image loader). During the build process, when Webpack's `LoaderRunner` processes these files, the vulnerability is triggered, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the build server or within the generated bundle.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the build environment, injection of malicious code into the final application bundle, or denial of service of the build process.
    *   **Affected Component:** `LoaderRunner` (loader execution)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep loaders updated to their latest versions.
        *   Carefully review the source code and security posture of used loaders, especially community-developed ones.
        *   Implement input validation and sanitization within custom loaders.
        *   Run the build process in a sandboxed environment.

*   **Threat:** Plugin Vulnerability Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability in a Webpack plugin. This could involve crafting specific configuration or input that triggers the vulnerability during the plugin's execution within the Webpack `Compiler` lifecycle. This could lead to arbitrary code execution during the build, manipulation of build artifacts, or information disclosure.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the build environment, injection of malicious code into the final application bundle, exfiltration of sensitive build information, or denial of service of the build process.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Compiler` (plugin execution)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep plugins updated to their latest versions.
        *   Carefully evaluate the security reputation and maintenance of used plugins.
        *   Avoid using plugins from untrusted sources.
        *   Implement security reviews for custom-developed plugins.

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion Attack
    *   **Description:** An attacker publishes a public package with the same name as a private internal package used by the development team. When Webpack's `NormalModuleFactory` attempts to resolve the dependency, it might inadvertently pull the attacker's public package instead of the intended private one, especially if the package manager configuration is not strict. The attacker's package can contain malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Inclusion of malicious code in the application bundle, potentially leading to the same impacts as malicious dependency inclusion.
    *   **Affected Component:** `NormalModuleFactory` (module resolution)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use namespaced packages for private dependencies.
        *   Configure package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm) to prioritize private registries.
        *   Implement strict dependency resolution rules.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Build Environment Leading to Code Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the build environment where Webpack is executed. They can then modify the Webpack configuration, inject malicious loaders or plugins, or directly alter the source code before or during the bundling process. This allows them to inject arbitrary code into the final application bundle.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application, as the attacker can inject any code they desire.
    *   **Affected Component:** Entire Webpack build process
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the build environment with strong access controls and authentication.
        *   Implement regular security audits of the build infrastructure.
        *   Use isolated build agents or containers.
        *   Implement integrity checks for build artifacts.
