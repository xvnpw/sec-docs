### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving Materialize CSS Framework

Here's an updated list of high and critical threats that directly involve the Materialize CSS framework:

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Autocomplete Component
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into data sources used by the Autocomplete component. When the component renders the suggestions containing the malicious script, it will be executed in the user's browser. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, redirect the user, or perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user. This threat directly involves Materialize's JavaScript code for rendering autocomplete suggestions.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the application, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Autocomplete` component, specifically the JavaScript responsible for rendering the suggestion list.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize all user-provided data on the server-side before it is used to populate the autocomplete suggestions.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and mitigate the impact of XSS.
        *   Consider using a templating engine that automatically escapes output by default.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Materialize's JavaScript Components
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist within the JavaScript code of Materialize components (e.g., in event handlers, data processing). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary JavaScript, potentially leading to XSS or other client-side attacks. This threat directly involves vulnerabilities within Materialize's own JavaScript codebase.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, malicious actions performed on behalf of the user.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various JavaScript-driven components like `Dropdown`, `Select`, `Datepicker`, `Timepicker`, `Sidenav`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Materialize updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   Carefully review and test the integration of Materialize components.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential JavaScript vulnerabilities within Materialize's code.
