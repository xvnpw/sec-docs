## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Review and Sanitize User-Generated Content Interacting with Materialize Components](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_review_and_sanitize_user-generated_content_interacting_with_materialize_components.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Materialize Interaction Points:**  Locate all areas where user-generated content is displayed *within Materialize components* (e.g., content in Materialize modals, cards, lists, or styled elements).
2.  **Server-Side Sanitization (Materialize Context):** Implement robust server-side input sanitization using a dedicated HTML sanitization library. Configure it to be aware of HTML structures expected by Materialize components.
3.  **Sanitization Rules for Materialize:** Configure the sanitization library to allow only safe HTML tags and attributes *that are compatible with Materialize's styling and functionality*.  Strictly disallow potentially harmful tags and attributes that could break Materialize layouts or introduce XSS.
4.  **Context-Aware Output Encoding (Materialize Rendering):** Apply context-aware output encoding when rendering user-generated content *within Materialize components*. Ensure encoding is appropriate for the HTML context where Materialize will process the content.
5.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) for Materialize Context:** Implement and enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) header. Configure CSP to further restrict script execution and resource loading, especially in areas where Materialize components render user content.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Materialize Components (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts that are rendered and executed *within the context of Materialize components*, potentially exploiting how Materialize handles HTML. Severity is high as XSS can lead to account takeover, data theft, and malware distribution.

**Impact:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Materialize Components (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities specifically related to user content interacting with Materialize components through robust sanitization and CSP.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially

**Missing Implementation:** Server-side sanitization is implemented on some user input fields, but missing in other areas where content is rendered within Materialize components. CSP is not implemented. Sanitization is not specifically configured with Materialize's HTML structure in mind.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Scrutinize Custom JavaScript Interactions with Materialize Components](./mitigation_strategies/scrutinize_custom_javascript_interactions_with_materialize_components.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Review Materialize-Specific JavaScript:**  Thoroughly review all custom JavaScript code that *directly interacts with Materialize JavaScript components or the DOM elements styled by Materialize*.
2.  **Secure DOM Manipulation with Materialize:** When manipulating DOM elements styled by Materialize using JavaScript, avoid insecure practices like `innerHTML` with unsanitized user input. Sanitize and encode user input before using it to modify Materialize-styled elements.
3.  **Use Materialize JavaScript API Securely:** If extending or customizing Materialize components using their JavaScript API, ensure you are using the API securely and not introducing vulnerabilities through improper usage. Refer to Materialize documentation for secure API usage guidelines.
4.  **Code Reviews for Materialize JavaScript Interactions:** Conduct regular code reviews specifically focused on JavaScript code that interacts with Materialize components, looking for potential DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities or insecure manipulations of Materialize elements.
5.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Materialize JavaScript):** Ensure custom JavaScript interacting with Materialize components operates with the minimum necessary privileges and avoids unnecessary global scope usage that could impact Materialize's functionality or introduce vulnerabilities.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Materialize Context (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities that arise from insecure custom JavaScript code manipulating DOM elements styled or controlled by Materialize, potentially breaking Materialize's intended behavior or introducing exploits. Severity can be high depending on the context and potential impact within the Materialize component.

**Impact:**
*   **DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Materialize Context (High Reduction):**  Significantly reduces DOM-based XSS risks specifically related to Materialize interactions by promoting secure JavaScript coding practices and focused code review.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially

**Missing Implementation:** Code reviews are conducted, but not specifically focused on security aspects of JavaScript interactions *with Materialize components*. Principle of least privilege is not consistently applied in JavaScript modules interacting with Materialize.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Integrity of Materialize Files (if using CDN)](./mitigation_strategies/verify_integrity_of_materialize_files__if_using_cdn_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Choose Reputable Materialize CDN:** If using a CDN, select a reputable and well-known CDN provider specifically for Materialize (e.g., jsDelivr, cdnjs, ensure they reliably serve Materialize).
2.  **Enable Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Materialize:** Generate SRI hashes specifically for the Materialize CSS and JavaScript files you are loading from the CDN.  Use tools or CDN features to obtain accurate SRI hashes for the exact Materialize files being used.
3.  **Implement SRI Attributes in Materialize Includes:** Add the `integrity` attribute to your `<link>` and `<script>` tags when including *Materialize files* from the CDN. Set the value of the `integrity` attribute to the generated SRI hash, prefixed with the algorithm (e.g., `integrity="sha384-HASH_VALUE"`).
4.  **Verify Materialize SRI Implementation:**  Inspect your browser's developer console to ensure there are no SRI errors specifically when loading *Materialize files*. Successful SRI verification confirms the integrity of the Materialize framework files.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Compromised Materialize CDN (Low Probability, High Severity):** Mitigates the unlikely but severe threat of a CDN serving malicious versions of *Materialize files specifically*. Severity is high because a compromised Materialize CDN could affect the application's front-end functionality and potentially introduce malicious code through the framework itself.
*   **MITM Attacks on Materialize Files (Low Probability, Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of MITM attacks injecting malicious code into *Materialize files* during transit, ensuring the integrity of the framework code.

**Impact:**
*   **Compromised Materialize CDN (High Reduction):** SRI effectively prevents the browser from executing compromised *Materialize files* from a CDN, significantly reducing the impact of a CDN compromise specifically targeting Materialize.
*   **MITM Attacks on Materialize Files (Medium Reduction):** SRI provides a good level of protection against MITM attacks attempting to alter *Materialize files* served via CDN.

**Currently Implemented:** No

**Missing Implementation:** SRI is not implemented for Materialize CSS and JavaScript files loaded from CDN.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Be Cautious with Materialize's JavaScript Initialization and Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/be_cautious_with_materialize's_javascript_initialization_and_configuration.md)
