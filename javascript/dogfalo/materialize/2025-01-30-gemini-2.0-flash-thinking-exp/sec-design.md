# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities:
  - Provide a responsive CSS framework based on Material Design principles.
  - Simplify front-end web development for developers.
  - Offer a customizable and easy-to-use UI component library.
- Business goals:
  - Increase adoption and usage of Materialize CSS framework within the web development community.
  - Maintain an active and supportive open-source project.
  - Provide comprehensive documentation and examples to facilitate user adoption.
- Business risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities within the framework could lead to website compromises and damage user trust.
  - Lack of consistent maintenance and updates could result in the framework becoming outdated and less appealing to developers.
  - Poor documentation or lack of community support could hinder adoption and user satisfaction.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Reliance on standard web security practices implemented by developers using the framework in their projects.
  - security control: Publicly accessible source code on GitHub for community review and vulnerability reporting.
- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used in build process.
  - accepted risk: Misuse or insecure implementation of the framework by developers leading to application-level vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the framework's JavaScript components are not properly handled or if developers introduce vulnerabilities when using the framework.
- Recommended security controls:
  - recommended security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used during development and build process.
  - recommended security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the build pipeline to automatically detect potential security flaws in JavaScript code.
  - recommended security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for new features and updates, to identify and mitigate potential security risks.
  - recommended security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using Materialize CSS to minimize common security pitfalls.
- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a CSS framework. Authentication is the responsibility of the web applications built using Materialize CSS.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a CSS framework. Authorization is the responsibility of the web applications built using Materialize CSS.
  - Input validation: Input validation is primarily the responsibility of the web applications using Materialize CSS. The framework itself may include some client-side validation components, but server-side validation is crucial and outside the scope of the framework. Developers using Materialize CSS should implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks.
  - Cryptography: Cryptographic operations are not a core feature of a CSS framework. Web applications built with Materialize CSS should implement necessary cryptography using appropriate libraries and following security best practices.
