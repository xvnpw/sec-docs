# Threat Model Analysis for dogfalo/materialize

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via jQuery vulnerabilities](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_jquery_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via jQuery vulnerabilities.
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities within the version of jQuery bundled with or required by Materialize. This allows them to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application that is executed in a victim's browser. The reliance on jQuery by Materialize's JavaScript components makes this a direct threat.
    *   **Impact:**  An attacker can steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the application, or perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user, gaining unauthorized access and potentially compromising sensitive data.
    *   **Affected Component:** JavaScript Components (reliant on jQuery).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Immediately update Materialize to the latest version, ensuring it includes the most recent and secure version of jQuery.
        *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.
        *   While not directly a Materialize fix, robust server-side input validation remains crucial to prevent the initial injection of malicious scripts.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Materialize JavaScript components leading to unintended actions with significant impact](./threats/manipulation_of_materialize_javascript_components_leading_to_unintended_actions_with_significant_imp_d6115c17.md)

*   **Threat:** Manipulation of Materialize JavaScript components leading to unintended actions with significant impact.
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input or manipulates the state of specific Materialize JavaScript components (e.g., programmatically opening a modal with misleading content leading to credential theft, bypassing client-side validation on a critical form element). This leverages the specific functionality and behavior of Materialize's components.
    *   **Impact:** This can lead to unauthorized actions with significant consequences, such as bypassing security checks leading to data breaches, tricking users into performing unintended sensitive actions, or gaining unauthorized access to functionalities.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific JavaScript Components (e.g., Modals, Forms interactions).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and secure the application logic associated with Materialize components, ensuring that manipulating their state cannot lead to security vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust server-side authorization and validation for all critical actions triggered by or involving Materialize components.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side validation provided by Materialize; always implement server-side checks.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via compromised Materialize library](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_materialize_library.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack via compromised Materialize library.
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official Materialize repository, the CDN hosting the library, or the download source, injecting malicious code directly into the framework files. This directly affects any application using the compromised version of Materialize.
    *   **Impact:**  This is a critical threat, as the malicious code embedded within Materialize could have widespread access to the application's functionality and user data, potentially leading to complete compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Entire Materialize Library (CSS and JavaScript).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize reputable CDNs for Materialize and implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) to verify the integrity of the downloaded files, ensuring they haven't been tampered with.
        *   If hosting Materialize files directly, rigorously verify the integrity of the downloaded files and implement monitoring for any unauthorized changes to these files.
        *   Stay informed about any security advisories or reported compromises related to the Materialize library.
