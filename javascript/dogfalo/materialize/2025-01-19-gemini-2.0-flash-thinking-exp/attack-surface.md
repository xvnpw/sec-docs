# Attack Surface Analysis for dogfalo/materialize

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via DOM Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_dom_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into a web application, which are then executed by the victim's browser.
    *   **How Materialize Contributes:** Materialize's JavaScript components often dynamically manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM) based on user interactions or data. If the application doesn't properly sanitize user-provided data before using it to interact with Materialize components (e.g., setting content in modals, tooltips, dropdowns, or dynamically generated elements), it can create an opportunity for XSS.
    *   **Example:** An application uses Materialize's `Tooltip` component and sets the tooltip text directly from user input without sanitization: `$('.tooltipped').attr('data-tooltip', userInput);`. If `userInput` contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, the script will execute when the tooltip is displayed.
    *   **Impact:**  Account compromise, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, installation of malware, defacement of the website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust server-side and client-side input validation and sanitization.
        *   Use appropriate encoding techniques (e.g., HTML escaping) when displaying user-provided data within Materialize components.
        *   Avoid directly injecting unsanitized user input into DOM manipulation functions used by Materialize.
        *   Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Logic Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/client-side_logic_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate client-side code or browser behavior to bypass security controls or alter the intended functionality of the application.
    *   **How Materialize Contributes:** If the application relies solely on Materialize's client-side JavaScript for security-sensitive actions (e.g., form validation before submission, controlling access to certain UI elements), it can be bypassed by disabling JavaScript or manipulating the client-side code. Materialize's interactive components might have logic that, if not backed by server-side checks, can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** An application uses Materialize's form validation to check if required fields are filled before enabling a submit button. An attacker could bypass this by directly manipulating the DOM to enable the button or by submitting the form data directly without interacting with the Materialize validation.
    *   **Impact:**  Bypassing security checks, unauthorized access to features, data manipulation, submission of invalid data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never rely solely on client-side validation for security.** Always implement robust server-side validation and authorization checks.
        *   Treat client-side logic as a user interface enhancement, not a security mechanism.
        *   Secure sensitive actions with server-side controls that cannot be bypassed by client-side manipulation.
