# Threat Model Analysis for dogfalo/materialize

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unsanitized Input in Materialize Modals](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_unsanitized_input_in_materialize_modals.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a part of the application that is later displayed within a Materialize modal without proper sanitization. When the modal is opened, this script will execute in the user's browser. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform actions on behalf of the user. This directly involves how Materialize handles and renders content within its modal component.
    *   **Impact:** User account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected Materialize Component:** `Modal` module, specifically the methods or logic used to populate the modal's content (e.g., setting the modal's HTML).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize user-provided input before displaying it within a Materialize modal. Use appropriate encoding functions for HTML output.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed.
        *   Avoid directly setting the HTML content of the modal with user-provided data. If necessary, use templating engines with auto-escaping features.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised CDN Serving Materialize Assets](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_cdn_serving_materialize_assets.md)

*   **Description:** If Materialize assets are loaded from a compromised Content Delivery Network (CDN), an attacker could inject malicious code into the Materialize files served to users. This directly impacts the integrity of the Materialize library being used, allowing them to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the application.
    *   **Impact:** User account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected Materialize Component:** All components, as the core CSS and JavaScript files of Materialize could be compromised.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes to verify the integrity of Materialize files loaded from CDNs.
        *   Consider self-hosting Materialize assets to have more control over their integrity.
        *   If using a CDN, choose reputable providers with strong security practices.
