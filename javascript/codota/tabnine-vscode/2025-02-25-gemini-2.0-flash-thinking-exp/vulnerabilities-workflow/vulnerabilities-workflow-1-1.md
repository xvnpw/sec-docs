### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attack via using `master` branch for GitHub Actions
- Description:
    1. A threat actor gains control of one of the GitHub Action repositories used in the workflows (e.g., `dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset`, `codota/replace-action`, etc.) on the `master` branch.
    2. The attacker modifies the action code on the `master` branch to inject malicious code.
    3. When the Tabnine project's workflow (e.g., `tag-ovsx.yml`, `alpha_release.yml`, `tag.yml`, `continues_integration.yml`, `package-enterprise.yml`) runs, it uses the compromised action from the `master` branch.
    4. The malicious code injected by the attacker is executed as part of the build process, potentially injecting malware into the Tabnine VS Code extension.
    5. The compromised Tabnine VS Code extension is then packaged and potentially released to users through the marketplace.
    6. Users install the compromised extension, and the malicious code is executed on their machines.
- Impact: Critical. If successful, this could lead to a widespread supply chain attack. Millions of developers using the Tabnine extension could be compromised. The attacker could gain access to developer machines, steal code, credentials, or perform other malicious activities.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently implemented mitigations: None explicitly mentioned in the provided files to mitigate supply chain attacks related to GitHub Actions. The `dependabot.yml` helps keep dependencies updated, but it doesn't address the risk of using actions from `master`.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Pinning GitHub Actions to specific tags or commit SHAs instead of using `master` branch. This ensures that the workflows use a specific, known version of the action and are not affected by unintended or malicious changes on the `master` branch.
    - Regularly auditing used GitHub Actions and their dependencies.
    - Using tools like GitHub's Dependency Review to check for known vulnerabilities in action dependencies.
    - Consider using in-house actions or forking and vendoring critical actions to have more control over the supply chain.
- Preconditions: A threat actor needs to be able to compromise one of the external GitHub Action repositories used in the workflows, specifically the `master` branch.
- Source code analysis:
    - In multiple workflow files (`tag-ovsx.yml`, `alpha_release.yml`, `tag.yml`, `continues_integration.yml`, `package-enterprise.yml`), actions are used without specifying a version, which defaults to the `master` branch. For example, in `/code/.github/workflows/tag-ovsx.yml`:
        ```yaml
        uses: dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset@master
        uses: codota/replace-action@v2
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        ```
    - This pattern is repeated across multiple workflows and for different actions like `actions/setup-node@v3`, `actions/create-release@v1`, `actions/upload-release-asset@v1`, `rtCamp/action-slack-notify@v2`, `martinbeentjes/npm-get-version-action@master`, `codota/github-action-get-latest-release@master`, `codota/github-commit-timestamp-tagger@master`, `codota/visual-regression@master`, `codota/wait-action@master`, `google-github-actions/auth@v1`, `google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v1`, `codota/delete-tag-and-release@master`, `codota/vsix-name-modifier`, `usehaystack/jira-pr-link-action@v4`.
- Security test case:
    1. **(This test is for demonstration and should be performed in a controlled environment, NOT on the production pipeline).**
    2. Fork the `dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset` GitHub repository.
    3. Modify the `master` branch of your forked `fetch-gh-release-asset` action to include malicious code (e.g., add a step to `run: echo "Vulnerable Action"`).
    4. In one of the Tabnine workflow files (e.g., `/code/.github/workflows/continues_integration.yml`), temporarily change `uses: dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset@master` to `uses: <your-github-username>/fetch-gh-release-asset@master`. Replace `<your-github-username>` with your GitHub username.
    5. Trigger the workflow (e.g., by pushing a commit to a branch).
    6. Go to the Actions tab in your repository, select the triggered workflow, and check the logs for the step using the modified action. If you see "Vulnerable Action" in the logs, it confirms that your modified action was executed, demonstrating the vulnerability.
    7. **Important: After testing, immediately revert the changes in the workflow file to use the original action and delete or make private your forked action repository to prevent accidental usage.**
