- **Vulnerability Name:** Unpinned GitHub Actions Leading to Supply Chain Compromise  
  **Description:**  
  Several workflows reference third‑party GitHub Actions using floating branch names (for example, using `@master` or unpinned versions) instead of fixed commit SHAs. An attacker who is able to compromise the upstream repository or inject malicious commits into these branches can force arbitrary code execution in the CI/CD pipelines. For instance, workflows in files such as `/code/.github/workflows/alpha_release.yml`, `/code/.github/workflows/tag-ovsx.yml`, `/code/.github/workflows/tag.yml`, and `/code/.github/workflows/bump_version.yml` all invoke actions like `dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset@master` and `martinbeentjes/npm-get-version-action@master`. Because these references are not pinned to a known good commit, a malicious change in one of those repositories could be pulled into the build process without notice.  
  **Impact:**  
  - An attacker could inject, execute, and persist arbitrary code in the CI/CD environment.  
  - A compromised pipeline could alter release artifacts, embed malicious payloads into published extensions, or cause leakage of internal secrets.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - Some core actions (e.g., `actions/checkout@v2` and `actions/setup-node@v3`) are versioned; however, multiple custom or third‑party actions are referenced using branch names rather than fixed commit hashes.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no pinning of third‑party actions (such as those maintained by dsaltares, codota, or martinbeentjes) to fixed commit SHAs.  
  - There is no automated dependency scanning or alerting mechanism to monitor changes in these remote actions.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The CI/CD jobs have network access to fetch these GitHub Actions codebases.  
  - An attacker must be able to influence or compromise one of the floating branches (e.g., via an upstream compromise or injected commit into a branch like master) of a referenced action’s repository.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In `/code/.github/workflows/alpha_release.yml`, the step using  
    ```
    uses: dsaltares/fetch-gh-release-asset@master
    ```  
    always pulls the latest code from the master branch. Any malicious update committed there would immediately affect the build.  
  - Multiple workflows (see `/code/.github/workflows/tag-ovsx.yml`, `/code/.github/workflows/tag.yml`, `/code/.github/workflows/bump_version.yml`) call actions such as  
    ```
    uses: martinbeentjes/npm-get-version-action@master
    ```  
    and  
    ```
    uses: codota/github-commit-timestamp-tagger@master
    ```  
    without pinning to a known commit. This leaves them vulnerable to supply chain compromises.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - *Step 1:* Review all workflow files and list each external GitHub Action that is referenced with a floating branch (e.g., `@master`).  
  - *Step 2:* In a controlled test environment (or using a test repository), simulate a malicious update to one of these actions by pointing the reference to a commit containing a benign “malicious” marker (for testing purposes only).  
  - *Step 3:* Trigger the affected workflow (e.g., by pushing a commit) and monitor the logs and resulting build artifacts for execution of the marker code.  
  - *Step 4:* Verify that the test action’s malicious behavior is detected in the CI/CD output, proving that an attacker could force arbitrary code execution.  
  - *Step 5:* Document the findings and recommend pinning the actions to fixed, trusted commit SHAs to close this avenue for attack.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Secrets Handling in Workflow “tmp.yml”  
  **Description:**  
  In the workflow defined in `/code/.github/workflows/tmp.yml`, several sensitive secrets (such as `GCS_RELEASE_KEY`, `INSTRUMENTATION_KEY`, `MODIFIER_PAT`, `OVSX_PAT`, `SLACK_RELEASES_CHANNEL_WEBHOOK_URL`, `SLACK_VALIDATE_MARKETPLACE_WEBHOOK`, and `VSCE_PAT`) are written in cleartext to a file (`vscode-vars`) via successive `echo` commands. This file is then uploaded to a Google Cloud Storage bucket (“tabnine”) using the action `google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v1` without any encryption. If the destination bucket is misconfigured (for example, if it allows public read or list access), an external attacker could retrieve the file and compromise these sensitive credentials.  
  **Impact:**  
  - Leakage of critical secrets used to authenticate with Google Cloud, the Open VSX service, Slack, and other systems.  
  - An attacker could misuse these secrets to access cloud resources, manipulate release artifacts, or disrupt the integrity of the deployment and update pipeline.  
  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical  
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The workflow uses the official Google Cloud Storage upload action with credentials passed as secrets, which limits exposure during transmission; however, the file being uploaded is in plain text and there is no verification of the destination bucket’s access control settings.  
  **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - There is no encryption or obfuscation of sensitive data before writing it to disk and uploading it.  
  - No explicit check is performed to enforce that the target bucket (“tabnine”) is secured against public or unauthorized access.  
  **Preconditions:**  
  - The workflow must be triggered (via workflow_dispatch) so that the file is created and uploaded.  
  - The target Google Cloud Storage bucket must be misconfigured (e.g., allow public read or listing) or exposed through other misconfigurations.  
  **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - The workflow file `/code/.github/workflows/tmp.yml` contains the following commands:  
    ```
    echo ${{ secrets.GCS_RELEASE_KEY }} > vscode-vars
    echo ${{ secrets.INSTRUMENTATION_KEY }} >> vscode-vars
    echo ${{ secrets.MODIFIER_PAT }} >> vscode-vars
    echo ${{ secrets.OVSX_PAT }} >> vscode-vars
    echo ${{ secrets.SLACK_RELEASES_CHANNEL_WEBHOOK_URL }} >> vscode-vars
    echo ${{ secrets.SLACK_VALIDATE_MARKETPLACE_WEBHOOK }} >> vscode-vars
    echo ${{ secrets.VSCE_PAT }} >> vscode-vars
    ```  
    These commands write multiple critical secrets to the file `vscode-vars` in plain text.  
  - Immediately after, the file is uploaded:  
    ```
    - name: ⬆️ Upload latest stable version to GCS
      uses: google-github-actions/upload-cloud-storage@v1
      with:
        path: vscode-vars
        destination: tabnine
        parent: false
        gzip: false
        headers: |-
          content-type: text/plain
    ```  
    Because there is no encryption applied to the file and no safeguards ensuring that the “tabnine” bucket is private, an attacker with any ability to view the bucket’s contents (due to misconfiguration) could retrieve and abuse these secrets.  
  **Security Test Case:**  
  - *Step 1:* Review the bucket “tabnine” configuration in Google Cloud Storage to determine whether it is publicly accessible or if listing/reading is allowed without proper authentication.  
  - *Step 2:* From an external network environment (simulating an unauthenticated attacker), attempt to list the contents of the bucket using the Google Cloud Storage API or web console.  
  - *Step 3:* If the bucket is publicly listable, attempt to retrieve the file `vscode-vars` and inspect its contents.  
  - *Step 4:* Verify that sensitive secret values are exposed.  
  - *Step 5:* Based on the test results, report the finding and recommend that the workflow be updated to either encrypt the file before upload or ensure the bucket’s strict access controls (or both) to prevent unauthorized access.
