## Vulnerability List:

- **Vulnerability Name:** No High-Rank Vulnerabilities Identified in Provided Files
- **Description:** Based on the analysis of the currently provided files (documentation, changelogs, configuration guides, build scripts, CI/CD workflow definitions), no high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance of the application have been identified that meet the specified inclusion criteria.  This assessment is limited to the provided files, which do not include source code. Therefore, vulnerabilities that might exist within the application's codebase or third-party library usage (such as `tree-kill`) cannot be assessed at this stage. Further analysis, particularly of the project's source code, is required to provide a comprehensive vulnerability assessment.
- **Impact:** N/A
- **Vulnerability Rank:** N/A
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** N/A
- **Missing Mitigations:** N/A
- **Preconditions:** N/A
- **Source Code Analysis:** No source code was provided for analysis. Therefore, a detailed source code analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities cannot be performed at this time.
- **Security Test Case:**  No security test case can be defined as no high-rank vulnerability has been identified within the scope of the currently provided files. Security testing will be conducted once source code is available and potential vulnerabilities are identified through code analysis.
