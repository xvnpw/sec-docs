- Arbitrary Code Execution in `tree-kill`

### Vulnerability Details:

#### Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution in `tree-kill`
- Description:
    - The `tree-kill` npm library, in versions 1.2.1 and earlier, was vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to insufficient sanitization of the `pid` (process ID) parameter.
    - An attacker capable of influencing the `pid` parameter could inject malicious commands, leading to arbitrary code execution on the system where the `tree-kill` library is used.
    - The vulnerability was addressed in `tree-kill` version 1.2.2 by sanitizing the `pid` parameter.
    - To trigger this vulnerability in a vulnerable application:
        1. An external attacker would need to find an endpoint or functionality in the publicly available VS Code Go extension that indirectly uses the `tree-kill` library.
        2. The attacker needs to identify a way to control or influence the `pid` parameter that is eventually passed to the `tree-kill` function through this endpoint. This might involve manipulating input parameters to the extension, exploiting configuration settings, or finding an injection point in the extension's API.
        3. Once a controllable path to the `pid` parameter is identified, the attacker crafts a malicious `pid` string. This string would contain shell commands injected to be executed when `tree-kill` processes the `pid`. Shell command injection techniques (like using backticks, `$()`, etc.) would be used depending on how the OS command is constructed within the vulnerable code path.
        4. The attacker sends a request to the identified endpoint, including the crafted malicious `pid` string.
        5. If the VS Code Go extension does not properly sanitize or validate the `pid` before passing it to the (potentially vulnerable version of) `tree-kill`, and if `tree-kill` version is indeed vulnerable (older than 1.2.2), the injected commands will be executed by the system shell.

- Impact:
    - Critical. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an external attacker to execute arbitrary code on the machine running the VS Code Go extension. From a publicly available instance perspective, this means an attacker could potentially compromise developer machines if they interact with a malicious project or trigger the vulnerable functionality through the extension's exposed interfaces. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft including source code and credentials, malware installation, or other malicious activities.

- Vulnerability Rank: Critical

- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - The project has vendored the `tree-kill` library version 1.2.2, as indicated in `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/README.md`: "vendored 1.2.2 with a fix for https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/90".
    - Version 1.2.2 of `tree-kill` includes a security fix that sanitizes the `pid` parameter, mitigating the arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the dependency itself.
    - **It is assumed that by vendoring version 1.2.2, the vulnerability is mitigated. However, this needs to be verified by analyzing how `tree-kill` is used within the VS Code Go extension.**

- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Verification of Mitigation:**  The primary missing mitigation is the *verification* that vendoring `tree-kill` 1.2.2 effectively mitigates the vulnerability in the context of the VS Code Go extension.  Source code analysis is needed to confirm:
        - That the vendored version is actually used in all code paths that previously used `tree-kill`.
        - That there are no coding errors in the VS Code Go extension that could bypass the sanitization in `tree-kill` 1.2.2 or introduce new vulnerabilities related to process handling.
        - That no other vulnerable versions of `tree-kill` are inadvertently included or used in the extension.
    - **Input Sanitization in VS Code Go Extension:** While `tree-kill` 1.2.2 sanitizes the `pid`, it's good practice for the VS Code Go extension itself to also sanitize or validate any external input that could influence the `pid` parameter *before* passing it to `tree-kill`. This adds a layer of defense in depth.

- Preconditions:
    - **Publicly Accessible Instance:** The VS Code Go extension must be running and accessible in some way that allows an external attacker to interact with it, even indirectly. This could be through interaction with a project opened in VS Code that uses the Go extension, or through some exposed API of the extension itself (if any).
    - **Vulnerable Code Path Exploitation:** The attacker needs to identify and successfully exploit a code path within the VS Code Go extension that:
        - Uses the `tree-kill` library.
        - Allows external influence over the `pid` parameter passed to `tree-kill`.
    - **Potentially Vulnerable Usage:** Even with `tree-kill` 1.2.2, if the VS Code Go extension constructs the command executed by `tree-kill` in a way that is still vulnerable to injection (e.g., by concatenating unsanitized input with the `pid` in a shell command string), the vulnerability could still be exploitable. This is less likely with `tree-kill` 1.2.2's sanitization, but still a potential precondition if the usage is flawed.

- Source Code Analysis:
    - To confirm or deny the mitigation and understand the vulnerable code path (if any still exists), the following source code analysis steps are required within the VS Code Go extension codebase:
        1. **Identify `tree-kill` Usage:** Search the entire codebase for instances where `tree-kill` is imported or required (`require('tree-kill')`) and where the `kill()` function from `tree-kill` is called.
        2. **Trace `pid` Parameter Source:** For each `tree-kill` usage, trace back the origin of the `pid` parameter. Determine how this `pid` value is obtained and if it originates from any external input sources (user configuration, API calls, data from opened projects, etc.).
        3. **Examine Input Sanitization/Validation:** Analyze if the VS Code Go extension performs any sanitization or validation on the `pid` parameter *before* passing it to `tree-kill`. Look for any functions or logic that might be intended to prevent command injection or ensure the `pid` is safe.
        4. **Verify Vendored Version Usage:** Confirm that the code paths are indeed using the vendored `tree-kill` library located in `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/` and that the version is 1.2.2 or later. Check `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and the actual code in the vendored directory.
        5. **Command Construction Analysis:**  If `tree-kill` is used to kill processes based on external input, carefully examine how the command string is constructed internally within `tree-kill` (even though version 1.2.2 is supposed to be fixed).  Understand if the surrounding code in the VS Code Go extension introduces new ways to inject commands even with the sanitized `pid`.

    - **Visualization (Conceptual):**

    ```
    [External Input (e.g., API Request, Project Config)] --> [VS Code Go Extension Code] --> PID Parameter --> [tree-kill Function Call] --> [OS Command Execution (potentially vulnerable if unsanitized PID and vulnerable tree-kill version)]
    ```

    - The goal of source code analysis is to understand the flow from external input to the `tree-kill` call and identify if there are any weaknesses in sanitization or version usage along this path.

- Security Test Case:
    - **Prerequisites:**
        - Set up a development environment for the VS Code Go extension or a test instance that mimics a publicly available setup as closely as possible.
        - Identify (through source code analysis - step above is crucial) a specific API endpoint or functionality in the VS Code Go extension that uses `tree-kill` and where the `pid` parameter *might* be controllable.
    - **Test Steps:**
        1. **Craft Malicious PID Payload:**  Based on the identified code path and how the `pid` is used, craft a malicious `pid` payload designed to execute a harmless but detectable command (e.g., `touch /tmp/pwned`).  Experiment with different shell injection techniques like backticks, `$()`, etc., as needed. Example payload:  "`1234 & touch /tmp/pwned &`" (assuming `tree-kill` uses something like `kill -9 <pid>`).
        2. **Trigger Vulnerable Functionality:** Send a request to the identified API endpoint or trigger the functionality in the VS Code Go extension in a way that incorporates the malicious `pid` payload. This will depend entirely on the specific vulnerable code path found in the source code analysis.
        3. **Monitor for Code Execution:** After triggering the functionality, check for evidence of command execution on the system where the VS Code Go extension is running. In our example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created. Monitor system logs for any unusual activity, process creation, or errors related to command execution.
        4. **Verify Mitigation (If No Code Execution):** If the test payload does not result in code execution:
            - Double-check the crafted payload and the test steps.
            - Review the source code again to ensure the correct vulnerable path is being targeted and that the payload is appropriate for the context.
            - If still no execution, it is likely that the vendored `tree-kill` 1.2.2 mitigation is effective *for the code path tested*. However, this does not guarantee complete mitigation across the entire extension. Further testing of other potential code paths would be needed.
        5. **Report Findings:** Document the test steps, payloads used, and the results (successful code execution or not). If code execution is achieved, the vulnerability is confirmed. If not, document the test as a mitigation verification for the specific code path tested, but emphasize the need for further analysis and testing to ensure complete mitigation.
