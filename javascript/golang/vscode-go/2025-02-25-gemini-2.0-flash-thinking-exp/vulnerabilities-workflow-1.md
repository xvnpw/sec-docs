## Combined Vulnerability List

### Unvetted Vendored Third-Party Dependencies in the “third_party” Directory / Arbitrary Code Execution in `tree-kill`

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unvetted Vendored Third-Party Dependencies in the “third_party” Directory / Arbitrary Code Execution in `tree-kill`

- **Description:**
    The project vendors several third-party dependencies under the `extension/third_party` folder (for example, the vendored copy of “tree-kill”). The README in this directory explicitly notes that vendoring of platform-dependent modules “has not been tested yet.” In practical terms, this means that while one dependency (e.g. tree-kill) shows evidence of being patched (its changelog even documents a security fix for sanitizing the `pid` parameter), other vendored modules (including several node libraries) may not have been fully security-reviewed or routinely updated. An external attacker who is able to supply specially crafted input to functions in these modules—or influence their configuration via the extension’s public interfaces—could trigger unexpected behavior such as arbitrary code execution or other unintended actions if an underlying vulnerability is exploited.

    Specifically, the `tree-kill` npm library, in versions 1.2.1 and earlier, was vulnerable to arbitrary code execution due to insufficient sanitization of the `pid` (process ID) parameter. An attacker capable of influencing the `pid` parameter could inject malicious commands, leading to arbitrary code execution on the system where the `tree-kill` library is used. The vulnerability was addressed in `tree-kill` version 1.2.2 by sanitizing the `pid` parameter.

    To trigger this vulnerability in a vulnerable application:
        1. An external attacker would need to find an endpoint or functionality in the publicly available VS Code Go extension that indirectly uses the `tree-kill` library.
        2. The attacker needs to identify a way to control or influence the `pid` parameter that is eventually passed to the `tree-kill` function through this endpoint. This might involve manipulating input parameters to the extension, exploiting configuration settings, or finding an injection point in the extension's API.
        3. Once a controllable path to the `pid` parameter is identified, the attacker crafts a malicious `pid` string. This string would contain shell commands injected to be executed when `tree-kill` processes the `pid`. Shell command injection techniques (like using backticks, `$()`, etc.) would be used depending on how the OS command is constructed within the vulnerable code path.
        4. The attacker sends a request to the identified endpoint, including the crafted malicious `pid` string.
        5. If the VS Code Go extension does not properly sanitize or validate the `pid` before passing it to the (potentially vulnerable version of) `tree-kill`, and if `tree-kill` version is indeed vulnerable (older than 1.2.2), the injected commands will be executed by the system shell.

- **Impact:**
    Exploitation of a vulnerability in one of the unvetted modules could result in remote or local arbitrary code execution within the context of the extension. Given that the extension may launch or attach to Go debugging sessions on the end user’s machine, successful exploitation might lead to privilege escalation, leakage of sensitive data, or further attacks on the host system.

    Successful exploitation of the `tree-kill` vulnerability allows an external attacker to execute arbitrary code on the machine running the VS Code Go extension. From a publicly available instance perspective, this means an attacker could potentially compromise developer machines if they interact with a malicious project or trigger the vulnerable functionality through the extension's exposed interfaces. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft including source code and credentials, malware installation, or other malicious activities.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High / Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability in vendored dependency, `tree-kill` ACE is Critical)

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - At least one vendored module (“tree-kill”) is known to be at a patched version (v1.2.2) that sanitizes inputs.
    - Vendoring is used to “lock-in” dependency versions for reproducibility.
    - The project has vendored the `tree-kill` library version 1.2.2, as indicated in `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/README.md`: "vendored 1.2.2 with a fix for https://github.com/golang/vscode-go/issues/90".
    - Version 1.2.2 of `tree-kill` includes a security fix that sanitizes the `pid` parameter, mitigating the arbitrary code execution vulnerability in the dependency itself.
    - **It is assumed that by vendoring version 1.2.2, the vulnerability is mitigated. However, this needs to be verified by analyzing how `tree-kill` is used within the VS Code Go extension.**

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No evidence of automated dependency scanning or routine security audits for all vendored modules.
    - No sandboxing or runtime integrity checking is performed on code loaded from the `third_party` directory.
    - Reliance on informally documented information (“not tested yet” in the README) rather than enforced security review processes.
    - **Verification of Mitigation:**  The primary missing mitigation is the *verification* that vendoring `tree-kill` 1.2.2 effectively mitigates the vulnerability in the context of the VS Code Go extension.  Source code analysis is needed to confirm:
        - That the vendored version is actually used in all code paths that previously used `tree-kill`.
        - That there are no coding errors in the VS Code Go extension that could bypass the sanitization in `tree-kill` 1.2.2 or introduce new vulnerabilities related to process handling.
        - That no other vulnerable versions of `tree-kill` are inadvertently included or used in the extension.
    - **Input Sanitization in VS Code Go Extension:** While `tree-kill` 1.2.2 sanitizes the `pid`, it's good practice for the VS Code Go extension itself to also sanitize or validate any external input that could influence the `pid` parameter *before* passing it to `tree-kill`. This adds a layer of defense in depth.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The extension must be running and loading third-party code (for example, in modes that invoke functions of platform-dependent modules).
    - An attacker must be able to supply or influence input to one or more functions exported by a vendored dependency.
    - **Publicly Accessible Instance:** The VS Code Go extension must be running and accessible in some way that allows an external attacker to interact with it, even indirectly. This could be through interaction with a project opened in VS Code that uses the Go extension, or through some exposed API of the extension itself (if any).
    - **Vulnerable Code Path Exploitation:** The attacker needs to identify and successfully exploit a code path within the VS Code Go extension that:
        - Uses the `tree-kill` library.
        - Allows external influence over the `pid` parameter passed to `tree-kill`.
    - **Potentially Vulnerable Usage:** Even with `tree-kill` 1.2.2, if the VS Code Go extension constructs the command executed by `tree-kill` in a way that is still vulnerable to injection (e.g., by concatenating unsanitized input with the `pid` in a shell command string), the vulnerability could still be exploitable. This is less likely with `tree-kill` 1.2.2's sanitization, but still a potential precondition if the usage is flawed.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `/code/extension/third_party/README.md`, the README explains that code is vendored locally and notes that “platform-dependent modules” have not been thoroughly security-validated.
    2. In `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/README.md`, the vendored “tree-kill” module documents that it was imported at version 1.2.2—which includes a patch for sanitizing the `pid` parameter.
    3. Other vendored modules in the same directory lack similar documentation or evidence of patches, leaving open the possibility that vulnerabilities remain unaddressed in those modules.

    To confirm or deny the mitigation for `tree-kill` and understand the vulnerable code path (if any still exists), the following source code analysis steps are required within the VS Code Go extension codebase:
        1. **Identify `tree-kill` Usage:** Search the entire codebase for instances where `tree-kill` is imported or required (`require('tree-kill')`) and where the `kill()` function from `tree-kill` is called.
        2. **Trace `pid` Parameter Source:** For each `tree-kill` usage, trace back the origin of the `pid` parameter. Determine how this `pid` value is obtained and if it originates from any external input sources (user configuration, API calls, data from opened projects, etc.).
        3. **Examine Input Sanitization/Validation:** Analyze if the VS Code Go extension performs any sanitization or validation on the `pid` parameter *before* passing it to `tree-kill`. Look for any functions or logic that might be intended to prevent command injection or ensure the `pid` is safe.
        4. **Verify Vendored Version Usage:** Confirm that the code paths are indeed using the vendored `tree-kill` library located in `/code/extension/third_party/tree-kill/` and that the version is 1.2.2 or later. Check `package.json`, `package-lock.json` and the actual code in the vendored directory.
        5. **Command Construction Analysis:**  If `tree-kill` is used to kill processes based on external input, carefully examine how the command string is constructed internally within `tree-kill` (even though version 1.2.2 is supposed to be fixed).  Understand if the surrounding code in the VS Code Go extension introduces new ways to inject commands even with the sanitized `pid`.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Identify an exported function (for example, one that terminates process trees) from one of the vendored modules.
    2. Write a test script that loads this module in isolation and supplies carefully crafted input (e.g., overlong strings, special characters, payloads that test for input sanitization).
    3. Execute the script in an environment that mimics how the extension calls the function.
    4. Observe whether the module properly sanitizes the input or if unexpected behavior (such as abnormal process termination or buffer issues) occurs.
    5. Try injecting data or special sequences to see if the module chokes, misbehaves, or exposes additional debugging output.
    6. Document any behavior that suggests the underlying dependency could be exploited.

    For the specific `tree-kill` vulnerability:
    - **Prerequisites:**
        - Set up a development environment for the VS Code Go extension or a test instance that mimics a publicly available setup as closely as possible.
        - Identify (through source code analysis) a specific API endpoint or functionality in the VS Code Go extension that uses `tree-kill` and where the `pid` parameter *might* be controllable.
    - **Test Steps:**
        1. **Craft Malicious PID Payload:**  Based on the identified code path and how the `pid` is used, craft a malicious `pid` payload designed to execute a harmless but detectable command (e.g., `touch /tmp/pwned`).  Experiment with different shell injection techniques like backticks, `$()`, etc., as needed. Example payload:  "`1234 & touch /tmp/pwned &`" (assuming `tree-kill` uses something like `kill -9 <pid>`).
        2. **Trigger Vulnerable Functionality:** Send a request to the identified API endpoint or trigger the functionality in the VS Code Go extension in a way that incorporates the malicious `pid` payload. This will depend entirely on the specific vulnerable code path found in the source code analysis.
        3. **Monitor for Code Execution:** After triggering the functionality, check for evidence of command execution on the system where the VS Code Go extension is running. In our example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created. Monitor system logs for any unusual activity, process creation, or errors related to command execution.
        4. **Verify Mitigation (If No Code Execution):** If the test payload does not result in code execution:
            - Double-check the crafted payload and the test steps.
            - Review the source code again to ensure the correct vulnerable path is being targeted and that the payload is appropriate for the context.
            - If still no execution, it is likely that the vendored `tree-kill` 1.2.2 mitigation is effective *for the code path tested*. However, this does not guarantee complete mitigation across the entire extension. Further testing of other potential code paths would be needed.
        5. **Report Findings:** Document the test steps, payloads used, and the results (successful code execution or not). If code execution is achieved, the vulnerability is confirmed. If not, document the test as a mitigation verification for the specific code path tested, but emphasize the need for further analysis and testing to ensure complete mitigation.

### Insecure Exposure of the Legacy Debug Adapter’s Port (Remote Debugging)

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Exposure of the Legacy Debug Adapter’s Port (Remote Debugging)
- **Description:**
    In legacy debugging mode the extension spawns a separate node-based debug adapter. When configured to run in headless or remote modes, the debug adapter listens on a user-specified network port (e.g. port 2345) without incorporating any built-in authentication, access control, or encryption. If an attacker on the local network—or an untrusted user on the same system—can connect to this exposed port, they might be able to manipulate the debugging session. This could include pausing execution, inspecting the debugee’s state (such as variable values, stack traces, and configuration data), or even injecting arbitrary commands.
- **Impact:**
    An attacker who successfully connects to the debug adapter’s port could gain full control over an active debug session. Such control might lead to remote arbitrary code execution in the debugged process, disclosure of sensitive information, and disruption of the debugging session or underlying application execution.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The documentation recommends that users configure the debug adapter to listen only on `localhost` (e.g. using host `"127.0.0.1"`).
    - The extension’s normal (non-remote) debugging configurations do not expose network ports.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No built-in authentication, access controls, or encryption (such as TLS) are implemented when the adapter is run in legacy remote debugging mode.
    - There are no configuration options to require a password, token, or certificate for remote connections.
    - No network-level filtering is enforced by the extension itself.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user has configured remote debugging by starting the debug adapter in headless mode with a publicly accessible host/port configuration (for example, binding to an IP address other than `127.0.0.1`).
    - An attacker is on the same network (or has local access) and can reach the configured port.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The file `/code/docs/debugging-legacy.md` provides instructions for starting a headless debug server (using Delve) and includes sample configurations that specify a host/port (defaulting to `"127.0.0.1"` in many cases).
    2. No authentication or secure transport mechanisms are referenced in the documentation or in the configuration code.
    3. The extension passes along the host/port values to the debug adapter without applying additional security controls.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Configure a remote debugging session by editing `launch.json` to specify a host binding (e.g. `"host": "0.0.0.0"` or another non-localhost interface) and an exposed port (e.g. 2345).
    2. Start the legacy debug adapter using the provided instructions.
    3. From a separate machine or a virtual machine on the same network, use a network client (for example netcat or a DAP-compatible client) to connect to the specified port.
    4. Attempt to send valid and malformed debug adapter protocol messages.
    5. Observe if the adapter accepts the connection and responds without demanding authentication.
    6. Try performing operations (such as pausing or stepping through code) and document if such unauthenticated access is possible.

### Malicious Workspace Configuration Vulnerability Leading to Arbitrary Command Execution

- **Vulnerability Name:** Malicious Workspace Configuration Vulnerability Leading to Arbitrary Command Execution
- **Description:**
    The extension loads configuration settings (for example, paths to executables and environment variables) from workspace settings—in files such as `.vscode/settings.json`—when a workspace is marked as trusted. This mechanism allows users to override tool paths (e.g. via `"go.alternateTools"`) and other critical parameters used when invoking command-line tools (such as `go`, `gopls`, or `dlv`). A threat actor can prepare a malicious repository that contains a workspace settings file which redefines these parameters to point to attacker-controlled binaries or scripts. When an unsuspecting user opens such a repository and marks it as trusted, the extension will load and act on these malicious settings. As a result, standard operations such as building, testing, or debugging could trigger execution of arbitrary code.
- **Impact:**
    If exploited, an attacker could achieve arbitrary command execution on the victim’s machine. This could lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, or installation of persistent malware—especially serious given that the extension normally invokes tools with the user’s privileges.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - By default, the extension prefers reading configuration from user settings rather than workspace settings.
    - The extension provides a “Go: Toggle Workspace Trust Flag” command that requires users to explicitly mark a workspace as trusted before workspace settings are merged.
    - Documentation clearly warns users about the security risks of allowing workspace settings overrides.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No mechanism currently exists to sandbox or further verify the integrity of tools specified via workspace settings once a workspace is trusted.
    - There is no runtime cryptographic signature check or hash verification for executables that are resolved from settings.
    - The process trusts the entire workspace configuration once marked as trusted rather than performing any fine-grained verification of only “safe” settings.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must supply a repository that contains a malicious `.vscode/settings.json` file that overrides critical configuration values (e.g. `"go.alternateTools"` pointing to a malicious script).
    - The user must open this repository in VS Code and mark the workspace as trusted, thereby allowing the extension to load and use the malicious settings.
    - The extension then uses these settings during a build, test, or debugging operation.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In `/code/docs/settings.md`, the “Security” section explains that the extension “runs a few third-party command-line tools” based on locations determined by environment variables and settings such as `"go.alternateTools"`.
    2. The extension merges workspace settings with user settings if a workspace is trusted. The code paths that retrieve these configuration values do not implement sanity checks or integrity verification.
    3. There is no additional sandboxing or verification step before the resolved tool paths are used to spawn subprocesses.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Prepare a test repository that includes a `.vscode/settings.json` file. In this file, set—for example—the key `"go.alternateTools"` to an object where the `"go"` field is defined as an absolute path to a custom “malicious” script (e.g. `/tmp/malicious_go`).
       Example content:
       ```json
       {
         "go.alternateTools": {
           "go": "/tmp/malicious_go"
         }
       }
       ```
    2. On your test system, create the malicious script at `/tmp/malicious_go` that (for testing purposes) writes a unique file or message (e.g. creates `/tmp/attacker_triggered.txt`) and then exits.
    3. Open the test repository in VS Code. When prompted, mark the workspace as trusted so that workspace settings are applied.
    4. Trigger a build or test command (such as “Go: Build Current Package”) that would normally use the `go` tool.
    5. Check for the side effect of the malicious script (for example, verify that `/tmp/attacker_triggered.txt` exists) to confirm that the malicious binary was executed.
    6. Document that the extension executed the tool based on workspace configuration without additional verification, thereby proving the vulnerability.
