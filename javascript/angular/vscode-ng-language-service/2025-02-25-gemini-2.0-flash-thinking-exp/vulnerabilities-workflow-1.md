## Combined Vulnerability List

### Vulnerability Name: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in axios < 0.21.5
* Description:
    * An attacker can trigger a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability in applications using axios versions prior to 0.21.5.
    * By controlling the request URL passed to axios, an attacker can make the server send requests to arbitrary external or internal resources.
* Impact:
    * An SSRF vulnerability can allow an attacker to:
        * Scan internal networks and services that are not publicly accessible.
        * Read sensitive data from internal services.
        * Potentially achieve remote code execution in vulnerable internal services if they are exploited through SSRF.
        * Bypass firewalls or other network security measures.
* Vulnerability Rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * Not mitigated in the project if it uses axios < 0.21.5.
    * The `pnpm-lock.yaml` in the root directory (`/code/pnpm-lock.yaml`) shows `axios@0.21.4` is used by `localtunnel@2.0.2`, which is a vulnerable version.
    * The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file in the `/code/integration/project/` directory (`/code/integration/project/pnpm-lock.yaml`) does not include `axios` or `localtunnel` and thus does not change the mitigation status of this vulnerability.
    * The other `pnpm-lock.yaml` files in the `integration` directories (`/code/integration/workspace/pnpm-lock.yaml`, `/code/integration/pre_apf_project/pnpm-lock.yaml`, `/code/integration/pre_standalone_project/pnpm-lock.yaml`) do not directly include `axios` or `localtunnel` and thus do not change the mitigation status of this vulnerability.
* Missing mitigations:
    * Upgrade axios dependency to version 0.21.5 or later, especially for `localtunnel` if it's used in production or accessible to external attackers.
    * Implement input validation and sanitization for URLs passed to axios to prevent attacker-controlled URLs from being used in server-side requests.
* Preconditions:
    * The application or its dependencies must be using axios version less than 0.21.5.
    * The application must allow user-controlled input to be used as part of axios request URLs without proper validation.
* Source code analysis:
    1. The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file in the root directory (`/code/pnpm-lock.yaml`) indicates that the project dependency `localtunnel@2.0.2` is using `axios@0.21.4`.
    2. Security advisories indicate that axios versions before 0.21.5 are vulnerable to SSRF (CVE-2021-22833).
    3. If the project code or `localtunnel` uses axios to make requests and the URL in the request is derived from user input without sufficient validation, the SSRF vulnerability can be exploited.
    4. `localtunnel` is a tool to expose local servers publicly. If the project uses `localtunnel` in a publicly accessible environment or for features accessible to external attackers, this SSRF vulnerability in `axios` within `localtunnel` becomes exploitable.
    5. Example vulnerable code scenario (within `localtunnel` or project code using `localtunnel`'s functionalities):
        ```javascript
        const axios = require('axios');
        const express = require('express');
        const app = express();

        app.get('/localtunnel-proxy', async (req, res) => {
            const targetUrl = req.query.lt_url; // Hypothetical user-controlled URL for localtunnel proxy
            if (!targetUrl) {
                return res.status(400).send('lt_url parameter is required');
            }
            try {
                const response = await axios.get(targetUrl); // Vulnerable axios version 0.21.4 used by localtunnel
                res.send(response.data);
            } catch (error) {
                res.status(500).send('Proxy error');
            }
        });

        app.listen(3001, () => {
            console.log('Server listening on port 3001');
        });
        ```
    6. In this hypothetical example, if `localtunnel` or project code exposes an endpoint `/localtunnel-proxy` and uses user-provided URL from `lt_url` query parameter with vulnerable `axios`, it can be exploited for SSRF.
* Security test case:
    1. Set up an environment that uses the dependencies listed in root `pnpm-lock.yaml`, ensuring `axios` version is `0.21.4` through `localtunnel@2.0.2`.
    2. Deploy an application that potentially uses `localtunnel`'s functionalities or exposes `localtunnel` service in a publicly accessible instance.
    3. Identify a potential endpoint that interacts with `localtunnel` and might use user-provided URLs (e.g., a proxy feature or a webhook integration that leverages `localtunnel`).
    4. Craft a malicious URL to test for SSRF. This could be:
        * An internal IP address and port to check for internal network access (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`).
        * A URL pointing to an external website to verify external reach (e.g., `http://example.com`).
        * A URL to a requestbin or similar service to capture the request and confirm SSRF by observing the server's request originating from the application server.
    5. Send a GET request to the identified endpoint with the crafted malicious URL as a parameter (e.g., `/localtunnel-proxy?lt_url=http://127.0.0.1:8080/`).
    6. Analyze the response:
        * If the application attempts to access the internal resource and you observe errors or timeouts related to accessing internal resources, it indicates potential SSRF.
        * If you used an external URL and observe requests in requestbin logs originating from the server, it confirms the SSRF vulnerability.
    7. For a more definitive test, attempt to access a sensitive internal service (if applicable and known) that should not be publicly accessible to further demonstrate the impact of SSRF.

### Vulnerability Name: Prototype Pollution in protobufjs < 6.11.3
* Description:
    * The project uses a vulnerable version of `protobufjs` (prior to 6.11.3), which is susceptible to prototype pollution (CVE-2024-31798).
    * If an attacker can control the input data processed by `protobufjs`, they can pollute the JavaScript prototype chain.
* Impact:
    * Prototype pollution can lead to various security issues:
        * Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the application or making it unresponsive.
        * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if prototype pollution affects client-side JavaScript execution.
        * Remote Code Execution (RCE) in specific scenarios if prototype pollution can be chained with other vulnerabilities or leads to the manipulation of sensitive application logic.
* Vulnerability Rank: high
* Currently implemented mitigations:
    * Not mitigated. The project uses `protobufjs@6.8.8` as seen in root `pnpm-lock.yaml` (`/code/pnpm-lock.yaml`), which is vulnerable.
    * The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file in the `/code/integration/project/` directory (`/code/integration/project/pnpm-lock.yaml`) does not include `protobufjs` and thus does not change the mitigation status of this vulnerability.
    * The other `pnpm-lock.yaml` files in the `integration` directories (`/code/integration/workspace/pnpm-lock.yaml`, `/code/integration/pre_apf_project/pnpm-lock.yaml`, `/code/integration/pre_standalone_project/pnpm-lock.yaml`) do not include `protobufjs` and thus do not change the mitigation status of this vulnerability.
* Missing mitigations:
    * Upgrade the `protobufjs` dependency to version 6.11.3 or later.
    * Implement input validation and sanitization for data processed by `protobufjs` to prevent malicious payloads that exploit prototype pollution.
* Preconditions:
    * The application must be using `protobufjs` version less than 6.11.3.
    * The application must process user-controlled data using `protobufjs`.
* Source code analysis:
    1. The `pnpm-lock.yaml` file in the root directory (`/code/pnpm-lock.yaml`) indicates that the project is using `protobufjs@6.8.8`.
    2. Security advisories indicate that `protobufjs` versions before 6.11.3 are vulnerable to prototype pollution (CVE-2024-31798).
    3. If the project code uses `protobufjs` to parse or process data, and this data can be influenced by an external attacker, the prototype pollution vulnerability can be exploited.
    4. Example vulnerable code scenario:
        ```javascript
        const protobuf = require('protobufjs');

        // Assume user controlled input is passed as 'userInput'
        function processProtobufData(userInput) {
            try {
                const root = protobuf.Root.fromJSON({
                    nested: {
                        "MyMessage": {
                            fields: {
                                "name": { type: "string", id: 1 }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                });
                const MyMessage = root.lookupType("MyMessage");

                const message = MyMessage.decode(Buffer.from(userInput, 'base64')); // User input processed by protobufjs
                console.log("Decoded message:", message);
                return message;

            } catch (error) {
                console.error("Error processing Protobuf data:", error);
                return null;
            }
        }

        // Example of potentially vulnerable input (simplified for demonstration, actual exploit payload would be crafted to pollute prototype)
        const maliciousInput = 'eyJfcHJvdG90eWUiOnsicG9sbHV0ZWQiOnRydWV9fQ=='; // Base64 encoded '{"__proto__":{"polluted":true}}'
        processProtobufData(maliciousInput);

        // Check if prototype is polluted (demonstration of potential impact)
        if ({}.polluted === true) {
            console.log("Prototype POLLUTED!");
        } else {
            console.log("Prototype not polluted (or mitigation in place)");
        }

        ```
    5. In this example, if `userInput` is controlled by the attacker and processed by `protobufjs.Root.fromJSON` or `MyMessage.decode`, a malicious payload can pollute the prototype.
* Security test case:
    1. Set up an environment that uses the dependencies listed in root `pnpm-lock.yaml`, ensuring `protobufjs` version is `6.8.8`.
    2. Deploy an application that processes user-controlled data using `protobufjs` in a publicly accessible instance.
    3. Identify an endpoint or functionality that processes Protobuf data where the input is influenced by the attacker.
    4. Craft a malicious Protobuf payload designed to exploit the prototype pollution vulnerability. This payload will typically include `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties in the JSON or encoded Protobuf data.
        * Example malicious JSON payload (for `Root.fromJSON`): `{"nested": {"MyMessage": {"fields": {"name": {"type": "string", "id": 1}}}}, "__proto__": {"pollutedProperty": "maliciousValue"}}`
        * Encode this JSON payload if the application expects Base64 encoded Protobuf messages.
    5. Send a request to the vulnerable endpoint with the crafted malicious payload.
        * For example, if the application has an endpoint `/protobuf-process` that takes Base64 encoded Protobuf data as a POST parameter:
        ```
        POST /protobuf-process HTTP/1.1
        Host: <your-application-domain>
        Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

        protobufData=<base64-encoded-malicious-payload>
        ```
    6. After sending the request, attempt to verify if the prototype has been polluted. This can be done by checking for the existence of the polluted property on a plain JavaScript object:
        ```javascript
        // In a separate request or later in the application's lifecycle, check:
        if ({}.pollutedProperty === "maliciousValue") {
            console.log("PROTOTYPE POLLUTION VULNERABILITY CONFIRMED!");
        } else {
            console.log("Prototype pollution not detected or mitigated.");
        }
        ```
    7. Observe the application's behavior after sending the malicious payload. Check for unexpected errors, crashes, or changes in functionality that might indicate prototype pollution and its potential impact.
