## Combined Vulnerability List

### 1. Markdown Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via JSDoc `@link` tags

- **Vulnerability Name:** Markdown Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via JSDoc `@link` tags

- **Description:**
    - The `text_render.ts` file processes JSDoc tags, including `@link` tags, and converts them to markdown links.
    - The `replaceLinks` function in `text_render.ts` uses a regex to find `@link` tags and create markdown links.
    - When handling external URLs within `@link` tags, the function does not adequately sanitize the link text, allowing for the injection of arbitrary markdown syntax. This injected markdown can then be rendered by clients displaying the documentation, potentially leading to security issues like cross-site scripting (XSS), depending on the client's markdown rendering engine and security context.
    - Specifically, if a JSDoc comment contains a `@link` tag with a `javascript:` URL or malicious markdown, and if the markdown rendering process does not sanitize these URLs or markdown syntax, it might be possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript code or inject malicious content when the hover information or completion details containing this link are rendered in VS Code or other clients.
    - An attacker could potentially contribute to a project with malicious JSDoc comments containing `javascript:` URLs or markdown injection in `@link` tags. When a developer hovers over code with such comments, the malicious JavaScript or content could be executed or displayed in their environment.
    - **Step by step trigger instructions:**
        1. Create or modify a TypeScript file in an Angular project.
        2. Add a JSDoc comment to a class, method, or property that includes a `@link` tag with an external URL.
        3. In the text part of the `@link` tag (after the URL and a space or `|`), inject malicious markdown syntax or use a `javascript:` URL. For example:
            - Markdown Injection:
            ```typescript
            /**
             *  {@link https://example.com <img src="x" onerror="alert('Markdown Injection')}
             */
            export class MyClass1 {}
            ```
            - `javascript:` URL:
            ```typescript
            /**
             *  {@link javascript:alert('XSS')}
             */
            export class MyClass2 {}
            ```
        4. Hover over `MyClass1` or `MyClass2` in VS Code to trigger the display of hover information.
        5. If the vulnerability exists, an alert box with 'Markdown Injection' or 'XSS' might be displayed, or malicious content rendered, indicating that the injected markdown or `javascript:` URL was executed or rendered.

- **Impact:**
    - If successfully exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious content or execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a developer's environment that renders the documentation. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
        - Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the client renders HTML from markdown, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's session.
        - Stealing sensitive information (e.g., tokens, credentials) from the developer's environment.
        - Modifying code or project settings.
        - Installing malicious extensions or tools.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the developer.
        - Information disclosure if the injected markdown can be used to access local resources or exfiltrate data.
        - Phishing attacks by crafting misleading or malicious content within the documentation.
        - Defacement of documentation displayed in the client application.
    - The severity of the impact depends on the permissions and context in which the JavaScript code is executed within the client application and the nature of the injected markdown content. Given the potential for XSS, the vulnerability is considered high severity.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The code in `escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode` function attempts to escape backticks, and a comment suggests "Markdown is fully sanitized after being rendered." However, it's unclear if `javascript:` URLs or other markdown injection vectors are effectively sanitized to prevent XSS and markdown injection.
    - ```typescript
      function escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode(text: string): string {
        return text.replace(/`/g, '\\$&');  // CodeQL [SM02383] This is only meant to escape backticks.
                                            // The Markdown is fully sanitized after being rendered.
      }
      ```
    - The comment in the code incorrectly assumes that "The Markdown is fully sanitized after being rendered." which is not guaranteed and depends on the client's markdown rendering implementation.
    - There are no explicit sanitization mechanisms in `text_render.ts` to handle or remove potentially dangerous URLs like `javascript:` or sanitize general markdown syntax within `@link` tags beyond backticks.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input sanitization for URLs and markdown syntax within `@link` tags in JSDoc comments should be implemented in `text_render.ts`.
    - Specifically, `javascript:` URLs and other potentially harmful URL schemes should be detected and either removed, neutralized, or explicitly handled with robust sanitization before being rendered as markdown links.
    - Robust markdown sanitization for the text part of `@link` tags is needed, especially when external URLs are used.
    - Consider using a secure markdown rendering library (on the client side, if applicable) that automatically sanitizes URLs and prevents execution of JavaScript code from links and mitigates markdown injection.
    - Alternatively, escaping all potentially dangerous markdown syntax tokens, not just backticks, should be implemented in `text_render.ts`. This could be complex and error-prone if done manually.
    - Consider rendering `@link` text as plain text instead of markdown links when external URLs are used, or restrict the allowed markdown syntax within `@link` text to a safe subset.

- **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to be able to introduce or modify JSDoc comments in the codebase, for example, by contributing to an open-source project or through other means of code injection.
    - A developer needs to trigger the display of documentation that includes the malicious JSDoc comment in a client application that renders markdown, such as VS Code (by hovering over the code, using signature help, etc.).

- **Source code analysis:**
    - **File:** `code/server/src/text_render.ts`
    - **Function:** `replaceLinks`
        ```typescript
        function replaceLinks(text: string, getScriptInfo: (fileName: string) => tss.server.ScriptInfo | undefined): string {
            return text.replace(/\{@(link|linkplain|linkcode) (https?:\/\/[^ |}]+?)(?:[| ]([^{}\n]+?))?\}/gi,
                (match, tagName, link, linkText) => {
                    const currentLink = {
                        name: tagName,
                        text: linkText,
                        linkcode: tagName === 'linkcode',
                        target: link
                    };
                    return convertLinkTags([currentLink], getScriptInfo);
                });
        }
        ```
        - The `replaceLinks` function uses a regular expression `\{@(link|linkplain|linkcode) (https?:\/\/[^ |}]+?)(?:[| ]([^{}\n]+?))?\}/gi` to find and replace `@link`, `@linkplain`, and `@linkcode` tags.
        - It extracts the link and link text from the tags.
        - It calls `convertLinkTags` to process the extracted link information.

    - **Function:** `convertLinkTags`
        ```typescript
        function convertLinkTags(
            documentation: tss.SymbolDisplayPart[]|undefined|string,
            getScriptInfo: (fileName: string) => tss.server.ScriptInfo | undefined): string {
          // ...
          case 'link':
            // ...
          } else {
            const text = currentLink.text ?? currentLink.name;
            if (text) {
              if (/^https?:/.test(text)) {
                const parts = text.split(' ');
                if (parts.length === 1) {
                  out.push(parts[0]);
                } else if (parts.length > 1) {
                  const linkText = escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode(parts.slice(1).join(' ')); // Escapes backticks only
                  out.push(
                      `[${currentLink.linkcode ? '`' + linkText + '`' : linkText}](${parts[0]})`); // Constructs Markdown link
                }
              } else {
                out.push(escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode(text)); // Escapes backticks only
              }
            }
            // ...
        }
        ```
        - Inside `convertLinkTags`, for external links (starting with `https?:`), if there is text after the URL in the `@link` tag, it splits the text by spaces.
        - It then calls `escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode` on the text after the URL. **Crucially, `escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode` only escapes backticks.**
        - Finally, it constructs a markdown link using `[${linkText}](${parts[0]})`, where `linkText` is the insufficiently sanitized text from the JSDoc comment. If `linkText` contains markdown syntax or a `javascript:` URL, it will be included in the rendered markdown link.

    - **Function:** `escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode`
        ```typescript
        function escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode(text: string): string {
          return text.replace(/`/g, '\\$&');  // CodeQL [SM02383] This is only meant to escape backticks.
                                              // The Markdown is fully sanitized after being rendered.
        }
        ```
        - This function only escapes backticks and does not provide comprehensive markdown sanitization or URL sanitization.

    - **Call chain:**
        - `session.ts` -> `onHover` -> `documentationToMarkdown` -> `tagsToMarkdown` -> `processInlineTags` -> `replaceLinks` -> `convertLinkTags` -> `escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode`

- **Security test case:**
    - **Test case 1: Markdown Injection**
        - Steps:
            1. Open a valid Angular project in VS Code.
            2. Create a new TypeScript file or modify an existing one (e.g., `app.component.ts`).
            3. Add the following JSDoc comment to the `AppComponent` class:
            ```typescript
            /**
             * This is a class with malicious markdown injection.
             * {@link https://example.com <img src="x" onerror="alert('MARKDOWN_INJECTION_DEMO')">}
             */
            export class AppComponent1 {
                title = 'demo';
            }
            ```
            4. Save the file.
            5. Open the `app.component.ts` file in the VS Code editor.
            6. Hover your mouse cursor over the `AppComponent1` class name in the editor.
            7. Observe if an alert dialog box appears with the message 'MARKDOWN_INJECTION_DEMO' or if an image icon with broken link is rendered.
        - Expected result: An alert dialog box with the message 'MARKDOWN_INJECTION_DEMO' should *not* appear. The injected `<img>` tag should be sanitized or neutralized to prevent JavaScript execution or unexpected content rendering.
        - Actual result: If an alert dialog box appears or an image icon is rendered, it confirms the markdown injection vulnerability.

    - **Test case 2: `javascript:` URL XSS**
        - Steps:
            1. Open a valid Angular project in VS Code.
            2. Create a new TypeScript file or modify an existing one (e.g., `app.component.ts`).
            3. Add the following JSDoc comment to the `AppComponent` class:
            ```typescript
            /**
             * This is a class with a malicious link.
             * {@link javascript:alert('XSS_VULNERABILITY_DEMO')}
             */
            export class AppComponent2 {
                title = 'demo';
            }
            ```
            4. Save the file.
            5. Open the `app.component.ts` file in the VS Code editor.
            6. Hover your mouse cursor over the `AppComponent2` class name in the editor.
            7. Observe if an alert dialog box appears with the message 'XSS_VULNERABILITY_DEMO'.
        - Expected result: An alert dialog box with the message 'XSS_VULNERABILITY_DEMO' should *not* appear. The `javascript:` URL should be sanitized or neutralized to prevent JavaScript execution.
        - Actual result: If an alert dialog box appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability. If no alert box appears, it indicates that VS Code or an underlying markdown renderer is sanitizing `javascript:` URLs, or the vulnerability is not present in this specific scenario. Further investigation might be needed to confirm robust mitigation.

### 2. Insecure Use of `pull_request_target` in GitHub Actions Workflow Allowing Exposure of Repository Secrets

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Use of `pull_request_target` in GitHub Actions Workflow Allowing Exposure of Repository Secrets

- **Description:**
    - The GitHub Actions workflows in the repository are configured to trigger on the `pull_request_target` event. When triggered via this event, the workflow uses the trusted configuration and secrets of the base branch—even though parts of the workflow input may come from untrusted pull-request changes. An external attacker (for example, by forking the repository and submitting a pull request) can craft malicious modifications that cause privileged workflow steps to execute with access to sensitive data.
    - **Step‑by-step trigger scenario:**
        1. An attacker forks the repository and opens a pull request containing specially crafted changes (e.g. modifying inputs or adding unexpected characters) in areas referenced by the workflow.
        2. Because the workflow is triggered by `pull_request_target`, it runs with the base branch’s full configuration and secret environment variables rather than using a sanitized configuration from the pull request itself.
        3. If the workflow does not properly validate or segregate untrusted inputs, its logs or outputs can inadvertently reveal sensitive secrets (such as deployment tokens or API keys).

- **Impact:**
    - If exploited, an attacker could force the workflow to emit sensitive repository secrets into the logs or other outputs. With these secrets compromised, the attacker might impersonate privileged services, modify deployments, or otherwise compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the repository and its infrastructure.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The workflows pin custom action versions using fixed commit hashes to reduce tampering risk.
    - The trigger events are narrowly specified (for example, only on certain PR events) to mitigate some input abuse.
    - However, these measures do not overcome the intrinsic risk of running privileged steps on pull-request data.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Switching the workflow trigger from `pull_request_target` to `pull_request` so that untrusted contributions do not run privileged code.
    - Alternatively, restructuring the workflow so that only a safe subset of steps (which do not have access to secrets) process untrusted data, with privileged actions separated and executed only on trusted input.

- **Preconditions:**
    - The repository accepts pull requests from external contributors or forks.
    - Workflows are configured to trigger on the `pull_request_target` event, meaning that even untrusted pull request data is processed with trusted configuration and secrets.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The vulnerability is not found in the bulk of the server, client, test, or syntaxes source code but in the GitHub Actions workflow configuration (present in earlier batches of files). In the current set of project files, all server‑side language service logic, client commands, file and grammar utility code, and integration tests were found to be implemented following robust best practices. No additional dynamic processing of untrusted external input (such as unsanitized markdown processing, unsafe evaluation of user input, or insecure deserialization) was detected in the code itself. The risk is purely within the GitHub Actions configuration.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. From an external fork, submit a pull request with a commit that deliberately injects unexpected or malicious content in areas of the repository referenced by workflow steps. For example, modify a workflow input variable in the pull request.
    2. Observe that the workflow is triggered using the `pull_request_target` event and note that it runs with access to the base branch’s secrets.
    3. Check the job logs (and any other outputs) to verify if secret values (or portions thereof) are disclosed. For example, try to echo a secret variable to the logs.
    4. As a remediation test, modify the workflow trigger (e.g. use `pull_request` or separate unprivileged steps) and confirm that attempts to trigger secret-exposing behavior are thwarted.
