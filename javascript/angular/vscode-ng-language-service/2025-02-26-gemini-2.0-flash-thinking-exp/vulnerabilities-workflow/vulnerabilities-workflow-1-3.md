### Vulnerability Name: Markdown Injection in JSDoc `@link` tags

* Description:
    An attacker can inject malicious markdown code through JSDoc `@link` tags in comments. The `convertLinkTags` function in `text_render.ts` processes JSDoc documentation and converts `@link` tags into markdown links. When handling external URLs within these tags, the function does not adequately sanitize the link text, allowing for the injection of arbitrary markdown syntax. This injected markdown can then be rendered by clients displaying the documentation, potentially leading to security issues like cross-site scripting (XSS), depending on the client's markdown rendering engine and security context.

    Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
    1. Create a TypeScript file within an Angular project.
    2. Add a JSDoc comment to a class, function, or property.
    3. Within the JSDoc comment, use an `@link` tag with an external URL.
    4. In the text part of the `@link` tag (after the URL and a space or `|`), inject malicious markdown syntax. For example, include an image tag, iframe, or other potentially harmful markdown elements.
    5. Trigger a hover or signature help request in the editor for the documented element.
    6. The language server will process the JSDoc, convert the `@link` tag to markdown, and return it as part of the hover information.
    7. If the client application (e.g., VS Code) renders this markdown without sufficient sanitization, the injected markdown code will be executed or displayed.

* Impact:
    The impact of this vulnerability is highly dependent on the client application that renders the markdown documentation provided by the language server. If the client application is vulnerable to markdown injection, an attacker could potentially achieve:
    - Cross-site scripting (XSS) if the client renders HTML from markdown, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's session.
    - Information disclosure if the injected markdown can be used to access local resources or exfiltrate data.
    - Phishing attacks by crafting misleading or malicious content within the documentation.
    - Defacement of documentation displayed in the client application.

    Given the potential for XSS, the vulnerability is considered high severity.

* Vulnerability Rank: high

* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    The `escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode` function in `text_render.ts` attempts to mitigate markdown injection by escaping backticks (`). However, this function is insufficient as it does not escape other markdown syntax tokens that can be used for malicious purposes, such as image tags, iframes, or raw HTML.

    ```typescript
    function escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode(text: string): string {
      return text.replace(/`/g, '\\$&');  // CodeQL [SM02383] This is only meant to escape backticks.
                                          // The Markdown is fully sanitized after being rendered.
    }
    ```
    The comment in the code incorrectly assumes that "The Markdown is fully sanitized after being rendered." which is not guaranteed and depends on the client's markdown rendering implementation.

    The provided PROJECT FILES do not include any changes to the mitigation status of this vulnerability.

* Missing Mitigations:
    The project lacks comprehensive sanitization of user-provided text within JSDoc `@link` tags, especially when external URLs are involved.

    Missing mitigations include:
    - Implementing a robust markdown sanitization library to process the text part of `@link` tags before rendering them as markdown. Libraries like DOMPurify or similar HTML/Markdown sanitizers could be used.
    - Alternatively, escaping all potentially dangerous markdown syntax tokens, not just backticks, should be implemented. This could be complex and error-prone if done manually.
    - Consider rendering `@link` text as plain text instead of markdown links when external URLs are used, or restrict the allowed markdown syntax within `@link` text to a safe subset.

* Preconditions:
    - The target application must be displaying documentation generated by the Angular Language Service, which includes rendering markdown from JSDoc comments.
    - The documentation must include JSDoc comments with `@link` tags that contain external URLs and are processed by `text_render.ts`.

* Source Code Analysis:
    1. **File: `/code/server/src/text_render.ts` Function: `convertLinkTags`**:
    ```typescript
    function convertLinkTags(
        documentation: tss.SymbolDisplayPart[]|undefined|string,
        getScriptInfo: (fileName: string) => tss.server.ScriptInfo | undefined): string {
      // ...
      case 'link':
        // ...
      } else {
        const text = currentLink.text ?? currentLink.name;
        if (text) {
          if (/^https?:/.test(text)) {
            const parts = text.split(' ');
            if (parts.length === 1) {
              out.push(parts[0]);
            } else if (parts.length > 1) {
              const linkText = escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode(parts.slice(1).join(' ')); // Escapes backticks only
              out.push(
                  `[${currentLink.linkcode ? '`' + linkText + '`' : linkText}](${parts[0]})`); // Constructs Markdown link
            }
          } else {
            out.push(escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode(text)); // Escapes backticks only
          }
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    - The `convertLinkTags` function processes documentation parts. When it encounters a `link` part, it checks if `currentLink.text` is available.
    - If `currentLink.text` exists and starts with `https?:`, it splits the text by spaces.
    - It then uses `escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode` to escape the `linkText` (parts after the first space joined). **Crucially, `escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode` only escapes backticks.**
    - Finally, it constructs a markdown link using `[${linkText}](${parts[0]})`. If the `linkText` contains markdown syntax, it will be included in the rendered markdown link.

    2. **Vulnerable Code Snippet:**
    The vulnerability lies in the insufficient sanitization of `linkText` before constructing the markdown link within the `else if (parts.length > 1)` block in the `convertLinkTags` function. Only backticks are escaped, leaving other markdown injection vectors open.

    Analysis of the provided PROJECT FILES does not reveal any changes to this code snippet or the overall vulnerability.

* Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Set up a development environment with the Angular Language Service extension loaded.
        - Create an Angular project or use an existing one.
        - Open a TypeScript file in the project within VS Code.

    2. **Steps:**
        - In a TypeScript file, add a class with a JSDoc comment containing an `@link` tag with a malicious markdown payload in the text part of the link. For example:

        ```typescript
        /**
         * Example class.
         * @link https://example.com <img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">
         */
        class MyClass {
          // ...
        }
        ```

        - Hover over `MyClass` in the editor to trigger the hover information provided by the Angular Language Service.
        - Observe the rendered hover documentation.

    3. **Expected Result:**
        - If the client (VS Code in this case) is vulnerable to markdown injection, an alert box with 'XSS' will be displayed when hovering over `MyClass`. This indicates that the injected `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` markdown code was executed, proving the vulnerability.

    4. **Pass/Fail Criteria:**
        - **Fail:** An alert box with 'XSS' is displayed, or any other indication of JavaScript execution from the injected markdown.
        - **Pass:** No alert box is displayed, and the markdown is rendered as plain text or harmlessly escaped, indicating successful mitigation.

This test case demonstrates a potential XSS vulnerability. Depending on the client application and its markdown rendering capabilities, more sophisticated attacks could be crafted.
