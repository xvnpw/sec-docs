## Vulnerability list:

- Vulnerability name: Potential XSS via javascript: URLs in JSDoc `@link` tags
- Description:
    - The `text_render.ts` file processes JSDoc tags, including `@link` tags, and converts them to markdown links.
    - The `replaceLinks` function in `text_render.ts` uses a regex to find `@link` tags and create markdown links.
    - If a JSDoc comment contains a `@link` tag with a `javascript:` URL, and if the markdown rendering process does not sanitize these URLs, it might be possible to execute arbitrary JavaScript code when the hover information or completion details containing this link are rendered in VS Code.
    - An attacker could potentially contribute to a project with malicious JSDoc comments containing `javascript:` URLs in `@link` tags. When a developer hovers over code with such comments, the malicious JavaScript could be executed in their VS Code environment.
    - Step by step trigger instructions:
        1. Create or modify a TypeScript file in an Angular project.
        2. Add a JSDoc comment to a class, method, or property that includes a `@link` tag with a `javascript:` URL. For example:
        ```typescript
        /**
         *  {@link javascript:alert('XSS')}
         */
        export class MyClass {}
        ```
        3. Hover over `MyClass` in VS Code to trigger the display of hover information.
        4. If the vulnerability exists, an alert box with 'XSS' will be displayed, indicating that the `javascript:` URL was executed.
- Impact:
    - If successfully exploited, this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within a developer's VS Code environment. This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
        - Stealing sensitive information (e.g., tokens, credentials) from the developer's environment.
        - Modifying code or project settings.
        - Installing malicious extensions or tools.
        - Performing actions on behalf of the developer.
    - The severity of the impact depends on the permissions and context in which the JavaScript code is executed within VS Code.
- Vulnerability rank: high
- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - The code in `escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode` function attempts to escape backticks, and a comment suggests "Markdown is fully sanitized after being rendered." However, it's unclear if `javascript:` URLs are effectively sanitized to prevent XSS.
    - There are no explicit sanitization mechanisms in `text_render.ts` to handle or remove potentially dangerous URLs like `javascript:`.
- Missing mitigations:
    - Input sanitization for URLs within `@link` tags in JSDoc comments should be implemented in `text_render.ts`.
    - Specifically, `javascript:` URLs and other potentially harmful URL schemes should be detected and either removed, neutralized, or explicitly handled with robust sanitization before being rendered as markdown links.
    - Consider using a secure markdown rendering library that automatically sanitizes URLs and prevents execution of JavaScript code from links.
- Preconditions:
    - An attacker needs to be able to introduce or modify JSDoc comments in the codebase, for example, by contributing to an open-source project or through other means of code injection.
    - A developer needs to hover over the code containing the malicious JSDoc comment in VS Code.
- Source code analysis:
    - `code/server/src/text_render.ts`
        - `replaceLinks` function uses regex `\{@(link|linkplain|linkcode) (https?:\/\/[^ |}]+?)(?:[| ]([^{}\n]+?))?\}/gi` to find and replace link tags.
        - It creates markdown links using `[text](link)`.
        - `escapeMarkdownSyntaxTokensForCode` only escapes backticks.
        - No explicit sanitization for `javascript:` URLs is present in `replaceLinks` or `convertLinkTags`.
        - `processInlineTags` uses `replaceLinks` to process links.
        - `asPlainTextWithLinks` and `documentationToMarkdown` use `processInlineTags`.
        - `tagsToMarkdown` and `documentationToMarkdown` are used in `session.ts` -> `onHover` to generate hover content.
    - `code/server/src/session.ts`
        - `onHover` function retrieves quick info using `languageService.getQuickInfoAtPosition`.
        - It then calls `documentationToMarkdown` to format the documentation and tags for hover display.
        - The output of `documentationToMarkdown`, which might contain unsanitized `javascript:` URLs, is directly used as hover content.

- Security test case:
    - Test case: Inject a JSDoc comment with a `@link` tag containing a `javascript:` URL and verify if JavaScript code is executed when hovering over the documented element in VS Code.
    - Steps:
        1. Open a valid Angular project in VS Code.
        2. Create a new TypeScript file or modify an existing one (e.g., `app.component.ts`).
        3. Add the following JSDoc comment to the `AppComponent` class:
        ```typescript
        /**
         * This is a class with a malicious link.
         * {@link javascript:alert('XSS_VULNERABILITY_DEMO')}
         */
        export class AppComponent {
            title = 'demo';
        }
        ```
        4. Save the file.
        5. Open the `app.component.ts` file in the VS Code editor.
        6. Hover your mouse cursor over the `AppComponent` class name in the editor.
        7. Observe if an alert dialog box appears with the message 'XSS_VULNERABILITY_DEMO'.
    - Expected result: An alert dialog box with the message 'XSS_VULNERABILITY_DEMO' should *not* appear. The `javascript:` URL should be sanitized or neutralized to prevent JavaScript execution.
    - Actual result: If an alert dialog box appears, it confirms the XSS vulnerability. If no alert box appears, it indicates that VS Code or an underlying markdown renderer is sanitizing `javascript:` URLs, or the vulnerability is not present in this specific scenario. Further investigation might be needed to confirm robust mitigation.
