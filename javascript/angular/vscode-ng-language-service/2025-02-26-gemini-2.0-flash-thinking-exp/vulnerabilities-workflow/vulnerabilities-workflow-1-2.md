- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Use of `pull_request_target` in GitHub Actions Workflow Allowing Exposure of Repository Secrets
  - **Description:**
    The GitHub Actions workflows in the repository are configured to trigger on the `pull_request_target` event. When triggered via this event, the workflow uses the trusted configuration and secrets of the base branch—even though parts of the workflow input may come from untrusted pull-request changes. An external attacker (for example, by forking the repository and submitting a pull request) can craft malicious modifications that cause privileged workflow steps to execute with access to sensitive data.
    - **Step‑by-step trigger scenario:**
      1. An attacker forks the repository and opens a pull request containing specially crafted changes (e.g. modifying inputs or adding unexpected characters) in areas referenced by the workflow.
      2. Because the workflow is triggered by `pull_request_target`, it runs with the base branch’s full configuration and secret environment variables rather than using a sanitized configuration from the pull request itself.
      3. If the workflow does not properly validate or segregate untrusted inputs, its logs or outputs can inadvertently reveal sensitive secrets (such as deployment tokens or API keys).
  - **Impact:**
    If exploited, an attacker could force the workflow to emit sensitive repository secrets into the logs or other outputs. With these secrets compromised, the attacker might impersonate privileged services, modify deployments, or otherwise compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the repository and its infrastructure.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The workflows pin custom action versions using fixed commit hashes to reduce tampering risk.
    - The trigger events are narrowly specified (for example, only on certain PR events) to mitigate some input abuse.
    However, these measures do not overcome the intrinsic risk of running privileged steps on pull-request data.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Switching the workflow trigger from `pull_request_target` to `pull_request` so that untrusted contributions do not run privileged code.
    - Alternatively, restructuring the workflow so that only a safe subset of steps (which do not have access to secrets) process untrusted data, with privileged actions separated and executed only on trusted input.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The repository accepts pull requests from external contributors or forks.
    - Workflows are configured to trigger on the `pull_request_target` event, meaning that even untrusted pull request data is processed with trusted configuration and secrets.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    The vulnerability is not found in the bulk of the server, client, test, or syntaxes source code but in the GitHub Actions workflow configuration (present in earlier batches of files). In the current set of project files, all server‑side language service logic, client commands, file and grammar utility code, and integration tests were found to be implemented following robust best practices. No additional dynamic processing of untrusted external input (such as unsanitized markdown processing, unsafe evaluation of user input, or insecure deserialization) was detected.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. From an external fork, submit a pull request with a commit that deliberately injects unexpected or malicious content in areas of the repository referenced by workflow steps.
    2. Observe that the workflow is triggered using the `pull_request_target` event and note that it runs with access to the base branch’s secrets.
    3. Check the job logs (and any other outputs) to verify that secret values (or portions thereof) are disclosed.
    4. As a remediation test, modify the workflow trigger (e.g. use `pull_request` or separate unprivileged steps) and confirm that attempts to trigger secret-exposing behavior are thwarted.
