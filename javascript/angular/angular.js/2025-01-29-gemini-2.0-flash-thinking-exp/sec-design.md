# BUSINESS POSTURE

The AngularJS project is an open-source JavaScript framework designed to simplify the development and testing of web applications. It provides a structured approach to building dynamic web applications, primarily Single Page Applications (SPAs).

Business Priorities and Goals:

- Goal: Provide a comprehensive and user-friendly framework for building dynamic web applications.
- Goal: Enable developers to create maintainable and testable front-end code.
- Goal: Foster a strong community around the framework to ensure its continued development and support.
- Priority: Maintain the stability and reliability of the framework for existing applications.
- Priority: Address critical security vulnerabilities promptly to maintain user trust.

Business Risks:

- Business Risk: Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to exploitation of applications built with AngularJS, resulting in data breaches, service disruption, or reputational damage.
- Business Risk: Lack of community support or maintainer burnout could lead to slow response times for bug fixes and security patches, impacting users.
- Business Risk:  Framework obsolescence as newer technologies emerge, potentially leading to reduced adoption and eventual decline in relevance.
- Business Risk: Compatibility issues with modern browsers and evolving web standards could require significant refactoring and maintenance efforts.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

- security control: Open Source Code - The AngularJS codebase is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny, which can help identify potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
- security control: Community Contributions - Security vulnerabilities and bug fixes are often identified and contributed by the open-source community. Implemented: GitHub pull requests and issue tracking.
- security control: Standard Web Security Practices - Applications built with AngularJS are expected to follow standard web security practices, such as input validation, output encoding, and secure communication (HTTPS). Implemented: Developer responsibility when building applications.

Accepted Risks:

- accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Contributions - The project relies on the community to identify and report security vulnerabilities. The speed and effectiveness of vulnerability discovery and patching are dependent on community engagement.
- accepted risk: Third-Party Dependencies - AngularJS relies on third-party libraries and tools (though minimized in core). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies could indirectly affect AngularJS applications. Mitigation: Dependency updates and scanning (generally expected from developers using the framework).
- accepted risk: Client-Side Execution - As a client-side framework, AngularJS code executes in the user's browser, making it susceptible to client-side attacks if applications are not developed securely. Mitigation: Developer responsibility for secure application development.

Recommended Security Controls:

- recommended security control: Security Audits - Periodic security audits of the AngularJS framework codebase by security experts to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - A clear and public vulnerability disclosure policy to guide security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
- recommended security control: Automated Security Scanning - Integrate automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) into the development and release process to detect vulnerabilities early.
- recommended security control: Security focused documentation - Provide clear and comprehensive security guidelines and best practices for developers building applications with AngularJS.

Security Requirements:

- Authentication: AngularJS itself does not handle authentication. Authentication is the responsibility of the backend services and the applications built using AngularJS. Security Requirement: Applications built with AngularJS must integrate with secure authentication mechanisms provided by backend services.
- Authorization: AngularJS itself does not handle authorization. Authorization logic resides in the backend services. Security Requirement: Applications built with AngularJS must securely interact with backend authorization services to control access to resources and functionalities.
- Input Validation: AngularJS applications must perform input validation to prevent client-side vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Security Requirement: Implement robust input validation on the client-side within AngularJS applications, especially when handling user-provided data.
- Cryptography: AngularJS itself does not provide cryptographic primitives. Cryptographic operations should ideally be handled by secure backend services. Security Requirement: If client-side cryptography is necessary within AngularJS applications, utilize well-vetted and secure JavaScript crypto libraries. Ensure sensitive cryptographic keys are not exposed client-side. Security Requirement: Secure communication (HTTPS) must be enforced for all communication between the browser and backend services.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

- Critical Business Process: Development and maintenance of the AngularJS framework itself. Disruption or compromise of this process would impact all users of AngularJS.
- Critical Business Process: Distribution of the AngularJS framework to developers and end-users. Compromised distribution channels could lead to the delivery of malicious code.
- Critical Business Process: Secure development of applications using AngularJS. Vulnerabilities in applications built with AngularJS can directly impact businesses relying on these applications.

Data Sensitivity:

- Data Sensitivity (AngularJS Framework): The AngularJS framework code itself is public and not sensitive in terms of confidentiality. Integrity and availability are critical. Tampering with the framework code or making it unavailable would be a significant security incident.
- Data Sensitivity (Applications built with AngularJS): Data sensitivity depends entirely on the specific applications built using AngularJS. Applications can handle highly sensitive data (e.g., personal data, financial data, health records). The security of AngularJS applications is crucial to protect this sensitive data.
