# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a robust and efficient framework for building dynamic web applications.
*   Maintain backward compatibility while introducing new features and improvements.
*   Foster a large and active community of developers.
*   Ensure the framework remains relevant and competitive in the evolving web development landscape.
*   Simplify the development of complex web applications, reducing development time and cost.
*   Provide a structured approach to web application development, promoting maintainability and scalability.

Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the framework could expose applications built with it to attacks, leading to data breaches and reputational damage.
*   Performance issues or instability could negatively impact the user experience of applications built with the framework.
*   Lack of adoption or a decline in community support could lead to the framework becoming obsolete.
*   Failure to keep up with evolving web standards and technologies could render the framework less relevant.
*   Competition from other JavaScript frameworks could reduce market share.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Regular security audits and code reviews (mentioned throughout the repository's commit history and contribution guidelines).
*   security control: Sanitization of user inputs to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks (documented in the security guidelines and implemented in the core framework).
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) compatibility (discussed in documentation and implemented in parts of the framework).
*   security control: Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) to prevent XSS in different contexts (documented and implemented).
*   security control: Regular updates and patches to address security vulnerabilities (evident in the release history).
*   security control: Community involvement in identifying and reporting security issues (encouraged through contribution guidelines).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries, which may introduce their own security vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Potential for developers to introduce security vulnerabilities in their applications despite the framework's built-in security features.
*   accepted risk: Backward compatibility requirements may limit the implementation of certain security enhancements.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a comprehensive and automated security testing pipeline, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, and dependency scanning.
*   security control: Provide more detailed and prescriptive security guidance for developers using the framework.
*   security control: Establish a formal vulnerability disclosure program.
*   security control: Conduct regular penetration testing of the framework.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: The framework itself does not handle authentication directly, but it should provide mechanisms to integrate with various authentication systems securely.
*   Authorization: The framework should facilitate the implementation of role-based access control (RBAC) and other authorization schemes.
*   Input Validation: All user inputs must be strictly validated and sanitized to prevent XSS, SQL injection, and other injection attacks.
*   Cryptography: The framework should provide secure defaults for cryptographic operations, such as hashing passwords and encrypting sensitive data. It should also allow developers to easily integrate with secure cryptographic libraries.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  Traditional Web Server (Apache, Nginx): The AngularJS application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript files) is deployed to a web server, which serves the files to users' browsers.
2.  Cloud-Based Hosting (AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage): The application files are stored in a cloud storage service and served directly to users' browsers, often in conjunction with a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
3.  Platform as a Service (PaaS) (Heroku, Netlify, Vercel): The application is deployed to a PaaS provider, which handles the underlying infrastructure and scaling.

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Commits code" --> GitRepo["Git Repository (GitHub)"]
    GitRepo -- "Trigger" --> CI["CI/CD Pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions)"]
    CI -- "Runs tests" --> Tests["Unit & E2E Tests"]
    CI -- "Builds application" --> Build["Build Process (e.g., npm, Grunt, Gulp)"]
    Build -- "Scans code" --> SAST["SAST Scanner"]
    Build -- "Generates artifacts" --> Artifacts["Application Artifacts (JS, CSS, HTML)"]
    CI -- "Deploys" --> Artifacts

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write and commit code to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  The CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) is triggered by code commits.
3.  The CI pipeline runs unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests to ensure code quality.
4.  The build process (using tools like npm, Grunt, or Gulp) compiles and bundles the application code.
5.  A Static Application Security Testing (SAST) scanner analyzes the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
6.  The build process generates the application artifacts (minified JavaScript, CSS, and HTML files).
7.  The CI pipeline deploys the artifacts to the target environment (e.g., cloud storage).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Git repository access control: Restricting access to the codebase to authorized developers.
*   security control: CI/CD pipeline security: Securing the CI/CD pipeline itself to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.
*   security control: Unit and E2E testing: Automated tests to identify bugs and potential security vulnerabilities early in the development process.
*   security control: SAST scanning: Static analysis to detect security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Dependency management: Using tools to manage and scan third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Artifact signing: Digitally signing the build artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing a reliable and secure framework for web application development.
*   Maintaining a strong community and ecosystem around the framework.
*   Ensuring the framework remains competitive and relevant.

Data to Protect:

*   Source code of the framework (sensitivity: medium): Protecting the intellectual property of the framework.
*   User data processed by applications built with the framework (sensitivity: varies, potentially high): This depends on the specific applications, but could include personally identifiable information (PII), financial data, or other sensitive information. The framework itself does not store this data, but vulnerabilities in the framework could be exploited to access it.
*   Documentation and community resources (sensitivity: low): Ensuring the availability and integrity of resources for developers using the framework.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
