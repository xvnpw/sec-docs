# Deep Analysis of AngularJS Attack Tree Path: [C4] Misuse of AngularJS Directives/Services

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the security risks associated with the misuse of AngularJS directives and services, particularly focusing on `ng-bind-html` and its potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.  We aim to identify common insecure coding patterns, provide concrete examples of exploitation, and recommend robust mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to equip the development team with the knowledge to prevent these vulnerabilities in our application.

### 1.2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following:

*   **AngularJS (v1.x):**  We are specifically analyzing applications built using AngularJS (version 1.x), *not* Angular (2+).
*   **`ng-bind-html` Directive:**  The primary focus is on the insecure use of `ng-bind-html` and its direct link to XSS.
*   **Custom Directives:**  We will examine how custom directives that handle user input and manipulate the DOM can inadvertently introduce XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Relevant Services (Indirectly):**  While the primary focus is on directives, we will briefly touch upon how services like `$http` can contribute to related vulnerabilities (e.g., URL manipulation) if misused.  However, this is secondary to the directive-based XSS analysis.
*   **Client-Side Vulnerabilities:**  This analysis concentrates on client-side vulnerabilities that can be exploited through the browser.

### 1.3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Definition:**  Clearly define the vulnerability, its root cause, and its potential impact.
2.  **Code Review:**  Analyze example code snippets (both vulnerable and secure) to illustrate the problem and its solution.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describe realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit the vulnerability, including the attacker's input and the resulting impact.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  Provide detailed, actionable recommendations for preventing the vulnerability, including code examples and best practices.
5.  **Testing Recommendations:**  Suggest specific testing techniques to identify and verify the presence or absence of the vulnerability.
6.  **Tooling:** Recommend tools that can assist in identifying and mitigating these vulnerabilities.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: [C4] Misuse of AngularJS Directives/Services

### 2.1. Vulnerability Definition:  XSS via `ng-bind-html` and Custom Directives

**Root Cause:**  The core issue is the direct rendering of unsanitized user-supplied HTML content into the DOM.  AngularJS's `ng-bind-html` directive, when used without proper sanitization, provides a direct pathway for attackers to inject malicious JavaScript code.  Similarly, custom directives that directly concatenate user input into the DOM without escaping create the same vulnerability.

**Impact:**  Successful exploitation of an XSS vulnerability can lead to:

*   **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing user session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
*   **Data Theft:**  Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data displayed on the page or stored in the browser's local storage.
*   **Website Defacement:**  Modifying the content of the webpage to display malicious or misleading information.
*   **Phishing Attacks:**  Redirecting users to fake login pages to steal their credentials.
*   **Malware Distribution:**  Delivering malware to the user's browser.
*   **Keylogging:**  Capturing user keystrokes, including passwords and other sensitive information.

### 2.2. Code Review and Exploitation Scenarios

**2.2.1. `ng-bind-html` Vulnerability**

**Vulnerable Code (Controller):**

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .controller('MyController', ['$scope', function($scope) {
    // Assume this comes from user input (e.g., a comment form)
    $scope.userComment = "<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS!\")'>";
  }]);
```

**Vulnerable Code (HTML):**

```html
<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="MyController">
  <div ng-bind-html="userComment"></div>
</div>
```

**Exploitation:**

1.  **Attacker Input:** The attacker provides the following input: `<img src='x' onerror='alert("XSS!")'>`.  This is a common XSS payload that uses an invalid image source (`src='x'`) to trigger the `onerror` event, which executes the JavaScript code.
2.  **Rendering:** AngularJS renders the `userComment` directly into the DOM using `ng-bind-html`.
3.  **Execution:** The browser encounters the `<img>` tag, attempts to load the invalid image, and triggers the `onerror` event.  The `alert("XSS!")` JavaScript code is executed, demonstrating the XSS vulnerability.

**2.2.2. Custom Directive Vulnerability**

**Vulnerable Code:**

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .directive('myDirective', function() {
    return {
      restrict: 'E',
      scope: {
        userInput: '='
      },
      link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
        // DANGEROUS: Directly concatenating user input into the DOM
        element.html('<div>' + scope.userInput + '</div>');
      }
    };
  });
```

**HTML Usage:**

```html
<my-directive user-input="attackerControlledData"></my-directive>
```

**Exploitation:**

1.  **Attacker Input:**  The attacker controls the value of `attackerControlledData`, providing a malicious payload like `<script>alert('XSS from custom directive');</script>`.
2.  **Direct Concatenation:** The `link` function of the custom directive directly concatenates the `userInput` into the DOM using `element.html()`.
3.  **Execution:** The browser parses the injected HTML, including the `<script>` tag, and executes the malicious JavaScript code.

### 2.3. Mitigation Strategies

**2.3.1.  Use `$sce` (Strict Contextual Escaping) with `ng-bind-html`**

AngularJS provides the `$sce` service for strict contextual escaping.  This is the **recommended** approach for sanitizing HTML content before using `ng-bind-html`.

**Secure Code (Controller):**

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .controller('MyController', ['$scope', '$sce', function($scope, $sce) {
    // Assume this comes from user input
    let rawComment = "<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS!\")'>";

    // Sanitize the HTML using $sce.trustAsHtml
    $scope.userComment = $sce.trustAsHtml(rawComment);
  }]);
```

**Explanation:**

*   `$sce.trustAsHtml(rawComment)`: This function explicitly marks the `rawComment` as "trusted" HTML.  However, `$sce` performs contextual escaping *before* marking it as trusted.  It understands the context (HTML) and escapes potentially dangerous characters and tags.  It will effectively neutralize the XSS payload.
*   **Important:**  `$sce` is not a "magic bullet."  It relies on AngularJS's built-in sanitization rules.  While generally effective, it's crucial to keep AngularJS updated to the latest version to benefit from the most recent security patches.

**2.3.2.  Use `ng-bind` for Plain Text**

If you only need to display plain text, use `ng-bind` instead of `ng-bind-html`.  `ng-bind` automatically escapes HTML entities, preventing XSS.

```html
<div ng-bind="userComment"></div>  <!-- Safe for plain text -->
```

**2.3.3.  Sanitize in Custom Directives**

For custom directives, *never* directly concatenate user input into the DOM.  Use AngularJS's built-in sanitization mechanisms or a trusted third-party sanitization library.

**Secure Code (Custom Directive):**

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .directive('myDirective', function($sce) {
    return {
      restrict: 'E',
      scope: {
        userInput: '='
      },
      link: function(scope, element, attrs) {
        // Sanitize the input using $sce
        let sanitizedInput = $sce.trustAsHtml(scope.userInput);
        element.html(sanitizedInput);
      }
    };
  });
```

**2.3.4.  Use a Trusted Sanitization Library (e.g., DOMPurify)**

For more robust sanitization, especially if you need to allow a specific subset of HTML tags and attributes, consider using a dedicated sanitization library like DOMPurify.

**Example with DOMPurify (Controller):**

```javascript
angular.module('myApp', [])
  .controller('MyController', ['$scope', '$sce', function($scope, $sce) {
      let rawComment = "<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS!\")'><b>Bold Text</b>";
      // Sanitize using DOMPurify, allowing only <b> tags
      let sanitizedComment = DOMPurify.sanitize(rawComment, { ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b'] });
      $scope.userComment = $sce.trustAsHtml(sanitizedComment);
  }]);
```

**2.3.5. Content Security Policy (CSP)**

Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities even if they exist.  CSP allows you to define a whitelist of sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.).  A well-configured CSP can prevent the execution of injected scripts.

**Example CSP Header:**

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com;
```

This CSP allows scripts to be loaded only from the same origin (`'self'`) and a trusted CDN.  It would block the execution of inline scripts injected via an XSS attack.

### 2.4. Testing Recommendations

*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Manually attempt to inject XSS payloads into all input fields and areas where user-provided data is displayed.  Use a variety of payloads, including those that test for common bypass techniques.
*   **Automated Security Scanners:**  Use automated web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.  These tools can automatically fuzz input fields and detect reflected or stored XSS.
*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for your controllers and directives that specifically test the sanitization logic.  These tests should verify that malicious input is properly escaped or sanitized.
*   **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**  Include E2E tests that simulate user interactions and verify that XSS vulnerabilities are not present in the rendered application.
*   **Code Reviews:**  Conduct thorough code reviews, paying close attention to the use of `ng-bind-html`, custom directives, and any other areas where user input is handled.

### 2.5 Tooling
* **OWASP ZAP:** An open-source web application security scanner that can be used to identify XSS vulnerabilities.
* **Burp Suite:** A commercial web security testing tool with a powerful proxy and scanner that can detect XSS and other vulnerabilities.
* **DOMPurify:** A fast, robust, and widely-used JavaScript library for sanitizing HTML.
* **ESLint with security plugins:** Use ESLint with plugins like `eslint-plugin-security` and `eslint-plugin-angular` to detect potential security issues in your AngularJS code.
* **RetireJS:** A tool that can detect the use of outdated JavaScript libraries with known vulnerabilities.

## 3. Conclusion

The misuse of AngularJS directives, particularly `ng-bind-html`, and custom directives that handle user input without proper sanitization, poses a significant XSS risk.  By understanding the vulnerability, implementing robust mitigation strategies (using `$sce`, DOMPurify, and CSP), and employing thorough testing techniques, developers can effectively prevent these vulnerabilities and build more secure AngularJS applications.  Regular security audits and staying up-to-date with the latest AngularJS security patches are also crucial for maintaining a strong security posture.
