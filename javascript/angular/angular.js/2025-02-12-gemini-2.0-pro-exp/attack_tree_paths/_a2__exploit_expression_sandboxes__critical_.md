# Deep Analysis: AngularJS Expression Sandbox Exploits ([A2] in Attack Tree)

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   Understand the historical vulnerabilities related to AngularJS expression sandboxes.
*   Identify the specific techniques used to bypass these sandboxes.
*   Assess the risk posed by these vulnerabilities to applications still using vulnerable AngularJS versions.
*   Provide clear guidance on mitigation strategies, primarily emphasizing upgrading to a secure version.
*   Educate the development team on the importance of staying up-to-date with framework security and the dangers of relying on deprecated security mechanisms.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the **[A2] Exploit Expression Sandboxes** attack tree path.  It covers:

*   **Vulnerable AngularJS Versions:** Primarily versions prior to 1.6, with a particular emphasis on versions known to have exploitable sandbox escapes (e.g., 1.0.x - 1.5.x).  We will highlight specific versions where known exploits exist.
*   **Exploitation Techniques:**  We will examine the common methods used to bypass the sandbox, including `constructor` property manipulation, function call manipulation, and other context-escaping techniques.
*   **Impact:**  We will analyze the potential consequences of successful sandbox escapes, such as arbitrary JavaScript execution, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and data exfiltration.
*   **Mitigation:**  We will focus on the *primary* mitigation strategy: upgrading to a secure AngularJS version (1.6+ or, ideally, migrating to Angular 2+).  We will briefly touch on *temporary* mitigations (which are strongly discouraged) for context.
*   **Detection:** We will discuss how to identify if an application is using a vulnerable version of AngularJS.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other AngularJS vulnerabilities unrelated to the expression sandbox.
*   Vulnerabilities in Angular (2+).
*   General XSS prevention techniques beyond the scope of this specific vulnerability.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will be conducted using the following methodology:

1.  **Literature Review:**  We will review existing security research, blog posts, CVE entries, and AngularJS documentation related to sandbox escapes.  This includes examining known exploit payloads and the underlying vulnerabilities they target.
2.  **Code Analysis:** We will analyze the relevant AngularJS source code (from vulnerable versions) to understand how the sandbox was implemented and where its weaknesses lie.
3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Recreation (Optional & Controlled):**  *If necessary and in a strictly controlled environment*, we may attempt to recreate known exploits to gain a deeper understanding of their mechanics.  This will *not* be performed on any production or staging systems.
4.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  The findings will be documented in this report, providing clear explanations, examples, and actionable recommendations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of [A2] Exploit Expression Sandboxes

### 4.1. The AngularJS Expression Sandbox (Historical Context)

AngularJS, in its earlier versions (pre-1.6), attempted to provide a degree of security by restricting the capabilities of JavaScript expressions evaluated within templates.  This was done through a mechanism called the "expression sandbox." The intention was to prevent malicious code injected into templates (e.g., through user input) from accessing sensitive global objects (like `window` or `document`) or executing arbitrary JavaScript.

The sandbox worked by:

*   **Restricting Access to Globals:**  It created a limited scope where only a subset of JavaScript features and objects were available.  Direct access to `window`, `document`, and other global objects was supposed to be blocked.
*   **Parsing and Evaluating Expressions:**  AngularJS parsed the expressions within templates and evaluated them within this restricted context.
*   **Blacklisting/Whitelisting:**  The sandbox used a combination of blacklisting (preventing access to specific properties and methods) and whitelisting (allowing access to a limited set of safe functions) to enforce its restrictions.

### 4.2. Sandbox Bypass Techniques

Despite these efforts, researchers repeatedly found ways to bypass the AngularJS sandbox.  These bypasses generally fell into the following categories:

*   **`constructor` Property Manipulation:**  This was a very common technique.  Many objects in JavaScript have a `constructor` property that refers to the function that created them.  By accessing the `constructor` property of an allowed object, attackers could often gain access to the `Function` constructor, which could then be used to create and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

    **Example (Conceptual):**

    ```javascript
    {{ {}.constructor.constructor('alert(1)')() }}
    ```
    This attempts to access the constructor of an empty object (`{}`), then the constructor of *that* constructor (which is `Function`), and finally uses `Function` to create a new function that executes `alert(1)`.

*   **Function Call Manipulation:**  Attackers exploited the way AngularJS handled function calls within expressions.  By carefully crafting function calls and their arguments, they could sometimes trick the sandbox into executing code outside of its intended context.  This often involved using functions like `call`, `apply`, or `bind` in unexpected ways.

    **Example (Conceptual):**
    ```javascript
    {{ a.b.c.call(null, 'alert(1)') }}
    ```
    If `a.b.c` resolved to a function, and the sandbox didn't properly restrict the `call` method, this could execute `alert(1)`.

*   **Prototype Pollution:**  In some cases, attackers could modify the prototype of built-in objects (like `Object` or `Array`) to inject malicious code that would be executed when those objects were used within expressions.

*   **Exploiting Specific AngularJS Functions:**  Some AngularJS-specific functions, if not properly secured, could be used to escape the sandbox.  This often involved exploiting internal AngularJS APIs or undocumented features.

*   **Version-Specific Exploits:**  Many exploits were specific to particular AngularJS versions.  As AngularJS developers patched vulnerabilities, new bypasses were often discovered, leading to a "cat-and-mouse" game.

### 4.3. Impact of Successful Sandbox Escapes

A successful sandbox escape typically resulted in:

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:**  The attacker could execute any JavaScript code they wanted within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  This is the most common consequence.  The attacker could inject malicious scripts that steal cookies, redirect users to phishing sites, deface the website, or perform other harmful actions.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker could access and steal sensitive data displayed on the page or stored in the application's scope.
*   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker could potentially crash the user's browser or make the application unusable.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

The **only reliable mitigation** is to **upgrade to AngularJS 1.6 or later (or, ideally, migrate to Angular 2+)**.  AngularJS 1.6 removed the expression sandbox entirely, recognizing that it was fundamentally flawed and could not be reliably secured.

**Strongly Discouraged (Temporary & Insecure) Workarounds:**

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  While CSP is a good security practice in general, it's *not* a reliable defense against sandbox escapes.  A well-crafted exploit can often bypass CSP restrictions.  CSP should be used as a *defense-in-depth* measure, not as a primary defense against this specific vulnerability.
*   **Input Sanitization/Validation:**  While important, relying solely on input sanitization to prevent sandbox escapes is extremely risky.  It's very difficult to anticipate all possible exploit vectors.
*   **Custom Sandbox Patches:**  Attempting to patch the sandbox yourself is *highly discouraged*.  It's likely to introduce new vulnerabilities and is unlikely to be effective against determined attackers.

**Key Takeaway:**  Upgrading is the *only* way to truly eliminate the risk of sandbox escapes.

### 4.5. Detection

To determine if your application is vulnerable:

1.  **Check `angular.version`:**  In your browser's developer console, type `angular.version`.  This will display the AngularJS version being used.  If it's less than 1.6, your application is vulnerable.
2.  **Examine `package.json` or `bower.json`:**  Look for the AngularJS dependency in your project's dependency management files.  This will also indicate the version being used.
3.  **Static Code Analysis:**  Use static code analysis tools that can detect the use of older AngularJS versions and potentially flag vulnerable code patterns.
4. **Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing, specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities, to identify if the application is susceptible to sandbox escapes.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

AngularJS expression sandboxes were a flawed security mechanism that has been repeatedly bypassed.  Applications still using vulnerable versions of AngularJS (pre-1.6) are at high risk of XSS attacks.  The **only effective mitigation** is to **upgrade to a secure version (1.6+) or migrate to a modern framework like Angular (2+)**.  Relying on workarounds or custom patches is strongly discouraged.  The development team should prioritize upgrading as soon as possible to eliminate this critical vulnerability.  This upgrade should be treated as a high-priority security issue.
