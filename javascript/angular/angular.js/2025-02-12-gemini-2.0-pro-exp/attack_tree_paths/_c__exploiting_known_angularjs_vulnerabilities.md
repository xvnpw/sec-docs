Okay, let's dive into a deep analysis of the attack tree path "[C] Exploiting Known AngularJS Vulnerabilities" for an application using AngularJS (specifically, the `angular.js` library, not the newer Angular framework).

## Deep Analysis of "Exploiting Known AngularJS Vulnerabilities"

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, understand, and propose mitigation strategies for known vulnerabilities within the AngularJS library that could be exploited by an attacker to compromise the application.  We aim to reduce the attack surface related to these specific vulnerabilities.  This is *not* a general AngularJS security audit, but a focused look at *known* issues.

**Scope:**

*   **Target:**  Applications built using `angular.js` (versions 1.x).  We are *not* analyzing Angular (2+).
*   **Vulnerability Focus:**  Publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs - Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures), documented exploits, and known weaknesses in `angular.js`.  This includes, but is not limited to:
    *   Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) / Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Sandbox Escapes
    *   Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
    *   Vulnerabilities in specific AngularJS modules (e.g., `ngSanitize`, `$sce`)
*   **Exclusion:**  This analysis does *not* cover:
    *   Vulnerabilities in the application's custom code (unless directly related to a known AngularJS vulnerability).
    *   Vulnerabilities in server-side components (unless the AngularJS vulnerability facilitates exploitation).
    *   General security best practices unrelated to known AngularJS vulnerabilities.
    *   Vulnerabilities in third-party libraries *other than* `angular.js` itself (though interactions with AngularJS vulnerabilities will be considered).

**Methodology:**

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**
    *   Consult vulnerability databases (NVD - National Vulnerability Database, Snyk, OWASP, etc.) for known AngularJS CVEs.
    *   Review security advisories and blog posts from security researchers and the AngularJS team.
    *   Analyze exploit code and proof-of-concepts (PoCs) where available.
    *   Identify the affected AngularJS versions for each vulnerability.

2.  **Version Identification:**
    *   Determine the *exact* version of `angular.js` used by the application.  This is crucial, as many vulnerabilities are version-specific.  This can be done by:
        *   Inspecting the application's source code (look for `<script>` tags referencing `angular.js`).
        *   Checking the `bower.json` or `package.json` file (if used).
        *   Using browser developer tools (Network tab) to identify the loaded `angular.js` file.
        *   Using `angular.version` in the browser's JavaScript console.

3.  **Vulnerability Impact Assessment:**
    *   For each identified vulnerability, assess its potential impact on the *specific* application.  Consider:
        *   What data could be accessed or modified?
        *   What actions could an attacker perform?
        *   What is the likelihood of exploitation (considering the application's context and user input handling)?
        *   What is the severity (High, Medium, Low) based on CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) scores and the application's context?

4.  **Exploit Scenario Analysis:**
    *   For high-impact vulnerabilities, develop realistic exploit scenarios demonstrating how an attacker could leverage the vulnerability in the context of the application.  This helps understand the attack vector and potential consequences.

5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**
    *   For each vulnerability, propose specific and actionable mitigation strategies.  These may include:
        *   Upgrading to a patched version of `angular.js`.
        *   Implementing workarounds (if an upgrade is not immediately feasible).
        *   Applying secure coding practices to prevent the vulnerability from being triggered.
        *   Using security-focused AngularJS features (e.g., `$sce`, `ngSanitize` â€“ but being aware of their limitations and potential bypasses).
        *   Implementing additional security controls (e.g., Content Security Policy (CSP), input validation, output encoding).

6.  **Documentation:**
    *   Clearly document all findings, including vulnerability details, impact assessment, exploit scenarios, and mitigation recommendations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

Now, let's proceed with the deep analysis, assuming we've completed the initial research and version identification steps.  We'll focus on some of the most common and impactful AngularJS vulnerabilities.

**2.1. Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) / XSS**

*   **Vulnerability Description:** AngularJS's template engine can be vulnerable to CSTI if user-supplied data is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization.  This allows an attacker to inject malicious AngularJS expressions, which are then evaluated by the client-side engine, leading to XSS.

*   **Affected Versions:**  Many versions of AngularJS 1.x are vulnerable, particularly older versions.  The severity and exploitability depend on the specific version and how user input is handled.

*   **Example (Simplified):**

    ```html
    <div ng-app>
      <input type="text" ng-model="userInput">
      <p>{{userInput}}</p> 
    </div>
    ```

    If an attacker enters `{{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}` into the input field, this AngularJS expression will be evaluated, resulting in an alert box (demonstrating XSS).  The `constructor.constructor` trick is a common way to bypass some basic sanitization attempts.

*   **Impact Assessment:**  High.  XSS allows attackers to:
    *   Steal user cookies and session tokens.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the application.
    *   Perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Access sensitive data displayed on the page.

*   **Exploit Scenario:**  An attacker could craft a malicious link or embed the malicious input in a comment field, forum post, or any other area where user input is displayed without proper sanitization.

*   **Mitigation Recommendations:**

    *   **Upgrade:** Upgrade to the latest patched version of AngularJS 1.x (if possible).  Later versions have improved sanitization and security features.
    *   **`ng-bind`:** Use `ng-bind` instead of double curly braces (`{{ }}`) for displaying user input whenever possible.  `ng-bind` is less susceptible to CSTI.
        ```html
        <p ng-bind="userInput"></p> 
        ```
    *   **`$sce` (Strict Contextual Escaping):** Use `$sce` to explicitly mark data as trusted or untrusted.  This helps AngularJS apply the appropriate escaping based on the context (HTML, URL, CSS, etc.).  However, `$sce` is *not* a silver bullet and can be bypassed if misused.
        ```javascript
        // In your controller
        $scope.userInput = $sce.trustAsHtml(userInput); // Only if you *know* userInput is safe HTML!
        ```
    *   **`ngSanitize`:** Use the `ngSanitize` module to sanitize HTML input.  This module provides functions like `$sanitize` to remove potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes.  However, `ngSanitize` has had its own vulnerabilities in the past, so ensure you're using a patched version and understand its limitations.
        ```html
        <div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">
          <div ng-bind-html="safeHtml"></div>
        </div>

        <script>
        angular.module('myApp', ['ngSanitize'])
        .controller('myCtrl', function($scope, $sanitize) {
          $scope.safeHtml = $sanitize(userInput); // Sanitize the input
        });
        </script>
        ```
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed.  This can help mitigate the impact of XSS even if a vulnerability exists.  A CSP with `script-src 'self'` would prevent inline scripts (like those injected via CSTI) from executing.
    *   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:**  Always validate user input on the server-side and encode output appropriately when displaying it in the application.  This is a general security best practice that complements AngularJS-specific mitigations.
    * **Avoid `angular.element(userInput).append/prepend/after/before`**: Avoid using angular.element with user input, because it can lead to XSS.

**2.2. Sandbox Escapes**

*   **Vulnerability Description:** AngularJS's "sandbox" was designed to restrict the scope of expressions and prevent access to potentially dangerous JavaScript objects and functions.  However, numerous sandbox escape vulnerabilities have been discovered over the years, allowing attackers to bypass these restrictions and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

*   **Affected Versions:**  Many versions of AngularJS 1.x, particularly before 1.6.  The sandbox was eventually removed in AngularJS 1.6 due to the difficulty of maintaining its security.

*   **Example (Conceptual):**  Sandbox escapes often involve exploiting subtle quirks in the AngularJS expression parser or leveraging properties of JavaScript objects to gain access to the global scope (`window`).  Specific exploit payloads vary depending on the AngularJS version.

*   **Impact Assessment:**  High.  Sandbox escapes effectively grant the attacker the same level of access as if they had injected arbitrary JavaScript code directly.

*   **Exploit Scenario:**  Similar to CSTI, an attacker could inject a malicious expression that escapes the sandbox and executes arbitrary code.

*   **Mitigation Recommendations:**

    *   **Upgrade to AngularJS 1.6 or later:**  The sandbox was removed in version 1.6, eliminating this entire class of vulnerabilities.  This is the *strongest* recommendation.
    *   **If upgrading is impossible:**  Ensure you are using the *absolute latest* patch release within your AngularJS 1.x minor version.  Some sandbox escapes were patched in later releases.  However, this is a *weak* mitigation, as new escapes may be discovered.
    *   **All other CSTI/XSS mitigations:**  The mitigations listed for CSTI (e.g., `ng-bind`, `$sce`, `ngSanitize`, CSP) also help mitigate sandbox escapes, as they reduce the likelihood of an attacker being able to inject a malicious expression in the first place.

**2.3. Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**

*   **Vulnerability Description:** AngularJS uses regular expressions in various parts of its code (e.g., routing, parsing).  Some of these regular expressions may be vulnerable to ReDoS, where a carefully crafted input string can cause the regular expression engine to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.

*   **Affected Versions:**  Specific versions and modules within AngularJS 1.x may be affected.  This requires careful analysis of the codebase and known CVEs.

*   **Example (Conceptual):**  A vulnerable regular expression might have a pattern with excessive backtracking or nested quantifiers.  An attacker could provide an input string that triggers this worst-case behavior.

*   **Impact Assessment:**  Medium to High.  A successful ReDoS attack can make the application unresponsive, affecting all users.

*   **Exploit Scenario:**  An attacker could submit a malicious input string through a form field, URL parameter, or other input vector that is processed by a vulnerable regular expression within AngularJS.

*   **Mitigation Recommendations:**

    *   **Upgrade:** Upgrade to a patched version of AngularJS that addresses any known ReDoS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Review Regular Expressions:**  If you are using custom directives or filters that interact with AngularJS's internal regular expressions, carefully review them for potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.  Use tools like regex101.com to analyze the complexity of your regular expressions.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation to limit the length and character set of user input, reducing the likelihood of triggering a ReDoS vulnerability.
    *   **Timeout Mechanisms:**  Consider implementing timeout mechanisms for regular expression processing to prevent them from running indefinitely.

**2.4 Other Vulnerabilities**
There are other vulnerabilities, like CVE-2020-28364, CVE-2019-14863, CVE-2018-1000613. Each of them should be analyzed in similar way.

### 3. Conclusion and Next Steps

This deep analysis provides a starting point for addressing known AngularJS vulnerabilities.  The key takeaways are:

*   **Upgrade is paramount:**  Upgrading to the latest version of AngularJS (ideally 1.6 or later) is the most effective way to mitigate many known vulnerabilities.
*   **Defense in depth:**  Employ multiple layers of security, including AngularJS-specific mitigations, secure coding practices, and general security controls (CSP, input validation, output encoding).
*   **Continuous monitoring:**  Stay informed about new AngularJS vulnerabilities and security advisories.  Regularly review your application's security posture.

**Next Steps:**

1.  **Prioritize Mitigations:** Based on the impact assessment and exploit scenarios, prioritize the mitigation recommendations.  Focus on high-impact vulnerabilities first.
2.  **Implement Mitigations:**  Work with the development team to implement the recommended mitigations.
3.  **Testing:**  Thoroughly test the application after implementing mitigations to ensure they are effective and do not introduce new issues.  Consider using automated security testing tools to help identify potential vulnerabilities.
4.  **Long-Term Strategy:** Develop a long-term strategy for managing AngularJS security, including plans for future upgrades and ongoing monitoring. Consider migrating away from AngularJS 1.x to a more modern and actively maintained framework (like Angular, React, or Vue.js) if feasible. This is the best long-term solution.
