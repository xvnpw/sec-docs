# Deep Analysis of Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) in AngularJS 1.x

## 1. Objective of Deep Analysis

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) / Expression Sandboxing Bypass attack surface in AngularJS 1.x applications.  The goal is to provide the development team with a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerability, its root causes, exploitation techniques, and, most importantly, robust and practical mitigation strategies.  This analysis will go beyond basic descriptions and delve into the specifics of AngularJS's internal mechanisms that contribute to this vulnerability.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on CSTI vulnerabilities within AngularJS 1.x applications.  It covers:

*   The AngularJS expression evaluation mechanism and its historical sandbox flaws.
*   Common and advanced exploitation techniques.
*   The interaction between client-side and server-side components in relation to CSTI.
*   Specific AngularJS directives and features that are relevant to CSTI (e.g., `{{ }}`, `ng-bind`, `ng-bind-html`, `$sce`).
*   Mitigation strategies, including both short-term fixes and long-term architectural changes.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other types of XSS vulnerabilities (e.g., DOM-based XSS unrelated to AngularJS expressions).
*   Vulnerabilities specific to Angular (v2+) or other JavaScript frameworks.
*   General web application security best practices outside the direct context of CSTI in AngularJS 1.x.

3.  **Vulnerability Reproduction:**  Construct practical examples of CSTI vulnerabilities in a controlled environment to demonstrate the exploitability and impact.
4.  **Mitigation Testing:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies by attempting to bypass them with known and novel attack vectors.
5.  **Expert Consultation:**  Leverage internal cybersecurity expertise and, if necessary, consult with external AngularJS security specialists.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

### 4.1. AngularJS Expression Evaluation and Sandboxing

AngularJS 1.x's core feature of data binding relies heavily on its expression evaluation mechanism.  Expressions within double curly braces (`{{ }}`), `ng-bind`, and other directives are parsed and evaluated by the `$parse` service.  Historically, AngularJS attempted to "sandbox" these expressions to prevent access to potentially dangerous JavaScript objects and functions (like `window`, `document`, etc.).  However, this sandbox was repeatedly bypassed, leading to numerous CSTI vulnerabilities.

**Key Concepts:**

*   **`$parse` Service:**  This service is responsible for parsing and compiling AngularJS expressions into functions that can be evaluated against a scope.
*   **Scope:**  A JavaScript object that represents the application model and provides the context for expression evaluation.
*   **Sandbox (Historically Flawed):**  The sandbox was an attempt to restrict the capabilities of evaluated expressions, preventing access to global objects and functions.  It relied on techniques like:
    *   Rewriting expressions to prevent access to certain properties (e.g., `constructor`, `__proto__`).
    *   Checking for potentially dangerous keywords.
    *   Limiting access to certain built-in functions.

**Why the Sandbox Failed:**

The sandbox was fundamentally flawed because it was a *blacklist* approach.  Attackers consistently found creative ways to circumvent the restrictions by:

*   **Property Access Obfuscation:**  Using alternative ways to access restricted properties (e.g., `['con' + 'structor']` instead of `constructor`).
*   **Exploiting Undocumented Features:**  Leveraging internal AngularJS functions or JavaScript quirks that were not considered by the sandbox.
*   **Chaining Properties:**  Constructing complex chains of property accesses to eventually reach the desired object (e.g., `a.b.c.constructor.constructor(...)`).

**Example Sandbox Escapes (Illustrative, not exhaustive):**

*   **Classic:** `{{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}` - Accesses the `Function` constructor through the `constructor` property of an object.
*   **Obfuscated:** `{{ {}['constr' + 'uctor']['constr' + 'uctor']('alert(2)')() }}` -  Similar to the classic escape, but with string concatenation to bypass simple keyword checks.
*   **Chained:** `{{ a={}, a.__proto__.b=1, a.__proto__.b.__proto__.c=2, a.b.c.constructor.constructor('alert(3)')() }}` -  Manipulates the prototype chain to eventually access the `Function` constructor.
*   **AngularJS-Specific:**  Exploits that leverage specific AngularJS internal functions or properties (these changed frequently between versions as vulnerabilities were discovered and patched).

### 4.2. Exploitation Techniques

Attackers can exploit CSTI in various ways, depending on where user input is reflected in the template:

*   **Direct Interpolation:**  The most common scenario, where user input is directly placed within double curly braces (`{{userInput}}`).
*   **`ng-bind`:**  Similar to direct interpolation, but using the `ng-bind` directive (`<span ng-bind="userInput"></span>`).
*   **`ng-bind-html` (Extremely Dangerous):**  This directive renders HTML, making it highly susceptible to CSTI if used with untrusted input.  Even sanitized HTML can be dangerous if the sanitization is not specifically designed to prevent AngularJS expression injection.
*   **Other Directives:**  Some custom directives or third-party libraries might inadvertently introduce CSTI vulnerabilities if they handle user input insecurely.
*   **Attribute Values:**  While less common, user input within attribute values can also be vulnerable if AngularJS expressions are allowed (e.g., `<a ng-href="{{userInput}}">`).

**Advanced Exploitation:**

Beyond simple `alert()` boxes, attackers can:

*   **Steal Cookies:**  Access `document.cookie` to steal session cookies.
*   **Exfiltrate Data:**  Send sensitive data (e.g., form data, API keys) to an attacker-controlled server using `XMLHttpRequest` or `fetch`.
*   **Modify the DOM:**  Manipulate the page content, inject malicious scripts, or redirect the user.
*   **Bypass CSRF Protection:**  If the CSRF token is accessible within the scope, the attacker can retrieve it and perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Keylogging:**  Capture user keystrokes and send them to the attacker.

### 4.3. Interaction with Server-Side Components

While CSTI is a client-side vulnerability, the server plays a crucial role in both enabling and mitigating it:

*   **Enabling CSTI:**  If the server does not properly validate and sanitize user input *before* sending it to the client, it creates the opportunity for CSTI.  This is the most common root cause.
*   **Mitigating CSTI:**
    *   **Server-Side Input Validation:**  The server *must* validate all user input to ensure it conforms to expected data types and formats.  This prevents unexpected characters or code from being injected.
    *   **Server-Side Sanitization:**  If the application needs to allow some HTML in user input, the server *must* use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove any potentially dangerous tags, attributes, or JavaScript code.  Crucially, this sanitization must be aware of AngularJS expressions and prevent their injection.  A standard HTML sanitizer might not be sufficient.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  The server can send a CSP header that restricts the browser's ability to execute inline scripts and load resources from untrusted sources.  A well-configured CSP can significantly limit the impact of a successful CSTI attack, even if the injection occurs.

### 4.4. AngularJS Directives and Features

*   **`{{ }}` (Interpolation):**  The primary vector for CSTI.
*   **`ng-bind`:**  A safer alternative to `{{ }}` for displaying text, but still vulnerable if the input contains AngularJS expressions.
*   **`ng-bind-html`:**  Extremely dangerous if used with untrusted input.  Should be avoided unless absolutely necessary, and even then, only with rigorous server-side sanitization specifically designed for AngularJS.
*   **`ng-bind-html-unsafe`:**  **Never use this directive with untrusted input.**  It completely bypasses any sanitization.
*   **`$sce` (Strict Contextual Escaping):**  Provides functions like `$sce.trustAsHtml`, `$sce.trustAsJs`, etc., to mark values as "safe" for specific contexts.  While useful, it's crucial to understand the risks and use it only when absolutely necessary.  Misuse of `$sce` can create vulnerabilities.
*   **`ng-non-bindable`:**  This directive can be used to prevent AngularJS from processing expressions within a specific element and its children.  Useful for displaying code snippets or other content that might contain AngularJS-like syntax.

### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

**1. Upgrade to Angular (v2+):** This is the *best* long-term solution. Angular (v2+) uses a completely different architecture that is inherently resistant to CSTI. It uses ahead-of-time (AOT) compilation and does not have a client-side template evaluation mechanism in the same way as AngularJS 1.x.

**2. Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) - Use with Caution:**

*   **`$sce.trustAsHtml`:**  Only use this if you *absolutely* need to render HTML from a trusted source.  Ensure the source is genuinely trustworthy and that the HTML is properly sanitized on the server.
*   **`$sce.trustAsJs`:**  Rarely needed.  Avoid if possible.
*   **`$sce.trustAsUrl`:**  Use for URLs that you control.
*   **`$sce.trustAsResourceUrl`:**  Use for URLs that point to resources (e.g., scripts, stylesheets) that you control.

**Example (Illustrative - Server-Side Sanitization is Still Essential):**

```javascript
// In your controller
$scope.safeHtml = $sce.trustAsHtml(sanitizedHtmlFromServer); // sanitizedHtmlFromServer MUST be sanitized on the server!

// In your template
<div ng-bind-html="safeHtml"></div>
```

**3. Avoid `ng-bind-html-unsafe`:**  Never use this directive with any data that might be influenced by user input.

**4. Content Security Policy (CSP):**

*   Implement a strong CSP, especially `script-src`.
*   **Avoid `unsafe-eval`:**  This directive allows the execution of dynamically generated code, which is exactly what CSTI exploits.
*   **Example CSP (Restrictive):**

    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; img-src 'self';
    ```

    This CSP allows scripts, styles, and images only from the same origin as the page.  You might need to adjust it based on your application's needs (e.g., if you use external libraries).  You can use `'nonce-<random-value>'` with inline scripts if necessary, but this requires careful management.

**5. Server-Side Input Validation & Sanitization:**

*   **Validate:**  Ensure all user input conforms to expected data types, lengths, and formats.  Reject any input that doesn't match.
*   **Sanitize:**  If you must allow HTML, use a robust HTML sanitization library *on the server*.  DOMPurify is a good choice.  Configure the sanitizer to specifically remove AngularJS expressions.
*   **Example (Node.js with DOMPurify):**

    ```javascript
    const DOMPurify = require('dompurify');
    const { JSDOM } = require('jsdom');

    const window = new JSDOM('').window;
    const purify = DOMPurify(window);

    const dirty = '<div ng-app>{{constructor.constructor(\'alert("XSS")\')()}}</div>';
    const clean = purify.sanitize(dirty, { FORBID_ATTR: ['ng-*'] , FORBID_TAGS: ['script']}); // Specifically forbid ng-* attributes

    console.log(clean); // Output: <div></div>
    ```

**6. Prefer `ng-bind` over Direct Interpolation:**  `ng-bind` is slightly less prone to accidental injection, but it's not a complete solution.  Server-side validation and sanitization are still essential.

**7. Use `ng-non-bindable` When Appropriate:**  If you have sections of your template that should not be processed by AngularJS (e.g., code examples), use `ng-non-bindable` to prevent accidental interpretation of expressions.

**8. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address any potential CSTI vulnerabilities.

**9. Keep AngularJS Updated (If You Must Use It):**  While AngularJS 1.x is no longer actively maintained, if you must use it, ensure you are using the latest patched version to minimize known vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

CSTI is a critical vulnerability in AngularJS 1.x applications.  The historical flaws in AngularJS's expression sandboxing make it inherently susceptible to this attack.  The most effective mitigation is to upgrade to Angular (v2+).  If that's not immediately possible, a combination of rigorous server-side input validation and sanitization, a strong Content Security Policy, and careful use of AngularJS's built-in security features (like `$sce`) is essential.  Developers must be acutely aware of the risks and avoid dangerous practices like using `ng-bind-html-unsafe` with untrusted input.  Regular security audits and penetration testing are crucial for identifying and addressing any remaining vulnerabilities.
