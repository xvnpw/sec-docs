# Threat Model Analysis for angular/angular.js

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) / Expression Injection](./threats/client-side_template_injection__csti___expression_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into AngularJS expressions (within `{{ }}`) that are evaluated directly in the user's browser by the `$interpolate` service. This occurs when user-controlled data is rendered within these expressions without proper sanitization. The attacker might manipulate input fields, URL parameters, or data stored on the server that is later rendered by the application.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This allows the attacker to steal cookies and session tokens, redirect the user to malicious websites, deface the application, perform actions on behalf of the user, or potentially install malware.

**Affected AngularJS Component:** `$interpolate` service (responsible for evaluating expressions), data binding mechanism.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid directly rendering user-controlled data within `{{ }}` expressions.**
* **Utilize AngularJS's built-in sanitization features by using the `$sce` service (specifically `$sce.trustAsHtml`, `$sce.trustAs`, etc.) judiciously and only when absolutely necessary after careful consideration.** Understand the security implications of marking data as trusted.
* **Use directives and filters to control how data is displayed and ensure proper escaping or sanitization.**
* **Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, limiting the impact of successful XSS.**
* **Upgrade to newer frameworks like Angular (without the `.js` suffix) which have built-in security measures to prevent CSTI by default.**

## Threat: [Unintended Data Exposure through Data Binding](./threats/unintended_data_exposure_through_data_binding.md)

**Description:** Due to AngularJS's two-way data binding, if sensitive data is bound to the view through the `$scope` without proper access controls, or if the scope is manipulated, an attacker might be able to observe or even modify data they shouldn't have access to. This could involve inspecting the DOM, manipulating form fields that are bound to the scope, or observing network requests where bound data is transmitted.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information to unauthorized users. This could include personal data, financial information, or internal application details. In some cases, it could also lead to the modification of application state or triggering unintended actions.

**Affected AngularJS Component:** Data binding mechanism, `$scope`, controllers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid binding sensitive data directly to the view if it's not absolutely necessary for display.**
* **Implement robust server-side access controls to ensure users can only access the data they are authorized to see.** Do not rely solely on client-side checks.
* **Use one-way data binding where appropriate to limit the ability of the view to modify the underlying data.**
* **Carefully manage the scope and avoid exposing more data than necessary.**
* **Thoroughly test the application with different user roles and permissions to identify potential data exposure issues.**

## Threat: [DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Insecure Directives](./threats/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss__through_insecure_directives.md)

**Description:** Custom directives in AngularJS have direct access to the DOM. If a directive manipulates the DOM using user-controlled data without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the user's browser. This can occur when directives dynamically create HTML elements or modify attributes based on user input received through attributes or transclusion.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, leading to the same consequences as reflected XSS (stealing cookies, redirection, etc.).

**Affected AngularJS Component:** Custom directives, `$compile` service (used for directive compilation).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Follow secure coding practices when developing custom directives.**
* **Sanitize user-controlled data before manipulating the DOM within directives. Use AngularJS's built-in sanitization features or other appropriate escaping mechanisms.**
* **Thoroughly review and test custom directives for potential vulnerabilities.**
* **Avoid directly using methods like `innerHTML` with unsanitized user input within directives.**
* **Consider using the `templateUrl` option for directives and pre-compile templates to reduce the risk of dynamic DOM manipulation with unsanitized data.**
