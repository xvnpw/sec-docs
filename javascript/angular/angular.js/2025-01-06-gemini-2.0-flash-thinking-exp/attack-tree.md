# Attack Tree Analysis for angular/angular.js

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the application, gaining control over user sessions, data, or the application's functionality.

## Attack Tree Visualization

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary JavaScript Code (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_javascript_code__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** The attacker's ultimate objective is to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the application's context.
**Significance:** Achieving this goal grants the attacker significant control over the application and its users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Angular.js Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_angular_js_specific_vulnerabilities.md)

This category represents attacks that leverage weaknesses inherent in the Angular.js framework itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Angular.js Sandbox (Older Versions) (HIGH RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_angular_js_sandbox__older_versions___high_risk_path_.md)

**Goal:** Execute arbitrary JavaScript code by escaping the security sandbox implemented in older versions of Angular.js.
**How:** Older versions of Angular.js used a sandbox to evaluate expressions. Attackers could find vulnerabilities within this sandbox to execute arbitrary code.
**Actionable Insights:**
* Mitigation: Upgrade to the latest stable version of Angular (or Angular 2+). Older versions are no longer supported and have known security vulnerabilities.
* Detection: Identify usage of older Angular.js versions in the application's dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Angular Expressions (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_angular_expressions__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Inject malicious Angular expressions that, when evaluated by Angular.js, execute arbitrary JavaScript code.
**Significance:** This is a direct route to achieving arbitrary code execution.
**How:** If user-controlled input is directly rendered within Angular templates without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious expressions (e.g., `{{constructor.constructor('alert(1)')()}}`).
**Actionable Insights:**
* Mitigation: **Never directly render unsanitized user input within Angular templates.** Use Angular's built-in sanitization mechanisms or a trusted library.
* Mitigation: Be cautious with server-side rendering using untrusted data. Ensure proper escaping before passing data to the Angular template.
* Mitigation: Be aware of DOM manipulation vulnerabilities where attackers can modify attributes bound to Angular expressions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Via User-Controlled Input Rendered Directly (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/via_user-controlled_input_rendered_directly__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Inject malicious Angular expressions through user input that is directly rendered in the template.
**Significance:** This is a common and easily exploitable entry point for expression injection.
**How:** Attackers provide malicious input (e.g., in form fields, URL parameters) that is then directly used within Angular's `{{ }}` syntax without sanitization.
**Actionable Insights:**
* Mitigation: Implement strict input validation and sanitization before rendering any user-provided data in Angular templates.
* Detection: Use static analysis tools to identify instances of direct rendering of user input.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfigurations or Improper Usage of Angular.js Features (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurations_or_improper_usage_of_angular_js_features__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

This category encompasses vulnerabilities arising from incorrect implementation or configuration of Angular.js features.
**Significance:** These are common mistakes that can lead to significant security flaws.

## Attack Tree Path: [Improper Sanitization of User Input Before Rendering (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/improper_sanitization_of_user_input_before_rendering__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Inject and execute malicious scripts due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided data.
**Significance:** This is a fundamental flaw leading directly to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
**How:** If user input is directly rendered into the DOM without using Angular's built-in sanitization features (or a trusted sanitization library), attackers can inject malicious HTML and JavaScript (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS).
**Actionable Insights:**
* Mitigation: **Always sanitize user input before rendering it in the view.** Utilize Angular's `ngSanitize` module or similar libraries.
* Mitigation: Be mindful of contexts where Angular might not automatically sanitize (e.g., rendering HTML directly).

## Attack Tree Path: [Render Unsafe HTML Leading to XSS (HIGH RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/render_unsafe_html_leading_to_xss__high_risk_path__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Successfully inject and execute malicious scripts in the user's browser due to the rendering of unsanitized HTML.
**Significance:** This is the direct consequence of improper sanitization and can lead to various attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.
**How:** The application renders user-provided HTML content without proper escaping, allowing attackers to inject `<script>` tags or other malicious HTML elements.
**Actionable Insights:**
* Mitigation: Enforce strict output encoding and sanitization for all user-generated content.
* Detection: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks. Regularly scan the application for XSS vulnerabilities.
