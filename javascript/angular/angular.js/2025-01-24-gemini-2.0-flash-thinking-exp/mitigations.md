# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for angular/angular.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid `ng-bind-html` and Use Safe Context Rendering](./mitigation_strategies/avoid__ng-bind-html__and_use_safe_context_rendering.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify all instances of `ng-bind-html` (or the deprecated `ng-bind-html-unsafe`) within your AngularJS templates.**  These directives are the primary entry points for client-side template injection vulnerabilities in AngularJS. Use code search tools to locate them.
    2.  **Analyze the data being bound to each `ng-bind-html` instance.** Determine the source of this data. If it originates from user input, external APIs, or any untrusted source, it poses a significant risk.
    3.  **Replace `ng-bind-html` with `ng-bind` whenever feasible.**  If the data is intended to be displayed as plain text and not interpreted as HTML, `ng-bind` is the secure alternative. AngularJS automatically escapes HTML characters when using `ng-bind`, preventing XSS.
    4.  **If HTML rendering is absolutely necessary, utilize AngularJS's `$sce` service for strict contextual escaping in conjunction with server-side sanitization.**
        *   **Prioritize server-side sanitization:** Before data reaches the AngularJS application, sanitize it on the server using a robust HTML sanitization library appropriate for your backend language. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Use `$sce.trustAsHtml` sparingly:** In your AngularJS controller or service, after receiving *sanitized* HTML from the server, use `$sce.trustAsHtml(sanitizedHtmlString)` to explicitly mark the *sanitized* HTML as safe for HTML context.
        *   **Bind the trusted HTML to `ng-bind-html`:** Only bind the `$sce`-trusted HTML to `ng-bind-html`.
        *   **Minimize the overall use of `$sce.trustAsHtml`:**  Rethink your application logic to reduce the need for dynamic HTML rendering. Prefer data binding with `ng-bind` for text content whenever possible.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI) via AngularJS Templates:** Severity: High.  Directly using `ng-bind-html` with unsanitized data allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript, exploiting AngularJS's templating engine.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via AngularJS Templates:** Severity: High.  Similar to CSTI, attackers can inject malicious scripts through `ng-bind-html`, leading to XSS attacks within the AngularJS application context.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSTI:** High reduction. Eliminating or carefully controlling `ng-bind-html` usage and enforcing server-side sanitization drastically reduces the attack surface for AngularJS-specific CSTI.
    *   **XSS:** High reduction.  By properly escaping HTML by default with `ng-bind` and cautiously using `$sce` with server-side sanitization, the risk of AngularJS-related XSS is significantly minimized.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   To be determined. A codebase audit is required to identify current usage of `ng-bind-html` and assess if proper sanitization and `$sce` are in place where it's used.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Potentially widespread across components that dynamically display content, especially user-generated content or data fetched from external sources that might contain HTML.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Enforce Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) and Audit `$sce` Usage](./mitigation_strategies/enforce_strict_contextual_escaping__sce__and_audit__$sce__usage.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Ensure AngularJS's Strict Contextual Escaping (SCE) is enabled and not disabled or weakened.** SCE is a core security feature of AngularJS that helps prevent XSS by default. Verify that configurations haven't inadvertently disabled it.
    2.  **Establish clear guidelines for using `$sce.trustAs` methods within the development team.**  Developers should understand when and how to use `$sce.trustAsHtml`, `$sce.trustAsUrl`, `$sce.trustAsJs`, `$sce.trustAsCss`, and `$sce.trustAsResourceUrl` methods. Emphasize that these should be used only when absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
    3.  **Conduct regular audits of all `$sce.trustAs` method calls in the AngularJS codebase.** Review each instance to ensure that the data being trusted is genuinely safe and that the usage is justified. Look for potential over-trusting or misuse.
    4.  **Prioritize server-side sanitization as the primary security layer, even when using `$sce`.**  `$sce` should be considered a secondary client-side defense, not a replacement for robust server-side input validation and sanitization.
    5.  **Avoid using `$sceDelegateProvider.resourceUrlWhitelist()` for overly broad URL whitelisting.** If URL whitelisting is necessary for resources, make the whitelist as specific as possible to minimize the risk of allowing malicious URLs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to bypassed AngularJS Security:** Severity: High.  Improper or excessive use of `$sce.trustAs` methods can inadvertently bypass AngularJS's built-in XSS protection, creating vulnerabilities where AngularJS was intended to provide security.
    *   **URL Redirection Attacks via AngularJS:** Severity: Medium.  Incorrectly trusting URLs with `$sce.trustAsUrl` without proper validation can lead to open redirection vulnerabilities within the AngularJS application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Medium reduction.  Correctly leveraging `$sce` strengthens AngularJS's XSS defenses, but its effectiveness depends heavily on developer discipline and careful auditing of `$sce` usage. Misuse can negate its security benefits.
    *   **URL Redirection Attacks:** Medium reduction.  Careful URL validation and restricted whitelisting when using `$sce.trustAsUrl` can reduce the risk of AngularJS-related URL redirection vulnerabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. AngularJS SCE is enabled by default in the framework. However, the secure and correct usage of `$sce.trustAs` methods and the auditing process need to be established and verified within the project.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal guidelines for `$sce` usage, regular audits of `$sce` calls, and potentially over-reliance on `$sce` without sufficient server-side sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep AngularJS Updated to the Latest Version](./mitigation_strategies/keep_angularjs_updated_to_the_latest_version.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a process for regularly monitoring AngularJS releases and security advisories.** Subscribe to AngularJS project channels or mailing lists to stay informed about updates and security patches.
    2.  **Promptly update AngularJS to the latest stable version whenever security updates or bug fixes are released.**  Prioritize security updates to address known vulnerabilities in the framework itself.
    3.  **Thoroughly test AngularJS updates in a staging environment before deploying to production.** Ensure that updates do not introduce regressions or break existing AngularJS application functionality.
    4.  **Maintain awareness of the AngularJS version currently in use in the project.**  Regularly check the project's dependency management files (e.g., `package.json` if using npm/yarn) to confirm the AngularJS version.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Known Security Vulnerabilities in AngularJS Framework:** Severity: Varies (High to Low depending on the vulnerability). Outdated versions of AngularJS may contain publicly known security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise the application.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Known Security Vulnerabilities in AngularJS Framework:** High reduction.  Updating AngularJS to the latest versions directly patches known vulnerabilities within the AngularJS framework itself, eliminating those specific attack vectors.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   To be determined. The process for tracking AngularJS updates and applying them needs to be assessed.  The current AngularJS version in use should be checked against the latest stable release.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A formal process for regularly checking for and applying AngularJS updates might be lacking.  The project might be running on an outdated version of AngularJS with known security vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for AngularJS Library](./mitigation_strategies/implement_subresource_integrity__sri__for_angularjs_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate SRI hashes specifically for the AngularJS library file(s) used in your application.**  Use online SRI hash generators or command-line tools to create cryptographic hashes (e.g., SHA-384 or SHA-512) of the AngularJS library files.
    2.  **Add the `integrity` attribute to the `<script>` tag that loads the AngularJS library.** Include the generated SRI hash in the `integrity` attribute and ensure the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute is also present if loading from a different origin (like a CDN).
    3.  **Update the SRI hash whenever the AngularJS library version is updated.**  If you upgrade AngularJS, regenerate the SRI hash for the new library file and update the `integrity` attribute in your HTML.
    4.  **Ideally, automate SRI hash generation and integration into your build or deployment process.** This ensures that SRI is consistently applied and updated.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromise of CDN or AngularJS Hosting Source:** Severity: Medium to High. If the CDN or server hosting the AngularJS library is compromised, attackers could potentially inject malicious code into the AngularJS library file itself. SRI prevents the browser from executing a tampered AngularJS library.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks Targeting AngularJS Library:** Severity: Medium. SRI provides a defense against MITM attacks where an attacker might attempt to inject malicious code by intercepting and modifying the AngularJS library file during transit.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromise of CDN or AngularJS Hosting Source:** High reduction. SRI effectively prevents the execution of a compromised AngularJS library loaded from a CDN or other external source, mitigating the impact of such a compromise.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks Targeting AngularJS Library:** Medium reduction. SRI provides a strong layer of defense against tampering of the AngularJS library during transit, reducing the risk of MITM attacks injecting malicious code via AngularJS.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   To be determined. SRI implementation for the AngularJS library needs to be checked in the application's HTML templates.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The `<script>` tag loading the AngularJS library likely lacks the `integrity` attribute with an SRI hash. This needs to be added to the HTML where AngularJS is included.

## Mitigation Strategy: [AngularJS-Specific Security Code Reviews](./mitigation_strategies/angularjs-specific_security_code_reviews.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Incorporate AngularJS-specific security considerations into your code review process.** Train developers and code reviewers to be aware of common AngularJS vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
    2.  **Focus code reviews on identifying AngularJS-specific vulnerability patterns.**  Specifically look for:
        *   Insecure use of `ng-bind-html`.
        *   Improper or missing server-side sanitization of data used in AngularJS templates.
        *   Over-reliance or misuse of `$sce.trustAs` methods.
        *   Potential Client-Side Template Injection points in templates.
        *   Insecure custom directives or filters that handle user input.
        *   Dynamically generated AngularJS expressions from user input.
    3.  **Use checklists or guidelines during code reviews to ensure AngularJS security aspects are systematically reviewed.** Create a checklist of AngularJS-specific security items to be verified during code reviews.
    4.  **Encourage developers to proactively think about AngularJS security during development.** Foster a security-conscious development culture where developers are aware of AngularJS security best practices and potential pitfalls.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **All AngularJS-Specific Vulnerabilities (CSTI, XSS, etc.):** Severity: Varies (High to Low). AngularJS-focused code reviews can proactively identify and prevent a wide range of AngularJS-related vulnerabilities before they are deployed.
    *   **Introduction of New AngularJS Security Vulnerabilities:** Severity: High. By making security a regular part of the development process, code reviews help prevent the introduction of new AngularJS vulnerabilities in ongoing development.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **All AngularJS-Specific Vulnerabilities:** High reduction.  Targeted AngularJS security code reviews are highly effective in preventing and detecting AngularJS vulnerabilities early in the development lifecycle, significantly reducing the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. General code reviews might be in place, but their specific focus on AngularJS security vulnerabilities and best practices needs to be strengthened.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized AngularJS-specific security code review guidelines, checklists, and training for developers and reviewers on AngularJS security best practices.
