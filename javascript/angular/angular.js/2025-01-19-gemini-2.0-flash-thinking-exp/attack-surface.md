# Attack Surface Analysis for angular/angular.js

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Angular Expressions](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_angular_expressions.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by the victim's browser.

**How Angular.js Contributes:** AngularJS's data binding and expression evaluation (e.g., `{{user.name}}`) can execute JavaScript if user-controlled data is directly rendered without proper sanitization. Older versions of AngularJS might have less robust automatic escaping.

**Example:** An attacker submits a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, which is then displayed on the page using `{{comment.text}}`.

**Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, malware installation.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use `$sanitize` service:**  Sanitize user-provided HTML before rendering it.
* **Avoid using `$sce.trustAsHtml` on user-controlled data:**  Only trust HTML from reliable sources.
* **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
* **Upgrade to newer versions of Angular (if feasible):** Later versions have improved default security measures.

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM XSS)](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__dom_xss_.md)

**Description:**  A type of XSS where the attacker's payload is executed as a result of modifications to the Document Object Model (DOM) environment in the victim's browser, often through client-side scripts.

**How Angular.js Contributes:**  Manipulating the DOM directly using AngularJS directives or custom code based on user input without proper sanitization can introduce DOM XSS vulnerabilities. This can occur when data from the URL (e.g., hash, query parameters) is used to dynamically update the DOM.

**Example:**  A custom directive reads a value from the URL hash (`#param=<script>alert('DOM XSS')</script>`) and directly inserts it into the DOM without sanitization.

**Impact:** Similar to reflected and stored XSS: account takeover, session hijacking, redirection, data theft.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Sanitize data retrieved from the URL:**  Use appropriate sanitization techniques before using URL parameters to manipulate the DOM.
* **Avoid directly manipulating the DOM with user-controlled data:**  If necessary, ensure thorough sanitization.
* **Use secure coding practices in custom directives:**  Be mindful of potential XSS vulnerabilities when handling user input.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/client-side_template_injection.md)

**Description:**  Attackers inject malicious code into client-side templates, which is then executed when the template is rendered.

**How Angular.js Contributes:** If user input is used to dynamically construct AngularJS templates or parts of templates, it can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the template context.

**Example:**  A feature allows users to customize a message, and this message is directly inserted into a template string: `var template = '<div>' + userProvidedMessage + '</div>';`. If `userProvidedMessage` contains AngularJS expressions or HTML with scripts, it can be executed.

**Impact:**  Code execution in the user's browser, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious actions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid dynamically constructing templates with user input:**  Use predefined templates and data binding.
* **If dynamic template construction is necessary, sanitize user input rigorously:**  Treat it as untrusted.
* **Consider using a templating engine with robust security features:** Although this is inherent to Angular.js, ensure best practices are followed.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Use of `$sce` (Strict Contextual Escaping)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_use_of__$sce___strict_contextual_escaping_.md)

**Description:**  AngularJS's `$sce` service helps prevent XSS by requiring developers to explicitly mark values as trusted in specific contexts (HTML, CSS, URL, JavaScript). Misuse or intentional bypassing of `$sce` can create vulnerabilities.

**How Angular.js Contributes:**  Developers might incorrectly use `$sce.trustAsHtml`, `$sce.trustAsJs`, etc., on user-provided data without proper validation, effectively disabling Angular's built-in XSS protection.

**Example:**  A developer uses `$sce.trustAsHtml(userInput)` without properly sanitizing `userInput`, allowing malicious HTML to be rendered.

**Impact:**  XSS vulnerabilities, leading to account takeover, data theft, etc.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Only trust data from reliable sources:**  Avoid using `$sce.trustAs...` on user input unless absolutely necessary and after thorough sanitization.
* **Understand the implications of trusting content in different contexts:**  Be specific about what type of content is being trusted.
* **Review code for unnecessary or insecure uses of `$sce`:**  Ensure it's being used correctly and judiciously.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of Sensitive Data in Client-Side Code](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_sensitive_data_in_client-side_code.md)

**Description:**  Storing or processing sensitive data directly in client-side JavaScript code makes it vulnerable to interception and theft.

**How Angular.js Contributes:**  AngularJS applications, like any client-side application, execute in the user's browser, making any data present in the code potentially accessible.

**Example:**  Storing API keys, session tokens, or personally identifiable information directly in AngularJS controllers or services.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, leading to account compromise, data breaches, and other security incidents.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid storing sensitive data in client-side code:**  Handle sensitive data on the server-side.
* **Use HTTPS to encrypt communication:**  Protect data in transit.
* **Implement proper session management:**  Use secure cookies and server-side session handling.
* **Be mindful of data exposed in the browser's developer tools:**  Minimize the amount of sensitive information processed client-side.
