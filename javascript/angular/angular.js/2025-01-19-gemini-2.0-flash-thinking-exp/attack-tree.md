## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Binding](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_data_binding.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploits Angular.js's two-way data binding mechanism when user-controlled data is directly rendered into the DOM without proper sanitization.
* **Steps:**
    * **Inject Malicious Data into Scope:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a data field that is part of the Angular.js scope.
    * **User Input Not Sanitized:** The application fails to sanitize or escape user-provided input before storing it in the scope.
    * **Data Bound to Potentially Dangerous Context (e.g., `ng-bind-html`):** The unsanitized data is bound to a DOM element using a directive like `ng-bind-html`, which renders the HTML content, including the malicious script.
* **Impact:** Successful execution allows the attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `$eval` or `$parse`](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via__$eval__or__$parse_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Leverages the `$scope.$eval()` and `$parse()` methods, which allow evaluating arbitrary JavaScript code within the Angular.js context.
* **Steps:**
    * **Inject Malicious String for Evaluation:** The attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript string.
    * **User Input Directly Passed to `$eval`:** The application directly passes user-controlled input to the `$scope.$eval()` method for evaluation.
* **Impact:**  Similar to data binding XSS, successful exploitation allows arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, with the same potential consequences.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Client-Side Validation](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_client-side_validation.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploits the client-side nature of Angular.js validation by directly manipulating the application state in the browser.
* **Steps:**
    * **Modify Angular.js Scope or Form State:** The attacker uses browser developer tools (or other techniques) to directly modify the values of Angular.js model variables or the state of form elements.
    * **Browser Developer Tools:**  Attackers commonly use the browser's developer console to inspect and modify the Angular.js scope or DOM elements.
* **Impact:** While not directly leading to code execution, bypassing client-side validation can allow attackers to:
    * Submit invalid data to the server, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.
    * Circumvent intended restrictions or business logic implemented on the client-side.
    * Prepare the application state for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leaking Sensitive Information via Improper Data Handling](./attack_tree_paths/leaking_sensitive_information_via_improper_data_handling.md)

**Attack Vector:** Sensitive information is inadvertently exposed in the Angular.js scope due to poor coding practices.
* **Steps:**
    * **Access Sensitive Data Exposed in Angular.js Scope:** The attacker uses browser developer tools to inspect the Angular.js scope and identify sensitive data.
    * **Improper Data Handling in Controllers or Services:** Developers might mistakenly store sensitive information directly in the scope or retrieve it without proper security considerations.
* **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information can lead to:
    * Account compromise if credentials are leaked.
    * Data breaches if personal or confidential data is exposed.
    * Further attacks if API keys or other security-related information is revealed.
