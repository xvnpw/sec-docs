# Threat Model Analysis for angular/angular.js

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)](./threats/client-side_template_injection__csti_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious AngularJS expressions into user-controlled data that is then rendered by the AngularJS template engine. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser, potentially gaining full control over the user's session and data. They might steal cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full compromise of the user's session and potential data breach.
*   **Affected AngularJS Component:** `$compile` service, specifically when rendering templates containing user-provided data. Directives like `ng-bind-html` are particularly vulnerable if used with untrusted input.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize user input before rendering it in templates. Use the built-in `$sanitize` service or a trusted sanitization library.
    *   Avoid using `ng-bind-html` with untrusted data. If necessary, ensure the data is rigorously sanitized.

## Threat: [Expression Injection](./threats/expression_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts malicious input that, when evaluated as an AngularJS expression, executes unintended JavaScript code. This can occur when user input directly influences AngularJS expressions, for example, in `ng-click` or `ng-mouseover` attributes. The attacker can execute arbitrary code within the AngularJS scope.
*   **Impact:** High. Can lead to arbitrary code execution in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
*   **Affected AngularJS Component:** AngularJS expression parser, directives that evaluate expressions (e.g., `ng-click`, `ng-mouseover`, `ng-change`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid constructing AngularJS expressions dynamically based on user input.
    *   If dynamic expressions are unavoidable, strictly validate and sanitize the input to ensure it doesn't contain malicious code.
    *   Use functions in your scope to handle events instead of directly embedding expressions with user input.

## Threat: [Directive Vulnerabilities](./threats/directive_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Custom AngularJS directives, if not implemented securely, can introduce vulnerabilities. Poorly written directives might be susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other attacks if they handle user input or manipulate the DOM without proper sanitization.
*   **Impact:** High. Can lead to XSS attacks, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
*   **Affected AngularJS Component:** Custom directives.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom directives.
    *   Sanitize user input before rendering it within directives.
    *   Be mindful of the security context in which directives operate.
    *   Avoid directly manipulating the DOM with user-provided content without sanitization.

## Threat: [Using an Outdated and Unsupported AngularJS Version](./threats/using_an_outdated_and_unsupported_angularjs_version.md)

*   **Description:** AngularJS is no longer actively developed or supported. Using an outdated version exposes the application to known, unpatched vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical. The application is vulnerable to all known security flaws in that version of AngularJS, with no new patches being released.
*   **Affected AngularJS Component:** The entire AngularJS framework.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Migrate to a modern framework like Angular (without the `.js`) or React.
    *   If migration is not immediately feasible, implement compensating controls and closely monitor for potential vulnerabilities. This is a high-risk situation and should be addressed as a priority.
