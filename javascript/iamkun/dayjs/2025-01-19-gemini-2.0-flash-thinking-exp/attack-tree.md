## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities -> Malicious Input Strings -> Cause Incorrect Data Storage/Processing](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities_-_malicious_input_strings_-_cause_incorrect_data_st_c63489c3.md)

* Attack Vector: Malicious Input Strings Leading to Incorrect Data Storage/Processing
    * Description: An attacker provides specially crafted date strings as input to the application. These strings exploit weaknesses in Day.js's parsing logic, causing the library to interpret the input incorrectly. This leads to the application storing or processing incorrect date values.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify input fields or data sources where the application accepts date strings.
        2. Craft various malicious date strings, including:
            * Strings with unexpected formats.
            * Strings with out-of-range values.
            * Strings with ambiguous date components.
            * Extremely long or complex strings designed to stress the parser.
        3. Submit these malicious strings to the application.
        4. Observe if the application parses the dates incorrectly and if these incorrect dates are subsequently stored in a database or used in calculations.
    * Potential Impact: Data corruption, incorrect business logic execution, flawed reporting, potential for further exploitation based on incorrect data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting Parsing Logic Flaws
    * Description: Attackers target inherent weaknesses or bugs within Day.js's date parsing functionality. By providing specific input patterns, they can trigger unexpected behavior, errors, or incorrect date object creation.
    * Steps:
        1. Analyze the application's code to identify how it uses Day.js for parsing dates.
        2. Review Day.js documentation and known vulnerabilities related to parsing.
        3. Experiment with different input formats and values to identify edge cases or inputs that cause parsing errors or incorrect results.
        4. Develop specific input strings that reliably trigger these parsing flaws.
    * Potential Impact: Serves as an entry point for various attacks, including DoS, unexpected behavior, and incorrect data handling.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Cause Incorrect Data Storage/Processing](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_cause_incorrect_data_storageprocessing.md)

* Attack Vector: Manipulation via Incorrectly Parsed Dates
    * Description:  The application, having received an incorrectly parsed date from Day.js, proceeds to store or use this flawed date in its operations. This can lead to a range of negative consequences depending on how the date is used.
    * Steps:
        1. Successfully exploit a parsing vulnerability to generate an incorrect date object.
        2. Observe how the application handles this incorrect date object.
        3. Identify where this date is stored (e.g., database) or used in calculations or comparisons.
        4. Analyze the impact of the incorrect date on the application's functionality and data integrity.
    * Potential Impact: Data corruption, incorrect business decisions, flawed scheduling, authentication bypasses (in specific scenarios), and other logic errors.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities -> Vulnerability in Specific Plugin -> Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin OR Data Manipulation via Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities_-_vulnerability_in_specific_plugin_-_remote_code_exe_4be8be70.md)

* Attack Vector: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin
    * Description: A vulnerability exists within a Day.js plugin that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or client-side. This could be due to insecure handling of input, deserialization flaws, or other common web application vulnerabilities present within the plugin's code.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify the Day.js plugins used by the application.
        2. Research known vulnerabilities for these specific plugins.
        3. Analyze the plugin's code for potential vulnerabilities if source code is available.
        4. Craft malicious requests or inputs that exploit the identified vulnerability.
        5. Execute the exploit to gain remote code execution.
    * Potential Impact: Full compromise of the server or client, data breach, malware installation, denial of service.

* Attack Vector: Data Manipulation via Plugin
    * Description: A vulnerability within a Day.js plugin allows an attacker to manipulate or access sensitive data. This could involve bypassing access controls, exploiting insecure data handling practices within the plugin, or leveraging other plugin-specific flaws.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify the Day.js plugins used by the application.
        2. Research known vulnerabilities for these specific plugins related to data access or manipulation.
        3. Analyze the plugin's code for potential vulnerabilities in data handling.
        4. Craft malicious requests or inputs that exploit the identified vulnerability to access or modify data.
    * Potential Impact: Data breach, unauthorized data modification, privilege escalation (in some cases).

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

* Attack Vector: Targeting Third-Party Plugin Code
    * Description: Attackers focus on vulnerabilities present not in the core Day.js library, but in the extensions or plugins used by the application. These plugins might have less rigorous security reviews or introduce their own security flaws.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify the Day.js plugins used by the target application.
        2. Research known vulnerabilities for these specific plugins.
        3. If no known vulnerabilities exist, attempt to reverse engineer or analyze the plugin's code for potential flaws.
        4. Develop exploits targeting identified vulnerabilities within the plugin.
    * Potential Impact: Opens the door for RCE, data manipulation, and other plugin-specific attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_remote_code_execution__rce__via_plugin.md)

* Attack Vector: Arbitrary Code Execution Through Plugin
    * Description: Successful exploitation of a plugin vulnerability allows the attacker to run arbitrary commands or code within the context of the application.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify and exploit a vulnerability in a Day.js plugin that allows code execution.
        2. Craft a malicious payload containing the code to be executed.
        3. Deliver the payload through the exploited vulnerability.
        4. The malicious code is executed on the server or client.
    * Potential Impact: Complete system compromise, data theft, malware deployment, denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Data Manipulation via Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_data_manipulation_via_plugin.md)

* Attack Vector: Unauthorized Data Access or Modification Through Plugin
    * Description: Attackers leverage plugin vulnerabilities to bypass security measures and directly access or modify sensitive data managed or processed by the plugin or the application.
    * Steps:
        1. Identify and exploit a vulnerability in a Day.js plugin related to data handling.
        2. Craft malicious requests or inputs to access or modify data.
        3. The plugin, due to the vulnerability, grants unauthorized access or allows data modification.
    * Potential Impact: Data breaches, data corruption, loss of data integrity, financial loss, reputational damage.
