# Threat Model Analysis for iamkun/dayjs

## Threat: [Malicious Input Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities](./threats/malicious_input_exploiting_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Threat:** Malicious Input Exploiting Parsing Vulnerabilities

**Description:** An attacker might craft malicious date strings and send them to the application's endpoints or input fields. The application, without proper validation, passes this string to `dayjs`'s parsing functions (e.g., `dayjs()`, `dayjs.utc()`). This could cause `dayjs` to throw errors, enter infinite loops (if regex parsing is involved), or behave unexpectedly.

**Impact:** Application crashes (denial of service), potential for resource exhaustion, unexpected application behavior leading to logical errors.

**Affected Component:** Core parsing functions (`dayjs()`, `dayjs.utc()`, and potentially custom parsing logic if used).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement strict input validation on both client-side and server-side before passing any data to `dayjs` parsing functions.
- Sanitize and normalize date strings before parsing.
- Consider using specific parsing formats with `dayjs(input, format)` instead of relying on automatic parsing where possible.
- Implement error handling around `dayjs` parsing calls to gracefully handle invalid input.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Parsing (Less Likely but Possible)](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_parsing__less_likely_but_possible_.md)

**Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Parsing (Less Likely but Possible)

**Description:** While `dayjs` aims to be lightweight, vulnerabilities can exist in the regular expressions used internally for parsing date strings. An attacker could craft a specific, long, and complex malicious date string that, when processed by `dayjs`'s parsing logic, causes excessive backtracking in the regular expression engine, leading to high CPU utilization and potentially a denial-of-service.

**Impact:** Denial-of-service, application slowdown, resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** Internal regular expressions used within `dayjs`'s parsing functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Keep `dayjs` updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for performance issues and potential ReDoS vulnerabilities.
- Implement timeouts for date parsing operations if feasible.
- Implement rate limiting on endpoints that process user-provided date strings.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Day.js Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_day_js_plugins.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Day.js Plugins

**Description:** If the application uses `dayjs` plugins (e.g., `dayjs/plugin/utc`, `dayjs/plugin/timezone`), vulnerabilities within these plugins could be exploited. An attacker might target specific functionalities provided by these plugins with malicious input or by exploiting known flaws in the plugin's code.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability in the plugin. Could range from incorrect calculations to potential code execution if a plugin has a severe flaw.

**Affected Component:** Specific `dayjs` plugins used by the application.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Only use necessary `dayjs` plugins.
- Keep all `dayjs` plugins updated to their latest versions.
- Review the source code of plugins if possible, especially for critical applications.
- Be aware of reported vulnerabilities in `dayjs` plugins.

## Threat: [Security Vulnerabilities in Older Versions of Day.js](./threats/security_vulnerabilities_in_older_versions_of_day_js.md)

**Threat:** Security Vulnerabilities in Older Versions of Day.js

**Description:** If the application uses an outdated version of `dayjs`, it might be susceptible to known security vulnerabilities that have been patched in newer versions. Attackers could exploit these known vulnerabilities if the application is not kept up-to-date.

**Impact:** Depends on the specific vulnerability present in the older version. Could range from information disclosure to remote code execution in extreme cases (though less likely for a date/time library).

**Affected Component:** The entire `dayjs` library.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Regularly update `dayjs` to the latest stable version.
- Monitor security advisories and release notes for `dayjs`.
- Use dependency management tools that can alert you to outdated dependencies with known vulnerabilities.
