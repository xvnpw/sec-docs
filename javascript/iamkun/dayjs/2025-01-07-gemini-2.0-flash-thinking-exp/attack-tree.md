# Attack Tree Analysis for iamkun/dayjs

Objective: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Day.js library, leading to arbitrary code execution or data manipulation within the application's context.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Parsing Logic Errors](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_parsing_logic_errors.md)

* Attack Vector: Providing carefully crafted input strings that exploit flaws in Day.js's parsing logic.
    * How it Works: Attackers identify edge cases, invalid formats, or out-of-range values that cause Day.js to misinterpret the input, leading to incorrect date/time calculations or internal errors.
    * Potential Impact: Logic flaws in the application, incorrect data processing, potential for further exploitation if the errors lead to exploitable states.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Differences in Locale Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_differences_in_locale_data.md)

* Attack Vector: Supplying date/time strings that are interpreted differently based on the locale settings used by Day.js.
    * How it Works: Attackers leverage inconsistencies in date/time formats, month names, or other locale-specific data to cause the application to process dates incorrectly, potentially bypassing security checks or manipulating application logic.
    * Potential Impact: Logic flaws, data inconsistencies, bypassing security measures that rely on date/time comparisons.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Plugin Installation (If application allows dynamic plugin loading)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_plugin_installation__if_application_allows_dynamic_plugin_loading_.md)

* Attack Vector: Installing a deliberately backdoored Day.js plugin.
    * How it Works: If the application allows loading external plugins, attackers can introduce a malicious plugin containing arbitrary code that executes within the application's context when Day.js functions are called.
    * Potential Impact: Full compromise of the application, arbitrary code execution, data theft, malware installation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Existing Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_existing_plugins.md)

* Attack Vector: Leveraging known security vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Day.js plugins used by the application.
    * How it Works: Attackers exploit publicly disclosed weaknesses in the plugin code to gain unauthorized access, execute code, or manipulate data.
    * Potential Impact: Depends on the plugin vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using a Vulnerable Day.js Version](./attack_tree_paths/using_a_vulnerable_day_js_version.md)

* Attack Vector: Exploiting known security vulnerabilities (CVEs) present in the specific version of Day.js used by the application.
    * How it Works: Attackers utilize publicly available exploits targeting the identified vulnerabilities in the outdated Day.js library.
    * Potential Impact: Depends on the specific CVE, but can include remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
