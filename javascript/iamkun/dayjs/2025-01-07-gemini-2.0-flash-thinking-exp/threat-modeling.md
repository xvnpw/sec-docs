# Threat Model Analysis for iamkun/dayjs

## Threat: [Vulnerability in Day.js Library Itself](./threats/vulnerability_in_day_js_library_itself.md)

Vulnerability in Day.js Library Itself
*   **Description:** The `dayjs` library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (bugs, logic errors, etc.). An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities if the application uses an affected version of the library. This could lead to various impacts depending on the nature of the vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Potentially arbitrary code execution, data breaches, denial of service, depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Affected Day.js Component:** Any part of the `dayjs` library code.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the severity of the discovered vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update `dayjs` to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to `dayjs`.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to track dependencies and identify potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Time Zone Data Issues (with `dayjs/plugin/timezone`)](./threats/time_zone_data_issues__with__dayjsplugintimezone__.md)

Time Zone Data Issues (with `dayjs/plugin/timezone`)
*   **Description:** If the application uses the `dayjs/plugin/timezone`, vulnerabilities in the underlying time zone data (IANA database) or in the plugin's implementation could lead to incorrect date/time calculations. An attacker might exploit this to manipulate time-sensitive application logic, such as access control or scheduling.
*   **Impact:**  Incorrect authorization decisions, manipulation of scheduled events, data inconsistencies.
*   **Affected Day.js Component:** `timezone` plugin and its interaction with the IANA time zone data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if time is critical for security or business logic).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep the `dayjs/plugin/timezone` and the underlying time zone data updated.
    *   Thoroughly test the application's time zone handling logic, especially in security-sensitive areas.
    *   Be aware of potential edge cases and ambiguities in time zone rules.
