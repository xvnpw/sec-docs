# Attack Surface Analysis for iamkun/dayjs

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Day.js Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_day_js_plugins.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Vulnerabilities in Day.js Plugins
    * **Description:** Day.js allows extending its functionality through plugins. If an application uses third-party or custom plugins, vulnerabilities within those plugins can introduce security risks.
    * **How Day.js Contributes:** Day.js's plugin architecture allows external code to interact with its core functionality. If these plugins are not developed with security in mind, they can become attack vectors.
    * **Example:** A plugin has a vulnerability that allows for arbitrary code execution when processing certain date formats or manipulating date objects in a specific way.
    * **Impact:**  Range from minor issues like incorrect date calculations to severe risks like arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service, depending on the plugin's functionality and the nature of the vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the plugin's permissions and vulnerabilities)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use Reputable Plugins:  Carefully evaluate and select plugins from trusted sources with active maintenance and a good security track record.
        * Security Audits: Conduct security reviews and audits of any third-party or custom plugins used.
        * Principle of Least Privilege: Ensure plugins only have the necessary permissions and access to application resources.
        * Stay Updated: Keep Day.js and its plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
