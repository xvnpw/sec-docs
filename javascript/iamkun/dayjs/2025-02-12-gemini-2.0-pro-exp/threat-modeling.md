# Threat Model Analysis for iamkun/dayjs

## Threat: [Malicious Date String Parsing (DoS)](./threats/malicious_date_string_parsing__dos_.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Date String Parsing (DoS)

    *   **Description:** An attacker submits an extremely long, complex, or specially crafted date/time string to a `dayjs` parsing function. The attacker aims to cause excessive CPU consumption, leading to a denial-of-service condition by exhausting server resources. This could involve deeply nested date components, unusual formats, or exploiting known parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive or crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing the service.  Potentially impacts other applications running on the same server.
    *   **Affected Dayjs Component:** `dayjs()` (parsing function), and any plugins that extend parsing capabilities (e.g., `customParseFormat`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:** Implement strict input validation *before* calling `dayjs()`.  Limit the maximum length of input strings.  Reject inputs that don't match expected formats using regular expressions.
        *   **Strict Parsing:** Use the strict parsing mode whenever possible: `dayjs(input, format, true)`. This enforces the provided format and rejects invalid dates.
        *   **Resource Limits:** Implement resource limits (e.g., CPU time, memory) for the process handling date parsing.  Use timeouts to prevent long-running parsing operations.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from submitting a large number of parsing requests in a short period.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor application performance and resource usage to detect potential DoS attacks.

## Threat: [Library Tampering (Tampering)](./threats/library_tampering__tampering_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Library Tampering (Tampering)

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the `dayjs` library itself, either through a supply chain attack (e.g., compromising the npm registry or a CDN) or by directly modifying the library files on the server.  The attacker modifies the library code to introduce malicious behavior, such as altering date calculations or injecting malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Incorrect date/time calculations, leading to data corruption or logic errors.  Potential for arbitrary code execution if the attacker can inject JavaScript code.
    *   **Affected Dayjs Component:**  The entire `dayjs` library and any plugins used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI tags when including `dayjs` from a CDN.
        *   **Package Manager & Lock Files:** Use a package manager (npm, yarn) and lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent and verified versions.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Regularly update `dayjs` to the latest version.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
        *   **Code Auditing:** Periodically audit the `dayjs` library code (and its dependencies) for any signs of tampering. This is especially important if you are using a forked or modified version.
