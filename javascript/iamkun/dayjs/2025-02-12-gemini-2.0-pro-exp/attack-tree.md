## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Parsing Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_parsing_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a broad category encompassing vulnerabilities that arise from how `dayjs` (or its plugins) parses date/time input. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities by providing malformed or unexpected input.
*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Unexpected Input to `dayjs()` or Plugins [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_unexpected_input_to__dayjs____or_plugins__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The core `dayjs()` function and many plugins accept various input types (strings, numbers, objects, etc.). If the application doesn't properly validate and sanitize this input *before* passing it to `dayjs`, an attacker can craft malicious input to trigger unexpected behavior.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium-High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Strictly validate all user-supplied date/time inputs using a whitelist approach.
    *   Sanitize input before passing it to `dayjs` or plugins.
    *   Limit the length of date/time strings.
    *   Avoid passing user-supplied objects directly to plugins; validate object properties if necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Crafted Date/Time String [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_crafted_datetime_string__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a specially designed date/time string that exploits a parsing bug or weakness in `dayjs` or a plugin. This could involve extremely long strings, unusual characters, or strings designed to trigger specific edge cases in the parsing logic.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
*   **Mitigation:** Same as 1.1 (strict input validation and sanitization).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.2 Invalid Date/Time Object (if passed to plugins) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_2_invalid_datetime_object__if_passed_to_plugins___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** If the application passes user-supplied *objects* (not just strings) to `dayjs` plugins, an attacker might craft a malicious object to exploit vulnerabilities in how the plugin handles object properties. This is less common than string-based attacks but can be more impactful.
*   **Likelihood:** Low
*   **Impact:** Medium-High
*   **Effort:** Medium
*   **Skill Level:** Advanced
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Avoid passing user-supplied objects directly to `dayjs` plugins.
    *   If necessary, thoroughly validate all properties of the object before passing it to the plugin. Use a whitelist approach for allowed properties and types.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Prototype Pollution via `dayjs.extend()` or `dayjs()` [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_prototype_pollution_via__dayjs_extend____or__dayjs_____critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Prototype pollution is a JavaScript vulnerability where an attacker can modify the properties of an object's prototype, affecting all objects that inherit from that prototype. If `dayjs.extend()` (used for adding plugins) or the core `dayjs()` function is vulnerable, an attacker could globally alter the behavior of `dayjs` objects.
*   **Likelihood:** Very Low
*   **Impact:** Very High (complete application compromise)
*   **Effort:** High
*   **Skill Level:** Expert
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Be extremely cautious when using `dayjs.extend()`. Thoroughly vet any third-party plugins.
    *   Implement general JavaScript prototype pollution mitigations:
        *   Use `Object.create(null)` for objects that shouldn't inherit from `Object.prototype`.
        *   Freeze objects to prevent modification.
        *   Use libraries specifically designed to prevent prototype pollution.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Locale/Plugin Issues](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_localeplugin_issues.md)

*   **Sub-Vectors:**

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Plugin Vulnerability (if custom) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_plugin_vulnerability__if_custom___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Custom `dayjs` plugins are a significant risk because they are less likely to have undergone the same level of scrutiny as widely-used, well-maintained plugins. Any vulnerability in a custom plugin could be exploited.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High (depends on the plugin's functionality)
*   **Effort:** Variable (depends on the plugin and vulnerability)
*   **Skill Level:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Variable (depends on the vulnerability and logging)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Thoroughly review and test custom plugins for security vulnerabilities.
    *   Follow secure coding practices, paying close attention to input validation and error handling.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Specific Vulnerability Examples:**
    *   **2.2.1 Input Validation Bypass:** The plugin fails to properly validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data.
    *   **2.2.2 Logic Flaws:** Errors in the plugin's logic can lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This is a broad category encompassing any flaw in the plugin's code that could be exploited.
