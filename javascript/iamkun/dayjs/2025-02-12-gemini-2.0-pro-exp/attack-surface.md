# Attack Surface Analysis for iamkun/dayjs

## Attack Surface: [Unexpected Input Formats (Potentially High, Context-Dependent)](./attack_surfaces/unexpected_input_formats__potentially_high__context-dependent_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can provide malformed or unexpected date/time strings to `dayjs` parsing functions, aiming for unexpected behavior beyond simple parsing errors.
*   **How `dayjs` Contributes:** `dayjs`'s flexible parsing, while convenient, can be a weakness if the application doesn't *strictly* validate input *before* using `dayjs`. The *potential* for high severity comes from scenarios where the parsed (but still potentially attacker-influenced) date/time data is used in security-critical operations *without further validation*.
*   **Example:** An application expects "YYYY-MM-DD" but receives a string containing special characters or an extremely long string.  If the application then uses the partially parsed (and potentially manipulated) date components in a database query, file path, or other sensitive operation *without additional checks*, it could lead to more severe consequences than just a parsing error. This is a *combination* of `dayjs`'s flexible parsing and the application's lack of subsequent validation.
*   **Impact:** While typically Medium (DoS, unexpected behavior), the impact *could* be High if the parsed data is used in security-critical contexts without further validation. This could *potentially* lead to data corruption, unauthorized access, or other issues depending on the specific application logic. It's crucial to understand this is *not* a direct code execution vulnerability in `dayjs` itself, but a potential for misuse leading to higher-severity problems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Potentially High (context-dependent; relies on how the application uses the parsed output).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**  Implement *strict* input validation *before* passing any data to `dayjs`. Use a whitelist of allowed formats.  Always use the `dayjs(string, format)` constructor with an explicit format string for user-supplied input.  *Crucially*, even after parsing with `dayjs`, *validate the resulting date object and its components* before using them in any security-sensitive operations.  Treat the output of `dayjs` as potentially untrusted if the input was user-controlled. Employ a separate, robust date/time validation library for defense-in-depth.

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution (Low Probability, but Potentially High Impact if Present)](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution__low_probability__but_potentially_high_impact_if_present_.md)

*   **Description:** Although unlikely in a well-maintained library like `dayjs`, a prototype pollution vulnerability *could* theoretically exist, allowing an attacker to modify the behavior of `dayjs` or other parts of the application. This is included because, *if present*, it would be a high-severity issue.
    *   **How `dayjs` Contributes:** The vulnerability would stem from `dayjs` (or a closely related, officially supported component) improperly handling object merging or property assignment, allowing attacker-controlled properties to affect the global object prototype.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a crafted object with a `__proto__` property or other specially named properties, attempting to overwrite default `dayjs` methods or properties.
    *   **Impact:** Potentially High. Successful prototype pollution could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or modification of application behavior in unpredictable ways.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Low Probability, but High Impact if present.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:** This is primarily a concern for the `dayjs` maintainers. However, application developers should:
            *   Avoid passing user-controlled objects directly to `dayjs` methods without thorough sanitization and validation.
            *   Be aware of any reports of prototype pollution vulnerabilities in `dayjs` and apply updates promptly.
            *   Consider using security linters and static analysis tools that can detect potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
