## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application via Day.js Vulnerability [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_via_day_js_vulnerability__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the root goal. An attacker aims to leverage any weakness in Day.js to compromise the application using it. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective through exploiting Day.js.
*   **Risk:** Critical. Successful compromise can lead to a wide range of negative outcomes, from data breaches to complete application takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Day.js Parsing Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_day_js_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Day.js, like any date/time library, needs to parse various date and time formats. Parsing logic can be complex and prone to vulnerabilities. Attackers target flaws in this parsing process to cause unexpected behavior or gain control.
*   **Risk:** Critical. Parsing vulnerabilities can be highly exploitable, potentially leading to code execution or significant application disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Input Injection Attacks [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3__input_injection_attacks__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a specific type of parsing vulnerability. Attackers craft malicious date/time strings and inject them into the application's input fields. If Day.js parsing logic is flawed, these malicious strings can be misinterpreted, leading to unintended actions.
*   **Risk:** Critical. Input injection can be relatively easy to execute if input validation is weak. The impact can range from data corruption to more severe exploits depending on the nature of the parsing flaw and application context.
    *   **Craft malicious date/time strings to exploit parsing logic:**
        *   **Attack Vector Detail:**  Attackers experiment with various date/time string formats, boundary values, and special characters to find inputs that trigger errors, unexpected behavior, or vulnerabilities in Day.js parsing functions.
        *   **Risk:** Medium. Likelihood is medium because parsing vulnerabilities are common, but Day.js is maintained. Impact is medium as it can lead to application malfunction or further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Day.js Locale Data Vulnerabilities (If applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_day_js_locale_data_vulnerabilities__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Day.js supports localization through locale data. If an application dynamically loads or uses locale data, especially from untrusted sources, or if Day.js itself has vulnerabilities in processing locale data, attackers can exploit this.
*   **Risk:** Medium to High (depending on locale usage). If locales are dynamically handled and output, the risk increases significantly.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Locale Data [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/5__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_locale_data__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** If Day.js locale data (or manipulated locale data) contains malicious scripts, and the application outputs this data to web pages without proper sanitization (encoding), it can lead to XSS. The attacker's script will execute in the user's browser when the page is viewed.
*   **Risk:** Critical. XSS vulnerabilities are highly impactful, allowing attackers to hijack user sessions, steal data, deface websites, and perform other malicious actions in the context of the user's browser.
    *   **If Day.js locale data contains or can be manipulated to contain malicious scripts, and the application outputs this data without proper encoding:**
        *   **Attack Vector Detail:** Attackers aim to inject or manipulate locale data to include JavaScript code. If the application then displays locale-dependent information (e.g., formatted dates, month names) without encoding, the malicious script will be executed in the user's browser.
        *   **Risk:** Medium to High. Likelihood depends on application's locale handling and output practices. Impact is high due to the nature of XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Exploit Day.js Plugin Vulnerabilities (If application uses plugins) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/6__exploit_day_js_plugin_vulnerabilities__if_application_uses_plugins___critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Day.js functionality can be extended with plugins. Plugins, being third-party code, can introduce vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities in installed Day.js plugins to compromise the application.
*   **Risk:** Critical. Plugin vulnerabilities can be as severe as vulnerabilities in the core library itself, potentially leading to code execution or other serious compromises.

## Attack Tree Path: [7. Vulnerable Plugin Installation [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/7__vulnerable_plugin_installation__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the primary way plugin vulnerabilities are introduced. If an application uses a Day.js plugin that has known security vulnerabilities, the application becomes vulnerable.
*   **Risk:** Critical. Using vulnerable plugins directly exposes the application to known exploits.
    *   **Application uses a known vulnerable Day.js plugin [CRITICAL]:**
        *   **Attack Vector Detail:** The application includes and uses a Day.js plugin that has been publicly identified as having a security vulnerability. Attackers can leverage readily available exploit information or tools to target this known vulnerability.
        *   **Risk:** Critical.  Known vulnerabilities are easier to exploit. Impact depends on the specific plugin vulnerability, but can be high.

## Attack Tree Path: [8. Supply Chain Attack targeting Day.js Dependency [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/8__supply_chain_attack_targeting_day_js_dependency__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the supply chain of Day.js itself. This could involve compromising the npm package repository, the GitHub repository, or maintainer accounts to inject malicious code into Day.js.
*   **Risk:** Critical. Supply chain attacks are extremely dangerous because they can affect a vast number of applications that depend on the compromised library.

## Attack Tree Path: [9. Compromise Day.js npm package [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/9__compromise_day_js_npm_package__critical_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is a specific type of supply chain attack. Attackers aim to compromise the Day.js npm package on the npm registry. If successful, they can inject malicious code into the package, which will then be distributed to all applications that install or update Day.js.
*   **Risk:** Critical. Compromising the npm package is a highly impactful supply chain attack, potentially affecting a massive user base.
    *   **Attacker gains access to Day.js npm package maintainer account and injects malicious code:**
        *   **Attack Vector Detail:** Attackers use social engineering, phishing, or account compromise techniques to gain access to the npm account of a Day.js maintainer. Once in control, they can publish a compromised version of the Day.js package to npm.
        *   **Risk:** Critical.  This is a direct and highly effective supply chain attack. Impact is widespread and severe.
