# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, dayjs, aims to provide a minimalist JavaScript library that parses, validates, manipulates, and formats dates, offering a Moment.js-compatible API as a lighter alternative for modern browsers.

* Business Priorities:
    * Provide a lightweight and performant date manipulation library for JavaScript environments.
    * Maintain a high degree of compatibility with the Moment.js API to ease migration for existing projects.
    * Ensure ease of use and integration for web developers.

* Business Goals:
    * Become a widely adopted replacement for Moment.js in projects where bundle size and performance are critical.
    * Grow a strong community of users and contributors.
    * Offer a reliable and well-documented date/time library.

* Business Risks:
    * Risk of security vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited in applications using dayjs.
    * Risk of incompatibility issues with Moment.js API, leading to integration challenges and developer dissatisfaction.
    * Risk of performance regressions or inefficiencies that could negate the benefits of a lightweight library.
    * Risk of insufficient community support or maintenance, leading to stagnation and security vulnerabilities not being addressed promptly.

# SECURITY POSTURE

* Security Control: Repository hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features for access control and vulnerability scanning. Implemented by: GitHub platform.
* Security Control: Open-source project, allowing for community review and contribution to identify and fix security issues. Implemented by: Open Source nature of the project.
* Accepted Risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by dayjs.
* Accepted Risk: Risk of developers misusing the library in ways that introduce security vulnerabilities in their applications.

* Recommended Security Controls:
    * Security Control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
    * Security Control: Conduct regular security audits and code reviews, focusing on potential vulnerabilities related to date parsing and manipulation.
    * Security Control: Provide clear security guidelines and best practices in the documentation for developers using dayjs, especially regarding input validation and handling of date formats from untrusted sources.

* Security Requirements:
    * Authentication: Not applicable for a JavaScript library. Dayjs itself does not handle authentication. Applications using dayjs will manage their own authentication.
    * Authorization: Not applicable for a JavaScript library. Dayjs itself does not handle authorization. Applications using dayjs will manage their own authorization.
    * Input Validation: Dayjs must robustly validate date inputs from various sources to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities due to malformed or malicious input strings. This is critical for parsing dates from user input or external APIs.
    * Cryptography: Cryptography is not a primary requirement for dayjs. However, if dayjs were to handle time zone data that is sensitive, cryptographic measures to ensure integrity and authenticity of time zone data might be considered. Currently, this is not a direct requirement.

## DEPLOYMENT

Dayjs library itself is not deployed as a standalone application. It is distributed as a package that is integrated into other applications. Deployment for dayjs refers to how developers include it in their projects and how those projects are deployed. Common deployment methods for applications using dayjs include:

*   CDN (Content Delivery Network): Applications can include dayjs from a CDN for browser-based applications.
*   npm (Node Package Manager): For Node.js applications and web applications using build tools, dayjs is typically installed via npm and bundled with the application.
*   Direct Download: Developers can download dayjs files and include them directly in their projects.

Let's consider the npm deployment scenario as it is a common and representative case.

* Build Process Description:
    1. Developer writes code and commits changes to the Source Code Repository (GitHub).
    2. Code commit to the repository triggers the Build System (CI/CD pipeline).
    3. Build Server fetches the latest code from the Source Code Repository.
    4. Build Server compiles and packages the dayjs library.
    5. Automated Tests are executed in the Test Environment to ensure functionality and code quality.
    6. Security Scans (SAST, Dependency Check) are performed to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code and dependencies.
    7. Build Server aggregates test and scan results. If tests and security checks pass, the build process continues.
    8. Build Server publishes the packaged dayjs library to the Package Registry (npm).

* Build Process Security Controls:
    * Security Control: Source Code Repository (GitHub) access control to ensure only authorized developers can commit code.
    * Security Control: Build Server security hardening and access control to prevent unauthorized access and modifications.
    * Security Control: Automated testing to catch functional defects and potential security issues early in the development lifecycle.
    * Security Control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
    * Security Control: Dependency scanning to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
    * Security Control: Secure publishing process to the Package Registry (npm), including using API keys and verifying package integrity.
    * Security Control: Code signing of published packages (if applicable) to ensure authenticity and integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

* Critical Business Processes:
    * Applications relying on accurate date and time calculations for core functionality (e.g., scheduling, financial calculations, logging, data processing).
    * Applications where incorrect date/time handling could lead to business logic errors, data corruption, or security vulnerabilities.

* Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
    * Date and time data processed by dayjs. Sensitivity depends on the context of the application using dayjs.
        * Low Sensitivity: In many UI applications, date/time is primarily for display and user experience.
        * Medium Sensitivity: In applications dealing with scheduling or logging, incorrect date/time can lead to operational issues.
        * High Sensitivity: In financial, medical, or legal applications, incorrect date/time can have serious legal and financial consequences. Date/time data might be considered personally identifiable information (PII) in some contexts.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

* Questions:
    * What are the specific compliance requirements for applications that will use dayjs (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS)? This will help determine the required level of security and data protection.
    * What is the expected threat model for applications using dayjs? Are they expected to be targeted by sophisticated attackers, or are more common web application vulnerabilities the primary concern?
    * What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in dayjs? Is there a security policy or contact information available?

* Assumptions:
    * Assumption: Dayjs is primarily used in web applications and Node.js environments.
    * Assumption: Security is a secondary concern compared to bundle size and performance for many dayjs users, but security is still important for a widely used library.
    * Assumption: Developers using dayjs are responsible for integrating it securely into their applications and validating inputs appropriately.
    * Assumption: The dayjs project follows standard open-source development practices, including code reviews and testing, but the extent of security-focused activities needs to be verified.
