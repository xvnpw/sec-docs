# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, "swiper", provides a mobile touch slider component for web and mobile applications.

- Business Priorities:
  - Provide a reusable, performant, and easy-to-integrate touch slider library for web and mobile developers.
  - Ensure wide compatibility across different browsers and devices.
  - Maintain a stable and reliable library to minimize integration issues for users.
  - Foster a strong community and provide good documentation to encourage adoption and contribution.

- Business Goals:
  - Become a widely adopted and recognized touch slider library in the web and mobile development ecosystem.
  - Enable developers to easily create engaging and user-friendly interfaces.
  - Continuously improve the library based on community feedback and evolving web standards.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in "swiper" could be exploited in numerous applications that depend on it, potentially leading to various security issues in those applications (e.g., Cross-Site Scripting, UI manipulation, denial of service).
  - Supply chain risks if the library's build or distribution process is compromised, leading to the distribution of malicious code to users.
  - Performance issues or bugs in "swiper" could negatively impact the user experience of applications that integrate it, potentially damaging the reputation of both "swiper" and the applications using it.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to stagnation and decreased adoption over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: GitHub repository with standard access controls for contributors. Implemented in: GitHub repository settings.
  - security control: Dependency scanning provided by GitHub Dependabot. Implemented in: GitHub Dependabot configuration.
  - security control: Issue tracking for reporting bugs and potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub Issues.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for security vulnerability identification and patching.
  - accepted risk: Potential for vulnerabilities to be present in dependencies used by the library.
  - accepted risk: Limited dedicated security resources for in-depth security audits and penetration testing.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct regular security code reviews, especially for critical components and contributions from external developers.
  - security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to continuously monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities and ensure timely updates.
  - security control: Consider signing release artifacts to enhance supply chain security and verify the integrity of distributed packages.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the "swiper" library itself, as it is a client-side component. Authentication is the responsibility of the applications that integrate "swiper".
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the "swiper" library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the applications that integrate "swiper".
  - Input Validation:
    - security requirement: Validate configuration options provided by developers to prevent unexpected behavior or errors.
    - security requirement: Sanitize or validate user-provided content that might be dynamically rendered within the slider to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in applications using "swiper".
    - security requirement: Ensure proper handling of touch events and user interactions to prevent unexpected states or security issues.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of the "swiper" library. Cryptographic operations are the responsibility of the applications that integrate "swiper" if needed.

    style H fill:#ffe,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

- Build Process Description:
  1. Developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
  2. GitHub Actions workflow is triggered automatically on code commit (e.g., push to main branch, pull request).
  3. GitHub Actions executes the build process, which typically includes:
     - Installing dependencies (using npm install or similar).
     - Compiling or bundling JavaScript and CSS code.
     - Running unit tests to ensure code quality and functionality.
     - Performing static analysis security testing (SAST) to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
     - Running linters to enforce code style and quality standards.
  4. If all checks pass, build artifacts (JavaScript and CSS files, npm package) are created.
  5. Build artifacts are published to the NPM Registry, making the new version of "swiper" available to developers.
  6. Build artifacts are also distributed to CDN providers for faster global delivery.

- Build Process Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated build process using GitHub Actions to ensure consistency and reduce manual errors.
  - security control: Source code version control using Git and GitHub to track changes and facilitate collaboration.
  - security control: Unit tests to verify code functionality and prevent regressions.
  - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST) integrated into the build pipeline to detect potential code-level vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.
  - security control: Linters to enforce code style and quality, reducing the likelihood of certain types of errors.
  - security control: Dependency scanning (GitHub Dependabot) to identify vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Access controls to GitHub Actions workflows and secrets to prevent unauthorized modifications to the build process.
  - security control: Consider signing release artifacts to ensure integrity and authenticity of distributed packages.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Reliable and secure delivery of the "swiper" library to developers.
  - Correct and secure functioning of the "swiper" library in applications that integrate it.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trust in the "swiper" library within the developer community.

- Data We Are Trying to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Source code of the "swiper" library: High sensitivity - Confidentiality and integrity are important to prevent unauthorized modifications or exposure of vulnerabilities.
  - Build artifacts (JavaScript, CSS files, npm package): Medium sensitivity - Integrity is crucial to ensure that developers and end users receive unmodified and safe code.
  - Developer and contributor credentials for GitHub and NPM: High sensitivity - Confidentiality is essential to prevent unauthorized access and malicious activities.
  - Usage data and metrics (download counts, etc.): Low sensitivity - Primarily for understanding usage patterns and trends, less critical from a direct security perspective.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports? Is there a security contact or security policy documented?
  - Are there any existing security audits or penetration testing reports for the "swiper" library?
  - What is the policy for updating dependencies, especially in response to security vulnerabilities?
  - Are there any specific coding standards or security guidelines followed by contributors?
  - Is there a process for verifying the identity and trustworthiness of contributors?

- Assumptions:
  - The primary distribution channels for "swiper" are NPM and CDNs.
  - Security is considered important but might not be the absolute top priority compared to functionality and ease of use.
  - The target audience is primarily web and mobile developers integrating the library into their projects.
  - The project relies heavily on community contributions and open-source principles.
  - The current security posture is based on standard GitHub and NPM security features, with room for improvement in proactive security measures.
