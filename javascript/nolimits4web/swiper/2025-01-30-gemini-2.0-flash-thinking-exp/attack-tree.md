## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Swiper [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_swiper__critical_node_.md)

*   This is the root goal of the attacker. Success at any of the sub-nodes leads to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Swiper Usage [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_swiper_usage__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   This path focuses on directly exploiting weaknesses in how the application uses the Swiper library on the client-side.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Swiper
    *   Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Swiper
    *   Client-Side Logic Manipulation via Swiper API Abuse

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Swiper [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_swiper__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   This is the most critical threat vector. Attackers aim to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the user's browser through Swiper.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Configuration Injection XSS
    *   Slide Content Injection XSS
    *   Vulnerability in Swiper Library Code (Less Likely, but Possible)

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Injection XSS [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_injection_xss__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **How it works:** Attackers manipulate Swiper configuration options, especially if the application dynamically generates configuration based on user input without sanitization. Malicious JavaScript injected into configuration options (like `onSlideChange`, `renderSlide`) executes in the user's browser.
*   **Example:** Application sets `onSlideChange` based on a URL parameter: `swiper.on('slideChange', function() { eval(getParameterByName('callback')); });`. Attacker crafts URL like `example.com/?callback=alert('XSS')`.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Never use `eval()` or similar unsafe functions for dynamic configuration.
    *   Strictly sanitize and validate user-provided data in Swiper configuration.
    *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script sources and inline execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Slide Content Injection XSS [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/slide_content_injection_xss__critical_node___high_risk_path_.md)

*   **How it works:** Attackers inject malicious HTML/JavaScript into content displayed within Swiper slides. This is possible if the application renders user-supplied or external data within Swiper slides without proper sanitization. Malicious script executes when Swiper renders the slide.
*   **Example:** Slide content fetched from a database and displayed directly in Swiper slides without HTML encoding. Attacker injects `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>` into the database.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Always sanitize and encode user-provided or external data before displaying in Swiper slides. Use HTML encoding.
    *   Use a templating engine that automatically escapes HTML.
    *   Implement CSP for further XSS mitigation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Related to Swiper Integration (Indirect) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_related_to_swiper_integration__indirect___critical_node_.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting server-side vulnerabilities that indirectly impact the client-side Swiper implementation, leading to client-side attacks.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Server-Side Configuration Injection leading to Client-Side Exploitation
    *   Server-Side Data Manipulation affecting Swiper Content

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Configuration Injection leading to Client-Side Exploitation [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_configuration_injection_leading_to_client-side_exploitation__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **How it works:** Attackers exploit server-side vulnerabilities (e.g., injection flaws) to influence Swiper configuration generated by the server. This malicious configuration is then sent to the client and exploited, often leading to XSS.
*   **Example:** Server-side script generates Swiper configuration based on data from a SQL injection vulnerable database. Attacker injects malicious SQL to modify configuration data, leading to XSS on the client.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Secure server-side applications against common web vulnerabilities (SQL injection, command injection, etc.).
    *   Sanitize and validate data from backend systems before using it to generate Swiper configuration.
    *   Treat server-generated Swiper configuration as potentially untrusted and apply client-side sanitization if needed.
