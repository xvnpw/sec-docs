## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 XSS via `on` Event Handlers (if improperly sanitized) [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_xss_via__on__event_handlers__if_improperly_sanitized___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by exploiting improperly sanitized user input that is passed to Swiper's event handlers (e.g., `slideChange`, `click`).  Swiper itself doesn't execute arbitrary code in event handlers, *but the application code using Swiper might*.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Highly dependent on developer implementation.)
*   **Impact:** High (XSS allows for a wide range of attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.)
*   **Effort:** Low (If sanitization is missing or flawed, injecting a script is often trivial.)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of XSS and JavaScript.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Detectable with code review, dynamic analysis, and security scanners, but subtle vulnerabilities can be missed.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove or escape any potentially dangerous characters or tags from user input *before* it's passed to Swiper's event handlers.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit the types of scripts that can be executed, mitigating the impact of XSS.
    *   **Context-Aware Escaping:** Ensure that the escaping method used is appropriate for the context where the data is being used (e.g., HTML attribute, JavaScript string, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.4 Inject malicious HTML into `navigation`, `pagination` or `scrollbar` [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_4_inject_malicious_html_into__navigation____pagination__or__scrollbar___high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by exploiting improperly sanitized user input that is passed to Swiper's `navigation`, `pagination` or `scrollbar` options, that accept HTML.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Highly dependent on developer implementation.)
*   **Impact:** High (XSS allows for a wide range of attacks, including session hijacking, data theft, and defacement.)
*   **Effort:** Low (If sanitization is missing or flawed, injecting a script is often trivial.)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of XSS and JavaScript.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Detectable with code review, dynamic analysis, and security scanners, but subtle vulnerabilities can be missed.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove or escape any potentially dangerous characters or tags from user input *before* it's passed to Swiper's options.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit the types of scripts that can be executed, mitigating the impact of XSS.
    *   **Context-Aware Escaping:** Ensure that the escaping method used is appropriate for the context where the data is being used (e.g., HTML attribute, JavaScript string, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1.1 XSS via Unsanitized User Input in Slide Content [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_1_xss_via_unsanitized_user_input_in_slide_content__high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by providing unsanitized input that is then rendered within Swiper slides.  This is a direct XSS attack, exploiting the application's handling of user-generated content.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Highly dependent on developer implementation; Swiper itself doesn't directly handle user input in this way, but applications often do.)
*   **Impact:** High (XSS allows for a wide range of attacks.)
*   **Effort:** Low (If sanitization is missing, injecting a script is trivial.)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of XSS.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Detectable with code review, dynamic analysis, and security scanners.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove or escape any potentially dangerous characters or tags from user input *before* it's rendered within Swiper slides.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP.
    *   **Context-Aware Escaping:** Ensure proper escaping for the context.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.1.2 Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Older Versions of Modules [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/4_1_2_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_older_versions_of_modules__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Swiper modules (e.g., Navigation, Pagination, A11y).  These vulnerabilities might allow for code execution, denial of service, or other exploits.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If the application uses outdated modules.)
*   **Impact:** Varies (Depends on the specific vulnerability, but can be high.)
*   **Effort:** Low (Publicly known vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits.)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of vulnerability databases and exploit usage.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Vulnerability scanners can easily detect outdated modules.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep Modules Updated:** Regularly update all Swiper modules to their latest versions.  Use a package manager (like npm or yarn) to manage dependencies and ensure they are up-to-date.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use automated vulnerability scanning tools to identify outdated dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [4.2.1 Apply Similar Attack Vectors as for Core Swiper [HIGH RISK] (for Custom Modules)](./attack_tree_paths/4_2_1_apply_similar_attack_vectors_as_for_core_swiper__high_risk___for_custom_modules_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers target custom Swiper modules, applying the same attack vectors that could be used against the core Swiper library (e.g., XSS, injection, etc.). Custom modules are often less scrutinized and may contain vulnerabilities.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Custom modules are more likely to have vulnerabilities than well-vetted libraries.)
*   **Impact:** Varies (Depends on the module's functionality and the specific vulnerability.)
*   **Effort:** Varies (Depends on the complexity of the module and the attacker's skill.)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced (Requires understanding of web security principles and the module's code.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires thorough code review and security testing.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices when developing custom modules.  Pay close attention to input validation, output encoding, and avoiding common web vulnerabilities.
    *   **Code Review:** Conduct thorough code reviews of custom modules, focusing on security aspects.
    *   **Security Testing:** Perform security testing (e.g., penetration testing, fuzzing) on custom modules.

## Attack Tree Path: [5.1.1 Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Older Versions of Dependencies [HIGH RISK] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/5_1_1_exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_older_versions_of_dependencies__high_risk___critical_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated versions of Swiper's dependencies (e.g., Dom7).  These vulnerabilities could allow for a wide range of attacks, including code execution and denial of service.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If the application uses outdated dependencies.)
*   **Impact:** Varies greatly (Depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but can be high.)
*   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Publicly known vulnerabilities often have readily available exploits.)
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of vulnerability databases and exploit usage.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy (Vulnerability scanners can easily detect outdated dependencies.)
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update all of Swiper's dependencies to their latest versions. Use a package manager to manage dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use automated vulnerability scanning tools.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit your project's dependencies to identify and address any potential security risks.
