## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within Slides](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__within_slides.md)

*   **1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within Slides:**

    *   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into the content displayed *within* Swiper slides.
    *   **How Swiper Contributes:** Swiper provides the container and structure for displaying content. It acts as the delivery mechanism for a malicious payload if the content *you* provide is not sanitized. This is Swiper's most significant direct contribution to a potential vulnerability.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A user submits a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` that is displayed within a Swiper slide. Without sanitization, the script executes.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of user accounts.
        *   Data theft (cookies, session tokens).
        *   Website defacement.
        *   Redirection to malicious sites.
        *   Execution of arbitrary code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** *Crucially*, use a robust HTML sanitizer (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove dangerous tags/attributes from user-supplied content *before* displaying it in Swiper slides.
            *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict script execution, providing a vital second layer of defense.
            *   **Output Encoding:** Ensure proper encoding of dynamic content within slides.
            *   **Input Validation:** Validate data types rigorously.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Excessive Slides](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__-_excessive_slides.md)

*   **2. Denial of Service (DoS) - Excessive Slides:**

    *   **Description:** An attacker creates an extremely large number of Swiper slides, overwhelming the application.
    *   **How Swiper Contributes:** Swiper's core function is creating and managing slides.  Uncontrolled slide creation directly leverages this functionality for a DoS attack.
    *   **Example:**
        *   An attacker submits a form with a value of 1,000,000 for the number of slides, potentially crashing the browser.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Website unavailability.
        *   Browser freezing/crashing.
        *   Server overload.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developer:**
            *   **Limit Number of Slides:** Enforce a strict upper limit on the number of slides.
            *   **Pagination/Lazy Loading:** Use Swiper's "virtual slides" feature or implement pagination to load only a subset of slides at a time. This is *essential* for both performance and security.
            *   **Server-Side Rate Limiting:** Limit the rate of slide creation.
            *   **Input Validation:** Validate any input controlling the number of slides.
