# Threat Model Analysis for nolimits4web/swiper

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into content displayed within Swiper slides. This is a direct result of Swiper rendering unsanitized content provided to it, often originating from user input or untrusted sources. When a user views the slider, the malicious script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, defacement of the web page.
    *   **Affected Component:** `renderSlide` function, potentially the core Swiper module when handling dynamically loaded content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict output encoding and sanitization of all content displayed within Swiper slides *before* passing it to Swiper for rendering. Utilize browser built-in sanitization functions or reputable sanitization libraries. Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [DOM Manipulation Leading to Code Injection](./threats/dom_manipulation_leading_to_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the data or configuration provided directly to Swiper in a way that causes the library to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript into the page through its DOM manipulation mechanisms. This exploits how Swiper handles and renders the provided data and configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to XSS, including account takeover, data theft, and malware distribution.
    *   **Affected Component:** Swiper's core module responsible for DOM manipulation, potentially configuration options handling.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all data used in Swiper's configuration options and slide content *before* it's used by Swiper. Avoid dynamically generating Swiper configurations based on untrusted input.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Older Swiper Versions](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_older_swiper_versions.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker targets known vulnerabilities present within the Swiper library code itself. If the application uses an outdated version, it is directly susceptible to publicly known exploits within Swiper.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the specific vulnerability within Swiper, but could range from XSS to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Swiper library code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Keep the Swiper library updated to the latest stable version. Regularly check for security advisories specifically related to Swiper and apply necessary patches or updates promptly.
