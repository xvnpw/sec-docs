# Attack Surface Analysis for nolimits4web/swiper

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Configuration Options](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_configuration_options.md)

* **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the application that are then executed in the victim's browser.
    * **How Swiper Contributes:** If the application dynamically generates Swiper configuration options (like `navigation.nextEl`, `navigation.prevEl`, `pagination.renderBullet`, or custom event handlers) based on user input or data from untrusted sources without proper sanitization, Swiper will render these options, potentially executing the injected script.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL with a malicious script in a parameter that is used to set the `navigation.nextEl` option. When the page loads, Swiper renders this malicious HTML, executing the script.
    * **Impact:**  Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, installation of malware.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and encode any user-provided data or data from untrusted sources before using it to configure Swiper options. Use context-aware output encoding.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed, reducing the impact of XSS even if it occurs.
        * **Avoid Dynamic Configuration with Untrusted Data:** If possible, avoid dynamically generating Swiper configuration options based on untrusted input. Use predefined, safe configurations.

## Attack Surface: [DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe Slide Content](./attack_surfaces/dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsafe_slide_content.md)

* **Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into the DOM through the content displayed within Swiper slides.
    * **How Swiper Contributes:** If the content displayed within Swiper slides originates from untrusted sources and is not properly sanitized before being rendered by Swiper, it can lead to DOM-based XSS.
    * **Example:** An attacker submits a comment containing a malicious script that is later displayed within a Swiper slide. When a user views that slide, the script executes in their browser.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, installation of malware.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Output Encoding:** Encode all data originating from untrusted sources before displaying it within Swiper slides. Use context-aware encoding appropriate for HTML.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  A strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of DOM-based XSS.
        * **Trusted Types (if supported):**  Utilize Trusted Types to prevent the injection of untrusted strings into potentially dangerous DOM manipulation sinks.
