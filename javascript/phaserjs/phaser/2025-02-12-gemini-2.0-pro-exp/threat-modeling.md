# Threat Model Analysis for phaserjs/phaser

## Threat: [Asset Injection/Substitution](./threats/asset_injectionsubstitution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker replaces legitimate game assets (images, audio, JSON files loaded via `Phaser.Loader`) with malicious ones. They might upload a modified image file to a poorly secured asset server, or intercept and alter network requests using a proxy. A specially crafted JSON file could exploit a parsing vulnerability in Phaser.
*   **Impact:** Game behavior alteration, display of inappropriate content, potential client-side code execution (if the "asset" is crafted to exploit a vulnerability, e.g., a specially crafted JSON file that triggers a bug in Phaser's parsing logic).
*   **Phaser Component Affected:** `Phaser.Loader`, `Phaser.Cache`, any scene using loaded assets.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the nature of the asset and potential for code execution).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI attributes on `<script>` and `<link>` tags for all externally loaded assets.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use CSP headers to restrict the origins from which assets can be loaded.
    *   **Secure Asset Hosting:** Host assets on a trusted server with strong access controls and HTTPS.
    *   **Asset Integrity Checks (Custom):** Implement custom checks (e.g., hashing) for assets loaded from less trusted sources, if SRI is not feasible.
    *   **Input Validation (for dynamically loaded assets):** If asset paths are generated dynamically, sanitize and validate them thoroughly.

## Threat: [Game State Manipulation (Client-Side)](./threats/game_state_manipulation__client-side_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker uses browser developer tools or custom scripts to directly modify game variables and object properties within the running Phaser game instance. They might alter player health, position, inventory, or other game state variables. This directly impacts how Phaser manages and renders the game.
*   **Impact:** Cheating, gaining unfair advantages, bypassing game rules, disrupting the experience for other players.
*   **Phaser Component Affected:** Virtually all Phaser components that manage game state: `Phaser.GameObjects`, `Phaser.Scene`, custom game classes, any variables storing game data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (for multiplayer games).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Authority:** The *primary* mitigation. The server should be the ultimate source of truth for game state. Clients send *actions*, not state updates. The server validates actions and updates the authoritative state.
    *   **Input Validation (Server-Side):** Rigorously validate *all* data received from clients. Assume the client is compromised.
    *   **Obfuscation/Minification:** Makes it *harder* (but not impossible) to understand and modify the client-side code.
    *   **Rate Limiting (Server-Side):** Limit the frequency of client requests to prevent rapid manipulation attempts.

## Threat: [Phaser Engine Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/phaser_engine_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a bug or vulnerability within the Phaser library itself (e.g., a flaw in the physics engine, rendering system, or input handling). This requires a deep understanding of Phaser's internals.
*   **Impact:** Potentially arbitrary code execution in the client's browser, data leakage, denial of service. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Phaser Component Affected:** Potentially any Phaser component, depending on the vulnerability. Examples: `Phaser.Physics.*`, `Phaser.Renderer.*`, `Phaser.Input.*`.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Phaser Updated:** Use the latest stable version of Phaser to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Monitor Phaser's Issue Tracker:** Stay informed about reported vulnerabilities on GitHub and community forums.
    *   **Input Sanitization (for Phaser APIs):** Even when using a library, sanitize data passed to Phaser functions, especially if it's derived from user input or external sources. This can prevent triggering vulnerabilities *within* Phaser.
    *   **Security Audits (High-Value Games):** Consider a professional security audit of the relevant Phaser codebase sections.

## Threat: [Third-Party Plugin Vulnerability](./threats/third-party_plugin_vulnerability.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a third-party Phaser plugin. The plugin might have insecure code, outdated dependencies, or other flaws. This directly impacts the Phaser environment through the plugin's integration.
*   **Impact:** Similar to Phaser engine vulnerabilities, but the source is the plugin. Could range from minor glitches to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Phaser Component Affected:** The specific plugin and any Phaser components it interacts with.
*   **Risk Severity:** Potentially Critical to High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Vet Plugins Carefully:** Use plugins only from reputable sources. Review code, reviews, and community activity.
    *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Update plugins to their latest versions.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Use only essential plugins.
    *   **Isolate Plugin Functionality (If Possible):** Limit the plugin's access to other parts of the game.
