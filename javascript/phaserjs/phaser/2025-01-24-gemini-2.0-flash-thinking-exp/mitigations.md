# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for phaserjs/phaser

## Mitigation Strategy: [Phaser Version Management and Updates](./mitigation_strategies/phaser_version_management_and_updates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly check for new Phaser releases:** Monitor the official Phaser website, GitHub repository ([https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser](https://github.com/phaserjs/phaser)), or npm for new version announcements. Pay attention to release notes and security advisories specifically related to Phaser.
    2.  **Review Phaser release notes and changelogs:** Carefully examine the release notes and changelogs for each new Phaser version, specifically looking for mentions of security fixes, bug patches, and vulnerability resolutions within the Phaser engine itself.
    3.  **Test Phaser updates in a development environment:** Before deploying to production, update Phaser in a development or staging environment. Conduct thorough testing of your Phaser game to ensure compatibility with the updated Phaser version and identify any Phaser-specific breaking changes or regressions.
    4.  **Update Phaser dependency in project:** Update the Phaser library in your project's dependency management system (e.g., `package.json` if using npm/yarn) to the latest stable version. Run the update command to fetch and install the new Phaser version.
    5.  **Post-Phaser-update testing:** After updating Phaser, perform comprehensive testing of your game application, focusing on core Phaser functionalities, critical game mechanics that rely on Phaser features, and areas potentially affected by Phaser engine updates.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploiting known Phaser vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Attackers can exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities *within the Phaser engine itself* in older versions to compromise the game or user systems. This could lead to unexpected game behavior, crashes, or potentially more serious exploits if Phaser vulnerabilities allow for code execution in certain contexts (though less common in a game engine context compared to server-side frameworks).
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for known *Phaser-specific* vulnerabilities. Regularly updating Phaser directly addresses security flaws within the game engine.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, we are currently using Phaser v3.60, and the dependency is managed through `package.json` using npm. We have a manual process for checking Phaser updates every quarter.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Automated dependency vulnerability scanning specifically for Phaser and its dependencies.  A more formalized regression testing process focused on Phaser engine functionalities after updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Third-Party Phaser Plugin Security](./mitigation_strategies/third-party_phaser_plugin_security.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Inventory Phaser Plugins:** Create a comprehensive list of all third-party Phaser plugins used in the project. Focus specifically on plugins designed to extend Phaser's functionality.
    2.  **Source Code Review of Phaser Plugins:**  Whenever feasible, review the source code of Phaser plugins, especially those that interact deeply with Phaser's core systems or handle game data. Look for suspicious code patterns, potential vulnerabilities introduced *within the plugin's Phaser integration*, or outdated Phaser API usage.
    3.  **Community Reputation Check for Phaser Plugins:** Research the plugin's reputation within the Phaser community. Check Phaser forums, plugin repositories, and community discussions for user reviews, reported issues, and maintainer activity specifically related to Phaser plugins.
    4.  **Update Frequency and Maintenance of Phaser Plugins:** Prioritize Phaser plugins that are actively maintained and regularly updated to be compatible with current Phaser versions. Check the last commit date and release history on their repositories, looking for updates that address Phaser version compatibility or bug fixes.
    5.  **Vulnerability Scanning for Phaser Plugins (if possible):**  If tools are available, use static analysis or vulnerability scanning tools to analyze Phaser plugin code for known security flaws or potential issues arising from their interaction with Phaser.
    6.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Phaser Plugins:** Only include Phaser plugins that are absolutely necessary for the game's functionality. Avoid adding unnecessary Phaser plugin dependencies that increase the attack surface within the Phaser game environment.
    7.  **Regular Audits of Phaser Plugins:** Periodically re-evaluate the necessity and security of all third-party Phaser plugins. Remove or replace any that are no longer needed or pose an unacceptable security risk within the Phaser game context.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Phaser Plugin Code Injection (High Severity):** A compromised or malicious Phaser plugin could inject malicious JavaScript code into the Phaser game, potentially exploiting Phaser APIs or game logic to cause harm.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Phaser Plugins (Medium to High Severity):** Phaser plugins may contain their own security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, injection flaws) that can be exploited *within the Phaser game environment*. These vulnerabilities might arise from improper use of Phaser APIs or insecure plugin code.
    *   **Phaser Plugin Compatibility Issues Leading to Exploits (Medium Severity):** Incompatibility between Phaser plugins and specific Phaser versions could lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities that attackers might exploit.
*   **Impact:** Moderate to High reduction in risk. Careful vetting and management of Phaser plugins significantly reduces the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities through third-party code *within the Phaser game*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We maintain a list of Phaser plugins, but source code reviews are not consistently performed. Community reputation is considered informally. Plugin updates are generally manual and not systematically tracked.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formalized Phaser plugin vetting process with documented source code review guidelines focusing on Phaser API usage and plugin interactions with the engine. Automated vulnerability scanning for Phaser plugins. System for tracking Phaser plugin updates and prompting reviews for Phaser compatibility and security.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Asset Loading Path Security within Phaser](./mitigation_strategies/asset_loading_path_security_within_phaser.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Phaser Asset Paths:**  Within your Phaser game code, define a limited set of allowed directories or paths from which Phaser game assets (images, audio, atlases, etc.) can be loaded using Phaser's asset loading mechanisms (e.g., `load.image`, `load.audio`). Avoid allowing arbitrary or user-controlled paths directly within Phaser's asset loading functions.
    2.  **Relative Paths in Phaser Asset Loading:**  Consistently use relative paths for asset loading within your Phaser game code. This reduces the risk of path manipulation and directory traversal attempts *through Phaser's asset loading system*.
    3.  **Server-Side Validation for Phaser Asset Paths (if applicable):** If asset paths used in Phaser are derived from user input or external data (e.g., level editor data that specifies asset paths), implement strict server-side validation *before* passing these paths to the Phaser game client. Ensure paths are within allowed directories and conform to expected formats before they are used in Phaser's asset loading.
    4.  **Sanitize Input for Phaser Asset Paths (Client-Side, if unavoidable):** If client-side path construction for Phaser assets is unavoidable, sanitize any user-provided input used in path construction *before* using it in Phaser's asset loading functions. Remove potentially malicious characters or path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `./`) to prevent exploitation *through Phaser's asset loading*.
    5.  **Secure Asset Hosting for Phaser Assets:** Ensure the server or storage location hosting Phaser game assets is properly secured. Implement access controls to prevent unauthorized access or modification of assets that are loaded by Phaser.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Directory Traversal Attacks via Phaser Asset Loading (High Severity):** Attackers could potentially manipulate asset paths used by Phaser to access files outside of the intended asset directories *through Phaser's asset loading mechanisms*, potentially exposing sensitive server files or game data.
    *   **Malicious Asset Injection via Phaser Asset Loading (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers could potentially inject malicious assets (e.g., modified images with embedded scripts, corrupted data files) if Phaser asset loading paths are not properly controlled or validated, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or exploits *within the Phaser game*.
*   **Impact:** Moderate to High reduction in risk. Restricting and validating asset paths used by Phaser significantly reduces the attack surface for path-based vulnerabilities *related to Phaser's asset loading*.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We primarily use relative paths and load assets from predefined directories within the Phaser game project structure. Basic input sanitization is applied in some areas where paths are dynamically constructed for Phaser asset loading.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Formal server-side validation for asset paths used by Phaser that are derived from external sources. More robust client-side input sanitization specifically for path construction used in Phaser asset loading.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization for Phaser Game Input](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_for_phaser_game_input.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Phaser Game Input Points:** Identify all points in your Phaser game where user input is directly handled by Phaser's input systems (e.g., keyboard input, mouse input, touch input, pointer events).
    2.  **Define Expected Phaser Game Input:** For each Phaser input point, define the expected input types, formats, and ranges within the context of your game's mechanics and Phaser input handling.
    3.  **Validation of Phaser Game Input:** Implement validation checks within your Phaser game code to ensure that received Phaser input conforms to the defined expectations. Reject or sanitize input that does not meet the criteria *within the Phaser input handling logic*.
    4.  **Sanitization for Phaser Text Display (if applicable):** If Phaser game input is used to construct dynamic text that is displayed using Phaser's text objects, sanitize the input to remove or encode potentially harmful characters or sequences that could cause issues with Phaser's text rendering or introduce XSS if the text is later used in a web context outside of Phaser (though less common).
    5.  **Context-Specific Phaser Input Validation:** Phaser input validation should be context-aware within the game. For example, input for player movement might have different validation rules than input for in-game chat (if implemented within Phaser).
    6.  **Regular Review of Phaser Input Validation:** Periodically review Phaser input validation logic to ensure it is comprehensive and effective, especially as new game mechanics or Phaser input handling features are added.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Phaser Game Input (Low to Medium Severity):** If Phaser game input is directly used to generate dynamic content that is then displayed in a web context outside of the Phaser canvas without proper sanitization, attackers *could potentially* inject malicious scripts. This is less direct in a typical Phaser game but could be a concern if Phaser game content interacts with other web elements.
    *   **Game Logic Exploits via Malicious Phaser Input (Low to Medium Severity):** Malicious Phaser game input could potentially be crafted to bypass game logic, cheat, or cause unexpected game behavior *within the Phaser game* if Phaser input validation is insufficient. For example, sending invalid key codes or pointer events.
*   **Impact:** Low to Moderate reduction in risk. Phaser input validation and sanitization are important for preventing game logic exploits and potential (though less direct) XSS risks related to game content generated from Phaser input.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic Phaser input validation is implemented for player movement and some in-game actions. Sanitization is applied to chat messages displayed within Phaser text objects.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Systematic Phaser input validation across all relevant Phaser input points. More robust sanitization for all dynamic text display within Phaser that originates from user input.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Client-Side Phaser Logic Security for Critical Game Mechanics](./mitigation_strategies/client-side_phaser_logic_security_for_critical_game_mechanics.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Critical Phaser Game Logic:** Analyze your Phaser game code to identify any game logic or operations that are critical to game fairness, progression, or security. This includes scoring calculations, in-game currency management, inventory handling *within the Phaser game*, and any mechanics that should not be easily manipulated by players.
    2.  **Minimize Sensitive Logic in Client-Side Phaser:** Move as much sensitive game logic as possible *out of the client-side Phaser game* and onto a secure server-side environment. The client-side Phaser game should primarily handle rendering, user interface, and non-critical game mechanics.
    3.  **API Communication for Phaser Game Actions:** Establish secure APIs for communication between the client-side Phaser game and the server-side backend for actions related to critical game mechanics. Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for all communication initiated from the Phaser game.
    4.  **Server-Side Validation and Authorization for Phaser Actions:** Implement robust server-side validation and authorization for all actions initiated by the Phaser game client that relate to critical game mechanics. Never trust client-side Phaser game logic or data for security-critical operations.
    5.  **Focus Phaser Client on Rendering and UI:** Design the client-side Phaser game to primarily focus on rendering the game world, handling user interface elements, and managing non-critical game mechanics. Offload critical logic to the server.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cheating and Game Exploitation in Phaser Games (High Severity in competitive games):** If critical game logic is client-side within the Phaser game, players can easily manipulate the game to cheat, gain unfair advantages, or exploit game mechanics *within the Phaser game*.
    *   **Data Tampering of Phaser Game State (Medium to High Severity):** Attackers can modify client-side Phaser game data, such as scores, inventory, or in-game currency, if sensitive data is stored or processed solely within the Phaser game client.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions in Phaser Games (Medium Severity):** If authorization checks for critical game actions are performed client-side within Phaser, attackers can bypass them to gain unauthorized access to game features or perform actions they are not permitted to *within the Phaser game*.
*   **Impact:** High reduction in risk for cheating and data manipulation *within the Phaser game*. Minimizing sensitive logic in the client-side Phaser game and moving it to the server is the most effective way to prevent client-side exploitation of game mechanics.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Core game logic like player movement and basic interactions is client-side in Phaser. Scoring and some inventory management are handled server-side via API calls.
*   **Missing Implementation:** More comprehensive server-side validation for all Phaser game actions that affect game state or player progression. Migration of more complex game mechanics and potentially in-game currency management *related to Phaser game actions* to the server-side.
