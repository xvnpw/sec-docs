# Threat Model Analysis for phaserjs/phaser

## Threat: [Malicious Asset Injection](./threats/malicious_asset_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Asset Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker intercepts the loading of game assets (images, audio, JSON data) and replaces them with malicious content. This could be done through a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the asset delivery mechanism. The core of this threat lies in Phaser's asset loading process.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Display of inappropriate or offensive content.
        *   Redirection of users to malicious websites.
        *   Execution of malicious JavaScript code if the injected asset is crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in how Phaser handles certain asset types.
    *   **Affected Phaser Component:**
        *   `Phaser.Loader.LoaderPlugin` (responsible for loading assets)
        *   `Phaser.Cache` (where loaded assets are stored)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement HTTPS:** Ensure all assets are loaded over secure HTTPS connections to prevent MITM attacks.
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI tags in HTML to verify the integrity of loaded assets.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which assets can be loaded.
        *   **Asset Validation:** Implement checks to validate the integrity or expected properties of loaded assets after they are loaded by Phaser.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Phaser Plugins](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_phaser_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Phaser Plugins
    *   **Description:** If the application uses third-party Phaser plugins, vulnerabilities in these plugins could be exploited by attackers. This directly involves Phaser's plugin system and can range from minor bugs to more serious issues allowing arbitrary code execution within the Phaser context.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Similar impacts to malicious asset injection, including XSS or redirection.
        *   Potential for more severe vulnerabilities depending on the plugin's functionality, potentially compromising the entire application's client-side execution.
    *   **Affected Phaser Component:**
        *   `Phaser.Plugins.PluginManager` (manages plugins)
        *   The specific vulnerable plugin itself.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be High or Critical depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Careful Plugin Selection:** Only use plugins from trusted and reputable sources with active maintenance and security practices.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all Phaser plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in used plugins.
        *   **Code Review:** If possible, review the source code of plugins before using them to identify potential security flaws. Consider the plugin's permissions and access within the Phaser environment.
