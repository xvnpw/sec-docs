# Attack Surface Analysis for phaserjs/phaser

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading.md)

*   **Description:** The application loads external assets (images, audio, JSON, etc.) that could be malicious.
*   **How Phaser Contributes:** Phaser provides functions like `load.image`, `load.audio`, `load.json`, and others to fetch and integrate these assets into the game. If the source or integrity of these assets isn't verified, it creates an entry point for malicious content.
*   **Example:** An attacker replaces a legitimate image hosted on a compromised CDN with an SVG file containing embedded JavaScript. When Phaser loads and renders this "image," the malicious script executes in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. Denial of service if the malicious asset is excessively large or resource-intensive.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which assets can be loaded.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI tags for assets loaded from CDNs to ensure their integrity.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (Server-Side):** If asset URLs are user-provided or derived from user input, validate and sanitize them on the server-side before passing them to Phaser.
    *   **Secure Asset Hosting:** Host assets on a secure, trusted server or CDN.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly audit the asset loading process and dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Phaser Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_phaser_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** The application uses third-party Phaser plugins that contain security vulnerabilities.
*   **How Phaser Contributes:** Phaser's plugin system (`plugins.install`) allows developers to extend its functionality. If a plugin has vulnerabilities, it becomes part of the application's attack surface.
*   **Example:** A poorly written plugin might directly manipulate the DOM without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts through plugin-specific functionalities.
*   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the plugin's vulnerability. It could range from XSS to remote code execution if the plugin interacts with server-side components or handles sensitive data insecurely.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Careful Plugin Selection:** Thoroughly vet and research plugins before using them. Choose plugins from reputable sources with active maintenance and security records.
    *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all Phaser plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Audits of Plugins:** If possible, conduct security audits of the plugins used, or rely on audits performed by trusted third parties.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** If a plugin requires specific permissions, ensure it only has the necessary access.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Game State](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_game_state.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information is inadvertently stored or exposed within the Phaser game's client-side state.
*   **How Phaser Contributes:** Phaser manages game objects and data in the client's memory, making it potentially accessible.
*   **Example:** Developers might mistakenly store API keys, user credentials, or other sensitive data within Phaser game objects or variables, making them visible in the browser's memory or through debugging tools.
*   **Impact:** Compromise of sensitive data, leading to account takeover, unauthorized access, or other security breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Storing Sensitive Information Client-Side:**  Do not store sensitive information directly within the Phaser game state.
    *   **Handle Sensitive Data Server-Side:** Process and manage sensitive data exclusively on the server-side.
    *   **Secure Communication:** Use HTTPS for all communication between the client and server to protect data in transit.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) via Phaser Assets](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_script_inclusion__xssi__via_phaser_assets.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can include malicious scripts from their domain within the context of the application by exploiting how Phaser loads assets.
*   **How Phaser Contributes:** If Phaser is configured to load assets from untrusted domains without proper CORS controls, an attacker can host a malicious JavaScript file and trick the application into loading it as a game asset.
*   **Example:** An attacker hosts a malicious JavaScript file on their server and then manipulates the application (e.g., through a vulnerability in how asset paths are handled) to load this file as if it were a legitimate game asset.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the application's origin, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict CORS Configuration:** Implement and enforce strict CORS headers on the server hosting the assets.
    *   **Restrict Asset Origins:**  Limit the allowed origins for loading assets in Phaser's configuration.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI tags for assets loaded from external domains to ensure their integrity.
