## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_known_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path focuses on leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities in the PhaserJS library. Attackers scan for applications using outdated or vulnerable versions of PhaserJS.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Access Public Vulnerability Databases (e.g., CVE): Attackers consult public resources to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   Identify Applicable PhaserJS Vulnerabilities: They pinpoint vulnerabilities affecting the specific PhaserJS version used by the target application.
    *   Develop or Obtain Exploit Code: Attackers either create their own exploit or find existing exploit code online.
    *   Execute Exploit Against Vulnerable Phaser Version [CRITICAL]: The attacker runs the exploit against the application, potentially gaining code execution or control.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Execute Exploit Against Vulnerable Phaser Version](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_execute_exploit_against_vulnerable_phaser_version.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the culmination of exploiting known vulnerabilities. Successful execution allows the attacker to run arbitrary code within the context of the application, leading to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Execute Exploit Against Target Application (Zero-Day)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_execute_exploit_against_target_application__zero-day_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  This represents the exploitation of previously unknown vulnerabilities in PhaserJS. This requires significant skill and effort to discover and develop an exploit. Successful execution results in a critical compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Manipulate Game Assets and Resources](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_manipulate_game_assets_and_resources.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to inject malicious content by replacing legitimate game assets with modified versions. This can introduce malicious scripts or alter the game's behavior.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify Asset Loading Mechanisms in Application: Understanding how the game loads assets is crucial.
    *   Intercept Asset Requests (e.g., Man-in-the-Middle): Attackers might intercept network traffic to replace assets in transit.
    *   Replace Legitimate Assets with Malicious Ones [CRITICAL]: The core of the attack, where malicious assets are substituted.
        *   Introduce Malicious Code within Assets (e.g., JavaScript in JSON) [CRITICAL]:  Malicious code embedded within seemingly harmless asset files can be executed by the game.
    *   Exploit Insecure Asset Delivery (e.g., Missing Integrity Checks): Lack of integrity checks makes it easier to inject modified assets without detection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Inject Malicious Assets](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_inject_malicious_assets.md)

**Attack Vector:** Successfully injecting malicious assets allows attackers to control the resources used by the game, leading to code execution or manipulation of the game experience.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Introduce Malicious Code within Assets (e.g., JavaScript in JSON)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_introduce_malicious_code_within_assets__e_g___javascript_in_json_.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is a specific technique within asset injection where malicious scripts are hidden within data files that the game processes, leading to code execution when the asset is loaded.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Corrupt Game Data](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_corrupt_game_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the game stores data client-side (e.g., in `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`), attackers can directly manipulate this data to gain an unfair advantage or disrupt the game.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Identify How Game Data is Stored and Accessed (Client-Side): Understanding where and how data is stored is the first step.
    *   Manipulate LocalStorage or SessionStorage Data [CRITICAL]: Attackers directly modify the contents of client-side storage.
    *   Alter Game State or Player Progress: By changing the stored data, attackers can influence the game's state or player progression.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Manipulate LocalStorage or SessionStorage Data](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_manipulate_localstorage_or_sessionstorage_data.md)

**Attack Vector:** Direct manipulation of client-side storage allows attackers to alter game variables, progress, or other data, potentially breaking the game's intended functionality or providing unfair advantages.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities Through Phaser's Integration (Third-Party Libraries)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_through_phaser's_integration__third-party_libraries_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  PhaserJS applications often integrate with other JavaScript libraries. Vulnerabilities in these third-party libraries can be exploited through Phaser's integration, allowing attackers to leverage weaknesses in the broader ecosystem.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Exploit Vulnerabilities Within the Plugin Context (Phaser Plugins)](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_exploit_vulnerabilities_within_the_plugin_context__phaser_plugins_.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Phaser plugins extend the framework's functionality. If these plugins contain vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to compromise the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path (for local compromise): Manipulate Game Logic through Browser Developer Tools](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path__for_local_compromise__manipulate_game_logic_through_browser_developer_tools.md)

**Attack Vector:** This path requires the attacker to have direct access to the user's browser and use the developer console to modify the game's JavaScript code and variables. While it typically only affects the local instance of the game, it can lead to significant manipulation.
*   **Steps:**
    *   Access Browser Developer Console: Opening the browser's developer tools.
    *   Modify JavaScript Variables and Functions: Directly altering the game's code in real-time.
    *   Alter Game State or Behavior Directly:  Changing game logic and variables to achieve the attacker's goals within their local game instance.
