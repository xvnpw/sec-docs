# Attack Surface Analysis for phaserjs/phaser

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Asset Loading](./attack_surfaces/malicious_asset_loading.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Malicious Asset Loading
    * **Description:**  The application loads game assets (images, audio, JSON, etc.) from potentially untrusted sources or user uploads.
    * **Phaser Contribution:** Phaser provides mechanisms for loading various asset types using its `Loader` API. If the application doesn't properly sanitize asset paths or validate asset content, it can be vulnerable.
    * **Example:** An attacker uploads a specially crafted image file that exploits a vulnerability in the browser's image rendering engine when Phaser attempts to display it.
    * **Impact:** Client-side code execution, denial of service (browser crash), information disclosure (if the browser vulnerability allows).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restrict the sources from which assets can be loaded using the `img-src`, `media-src`, and `script-src` directives.
        * **Asset Validation:** Implement server-side validation of uploaded assets to ensure they conform to expected file types and do not contain malicious content.
        * **Secure Asset Storage:** Store user-uploaded assets in a separate, isolated location and serve them through a domain without the application's cookies.
        * **Avoid Dynamic Asset Paths from User Input:**  Do not directly use user input to construct asset paths without thorough sanitization and validation.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Phaser Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_phaser_plugins.md)

* **Attack Surface:** Vulnerable Phaser Plugins
    * **Description:** The application uses third-party Phaser plugins or extensions that contain security vulnerabilities.
    * **Phaser Contribution:** Phaser's plugin system allows developers to extend its functionality. Using untrusted or outdated plugins introduces a risk.
    * **Example:** A plugin used for social media sharing has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript when a specific function is called.
    * **Impact:** Client-side code execution, data leakage, manipulation of game behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Plugin Auditing:** Carefully review the code of any third-party plugins before using them.
        * **Reputable Sources:** Only use plugins from trusted and well-maintained sources.
        * **Dependency Management:** Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * **Security Scans:** Use security scanning tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in plugin code.
