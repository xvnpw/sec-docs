# Threat Model Analysis for phaserjs/phaser

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerable Phaser Plugins](./threats/exploiting_vulnerable_phaser_plugins.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerable Phaser Plugins

**Description:** An attacker leverages known vulnerabilities present within third-party Phaser plugins that are integrated into the game. This could involve injecting malicious code that executes within the game's context, allowing for data theft, manipulation of game logic, or even redirection to malicious sites. The attacker might target publicly known vulnerabilities in popular plugins or discover zero-day vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  **High to Critical.** Remote code execution within the client's browser, potentially leading to access to sensitive data, manipulation of the game for malicious purposes (e.g., cheating on a massive scale, disrupting gameplay for others), or using the game as a vector to attack the user's system.

**Affected Phaser Component:** Plugin Manager, specific plugin code and its integration points within the Phaser engine.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**  Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party Phaser plugins before integration. Keep plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the capabilities of plugins. Consider sandboxing or limiting the permissions granted to plugins. Regularly scan project dependencies for known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities Leading to Phaser Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_leading_to_phaser_exploitation.md)

**Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities Leading to Phaser Exploitation

**Description:** Phaser relies on other JavaScript libraries. If these dependencies have critical vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them to compromise the Phaser application. This might not be a direct flaw in Phaser's code but a weakness in a library Phaser utilizes, which can then be leveraged to attack the game.

**Impact:** **High to Critical.** Depending on the vulnerability, this could allow for remote code execution within the browser, access to the game's state and data, or the ability to manipulate the game's behavior in unintended ways. This exploit would leverage a flaw in a library that Phaser trusts and uses.

**Affected Phaser Component:**  Potentially any component that utilizes the vulnerable dependency. This could include the Loader, Renderer, or Input systems, depending on the affected library.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**  Regularly update Phaser and all its dependencies to the latest versions. Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., npm audit, Yarn audit, Snyk) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in the project's dependencies. Monitor security advisories for Phaser's dependencies and promptly update when fixes are released.
