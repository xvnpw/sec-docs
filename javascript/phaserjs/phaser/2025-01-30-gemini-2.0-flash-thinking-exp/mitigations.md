# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for phaserjs/phaser

## Mitigation Strategy: [Validate Asset Sources](./mitigation_strategies/validate_asset_sources.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define a clear policy for where your Phaser game is allowed to load assets from. This includes images, audio files, JSON data, and any other resources used by Phaser.  Consider trusted domains like your own server or reputable CDNs specifically for game assets.
    *   Step 2: Configure your Phaser game's asset loading mechanisms to only accept assets from these pre-defined, trusted sources.  This might involve setting base URLs for asset paths within your Phaser configuration or code.
    *   Step 3: Implement checks within your game's asset loading functions to verify that the origin of any requested asset URL matches your allowed sources. Reject or ignore requests for assets from unauthorized domains.
    *   Step 4: If using external asset stores or marketplaces for Phaser-compatible assets, carefully vet the providers to ensure they are reputable and have secure asset delivery practices.
    *   Step 5: Avoid dynamically constructing asset URLs based on user input or data from untrusted sources, as this could bypass source validation and lead to loading malicious assets into your Phaser game.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious Asset Injection - Severity: High (Prevents loading of malicious game assets from untrusted sources into your Phaser game, potentially leading to XSS or other exploits within the game context)
    *   Data Exfiltration (via assets) - Severity: Medium (Reduces the risk of loading assets that might contain malicious scripts designed to exfiltrate game data or user information)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious Asset Injection: High reduction. Restricting asset sources significantly reduces the risk of loading compromised game assets into your Phaser application.
    *   Data Exfiltration (via assets): Medium reduction. Limits potential avenues for data exfiltration through malicious game assets.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Hypothetical Project - Asset loading in Phaser game is configured to primarily load from a dedicated CDN and internal server.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Hypothetical Project -  Explicit validation checks within Phaser asset loading functions to enforce allowed origins are not yet implemented.  Dynamic asset URL construction based on game level data needs review for potential source validation bypass.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Asset Types and Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/limit_asset_types_and_extensions.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define a strict whitelist of allowed asset file types and extensions that your Phaser game will load.  Focus on the specific asset types Phaser uses, such as image formats (e.g., `.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`), audio formats (e.g., `.ogg`, `.mp3`), JSON data (`.json`), and potentially JavaScript files for game code or plugins (`.js`).
    *   Step 2: Implement checks within your Phaser game's asset loading logic to verify that requested asset files have extensions that are on your allowed list. Reject requests for files with disallowed extensions.
    *   Step 3: Ensure your server serving Phaser game assets is configured to serve them with the correct MIME types based on their file extensions. This helps Phaser and the browser correctly interpret the asset files.
    *   Step 4: If your Phaser game involves any user-generated content or asset uploads (e.g., custom levels, avatars), implement robust server-side file type validation that goes beyond just extension checks. Use file signature analysis or MIME type detection libraries to verify the actual file type before allowing Phaser to load them.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Malicious File Upload as Game Asset - Severity: High (Prevents uploading and loading of malicious files disguised as legitimate Phaser game assets, such as HTML or SVG files that could be interpreted by Phaser or the browser in unintended ways)
    *   Unexpected File Processing by Phaser - Severity: Medium (Reduces the risk of Phaser attempting to process unexpected file types as game assets, which could potentially lead to errors or vulnerabilities)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Malicious File Upload as Game Asset: High reduction. Limiting allowed asset types and extensions significantly reduces the risk of malicious file uploads being used as game assets in Phaser.
    *   Unexpected File Processing by Phaser: Medium reduction. Reduces the attack surface related to Phaser's asset processing capabilities.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Hypothetical Project - Phaser game's asset loading code includes basic checks for allowed file extensions for common image and audio types.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Hypothetical Project -  More comprehensive file type validation within Phaser asset loading is needed, especially for JSON and JavaScript assets. Server-side validation for user-generated content intended for use as Phaser assets is not yet implemented.
