# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, PhaserJS, is an open-source 2D game engine for web browsers, supporting JavaScript and TypeScript. Its primary business priority is to provide a feature-rich, performant, and easy-to-use game development framework for developers to create games for the web and other platforms. The project's success is measured by its adoption rate, community engagement, and the quality of games built using it.

Key business goals include:
- Growing the user base of game developers utilizing PhaserJS.
- Maintaining a vibrant and active community around the engine.
- Continuously improving the engine with new features, performance enhancements, and bug fixes.
- Ensuring the engine remains compatible with modern web browsers and technologies.
- Fostering a positive reputation for PhaserJS as a reliable and powerful game engine.

The most important business risks that need to be addressed are:
- Security vulnerabilities in the PhaserJS engine itself. If vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited in games built with PhaserJS, it can damage the reputation of the engine and deter adoption.
- Lack of community trust due to security concerns. If the project is perceived as insecure, developers may choose alternative engines.
- Supply chain attacks targeting PhaserJS dependencies or build process. Compromising the engine's distribution could have widespread impact on games using it.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open-source code review by the community. The PhaserJS codebase is publicly available on GitHub, allowing for community scrutiny and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented in: GitHub repository and community contribution process.
- security control: Use of GitHub for version control and collaboration. GitHub provides basic security features like access control and audit logs for repository activities. Implemented in: GitHub platform.
- security control: Dependency management using npm. npm provides a registry for JavaScript packages and tools for managing project dependencies. Implemented in: package.json and npm ecosystem.

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on community for security vulnerability identification and patching. The project's security posture heavily depends on the active participation of the open-source community to identify and report vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies. PhaserJS relies on external npm packages, which may contain security vulnerabilities that could affect the engine.
- accepted risk: Lack of formal security development lifecycle (SDL). As an open-source project, PhaserJS may not have a dedicated security team or a formal SDL process in place.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- security control: Implement automated Dependency Scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy and process to handle security reports from the community effectively.
- security control: Conduct periodic security code reviews, focusing on critical components and areas prone to vulnerabilities.
- security control: Consider implementing Fuzz testing to identify unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities in input handling.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the PhaserJS engine itself, as it is a client-side library. Authentication is relevant for any backend services that games built with PhaserJS might interact with, but this is outside the scope of the engine itself.
- Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is not a primary concern for the engine. Authorization would be relevant in the context of backend services used by games.
- Input validation: Crucial for PhaserJS. The engine needs to handle various types of input from game developers and the browser environment (e.g., user input, asset loading, configuration). Robust input validation is necessary to prevent vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other injection attacks in games built with PhaserJS.
- Cryptography: PhaserJS might require cryptographic functionalities for certain game features (e.g., secure communication, data encryption). If cryptography is used, it must be implemented correctly and securely, using well-vetted libraries and algorithms. However, core engine itself might not require cryptography. Games built on top of PhaserJS might require cryptography.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Development, build, and distribution of the PhaserJS game engine. Maintaining the integrity and security of the engine is crucial for its reputation and adoption.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- PhaserJS Source Code: Publicly available, but integrity is critical. Modifications by unauthorized parties or introduction of vulnerabilities would be a high risk. Sensitivity: Public, Integrity: High.
- Build Artifacts (npm package, distribution files): Publicly distributed, integrity is paramount. Compromised artifacts would directly impact users. Sensitivity: Public, Integrity: High.
- Developer Credentials and Secrets: Used for accessing GitHub, npm, and build infrastructure. Confidentiality and integrity are essential to prevent unauthorized access and malicious activities. Sensitivity: Confidential, Integrity: High.
