# Threat Model Analysis for phaserjs/phaser

## Threat: [Phaser Framework Vulnerability leading to XSS via Malicious Assets](./threats/phaser_framework_vulnerability_leading_to_xss_via_malicious_assets.md)

*   **Description:** A vulnerability within Phaser's asset loading or handling process allows an attacker to inject malicious assets (e.g., SVG images with embedded JavaScript). When Phaser processes these assets, it results in Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This could stem from insufficient sanitization or improper handling of asset types within Phaser's core code. An attacker could host a malicious asset or trick the application into loading one.
    *   **Impact:** **Critical**. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This can lead to account compromise, theft of sensitive data (including session tokens, personal information), redirection to malicious websites, or further exploitation of the user's system.
    *   **Phaser Component Affected:** `Phaser.Loader` (asset loading module), potentially `Phaser.Cache` (asset caching), `Phaser.GameObjects.Image`, `Phaser.Textures` (rendering and texture management).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (due to XSS vulnerability and potential for widespread impact).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Latest Phaser Version:**  Immediately update Phaser to the latest stable version. Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases. Monitor Phaser release notes and security advisories.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to significantly reduce the impact of XSS. Configure CSP to restrict script sources, disallow `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval`, and limit asset sources to trusted origins.
        *   **Asset Type Validation (Server-Side if applicable):** If assets are loaded dynamically from external sources or user uploads, perform rigorous server-side validation of asset types and content before allowing Phaser to load them. Sanitize or reject suspicious assets.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Filename/Path):** If asset paths are constructed based on user input, sanitize and validate these inputs to prevent path traversal or injection of malicious filenames that could lead to loading unexpected or attacker-controlled assets.
        *   **Report Potential Vulnerabilities:** If you suspect a vulnerability in Phaser's asset handling, immediately report it to the Phaser development team and the security community.

## Threat: [Phaser Plugin Vulnerability leading to Client-Side Code Execution](./threats/phaser_plugin_vulnerability_leading_to_client-side_code_execution.md)

*   **Description:** A third-party Phaser plugin contains a security vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the Phaser application. This could be due to various coding errors in the plugin, such as improper input validation, buffer overflows, or insecure use of browser APIs. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if the application uses the vulnerable plugin and triggers the vulnerable code path.
    *   **Impact:** **High**. Client-Side Code Execution allows the attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript code. While the impact is limited to the client-side, it can still be severe, potentially leading to data theft, manipulation of the game state for cheating or malicious purposes, client-side denial of service, or in some scenarios, further exploitation depending on the browser and user permissions.
    *   **Phaser Component Affected:** Specific Phaser Plugin(s) - the vulnerable module, function, or class within the compromised plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** (due to potential for client-side code execution and impact on user experience and data).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Use Trusted Plugins Only:**  Exercise extreme caution when selecting and using third-party Phaser plugins. Prioritize plugins from reputable developers or organizations with a proven track record of security and maintenance.
        *   **Plugin Security Audits:**  Whenever possible, conduct security audits or code reviews of third-party plugin code before integrating them into your application. Look for common vulnerabilities and insecure coding practices.
        *   **Keep Plugins Updated:**  Regularly update all Phaser plugins to their latest versions. Plugin developers often release updates to address security vulnerabilities. Monitor plugin repositories and release notes for security-related updates.
        *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:**  Reduce the attack surface by using only essential plugins. Avoid using plugins with excessive or unnecessary functionalities. Consider if the plugin's functionality can be implemented directly within your application code instead.
        *   **Isolate Plugin Code (Advanced):** In highly security-sensitive applications, explore advanced techniques to isolate or sandbox plugin code to limit the potential impact of a plugin vulnerability. However, this is often complex in a browser environment and may not be fully effective.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use dependency scanning tools to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in your project's dependencies, including Phaser plugins. Regularly scan your project and update vulnerable plugins.
