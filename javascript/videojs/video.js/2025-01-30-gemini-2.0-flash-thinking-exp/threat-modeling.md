# Threat Model Analysis for videojs/video.js

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Core Video.js](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_core_video_js.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Core Video.js
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the core Video.js library code. This could involve injecting malicious JavaScript through crafted video metadata, manipulated player configuration options, or by exploiting flaws in how Video.js handles user inputs or processes data. When a user views content using a vulnerable Video.js player, the attacker's script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, theft of sensitive user data (cookies, local storage), redirection to malicious sites, website defacement, and potential malware distribution.
    *   **Video.js Component Affected:** Core Video.js library code (various modules depending on the vulnerability, including parsing, event handling, and UI rendering).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Immediately update Video.js:**  Upgrade to the latest stable version of Video.js as soon as security patches are released.
        *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** Enforce a strict CSP to significantly reduce the impact of XSS by controlling script sources and restricting inline script execution.
        *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct thorough security assessments specifically targeting client-side vulnerabilities in the Video.js implementation and integration.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution in Video.js or Dependencies](./threats/prototype_pollution_in_video_js_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution in Video.js or Dependencies
    *   **Description:** An attacker leverages a prototype pollution vulnerability present in Video.js itself or in one of its JavaScript dependencies. By manipulating JavaScript object prototypes, they can inject or modify properties that alter the intended behavior of Video.js or the application. This can lead to unexpected functionality, security bypasses, and potentially XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), privilege escalation within the application, bypass of security controls, and potentially remote code execution in specific scenarios depending on the polluted properties and application logic.
    *   **Video.js Component Affected:** Core Video.js code or vulnerable dependencies (utility libraries, UI components, plugin management modules).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Maintain Up-to-Date Dependencies:**  Regularly update Video.js and all its dependencies to the latest versions to patch known prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
        *   **Utilize Dependency Scanning Tools:** Employ tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or Snyk to continuously monitor and identify vulnerable dependencies.
        *   **Code Audits for Prototype Pollution:** Conduct focused code reviews to identify potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities, especially in areas handling external data or user inputs that could influence object properties.
        *   **Consider Object Immutability:** Where applicable, use techniques like `Object.freeze()` to protect critical objects and consider immutable data structures to limit the impact of prototype pollution attempts.

## Threat: [Plugin Vulnerabilities Leading to XSS or Remote Code Execution](./threats/plugin_vulnerabilities_leading_to_xss_or_remote_code_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Plugin Vulnerabilities Leading to XSS or Remote Code Execution
    *   **Description:**  Third-party Video.js plugins, if used, may contain critical security vulnerabilities, including XSS or even remote code execution flaws. Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities by targeting users who interact with content utilizing a vulnerable plugin. This is especially concerning as plugins are often developed and maintained outside the core Video.js team, potentially with less rigorous security practices.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) depending on the plugin vulnerability, leading to full account compromise, complete control over the user's browser session, data theft, malware installation, and significant reputational damage to the application.
    *   **Video.js Component Affected:** Video.js Plugin system, specific vulnerable plugin code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if RCE is possible, High for XSS and other severe impacts).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rigorous Plugin Vetting:**  Exercise extreme caution when selecting and using Video.js plugins. Thoroughly vet plugins from untrusted sources. Prioritize plugins from reputable developers with a strong security track record and active maintenance.
        *   **Regular Plugin Updates:**  Keep all plugins updated to their latest versions to benefit from security patches. Monitor plugin repositories and security advisories for updates.
        *   **Code Review of Plugins (Especially Custom/Less Common):**  For custom or less widely used plugins, conduct security code reviews before deployment to identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Minimize Plugin Dependency:**  Reduce the attack surface by using only essential plugins and avoiding unnecessary or poorly maintained plugins.
        *   **CSP and Security Headers:** Implement a strong CSP and other security headers to mitigate the impact of potential plugin vulnerabilities, similar to core library mitigations.

## Threat: [Insecure Configuration Leading to Unauthorized Access or Control](./threats/insecure_configuration_leading_to_unauthorized_access_or_control.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Configuration Leading to Unauthorized Access or Control
    *   **Description:**  Developers may misconfigure Video.js in ways that create significant security weaknesses. This could include improperly setting up Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies, leading to unauthorized access to video streams, or misconfiguring plugin loading mechanisms, potentially allowing injection of malicious plugins or code.  Incorrectly configured access controls on the client-side can also give a false sense of security, while the backend remains vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to premium or protected video content, exposure of sensitive backend infrastructure details, potential for further exploitation if misconfiguration allows code injection or control over player behavior, and data breaches if access controls are bypassed.
    *   **Video.js Component Affected:** Video.js configuration options, player setup code, potentially plugin loading and CORS handling within Video.js if misconfigured.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Adhere to Security Best Practices for Configuration:**  Strictly follow security best practices and recommendations outlined in the Video.js documentation and security guidelines when configuring the player.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege in Configuration:**  Only enable necessary features and avoid exposing sensitive configuration details on the client-side.
        *   **Robust Server-Side Access Control:** Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms on the server-side to protect video content. Do not rely solely on client-side configurations for access control.
        *   **Regular Configuration Reviews and Security Audits:** Periodically review Video.js configurations and conduct security audits to identify and rectify any misconfigurations that could introduce vulnerabilities. Ensure CORS policies are correctly configured and tested.
