# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for videojs/video.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep video.js Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_video_js_updated.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Keep video.js Updated

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Regularly check for new releases of video.js on the official GitHub repository ([https://github.com/videojs/video.js/releases](https://github.com/videojs/video.js/releases)) or through package managers if used.
*   Step 2: Review release notes for security fixes and vulnerability patches in new versions.
*   Step 3: Test the new version in a staging environment for compatibility with your application and plugins.
*   Step 4: Update video.js in production by replacing the old version with the new one. Update CDN version in `<script>` tag or package manager dependency.
*   Step 5: Monitor video.js security advisories for urgent updates and apply them immediately.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_subresource_integrity__sri_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Generate SRI hashes for the specific versions of video.js and any video.js plugins you are using (e.g., using `openssl dgst -sha384 video.min.js`).
*   Step 2: Add the `integrity` attribute with the generated hash and `crossorigin="anonymous"` to `<script>` or `<link>` tags when including video.js and plugins from CDNs.
    *   Example: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/video.js@7.x/dist/video.min.js" integrity="sha384-YOUR_SRI_HASH_HERE" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`
*   Step 3: Update SRI hashes whenever video.js or plugins are updated.

*   Compromised CDN or External Source - Severity: High
*   Man-in-the-Middle Attacks injecting malicious code - Severity: High

**Impact:**
*   Compromised CDN or External Source: High Risk Reduction

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Provided URLs and Configuration Options](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-provided_urls_and_configuration_options.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User-Provided URLs and Configuration Options

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify where user input influences video.js configuration (video URLs, source URLs, plugin options).
*   Step 2: Implement server-side validation and sanitization for user-provided URLs and configuration data before passing them to video.js.
    *   URL Validation: Validate URL format and scheme (whitelist allowed schemes like `http://`, `https://`, `blob:`, `data:`).
    *   Input Sanitization: Escape or remove harmful characters from user inputs to prevent JavaScript execution.
    *   Parameter Validation: Validate format and type of configuration options against expected values.
*   Step 3: Implement client-side validation and sanitization as a secondary defense.
*   Step 4: Avoid using user-provided strings directly in `eval()` or similar JavaScript execution functions when configuring video.js.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via URL injection - Severity: High
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration Injection - Severity: High

*   Step 2: Prioritize plugins from the official video.js organization or reputable developers.
*   Step 3: Review plugin code for potential security vulnerabilities, especially XSS, prototype pollution, or insecure API usage.
*   Step 4: Check plugin update history and issue tracker for maintenance and security responsiveness.
*   Step 5: Test plugin in development and monitor for unexpected behavior or browser console warnings.
*   Step 6: Only use necessary plugins to minimize the attack surface.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Plugins - Severity: High

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Define a restrictive Content Security Policy (CSP) for your application.
*   Step 2: Deliver CSP using the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header.
*   Step 3: Configure CSP directives relevant to video.js and media:
    *   `script-src`: Control JavaScript sources. Allow 'self', trusted CDNs, and 'unsafe-inline' (if needed and reviewed). Avoid 'unsafe-eval'.
    *   `media-src`: Control media file sources. Allow 'self', trusted domains, `blob:` or `data:` if needed.
    *   `frame-ancestors`: Control embedding locations. Use `'self'` or specific domains to prevent clickjacking.
*   Step 4: Test CSP in report-only mode (`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` header).
*   Step 5: Deploy CSP in enforcing mode (`Content-Security-Policy` header) after testing.
*   Step 6: Regularly review and refine CSP as the application evolves.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High
*   Clickjacking - Severity: Medium

**Impact:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): High Risk Reduction
*   Clickjacking: Medium Risk Reduction

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit JavaScript Execution Context for Video Player (Sandboxing)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_javascript_execution_context_for_video_player__sandboxing_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Limit JavaScript Execution Context for Video Player (Sandboxing)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Explore isolating video.js player and JavaScript in a restricted environment.
*   Step 2: Consider using `<iframe>` with the `sandbox` attribute for a sandboxed video player.
    *   Example: `<iframe sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin" src="/video-player-page.html"></iframe>`
    *   Choose sandbox attributes carefully (e.g., `allow-scripts`, `allow-same-origin`, avoid `allow-top-navigation`, `allow-forms`).
*   Step 3: Investigate Web Workers for video.js scripts in a separate thread (compatibility with video.js DOM manipulation needs evaluation).
*   Step 4: If using iframes, ensure secure communication between main app and sandboxed iframe using message passing.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reduced Impact - Severity: High (Reduced to Medium impact within sandbox)
*   Prototype Pollution - Reduced Impact - Severity: Medium (Reduced to Low impact within sandbox)
*   Privilege Escalation from video.js vulnerabilities - Reduced Impact - Severity: Medium (Reduced to Low impact within sandbox)

**Impact:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Medium Risk Reduction (Impact limited to sandbox)
*   Prototype Pollution: Low Risk Reduction (Impact limited to sandbox)
*   Privilege Escalation from video.js vulnerabilities: Low Risk Reduction (Impact limited to sandbox)

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Sandboxing: Not Implemented - Video player is running in the main application context without sandboxing.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Iframe Sandboxing Implementation: Missing - No iframe sandboxing is used for the video player.
*   Web Worker Investigation: Missing - No investigation into using Web Workers for video.js scripts has been conducted.
*   Secure Communication Channel for Sandboxed Player: Missing - No secure communication channel is set up for potential sandboxed player scenarios.

**Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Audit and Test for XSS Vulnerabilities

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Incorporate regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   Step 2: Focus testing on Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities related to video.js usage and configuration.
*   Step 3: Use automated security scanning tools (OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite Scanner, browser-based XSS scanners) and manual penetration testing.
*   Step 4: Test user inputs influencing video.js configuration, URLs, and plugin options for XSS.
*   Step 5: Simulate XSS attack scenarios by injecting malicious JavaScript code.
*   Step 6: Remediate identified XSS vulnerabilities by sanitizing inputs, encoding outputs, and implementing security controls.
*   Step 7: Retest after remediation to verify fixes.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Detection and Remediation - Severity: High
*   Unknown Vulnerabilities - Proactive Discovery - Severity: Medium
