## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__attacks__critical_node__high-risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Script via Video Source URL [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Attacker crafts a malicious video URL that, when processed by Video.js and rendered by the browser, executes JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the application.
    *   **Attack Details:**
        *   **Malicious URL Crafting:** The attacker can create URLs using various techniques:
            *   **`data:` URI scheme:** Embeds the script directly within the URL itself (e.g., `data:text/html,<script>alert('XSS')</script>`).
            *   **Open Redirect:**  Utilize a vulnerable open redirect on a trusted domain to redirect to a malicious site hosting the XSS payload.
            *   **URL with XSS Payload in Parameters:**  Embed JavaScript code within URL parameters that are not properly sanitized by Video.js or the application and are reflected in the HTML context.
        *   **Unsanitized URL Usage:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided video URLs before passing them to Video.js.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session, account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application, redirection to malicious sites, installation of malware.

*   **Attack Vector: Inject Malicious Script via Subtitle/Caption Files [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** Attacker crafts a malicious subtitle or caption file (e.g., SRT, VTT) that, when parsed and rendered by Video.js, executes JavaScript code in the user's browser within the context of the application.
    *   **Attack Details:**
        *   **Malicious Subtitle Crafting:** The attacker embeds JavaScript code within the subtitle file format.  This might involve exploiting vulnerabilities in the subtitle parsing logic of Video.js or the browser's subtitle rendering engine.  Some subtitle formats allow for HTML-like tags which, if not properly sanitized, can be exploited for XSS.
        *   **Unsanitized Subtitle Processing:** The application enables the subtitle/caption feature and Video.js processes and renders these files without proper sanitization of the content.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session, account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application, redirection to malicious sites, installation of malware.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure CDN Usage [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_cdn_usage__critical_node__high-risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Use Outdated or Compromised CDN for Video.js [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** The application loads Video.js from a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that is either outdated (containing known vulnerabilities) or has been compromised by an attacker.
    *   **Attack Details:**
        *   **Outdated CDN:** The application uses an outdated version of Video.js hosted on a CDN. Older versions may contain publicly known vulnerabilities that an attacker can exploit.
        *   **Compromised CDN:** An attacker gains control of the CDN infrastructure or a specific CDN endpoint serving Video.js. They can then replace the legitimate Video.js file with a malicious version.
    *   **Impact:** If the CDN is compromised or outdated, every user loading Video.js from that CDN will be served the malicious version. This can lead to widespread compromise of all users of the application, including account takeover, data theft, and malware distribution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Loading Plugins from Untrusted Sources [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/loading_plugins_from_untrusted_sources__critical_node__high-risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Load Video.js Plugins from Unverified Origins [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** The application loads Video.js plugins from sources that are not trusted or verified. This could include arbitrary URLs or repositories that are not officially maintained or vetted by the Video.js project or the application developers.
    *   **Attack Details:**
        *   **Malicious Plugin Injection:** An attacker creates a malicious Video.js plugin that contains malicious JavaScript code.
        *   **Untrusted Plugin Source:** The application is configured to load plugins from untrusted sources, allowing the attacker to host and serve their malicious plugin.
        *   **Lack of Plugin Verification:** The application does not perform any integrity checks or verification of the plugins before loading them.
    *   **Impact:** When a malicious plugin is loaded, its JavaScript code executes within the context of the application. This can lead to any action the attacker desires, including data theft, account manipulation, redirection, and further exploitation of the application and user systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [Lack of Input Validation on User-Provided Data Related to Video.js [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/lack_of_input_validation_on_user-provided_data_related_to_video_js__critical_node__high-risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector: Insufficient Validation of User-Provided Video URLs [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** The application allows users to provide video URLs (e.g., for embedding or playback) without proper validation and sanitization. This lack of validation can enable various attacks, most notably XSS (as detailed above) and potentially Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if these URLs are processed on the backend.
    *   **Attack Details:**
        *   **No URL Validation:** The application does not check the format, scheme, or content of user-provided URLs.
        *   **Insufficient Sanitization:**  Even if some validation is present, it might be insufficient to prevent malicious URLs designed to bypass filters or exploit parsing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  XSS vulnerabilities (as described in point 1), SSRF vulnerabilities if URLs are processed server-side (allowing attackers to access internal resources or interact with external services on behalf of the server), and potentially other injection attacks depending on how the URLs are used.

*   **Attack Vector: Insufficient Validation of User-Provided Subtitle/Caption Data (if directly uploaded) [HIGH-RISK]:**
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to upload subtitle or caption files directly, insufficient validation of these files can lead to vulnerabilities, primarily XSS (as detailed above) and potentially backend vulnerabilities if these files are processed server-side.
    *   **Attack Details:**
        *   **No File Validation:** The application does not check the file type, format, or content of uploaded subtitle/caption files.
        *   **Insufficient Sanitization:** Even if some validation is present, it might be insufficient to prevent malicious subtitle files containing XSS payloads or crafted to exploit backend processing vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities (as described in point 1), backend vulnerabilities if subtitle files are processed server-side (e.g., path traversal during file saving, command injection during file processing), and potentially other injection attacks.
