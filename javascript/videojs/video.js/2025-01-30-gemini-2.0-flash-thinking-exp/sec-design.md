# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, video.js, aims to provide a robust, customizable, and cross-browser compatible HTML5 video player library for web developers. The primary business priority is to offer a reliable and feature-rich solution that simplifies embedding video playback functionality into websites and web applications. The goal is to be the leading open-source HTML5 video player, widely adopted and trusted by the web development community.

Key business risks associated with this project include:

- Vulnerabilities in the video player library could be exploited to compromise websites embedding video.js, leading to potential cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, denial-of-service (DoS), or other security breaches.
- If the library is perceived as unreliable or insecure, it could damage the reputation of the project and reduce adoption rates.
- Lack of support for emerging video formats or browser technologies could lead to obsolescence and decreased user satisfaction.
- Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies used by video.js could introduce vulnerabilities into the library itself.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls for the video.js project are primarily focused on general web security best practices and browser-level security features.

- security control: Browser Security Model. Implemented by web browsers. Browsers provide fundamental security features like sandboxing, same-origin policy, and protection against common web vulnerabilities.
- security control: HTTPS for distribution. Implemented by CDN providers and website hosting. Ensures that the video.js library and video content are delivered over encrypted connections, protecting against eavesdropping and man-in-the-middle attacks.
- security control: Input validation within the library. Implemented in the video.js codebase. The library likely performs some level of input validation to handle video sources, user interactions, and configuration options.
- accepted risk: Reliance on browser security. The project inherently depends on the security of the underlying web browsers. Vulnerabilities in browser engines could impact video.js.
- accepted risk: Third-party dependencies. The project likely uses third-party libraries, which could introduce vulnerabilities if not properly managed and vetted.
- accepted risk: Misuse by developers. Developers embedding video.js might misconfigure it or use it in insecure contexts, leading to vulnerabilities outside the library's control.

Recommended security controls to enhance the security posture of video.js:

- recommended security control: Regular Security Audits. Periodic security audits, including penetration testing and code reviews, should be conducted to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the video.js codebase.
- recommended security control: Dependency Scanning. Implement automated dependency scanning to detect and remediate known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries used by video.js.
- recommended security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST). Integrate SAST tools into the development pipeline to automatically identify potential security flaws in the codebase during development.
- recommended security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) Guidance. Provide clear guidance and recommendations to developers on how to configure CSP headers to mitigate XSS risks when embedding video.js.
- recommended security control: Subresource Integrity (SRI). Encourage the use of SRI tags when including video.js from CDNs to ensure the integrity of the delivered library files.

Security requirements for the video.js project:

- Authentication: Authentication is not directly within the scope of the video player itself. However, websites using video.js might require authentication to access video content. Video.js should be designed to seamlessly integrate with website authentication mechanisms.
- Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization for video content is typically handled at the website or backend level. Video.js should respect authorization decisions made by the website and not bypass any access controls.
- Input Validation: Video.js must rigorously validate all inputs, including video source URLs, user interactions, and configuration options, to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities. This includes validating URL schemes, file types, and user-provided data.
- Cryptography: Video.js should leverage browser-provided cryptographic APIs where necessary and ensure that sensitive data, such as DRM keys (if supported), is handled securely. The library should encourage and support HTTPS for all video content delivery.

The build process for video.js likely involves the following steps, with a focus on security:

1. Developer writes code and commits it to the GitHub repository.
2. GitHub Actions (or another CI/CD system) is triggered by code changes.
3. The CI/CD pipeline checks out the source code from the repository.
4. Security checks are performed:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) is run to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
    - Dependency scanning is performed to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
    - Linters are used to enforce code quality and security best practices.
5. Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) are executed to ensure code functionality and prevent regressions.
6. The build process compiles and bundles the JavaScript and CSS assets, creating build artifacts.
7. Build artifacts are published to:
    - npm registry for distribution as an npm package.
    - CDN for direct linking from websites.

Security controls in the build process:

- security control: Version Control System (GitHub). Implemented by GitHub. Securely stores and manages source code, provides audit trails of changes.
- security control: Automated Build Pipeline (GitHub Actions). Implemented by GitHub Actions. Automates the build, test, and deployment process, reducing manual errors and ensuring consistent builds.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process being protected:

- Providing a reliable and secure HTML5 video player library for web developers. The core business process is the development, maintenance, and distribution of the video.js library.

Data being protected and their sensitivity:

- Source code of video.js: High sensitivity. Compromise could lead to injection of vulnerabilities, intellectual property theft, and reputational damage.
- Build artifacts (JavaScript, CSS files): Medium sensitivity. Compromise could lead to distribution of malicious versions of the library to users.
- Project infrastructure (GitHub repository, CI/CD pipeline, npm account, CDN account): High sensitivity. Compromise could disrupt development, build, and distribution processes, and potentially lead to malicious code injection.
- Developer credentials: High sensitivity. Compromise could grant unauthorized access to project infrastructure and source code.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What is the target risk appetite for the video.js project? Is it for a fresh startup with higher risk tolerance or a Fortune 500 company with stricter security requirements? This will influence the level of security controls to be implemented.
- Are there specific regulatory compliance requirements that video.js needs to adhere to (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, accessibility standards)?
- Are there specific use cases or industries that video.js is primarily targeting (e.g., media streaming, e-learning, enterprise video)? This could highlight specific security concerns.
- What is the process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities in video.js? Is there a dedicated security team or contact point?
- What is the budget and resources allocated for security activities for the video.js project?

Assumptions:

- The primary goal is to provide a secure and reliable video player library for general web use.
- Standard web security best practices are applicable to the video.js project.
- The project aims to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities in the library that could be exploited by malicious actors.
- Security is a priority for the video.js project, and efforts are made to incorporate security considerations throughout the development lifecycle.
- The project relies on community contributions and open-source principles for development and security.
