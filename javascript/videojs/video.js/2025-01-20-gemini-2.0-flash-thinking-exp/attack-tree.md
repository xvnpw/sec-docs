# Attack Tree Analysis for videojs/video.js

Objective: Compromise Application Using video.js Vulnerabilities

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Focused Threat Model for video.js - High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Malicious Media File](./attack_tree_paths/supply_malicious_media_file.md)

*How*: Provide a crafted video file that exploits a parsing vulnerability in video.js or the underlying browser media engine.
*Impact*: Could lead to arbitrary code execution on the client-side, denial of service, or information disclosure.
*Mitigation*: Input validation and sanitization of media URLs and file uploads. Regularly update video.js and the browser. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP).
*Likelihood*: Medium
*Impact*: Significant
*Effort*: Medium
*Skill Level*: Intermediate
*Detection Difficulty*: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Utilize Vulnerable Official Plugins**
    *How*: Exploit known vulnerabilities in official video.js plugins.
    *Impact*: Depends on the plugin's functionality, could range from XSS to more severe vulnerabilities.
    *Mitigation*: Regularly update video.js and all its plugins. Monitor security advisories. Only use necessary plugins.
    *Likelihood*: Medium (Depends on plugin usage and update frequency)
    *Impact*: Moderate to Significant
    *Effort*: Low (If exploits are public) to Medium (If requiring discovery)
    *Skill Level*: Beginner (If using public exploits) to Intermediate
    *Detection Difficulty*: Easy (If known exploits are used) to Medium
* **Utilize Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins**
    *How*: Exploit vulnerabilities in third-party video.js plugins.
    *Impact*: Similar to official plugins, but potentially higher risk due to less rigorous security reviews.
    *Mitigation*: Carefully vet third-party plugins. Keep third-party plugins updated. Consider the reputation of plugin developers.
    *Likelihood*: Medium (Depends on plugin usage and security of the plugin)
    *Impact*: Moderate to Significant
    *Effort*: Low (If exploits are public) to High (If requiring discovery)
    *Skill Level*: Beginner (If using public exploits) to Advanced
    *Detection Difficulty*: Easy (If known exploits are used) to Difficult

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_configuration.md)

*How*: Inject malicious scripts through configuration options that are not properly sanitized when rendered.
*Impact*: Can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other client-side attacks.
*Mitigation*: Ensure all data used in video.js configuration is properly sanitized and escaped. Implement CSP.
*Likelihood*: Low (If proper sanitization is in place) to Medium (If developers are unaware of the risk)
*Impact*: Significant
*Effort*: Low
*Skill Level*: Beginner
*Detection Difficulty*: Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies (Indirectly through video.js)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies__indirectly_through_video_js_.md)

* **Vulnerabilities in Transitive Dependencies**
    *How*: Exploit vulnerabilities in libraries that video.js depends on (directly or indirectly).
    *Impact*: Can range from denial of service to remote code execution, depending on the vulnerability.
    *Mitigation*: Regularly update video.js to benefit from updates to its dependencies. Use tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *Likelihood*: Low to Medium (Depends on the dependencies and their security)
    *Impact*: Moderate to Critical
    *Effort*: Low (If exploits are public) to High (If requiring discovery)
    *Skill Level*: Beginner (If using public exploits) to Advanced
    *Detection Difficulty*: Easy (If using vulnerability scanning tools) to Difficult
