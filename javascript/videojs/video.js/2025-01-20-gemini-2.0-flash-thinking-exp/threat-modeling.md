# Threat Model Analysis for videojs/video.js

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Video Source URL](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_video_source_url.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could provide a specially crafted video source URL that, when processed by video.js, injects malicious JavaScript into the user's browser. This could happen if video.js doesn't properly sanitize or escape the URL when handling certain video formats or error conditions. The attacker might inject scripts to steal cookies, redirect users, or deface the application.
    * **Impact:**  Account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement.
    * **Affected Component:**  Source handling module, potentially within format-specific playback technology (e.g., HLS, DASH).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
        * Sanitize and validate all user-provided video URLs on the server-side before passing them to video.js.
        * Ensure video.js is updated to the latest version with security patches.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Subtitle File](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_subtitle_file.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could provide a malicious subtitle file (e.g., SRT, VTT) containing embedded JavaScript or HTML that executes when the subtitles are rendered by video.js. The attacker could manipulate the page content, steal user data, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    * **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, website defacement.
    * **Affected Component:** Subtitle rendering module.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize subtitle files on the server-side before serving them to the client.
        * Use a secure subtitle parsing library that has built-in security measures.
        * Implement CSP to mitigate the impact of any successful XSS.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution Vulnerability](./threats/prototype_pollution_vulnerability.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could exploit a vulnerability within video.js or its dependencies to manipulate the prototype of JavaScript objects. This could lead to unexpected behavior, the execution of arbitrary code, or the bypassing of security measures. The attacker might leverage this to gain control over the application's functionality.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, privilege escalation, denial of service.
    * **Affected Component:** Potentially core library functions or dependencies.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Keep video.js and all its dependencies updated to the latest versions.
        * Regularly review security advisories for video.js and its dependencies.
        * Implement security scanning tools to detect potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Insecure Usage of Third-Party Plugins](./threats/insecure_usage_of_third-party_plugins.md)

* **Description:** If the application uses third-party video.js plugins, vulnerabilities within those plugins could be exploited by attackers. This could introduce new attack vectors not present in the core video.js library.
    * **Impact:**  Depends on the vulnerability in the plugin, potentially leading to XSS, remote code execution, or data breaches.
    * **Affected Component:**  Plugin architecture and the specific vulnerable plugin.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Thoroughly vet any third-party plugins before using them.
        * Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
        * Monitor for security advisories related to the plugins being used.
        * Implement strong security practices even when using plugins, such as input validation.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Video.js Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_video_js_dependencies.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could compromise a dependency of video.js, injecting malicious code that would then be included in applications using video.js.
    * **Impact:**  Potentially widespread compromise of applications using the affected version of video.js, leading to data theft, malware distribution, or other malicious activities.
    * **Affected Component:**  The dependency management system (e.g., npm) and the compromised dependency.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use package managers with integrity checking (e.g., npm with lock files, yarn).
        * Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or dedicated Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.
        * Consider using dependency pinning to ensure consistent versions.
