# Attack Surface Analysis for videojs/video.js

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Subtitle Files](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_subtitle_files.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers upload or provide malicious subtitle files (e.g., SRT, VTT) containing embedded JavaScript code.
*   **How video.js contributes to the attack surface:** video.js parses and renders subtitle files. If these files contain malicious `<script>` tags or event handlers, the browser will execute the embedded JavaScript within the context of the application's domain.
*   **Example:** A user uploads an SRT file containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When video.js renders the subtitles, the alert box appears.
*   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the user's session, including stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict server-side validation and sanitization of uploaded subtitle files, removing any potentially malicious tags or scripts.
    *   Use a secure subtitle rendering mechanism that prevents the execution of embedded scripts (if available or feasible).
    *   Set the `Content-Security-Policy` header to restrict the execution of inline scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities present in third-party plugins integrated with video.js.
*   **How video.js contributes to the attack surface:** video.js provides an API for extending its functionality through plugins. If these plugins are not developed securely, they can introduce vulnerabilities into the application.
*   **Example:** A plugin designed for custom analytics has an XSS vulnerability. When a user interacts with the video player, the malicious script in the plugin executes.
*   **Impact:**  Depends on the plugin's vulnerability. Could range from XSS to arbitrary code execution within the browser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party plugins before integrating them.
    *   Keep all plugins up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   Implement a mechanism to isolate plugin execution or limit their access to sensitive data.
    *   Consider using only well-maintained and reputable plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Video Source URLs](./attack_surfaces/malicious_video_source_urls.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide URLs pointing to crafted video files or streaming sources designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the browser's media engine or video.js itself.
*   **How video.js contributes to the attack surface:** video.js is responsible for fetching and attempting to play the video source provided in its configuration. It relies on the browser's media engine, which might have vulnerabilities when parsing certain file formats or protocols.
*   **Example:** An attacker provides a URL to a specially crafted MP4 file that triggers a buffer overflow in the browser's video decoding library when video.js attempts to play it.
*   **Impact:** Client-side denial-of-service (browser crash), potential remote code execution if the browser's media engine is severely compromised.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement server-side validation of video source URLs against an allowlist of trusted domains and protocols.
    *   Sanitize any user-provided data used to construct video URLs.
    *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which media can be loaded.
