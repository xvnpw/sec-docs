## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Insecure Video Source Handling](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_insecure_video_source_handling.md)

- Objective: To compromise the application by injecting a malicious video URL.
- Attack Steps:
    - Application allows users or external sources to specify video URLs.
    - Attacker injects a malicious video URL.
        - The malicious URL can point to:
            - A video file containing embedded malicious scripts or exploits in metadata.
            - A server that responds with malicious headers or content that exploits browser vulnerabilities.
- Potential Impact: Triggering browser-level vulnerabilities, potentially leading to code execution or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Accessibility Features for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_accessibility_features_for_malicious_purposes.md)

- Objective: To execute arbitrary JavaScript by injecting malicious content through accessibility features.
- Attack Steps:
    - video.js provides accessibility features (e.g., captions, subtitles).
    - Attacker injects malicious content through these features.
        - This can be done by:
            - Embedding malicious scripts within subtitle or caption files (e.g., using `<script>` tags if not properly sanitized).
- Potential Impact: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser (XSS).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in video.js Core Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_video_js_core_functionality.md)

- Objective: To exploit a security flaw within the video.js library itself.
- Attack Steps:
    - Identify a specific vulnerability in video.js (e.g., XSS, Prototype Pollution, Buffer Overflow).
    - Trigger the vulnerability through crafted media, API calls, or player configuration.
        - This can involve:
            - Injecting a malicious media source designed to trigger the vulnerability.
- Potential Impact: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser (XSS), denial of service, or other security impacts depending on the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Media Source](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_media_source.md)

- Objective: To introduce a malicious video or audio file that exploits a vulnerability.
- Attack Steps:
    - Find a way to control the `src` attribute of the video element or the source objects passed to video.js.
    - Point it to a malicious media file designed to exploit a vulnerability.
- Potential Impact: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, or other impacts depending on the exploited vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in video.js Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_video_js_plugins.md)

- Objective: To exploit a security flaw within a video.js plugin being used by the application.
- Attack Steps:
    - Identify a vulnerability in a specific video.js plugin being used (e.g., XSS, arbitrary code execution).
    - Trigger the vulnerability through plugin-specific interactions or data.
        - This can involve providing malicious input to plugin functions.
- Potential Impact: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially gaining access to application data handled by the plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker injects a malicious video URL](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_injects_a_malicious_video_url.md)

- Objective: To provide a harmful video URL to the application.
- Attack Steps:
    - The application allows users or external sources to specify video URLs.
    - The attacker provides a URL pointing to:
        - A video file with embedded malicious scripts.
        - A server with malicious response headers.
- Potential Impact: Triggering browser vulnerabilities, leading to code execution or information disclosure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker injects malicious content through these features](./attack_tree_paths/attacker_injects_malicious_content_through_these_features.md)

- Objective: To insert harmful code via accessibility features.
- Attack Steps:
    - video.js accessibility features are available.
    - The attacker injects malicious content, such as `<script>` tags within subtitle files.
- Potential Impact: Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser (XSS).
