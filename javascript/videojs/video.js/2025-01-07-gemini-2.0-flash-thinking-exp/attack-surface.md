# Attack Surface Analysis for videojs/video.js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Media Sources (URLs)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_media_sources__urls_.md)

*   **Description:** Providing untrusted or malicious URLs as the source for video or audio content.
    *   **How Video.js Contributes:** Video.js directly uses the provided `src` attribute or source objects to fetch and attempt to render media. This makes it the primary mechanism for loading potentially harmful content.
    *   **Example:** An attacker crafts a URL that, when provided as a video source, triggers a vulnerability in the browser or exposes sensitive information due to how Video.js handles the request. This could involve a URL pointing to a file disguised as a video that contains malicious scripts, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) if the application uses Video.js to fetch metadata from the provided URL without proper validation. Denial of Service (DoS) by providing URLs to extremely large or resource-intensive files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust server-side validation and sanitization of all user-provided or dynamically generated media URLs.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure a strong CSP to restrict the domains from which media can be loaded, significantly reducing the risk of XSS from malicious URLs.
        *   **URL Whitelisting:** Maintain a strict whitelist of trusted and verified media sources.
        *   **Avoid Direct User Input:** If possible, avoid directly using user-provided URLs as the `src`. Instead, use internal identifiers that map to validated and securely stored media resources.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable or Malicious Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_or_malicious_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Using third-party Video.js plugins that contain security vulnerabilities or are intentionally malicious.
    *   **How Video.js Contributes:** Video.js provides a plugin architecture that allows extending its functionality. Loading and executing code from these plugins is a core feature of Video.js, and vulnerabilities within these plugins directly impact the security of the player and the application.
    *   **Example:** A plugin has an XSS vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts by manipulating plugin-specific settings or through crafted media content that the plugin processes. When Video.js loads and executes the vulnerable plugin, the malicious script can run in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to arbitrary code execution in the user's browser, potentially allowing attackers to steal sensitive information, manipulate the application, or redirect users. In severe cases, vulnerable plugins could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if they interact with server-side components insecurely.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Trust and Verification:** Only use plugins from reputable and highly trusted sources. Thoroughly vet and review the documentation and, if possible, the code of any plugin before implementation.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all installed plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities. Implement a system for tracking and managing plugin updates.
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI tags when loading plugin files from CDNs to ensure the integrity and authenticity of the loaded code.
        *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Only install and enable necessary plugins. Avoid using plugins with broad permissions or functionalities that are not essential.
        *   **Sandboxing (Limited):** While browser-level sandboxing has limitations, ensure plugins operate within the expected scope and do not have excessive privileges.
