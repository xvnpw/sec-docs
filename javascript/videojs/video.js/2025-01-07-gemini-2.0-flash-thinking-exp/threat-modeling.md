# Threat Model Analysis for videojs/video.js

## Threat: [Malicious Video URL Injection](./threats/malicious_video_url_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the video source URL provided directly to `video.js` through the `src` option or `source` elements. By injecting a malicious URL, the attacker can leverage `video.js` to load and potentially execute code or trigger browser vulnerabilities. This is a direct interaction with `video.js`'s core functionality of handling video sources.
    *   **Impact:** Drive-by downloads leading to malware infection, execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser if the malicious URL points to a resource that can be interpreted as such (e.g., a specially crafted MP4 with embedded scripts or redirecting to a malicious page), or triggering browser vulnerabilities due to the nature of the malicious content.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   `src` option of the `videojs()` constructor or player instance.
        *   `source` elements within the `<video>` tag managed by `video.js`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict validation of video URLs:** Implement robust server-side validation and sanitization of all video URLs before they are passed to `video.js`. Use allow-lists of trusted domains or URL patterns.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP that restricts the sources from which media can be loaded using the `media-src` directive.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in `video.js`](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in__video_js_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known security vulnerabilities present within the `video.js` library itself. This involves leveraging documented flaws in the library's code to execute malicious actions within the context of the user's browser. This is a direct attack against the `video.js` codebase.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the specific vulnerability, impacts can range from cross-site scripting (XSS) allowing the execution of arbitrary JavaScript, to potentially more severe issues like remote code execution in specific environments or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:**
        *   Any module or function within the `video.js` library that contains a known vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if the vulnerability allows for remote code execution or significant compromise), High (for vulnerabilities like XSS).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regularly update `video.js`:** Keep the `video.js` library updated to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Monitor security advisories:** Stay informed about security advisories and vulnerability disclosures related to `video.js`.
        *   **Use Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools:** Employ SCA tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the `video.js` dependency.
