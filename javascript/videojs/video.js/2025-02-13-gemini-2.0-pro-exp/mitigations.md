## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Plugin Vetting and Management (Video.js Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_plugin_vetting_and_management__video_js_specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Plugin Vetting and Management (Video.js Specific Aspects)

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Whitelist Approved Plugins:** Maintain a list of explicitly allowed Video.js plugins.  This list should only include plugins from trusted sources (official Video.js plugins, well-known and reputable community developers).
        2.  **Video.js API Usage Review:**  Within the source code review of plugins (and your own custom Video.js code), pay *specific* attention to how the Video.js API is used. Look for:
            *   **`player.src()` Misuse:** Ensure that the `player.src()` method (or any method that sets the video source) is *not* using untrusted or user-supplied data directly without proper validation and sanitization.  This is a potential injection point.
            *   **Event Listener Security:**  Carefully review any event listeners added to the Video.js player (e.g., `player.on('loadedmetadata', ...)`).  Ensure that the event handler functions do not use unsanitized data from the event object or other sources in a way that could lead to XSS.
            *   **Custom UI Component Handling:** If the plugin creates custom UI components within the player, ensure that any data displayed in these components is properly sanitized.
            *   **Plugin Options:** If the plugin accepts configuration options, review how these options are used.  Ensure that options that could affect security (e.g., allowing custom HTML) are handled securely.
        3.  **Dependency Management (npm/yarn):** Use a package manager to manage Video.js and plugin versions.  This allows for easy updates and ensures you're using known versions.
        4.  **Regular Updates (via package manager):**  Regularly update Video.js and all plugins to their latest versions using the package manager.  This is *critical* for patching security vulnerabilities.
        5. **Removal of Unused Plugins/Features:** Disable or remove any Video.js plugins or features that are not actively used in your application. This reduces the attack surface.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Plugins:** (Severity: **Critical**) - Prevents execution of arbitrary JavaScript injected through a compromised or malicious plugin, specifically targeting how the plugin interacts with the Video.js API.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via Malicious Plugins:** (Severity: **High**) - Reduces the risk of a plugin using the Video.js API to access and send sensitive data to an attacker.
        *   **Video Source Manipulation:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious video sources via the `player.src()` method or similar.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk by focusing on the specific ways plugins can introduce XSS through the Video.js API.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting how plugins can interact with potentially sensitive data through the Video.js API.
        *   **Video Source Manipulation:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring proper validation and sanitization of video sources set through Video.js.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Package manager (npm) is used for Video.js and plugin management.
        *   Video.js and plugins are updated manually on a monthly basis.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Formal whitelist of approved plugins is not established.
        *   Comprehensive source code review, specifically focusing on Video.js API usage, is not consistently performed.
        *   Automated update process is not in place.
        *   Documentation of plugin security reviews and Video.js API usage is lacking.
        *   Regular review and removal of unused plugins/features is not a standard practice.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Metadata Sanitization within Video.js Context](./mitigation_strategies/metadata_sanitization_within_video_js_context.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Metadata Sanitization within Video.js Context

    *   **Description:**
        1.  **Identify Metadata Display Points:** Within your Video.js implementation (including custom plugins), identify all places where video metadata (title, description, captions, custom data) is displayed to the user. This includes:
            *   Using the `player.title()` method.
            *   Customizing the control bar or other UI elements to display metadata.
            *   Using plugin-specific methods for displaying metadata.
        2.  **Sanitize Before Display:** Before passing *any* metadata to Video.js methods or displaying it within custom UI elements, sanitize it using a robust HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify).  This should be done *within* your JavaScript code that interacts with Video.js.
            ```javascript
            // Example using DOMPurify and player.title()
            const dirtyTitle = "<script>alert('XSS')</script>Malicious Title";
            const cleanTitle = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirtyTitle);
            player.title(cleanTitle);

            // Example with a custom UI element
            const dirtyDescription = "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>Bad Description";
            const cleanDescription = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirtyDescription);
            document.getElementById('video-description').textContent = cleanDescription; // Use textContent for safety
            ```
        3.  **Prefer `textContent`:** When setting text-only content within Video.js UI elements (where HTML is not expected), use the `.textContent` property instead of `.innerHTML`. This provides automatic escaping.
        4. **Test with Malicious Payloads:** Specifically test your Video.js integration with various XSS payloads embedded in metadata to ensure the sanitization is effective.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Video Metadata (within Video.js):** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents the execution of malicious JavaScript embedded in video metadata that is displayed through Video.js or its plugins.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces the risk.  Proper sanitization within the Video.js context eliminates the possibility of injecting executable code through metadata handled by Video.js.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic escaping is used in some places when setting the video title, but a dedicated sanitization library is not used consistently across all metadata display points.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A robust sanitization library (like DOMPurify) needs to be integrated and used consistently for *all* metadata displayed through Video.js or its plugins.
        *   Thorough testing with various XSS payloads, specifically targeting the Video.js integration, is required.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Video Source (within Video.js)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_video_source__within_video_js_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Handling of Video Source (within Video.js)

    *   **Description:**
        1. **Validate Input to `player.src()`:** If you are allowing users to input video URLs (which is generally discouraged), *strictly* validate and sanitize the input *before* passing it to the `player.src()` method (or any other method that sets the video source).  This validation should:
            *   Check the URL format.
            *   Potentially restrict the allowed protocols (e.g., only allow `https://`).
            *   Potentially restrict the allowed domains (whitelist).
        2. **Prefer Server-Side Source Control:** The *best* approach is to avoid allowing users to directly input video URLs. Instead, have the server provide the video source to Video.js. This allows for much stronger control and validation.
        3. **Escape URL Components:** If you must construct URLs dynamically on the client-side, ensure that all URL components are properly escaped using `encodeURIComponent()`.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Video Source Manipulation (leading to XSS or other attacks):** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious video sources (e.g., pointing to a file containing JavaScript) via the `player.src()` method.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Video Source Manipulation:** Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring that only validated and sanitized URLs are passed to Video.js.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Video sources are primarily controlled server-side.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   There are a few minor instances where user-provided data (e.g., from a query parameter) might be used to construct part of a video URL. These instances need to be reviewed and secured with proper validation and escaping.
