# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a free and open-source HTML5 video player framework.
*   Enable easy embedding and playback of videos in web browsers.
*   Offer a consistent and customizable user experience across different browsers and devices.
*   Support a wide range of video formats and streaming protocols.
*   Provide a plugin architecture for extending functionality.
*   Maintain a large and active community of users and contributors.
*   Ensure accessibility for users with disabilities.

Business Risks:

*   Malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities in the player to inject malicious code or compromise user data.
*   The player's reliance on external libraries and plugins could introduce supply chain risks.
*   Lack of proper input validation could lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
*   Inadequate security controls could allow unauthorized access to video content or user data.
*   Failure to comply with accessibility standards could exclude users with disabilities.
*   The project's open-source nature could make it a target for malicious contributions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Regular code reviews and audits. (Mentioned in the contributing guidelines and security policy)
*   security control: Use of linters and static analysis tools. (Implied by the project's build process and use of tools like ESLint)
*   security control: Dependency management using npm. (Visible in the package.json file)
*   security control: A security policy that outlines how to report vulnerabilities. (SECURITY.md file)
*   security control: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) handling. (Implemented in the codebase)
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) recommendations. (Mentioned in documentation and examples)
*   security control: Subresource Integrity (SRI) usage for loaded scripts. (Mentioned in documentation)

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for bug fixes and security patches.
*   accepted risk: Potential for zero-day vulnerabilities in the player or its dependencies.
*   accepted risk: Limited resources for comprehensive security testing and penetration testing.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement automated security testing, including dynamic analysis (DAST) and fuzzing, in the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Conduct regular penetration testing by independent security researchers.
*   Establish a bug bounty program to incentivize vulnerability reporting.
*   Implement a robust Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management system.
*   Perform regular security training for contributors and maintainers.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Not directly applicable to the core video player, as it primarily deals with playback. Authentication is typically handled by the embedding website or application.
*   Authorization:
    *   The player should respect any authorization mechanisms implemented by the embedding website or application, such as DRM or token-based access control.
*   Input Validation:
    *   All user-supplied input, including URLs, configuration options, and plugin parameters, must be strictly validated to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Support for encrypted media extensions (EME) for playing DRM-protected content.
    *   Secure communication over HTTPS when fetching video resources or interacting with external services.
    *   If handling sensitive data, use appropriate cryptographic libraries and algorithms.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  CDN (Recommended): Include Video.js directly from a CDN (e.g., cdnjs, jsDelivr). This is the simplest and most common approach.
2.  Self-Hosting: Download the Video.js files and host them on your own web server.
3.  npm/Bundler: Install Video.js as a dependency using npm and bundle it with your application code using a bundler like Webpack or Browserify.

Chosen Solution (CDN):

```mermaid

## BUILD

```mermaid
graph LR
    Developer["Developer"] -- "Commits code" --> GitHub["GitHub Repository"]
    GitHub -- "Triggers" --> GitHubActions["GitHub Actions (CI)"]
    GitHubActions -- "Runs tests, linters, builds" --> BuildArtifacts["Build Artifacts (video.js, video.min.js, etc.)"]
    BuildArtifacts -- "Published to" --> npmRegistry["npm Registry"]
    BuildArtifacts -- "Published to" --> CDN["CDN (e.g., cdnjs)"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developers write code and commit it to the GitHub repository.
2.  GitHub Actions, the CI/CD system used by Video.js, is triggered by commits and pull requests.
3.  GitHub Actions runs a series of jobs, including:
    *   Linting: Code style checks using ESLint.
    *   Testing: Unit and integration tests using Karma and other testing frameworks.
    *   Building: Transpiling code with Babel, minifying JavaScript and CSS.
4.  Build artifacts (video.js, video.min.js, video-js.css, etc.) are generated.
5.  The artifacts are published to:
    *   npm Registry: For developers who use npm to manage dependencies.
    *   CDN (e.g., cdnjs): For direct inclusion in web pages.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Linting (ESLint): Enforces code style and helps prevent common errors.
*   security control: Automated Testing: Unit and integration tests help ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: Dependency Management (npm): Tracks dependencies and allows for vulnerability scanning.
*   security control: GitHub Actions: Provides a secure and automated build environment.
*   security control: Code Review: All changes are reviewed before merging.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Delivering a functional and reliable video player.
*   Maintaining a positive user experience.
*   Protecting the reputation of the Video.js project and its community.

Data to Protect:

*   Source Code: Medium sensitivity. The code is publicly available, but unauthorized modifications could introduce vulnerabilities.
*   User Data (Indirectly): Low sensitivity. The player itself doesn't directly handle user data, but it could be used as a vector for attacks against the embedding website or application.
*   Video Content (Indirectly): Variable sensitivity, depending on the content. The player is responsible for playing the content, but the content itself is managed by the embedding website or application.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that the embedding website or application must adhere to, and how might these impact the use of Video.js?
*   What are the specific threat models considered by the Video.js maintainers?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities discovered in third-party plugins?
*   What level of support is provided for older browsers, and what are the security implications of supporting them?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to provide a free, open-source, and widely used video player. Security is important, but it's balanced with the need for ease of use and broad compatibility.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project relies on community contributions and best practices for security. There is no dedicated security team, but maintainers are responsive to security reports.
*   DESIGN: The design prioritizes flexibility and extensibility, allowing for a wide range of use cases and integrations. The use of a CDN for deployment is the most common and recommended approach. The build process is automated and includes basic security checks.
