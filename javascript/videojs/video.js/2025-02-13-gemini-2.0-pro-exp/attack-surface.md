# Attack Surface Analysis for videojs/video.js

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Player Configuration](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_player_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into the Video.js player through user-controlled configuration options, data attributes, or plugin settings.  This is the most direct and likely attack vector *specific to Video.js*.
    *   **Video.js Contribution:** Video.js's core design, with its extensive JavaScript-based configuration and plugin system, directly enables this attack if input is not properly handled.  The library *itself* is the mechanism for injecting and executing the malicious script.
    *   **Example:** A user provides a malicious URL as a subtitle track source via a `data-setup` attribute: `<video data-setup='{"tracks": [{"src": "javascript:alert(1)", "kind": "captions"}]}'>`. Or, a user supplies a malicious plugin configuration through the JavaScript API: `player.myPlugin({evilOption: "<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>"});`
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
        *   Theft of cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive data.
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
        *   Defacement of the web page.
        *   Keylogging and other malicious actions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** *Always* use a robust HTML sanitizer (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove dangerous elements and attributes from *all* user-supplied data used in *any* part of the Video.js configuration (player options, `data-*` attributes, plugin settings).
        *   **Context-Aware Escaping:** Escape data appropriately for its context (HTML, JavaScript, attribute).  Use appropriate encoding functions.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to restrict script sources.  This is a crucial defense-in-depth measure.
        *   **Allow-listing:** Define a strict allow-list of permitted configuration options and values.  Reject any input that doesn't match the allow-list.
        *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct regular code reviews, specifically focusing on how user input is used to construct the Video.js player and its plugins.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within third-party Video.js plugins.  This is a direct attack surface because the vulnerability exists *within* code loaded and executed by Video.js.
    *   **Video.js Contribution:** Video.js's plugin architecture allows for the execution of arbitrary third-party code *within the context of the Video.js player*.  The library provides the mechanism for loading and running the vulnerable plugin.
    *   **Example:** A plugin designed to display ads contains an XSS vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject malicious code through the ad content.  The Video.js player loads and executes this vulnerable plugin, leading to XSS.  Or, a plugin has a known remote code execution vulnerability, and Video.js loads and runs this vulnerable code.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the plugin vulnerability, but can range from XSS (most common) to complete system compromise (less common, but possible).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the specific plugin and its vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Vetting:** *Only* use plugins from trusted sources (e.g., official Video.js plugins, well-known and reputable developers) and those that are actively maintained.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep *all* plugins updated to the latest versions to patch any known vulnerabilities.  Automate this process if possible.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly scan plugins for known vulnerabilities using software composition analysis (SCA) tools.
        *   **Code Review (if feasible):** If the plugin is open-source, review the source code for potential security issues before using it.
        *   **Limit Plugin Usage:** Minimize the number of plugins used to reduce the overall attack surface.  Only use plugins that are absolutely necessary.
        * **Sandboxing (If available):** Explore if sandboxing options are available for the plugin.
