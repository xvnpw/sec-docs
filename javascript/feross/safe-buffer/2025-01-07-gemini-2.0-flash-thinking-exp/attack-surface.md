# Attack Surface Analysis for feross/safe-buffer

## Attack Surface: [Incorrect Size Calculation Leading to Buffer Overflow/Underflow](./attack_surfaces/incorrect_size_calculation_leading_to_buffer_overflowunderflow.md)

**Description:** Developers might miscalculate the necessary buffer size when allocating with `safe-buffer.alloc()` or `safe-buffer.allocUnsafe()`. This can lead to writing beyond the allocated buffer (overflow) or reading before the beginning of the buffer (underflow) during subsequent operations.

**How `safe-buffer` Contributes:** While `safe-buffer` prevents accidental out-of-bounds writes *during creation*, it relies on the developer to provide the correct size. An incorrect size provided to `safe-buffer`'s allocation functions is the root cause.

**Example:**

* A developer intends to store a 10-byte string but allocates a buffer of only 5 bytes using `safeBuffer.alloc(5)`. A subsequent attempt to write the full 10-byte string will result in a buffer overflow.

**Impact:** Memory corruption, potential for arbitrary code execution, application crash, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Careful Size Calculation:** Double-check and validate all calculations for buffer sizes before allocating.
* **Use Constants or Enums:** Define constants for expected buffer sizes to reduce errors.
* **Dynamic Size Determination:** If possible, dynamically determine the required buffer size based on the data being processed.
* **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews to identify potential size calculation errors.

## Attack Surface: [Information Leakage from `allocUnsafe()`](./attack_surfaces/information_leakage_from__allocunsafe___.md)

**Description:** As `allocUnsafe()` doesn't zero-fill the allocated memory, it might contain leftover data from previous memory allocations. If this buffer is used to store sensitive information and not fully overwritten, the old data might be accessible, leading to information disclosure.

**How `safe-buffer` Contributes:** `safe-buffer` provides the `allocUnsafe()` method, and its inherent behavior of not zero-filling is the direct cause of this potential leakage.

**Example:**

* A developer uses `safeBuffer.allocUnsafe(100)` to store a password. If the password is less than 100 bytes, the remaining bytes in the buffer might contain sensitive data from a previous memory allocation. If this buffer is then transmitted or logged, the old data could be exposed.

**Impact:** Disclosure of sensitive information (passwords, API keys, etc.).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Avoid `allocUnsafe()` for Sensitive Data:**  Prefer `safeBuffer.alloc()` for storing sensitive information as it guarantees zero-filled memory.
* **Explicitly Overwrite Buffers:** If `allocUnsafe()` must be used, ensure the entire buffer is overwritten with the intended data.
* **Clear Buffers After Use:**  Explicitly clear buffers containing sensitive data after they are no longer needed.
