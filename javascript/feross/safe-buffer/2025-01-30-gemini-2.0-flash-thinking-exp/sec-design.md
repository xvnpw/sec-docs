# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a secure and reliable JavaScript library for handling buffers in Node.js and browser environments.
  - Mitigate common buffer-related security vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and out-of-bounds access.
  - Offer a developer-friendly API that is easy to integrate into existing JavaScript projects.
  - Maintain compatibility with existing Node.js and browser buffer APIs where possible, while prioritizing security.
  - Ensure the library is performant and does not introduce significant overhead compared to native buffer implementations.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library itself could undermine the security of applications that depend on it.
  - Performance regressions compared to native buffers could discourage adoption.
  - API incompatibility with existing buffer usage patterns could lead to integration challenges and developer frustration.
  - Lack of community adoption and maintenance could lead to the library becoming outdated and unsupported.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting the distribution channels (e.g., npm registry) could compromise the library's integrity.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Public code repository on GitHub (https://github.com/feross/safe-buffer) - provides transparency and allows for community review.
  - security control: GitHub's built-in dependency scanning - helps identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
  - security control: Open-source license (MIT) - encourages community contributions and scrutiny.

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for undiscovered vulnerabilities in the code, inherent in any software project.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of the underlying JavaScript runtime environments (Node.js, browsers).
  - accepted risk: Risk of malicious contributions if the project accepts external contributions without thorough review.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct regular code reviews, especially for security-sensitive areas and external contributions.
  - security control: Establish a process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
  - security control: Consider fuzz testing to identify potential buffer-related vulnerabilities and edge cases.
  - security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to continuously monitor dependencies for vulnerabilities and license compliance.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to a JavaScript library. Authentication is relevant for systems that *use* the library, but not for the library itself.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to a JavaScript library. Authorization is relevant for systems that *use* the library, but not for the library itself.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Validate all input parameters related to buffer creation and manipulation (e.g., buffer sizes, offsets, lengths) to prevent out-of-bounds access and other buffer-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Ensure that input validation is performed consistently across all API entry points.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If the library is intended to be used in cryptographic contexts (e.g., handling cryptographic keys or data), ensure that cryptographic operations are performed securely using well-established and vetted cryptographic libraries and practices.
    - Requirement: Avoid implementing custom cryptography within the library if possible, and rely on established cryptographic modules provided by the runtime environment or dedicated libraries.
