Based on your instructions, the provided vulnerability list should be updated to exclude entries that do not meet the specified criteria.

The current entry, "**No high-rank vulnerabilities found in project configuration and workflow files**", is explicitly stated to be a "low" rank vulnerability and indicates that no high-rank vulnerabilities were identified in the analyzed files.  Furthermore, it describes an absence of vulnerability rather than a vulnerability itself.

Therefore, according to your instructions to include only vulnerabilities with a rank of "high" or higher, and to include only *valid* vulnerabilities, this entry should be excluded from the updated list.

Here is the updated list after applying the filtering criteria:

## Vulnerability List

```

**Explanation:**

The original list contained one entry that did not describe a valid, high-rank vulnerability exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance.  As per your instructions, this entry has been removed, resulting in an empty list.

If there are other vulnerability entries you would like me to review and filter based on the same criteria, please provide them.
