## Vulnerability List

### Supply Chain Dependency Compromise Risk

- **Vulnerability Name:** Supply Chain Dependency Compromise Risk

- **Description:**
  The extension depends on a number of externally maintained components (for example, PowerShell Editor Services, PSScriptAnalyzer, PSReadLine, and others) and uses publicly accessible CI/CD pipelines (as seen in the GitHub workflows and Azure Pipelines configuration files) to build, test, and package the extension before publishing it on the VS Code Marketplace. An advanced attacker who compromises one or more key dependencies or gains access to the CI/CD environment (or its credentials) could inject malicious code into a dependency or alter the build process. When a user downloads the new release, the injected code would execute in the context of their Visual Studio Code environment—potentially leading to remote code execution, data exfiltration, or further compromise.

  **Step‑by‑step Trigger:**
  1. The attacker identifies a target within the dependency chain (e.g. a module updated frequently) or targets the CI/CD process (via misconfigured workflow settings or stolen secrets).
  2. They compromise the upstream dependency repository — or the CI/CD pipeline itself (as defined in files such as `.github/workflows/ci-test.yml` and `.github/release.yml`) — injecting malicious code or modifying build scripts.
  3. The compromised update passes through the automated build and testing process (which uses static analysis tools such as CodeQL but may not detect a subtle malicious change).
  4. The release artifact is then signed (per the current release signing process) and published to the VS Code Marketplace.
  5. When an end user installs the extension update, the malicious payload executes in their VS Code host process.

- **Impact:**
  A successful attack could result in remote code execution within the user’s environment, allowing the attacker to exfiltrate sensitive information, install backdoors, or pivot to other systems. Given the widespread installation of the extension via the Marketplace, such an exploit would have large-scale implications.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - Dependency pinning: Versions are locked in configuration files (e.g. `package.json` and `global.json`) to reduce unexpected updates, as documented in the development instructions.
  - Automated CI/CD pipelines: Public workflows (in `.github/workflows/`) run the build, test, and packaging process and include some automated code scanning (e.g. CodeQL) to catch anomalous changes.
  - Build signing: A release signing process is in place to verify the integrity of builds prior to publication.
  - Regular updates and review: The changelog shows frequent updates and dependency audits.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Supply chain integrity framework: The project would benefit from adopting a more robust supply chain security framework (such as SLSA) to provide attestation of build integrity and to enable reproducible builds.
  - Enhanced runtime verification: There is currently no additional attestation or runtime verification of transitive dependencies beyond static scans.
  - Stronger CI/CD isolation: Greater isolation of build environment credentials (for example, via stricter secrets management and minimal privilege policies) could reduce the risk of CI/CD compromise.

- **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to compromise an external dependency (for example, by taking over a frequently updated module repo) or gain unauthorized access to the CI/CD pipeline (such as by exploiting misconfigurations or weak secrets management).
  - The malicious update must avoid detection during automated scanning and be accepted by the signing process, resulting in a compromised artifact published on the Marketplace.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The repository’s `.github/workflows/ci-test.yml` and `.github/release.yml` files reveal that the build and release processes are fully automated using public GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines. These workflows pull dependencies (e.g. using `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/upload-artifact@v4`) and then invoke build scripts (using tools like `Invoke-Build`) that rely on pinned versions of external components.
  - The development documentation (in `docs/development.md`) explicitly describes the dependency tracking and upgrading process, while the changelog entries (spanning releases such as v2020.2.0 and previous versions) document changes in CI/CD usage (e.g. moving to Azure Pipelines, updating CI configurations).
  - Although version-locking and code signing are in place, the extensive reliance on public and third-party infrastructure means that a sufficiently advanced attacker could compromise one of the external nodes in the dependency chain or the release process itself.

- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Test Environment Setup:**
     - Duplicate the CI/CD pipeline locally (using the workflow files in the `.github/workflows/` directory) and mirror the dependency management configuration from the repository.
  2. **Simulate a Compromise:**
     - In a fork of one of the key dependencies (for example, a modified version of PSReadLine or PSScriptAnalyzer), insert a benign “marker” payload intended to simulate malicious behavior.
     - Alternatively, simulate an injection into the CI/CD process (for example, by replacing a build script with one that records an execution marker).
  3. **Execute the Build:**
     - Trigger the build process via the replicated CI/CD pipeline so that the modified dependency (or build process) is incorporated into the signed release artifact.
  4. **Artifact Verification:**
     - Download and install the resulting test VSIX extension package in an isolated Visual Studio Code environment.
     - Validate (by searching logs or console output) whether the “marker” payload is executed, confirming that the malicious change propagated into the final artifact.
  5. **Assessment:**
     - Confirm that current automated checks (such as static analysis) did not catch the injected payload.
     - Use the results to evaluate the potential impact of an attacker successfully exploiting the supply chain risk.
