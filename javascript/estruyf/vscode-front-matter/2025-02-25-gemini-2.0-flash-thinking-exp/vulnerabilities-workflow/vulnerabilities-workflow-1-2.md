Based on the provided instructions and the analysis of the vulnerabilities, here is the updated list in markdown format:

---

- **Vulnerability Name:** Webview XSS via Unsanitized Markdown/Front Matter
  **Description:**
  An attacker can create a specially crafted markdown file (or inject malicious content into the front matter) containing HTML and JavaScript (for example, a `<script>` tag with an alert or worse payload). When a user loads this file in the Front Matter CMS preview (which is rendered inside a VS Code webview), the extension may simply insert the unsanitized content into its DOM. This results in the browser engine executing the attacker’s script within the context of the webview.
  **Impact:**
  - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the VS Code extension’s webview
  - Possibility to hijack the user’s session, steal sensitive data (such as tokens or credentials) or exfiltrate other information from the editor environment
  - Compromise of the overall security of the development session
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The documentation and changelog do not indicate a dedicated sanitization step or explicit Content Security Policies (CSP) applied in the webviews.
  - Standard markdown rendering is used, but no evidence shows that raw HTML injection is being filtered.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Use of a robust HTML–sanitization library (for example, DOMPurify) to cleanse input before insertion into the webview
  - Implementation of a strict CSP in the webview environment to limit script execution
  - Validation of incoming markdown and front matter so that any embedded HTML is either escaped or disallowed
  **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to supply or trick the user into loading a malicious markdown (or data file) via the CMS interface (for example, in a publicly exposed content folder or via an imported file)
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - Although the actual rendering code is not shown here, the READMEs and changelog repeatedly mention the preview functionality.
  - The content flow likely follows: file (which includes front matter and content) → parsing by the extension → insertion into a VS Code webview via innerHTML (or similar API) → execution if input is not sanitized.
  - No evidence in the provided documentation indicates additional checks are in place to neutralize embedded HTML/JS.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a controlled environment, create a markdown file with front matter similar to:
     ```
     ---
     title: "Test"
     ---
     <script>alert('XSS');</script>
     ```
  2. Place this file in a content folder that the extension will load.
  3. Open the file or use the Front Matter CMS preview command to render the file.
  4. Observe whether the alert is triggered in the webview; if so, this confirms that raw HTML is executing and the XSS vulnerability is present.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Custom Script Injection
  **Description:**
  The extension supports extensibility by allowing custom scripts (for actions such as GitHub Copilot prompts or other extensions of functionality) to be loaded and executed. If these custom script files are not properly validated or sandboxed, an attacker who is able to influence (or trick a user into loading) a malicious script file could inject code that runs with the full privileges of the user's VS Code environment.
  **Impact:**
  - Execution of arbitrary code on the user’s system under the context of the VS Code extension
  - Potential access to local files, credentials, and other sensitive data on the user’s machine
  - Complete compromise of the affected development environment
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The project documentation and changelog describe capabilities around custom script actions. However, there is no clear evidence that the extension enforces a sandbox or validates/sanitizes the content of these scripts before execution.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Implementation of sandboxing or isolated execution environments for running custom scripts
  - Strict validation of custom script content (or only allowing scripts that are digitally signed/trusted)
  - Limiting the privileges of the custom script execution context to reduce impact in the event of injection
  **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must succeed in either introducing a malicious custom script into a content folder used by the extension or trick a user into installing a compromised file from an external source
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - The changelog documents several enhancements that add “custom script” functionality (for example, support for GitHub Copilot custom prompts and linking custom actions to fields).
  - This indicates that the extension dynamically reads and executes user–provided scripts. In the absence of any documented sanitization or sandbox controls, this dynamic evaluation could lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker’s payload is received.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a safe test environment, create a custom script file with a payload that—for test purposes—executes a benign but noticeable command (for example, writing a specific file to disk or opening a calculator application).
  2. Place this script in the designated custom scripts directory so that the extension will load it.
  3. Use the extension’s interface to trigger the custom script action.
  4. Verify whether the payload is executed by checking for the expected benign action (e.g., the presence of the file or the execution of the command).
  5. Successful execution confirms that the custom script is run without proper isolation, demonstrating the vulnerability.
