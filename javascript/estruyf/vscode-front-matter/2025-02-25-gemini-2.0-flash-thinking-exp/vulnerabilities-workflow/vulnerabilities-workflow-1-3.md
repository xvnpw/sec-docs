## Vulnerability list for Front Matter CMS based on provided PROJECT FILES

Based on the provided project files, no vulnerabilities meeting the criteria for inclusion were identified. This means that within the scope of these files, there are no:

- Valid and not already mitigated vulnerabilities.
- Vulnerabilities with a rank of high or critical.
- Vulnerabilities triggerable by external attackers on a publicly available instance, excluding those caused by developer coding errors, missing documentation, or that are denial of service.

**Detailed Breakdown for each requested section (as no vulnerabilities were found):**

**Vulnerability Name:** None identified based on provided project files.

**Description:** No vulnerability description available as no qualifying vulnerability was identified in the provided project files.

**Impact:** No impact to describe as no qualifying vulnerability was identified in the provided project files.

**Vulnerability Rank:** No rank to assign as no qualifying vulnerability was identified in the provided project files.

**Currently Implemented Mitigations:** Not applicable as no qualifying vulnerability was identified in the provided project files.

**Missing Mitigations:** Not applicable as no qualifying vulnerability was identified in the provided project files.

**Preconditions:** Not applicable as no qualifying vulnerability was identified in the provided project files.

**Source Code Analysis:** Source code analysis of the provided project files did not reveal any vulnerabilities meeting the inclusion criteria. The analysis was limited to documentation, configuration, and CI/CD related files and did not include the application source code itself.

**Security Test Case:** No security test case can be defined as no qualifying vulnerability was identified in the provided project files.  Testing against a publicly available instance based solely on these project files would not reveal any high or critical vulnerabilities according to the analysis.

**Important Note:** This analysis is strictly limited to the provided PROJECT FILES. A comprehensive security assessment requires examination of the Front Matter CMS application source code to identify potential vulnerabilities within the application logic itself.
