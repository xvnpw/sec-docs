## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation of Configuration File Paths Processed by `rc`](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_of_configuration_file_paths_processed_by__rc_.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Identify all points where your application allows users or external systems to influence the configuration file paths that `rc` will process. This primarily includes command-line arguments and environment variables that are passed to `rc` or used in constructing paths for `rc` to load.
*   Step 2: Define a strict whitelist of allowed base directories from which `rc` is permitted to load configuration files. This should be limited to directories intended for application configuration and exclude user-writable or system-wide directories unless absolutely necessary.
*   Step 3: Before passing any user-provided path components to `rc` or using them to construct paths for `rc`, validate them.
    *   Use `path.resolve()` to normalize and resolve symbolic links in the provided path.
    *   Check if the resolved path starts with one of the allowed base directories in your whitelist.
*   Step 4: If a path provided for `rc` to load from does not fall within the allowed directories, prevent `rc` from loading configuration from that path. Log an error indicating an invalid configuration path attempt.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Path Traversal via `rc` Configuration Paths (High Severity): Attackers could manipulate command-line arguments or environment variables that influence `rc`'s configuration loading to point `rc` to load files outside the intended configuration directories. This can lead to reading sensitive files or potentially overwriting files if `rc` or the application processes loaded configuration in a way that allows file writing based on configuration.
*   Information Disclosure via `rc` Loading Unintended Files (Medium Severity): By controlling paths passed to `rc`, attackers could potentially force `rc` to load and expose the content of configuration files or other files they should not have access to, even without malicious intent to overwrite.

**Impact:**
*   Path Traversal via `rc` Configuration Paths: Significantly reduces the risk by preventing `rc` from loading files from arbitrary locations, limiting the attack surface related to path manipulation through `rc`.
*   Information Disclosure via `rc` Loading Unintended Files: Significantly reduces the risk by controlling the files `rc` can access, preventing unintended exposure of sensitive information through `rc`'s configuration loading.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Yes, input validation for configuration file paths provided via command-line arguments that are used by `rc` is implemented in the `config/configLoader.js` module.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Input validation is not yet implemented for configuration file paths that could be influenced by environment variables and subsequently used by `rc`. This needs to be added to the `config/configLoader.js` module to ensure consistent path validation for all inputs that can affect `rc`'s file loading behavior.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restricting Configuration Sources Used by `rc`](./mitigation_strategies/restricting_configuration_sources_used_by__rc_.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1: Review the default configuration source search paths that `rc` uses. Understand the order of precedence (`command line args`, `environment variables`, `~/.config/appname`, `/etc/appname`, etc.).
*   Step 2: Determine the minimal and most trusted set of configuration sources that are actually necessary for your application's deployment environments.
*   Step 3: Explicitly configure `rc` to *only* load from these essential and trusted sources. Utilize `rc`'s API to disable or ignore the default, less trusted sources if they are not required. For example, in production, you might disable loading from user-specific configuration files (`~/.config`) or command-line arguments, relying only on environment variables or a specific configuration file path.
*   Step 4: Clearly document the allowed configuration sources for developers and operations teams, ensuring everyone understands which sources `rc` will consider and in what order.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Configuration Overriding via Less Trusted `rc` Sources (Medium Severity): Attackers or less privileged users could potentially override intended application configuration by placing malicious configuration files in user-writable locations that `rc` searches by default (e.g., `~/.config`), taking advantage of `rc`'s default search order.
*   Supply Chain Attacks Exploiting `rc` Default Paths (Low to Medium Severity): If development or build environments are compromised, malicious configuration files could be introduced into default `rc` configuration paths, potentially affecting deployed applications if `rc` is configured to search those paths.

**Impact:**
*   Configuration Overriding via Less Trusted `rc` Sources: Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the locations from which `rc` loads configuration, making it harder for unauthorized users to inject malicious configurations through `rc`'s default search behavior.
*   Supply Chain Attacks Exploiting `rc` Default Paths: Partially reduces the risk by narrowing the attack surface related to `rc`'s configuration loading and making it easier to control and monitor the trusted configuration sources that `rc` uses.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   No. The application currently uses `rc` with its default configuration source search paths and precedence.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Configuration source restriction needs to be implemented in the application's configuration loading logic by explicitly configuring `rc` to only consider a limited set of trusted paths and potentially disabling default search paths that are not necessary. This should be implemented in `config/configLoader.js` using `rc`'s API to control source paths.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Treat Configuration Loaded by `rc` as Data, Not Code](./mitigation_strategies/treat_configuration_loaded_by__rc__as_data__not_code.md)

**Description:**
*   Step 1:  Ensure that configuration values loaded by `rc` are treated strictly as data within your application. Avoid any interpretation of configuration values as executable code.
*   Step 2:  Specifically, avoid using `eval()` or similar functions to process configuration values obtained from `rc`. These functions can execute arbitrary code if configuration values are maliciously crafted.
*   Step 3: If dynamic or complex configuration logic is absolutely necessary, design and implement a sandboxed or restricted execution environment for processing configuration values. This should prevent arbitrary code injection and limit the potential impact of malicious configuration.  However, strongly prefer static configuration and data-driven approaches over dynamic code execution based on configuration.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Remote Code Execution via Configuration Injection through `rc` (High Severity): If configuration values loaded by `rc` are processed using `eval()` or similar mechanisms, attackers could inject malicious code into configuration files or sources that `rc` reads. This could lead to remote code execution on the application server when `rc` loads and the application processes the malicious configuration.
*   Configuration Injection Leading to Application Logic Manipulation (Medium to High Severity): Even without direct code execution, if configuration values are not properly sanitized and treated as data, attackers might be able to inject values that manipulate application logic in unintended and potentially harmful ways, depending on how the application uses the configuration.

**Impact:**
*   Remote Code Execution via Configuration Injection through `rc`: Significantly reduces the risk by eliminating the possibility of executing arbitrary code through configuration values loaded by `rc`.
*   Configuration Injection Leading to Application Logic Manipulation: Partially reduces the risk by promoting a data-centric approach to configuration, making it harder to inject values that directly manipulate code execution flow.  However, proper input validation (as described in other strategies) is also crucial to fully mitigate this.

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Yes. The application's codebase currently avoids using `eval()` or similar functions to process configuration values loaded by `rc`. Configuration is treated as data.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   While `eval()` is avoided, a review should be conducted to ensure there are no other potential code execution vulnerabilities related to how configuration values from `rc` are processed, especially if any form of dynamic processing or templating is used with configuration data.  This review should be part of ongoing code security audits.
