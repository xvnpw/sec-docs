## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Environment Variables [HR]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_environment_variables__hr_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker gains control over the environment in which the application runs, allowing them to set or modify environment variables.
*   **Sub-Steps:**
    *   **Set Malicious Environment Variables [HR]**
        *   *Description:* The attacker sets environment variables that `rc` will read and use as configuration values.
        *   *Methods:*
            *   Compromised CI/CD Pipeline: The attacker gains access to the Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment system and modifies environment variables used during the build or deployment process.
            *   Compromised Container: The attacker gains access to the container (e.g., Docker) in which the application is running and sets environment variables within the container.
            *   Shared Hosting (Less Common, but Possible): In poorly configured shared hosting environments, an attacker might be able to influence the environment of other applications running on the same server.
            *   Vulnerable Application/Service: An attacker exploits a vulnerability in another application or service running on the same system to modify the environment of the target application.
    *   **Override Configuration Values [HR][CN]**
        *   *Description:* The attacker sets environment variables with names that match existing configuration keys used by the application. `rc` prioritizes environment variables over configuration files, so these malicious values will override the legitimate ones.
        *   *Impact:* This is a *critical* step because it's where the attacker's control over the environment translates into control over the application's configuration.
    *   **Inject Arbitrary Values [HR][CN]**
        *   *Description:* The attacker injects values that are designed to be harmful when used by the application.
        *   *Examples:*
            *   Database Credentials: Injecting fake database credentials to redirect the application to a malicious database.
            *   API Keys: Injecting invalid or compromised API keys to disrupt service or gain unauthorized access to external services.
            *   Commands: Injecting shell commands that will be executed by the application if it uses configuration values in an unsafe way (e.g., command injection).
            *   File Paths: Injecting malicious file paths to cause the application to read or write to unintended locations (e.g., path traversal).
    *   **Exploit Application Logic [HR][CN]**
        *   *Description:* This is the *most critical* step. The attacker's injected configuration values are used by the application in a way that leads to a security vulnerability being exploited.
        *   *Vulnerabilities:*
            *   SQL Injection: The application uses a configuration value directly in a database query without proper sanitization or parameterization.
            *   Command Injection: The application uses a configuration value as part of a system command that is executed.
            *   Path Traversal: The application uses a configuration value as a file path without proper validation, allowing the attacker to access files outside of the intended directory.
            *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): While less direct, if a configuration value is used to render HTML without proper encoding, it could lead to XSS.
            *   Other Logic Flaws: Any situation where the application uses a configuration value in an unsafe or unexpected way.
