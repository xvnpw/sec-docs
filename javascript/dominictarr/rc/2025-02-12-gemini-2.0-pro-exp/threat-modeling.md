# Threat Model Analysis for dominictarr/rc

## Threat: [Threat 1: Environment Variable Injection](./threats/threat_1_environment_variable_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker with the ability to modify environment variables accessible to the application process sets environment variables that `rc` will interpret as configuration settings. The attacker crafts these variables to override legitimate settings with malicious values, leveraging `rc`'s built-in environment variable parsing.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Integrity:** Modification of application behavior, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution (e.g., by changing database connection strings, library paths, or feature flags) due to `rc` loading the attacker-controlled values.
        *   **Availability:** Denial of service by setting invalid or resource-exhausting configuration values that `rc` passes to the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rc`'s environment variable parsing logic (specifically the `env` parsing within the main `rc` function and its merging behavior).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if it leads to RCE)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run the application with minimal privileges, restricting access to environment variables.
        *   **Input Validation:** Treat environment variables loaded by `rc` as untrusted. Implement strict validation and sanitization within the application after `rc` loads them.
        *   **Secrets Management:** Avoid storing sensitive data directly in environment variables. Use a dedicated secrets manager.
        *   **Configuration Prefixing:** Use a unique prefix (e.g., `MYAPP_`) for application-specific environment variables to minimize collisions and aid management.
        *   **Disable Environment Variable Loading (if feasible):** If not strictly required, disable this configuration source via `rc`'s options (e.g., empty `env` option).

## Threat: [Threat 2: Command-Line Argument Injection](./threats/threat_2_command-line_argument_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker who can influence the command-line arguments passed to the application injects arguments that `rc` will interpret as configuration overrides, exploiting `rc`'s built-in argument parsing.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Integrity:** Modification of application behavior, potentially leading to RCE, similar to environment variable injection, as `rc` processes the malicious arguments.
        *   **Availability:** Denial of service through `rc` loading and passing invalid configuration to the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rc`'s command-line argument parsing logic (the `argv` parsing within the main `rc` function).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if it leads to RCE)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Arguments:** Do not use command-line arguments for sensitive configuration.
        *   **Strict Input Validation:** Validate and sanitize all command-line arguments within the application, treating them as untrusted input *after* `rc` has processed them.
        *   **Controlled Execution Environment:** Ensure the application is launched securely, preventing attackers from modifying the command line.
        *   **Disable Argument Parsing (if feasible):** If not essential, disable this source via `rc`'s options (e.g., empty `argv` option).

## Threat: [Threat 3: Configuration File Tampering](./threats/threat_3_configuration_file_tampering.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker gains write access to configuration files that `rc` loads (e.g., `.appnamerc`, `/etc/appname/config`).  The attacker modifies the file contents, and `rc` subsequently loads these malicious settings. This threat directly involves `rc`'s file loading mechanism.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Integrity:** Modification of application behavior, potentially leading to RCE or data corruption, because `rc` loads and applies the tampered configuration.
        *   **Availability:** Denial of service by introducing invalid configuration that `rc` attempts to process.
    *   **Affected Component:** `rc`'s file loading mechanism (the logic that searches for and reads configuration files).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **File System Permissions:** Enforce strict file system permissions. Only the application's service account (with least privilege) should have read access; restrict write access.
        *   **File Integrity Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to detect unauthorized modifications to files that `rc` reads.
        *   **Secure Configuration Storage:** Store configuration files securely, separate from the application code and web root.
        *   **Configuration File Signing (Advanced):** Digitally sign configuration files and verify the signature before `rc` loads them.
