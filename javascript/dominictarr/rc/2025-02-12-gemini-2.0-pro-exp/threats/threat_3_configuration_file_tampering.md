# Deep Analysis: Configuration File Tampering (Threat 3) using `rc`

## 1. Objective

The objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly examine the "Configuration File Tampering" threat against applications using the `rc` library.  We aim to understand the specific attack vectors, potential consequences, and effective mitigation strategies beyond the high-level descriptions provided in the initial threat model.  This analysis will inform concrete implementation steps for the development team.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the threat of an attacker modifying configuration files loaded by the `rc` library.  It encompasses:

*   **`rc`'s File Loading Behavior:**  How `rc` searches for, reads, and parses configuration files.  This includes understanding the default search paths and file naming conventions.
*   **Attack Surface:**  Identifying all potential locations where `rc` might load configuration files, considering different operating systems and deployment scenarios.
*   **Exploitation Techniques:**  How an attacker might leverage file tampering to achieve specific malicious goals (e.g., RCE, data exfiltration, DoS).
*   **Mitigation Effectiveness:**  Evaluating the practical effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies and identifying potential bypasses.
*   **Implementation Guidance:** Providing specific, actionable recommendations for the development team.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Threats unrelated to `rc`'s configuration loading.
*   General system hardening beyond what directly impacts this specific threat.
*   Vulnerabilities within the application logic itself, *except* where those vulnerabilities are directly triggered by malicious configuration loaded via `rc`.

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodology:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the `rc` source code (https://github.com/dominictarr/rc) to understand its file loading logic in detail.  This includes identifying:
    *   The functions responsible for locating and reading configuration files.
    *   The order in which different configuration sources are prioritized.
    *   How errors during file loading are handled.
    *   Any existing security checks (e.g., input validation on file paths).
2.  **Documentation Review:**  Thoroughly review the `rc` documentation to understand the intended usage and configuration options.
3.  **Experimentation:**  Set up a test environment to simulate various attack scenarios.  This will involve:
    *   Creating different configuration files in various locations.
    *   Attempting to inject malicious configuration values.
    *   Observing how `rc` handles these scenarios.
    *   Testing the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.
4.  **Threat Modeling Refinement:**  Based on the findings from the code review, documentation review, and experimentation, refine the initial threat model and identify any previously overlooked attack vectors or vulnerabilities.
5.  **Mitigation Validation:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies and identify any potential weaknesses or bypasses.
6.  **Documentation and Reporting:**  Document the findings of the analysis, including specific recommendations for the development team.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Threat 3: Configuration File Tampering

### 4.1. `rc`'s File Loading Behavior (Code & Documentation Review)

Based on the `rc` documentation and source code, the library loads configuration from multiple sources, in the following order of precedence (highest to lowest):

1.  **Command-line arguments:**  Parsed using `minimist`.
2.  **Environment variables:**  Prefixed with the application name (or a custom prefix).
3.  **Configuration files:** This is the core of our threat. `rc` searches for files in several locations:
    *   If a `--config` flag is provided, that file is loaded.
    *   Otherwise, it searches:
        *   `~/.${appname}rc` (User's home directory)
        *   `~/.${appname}/config` (User's home directory)
        *   `~/.config/${appname}` (User's home directory)
        *   `~/.config/${appname}/config` (User's home directory)
        *   `/etc/${appname}rc`
        *   `/etc/${appname}/config`
        *   A local `.appnamerc` file in the current working directory or any parent directory.
4.  **Default values:**  Provided as an argument to the `rc` function.

The library uses `JSON.parse` to parse the configuration files.  It merges the configurations from different sources, with later sources overriding earlier ones.

**Key Observations:**

*   **Multiple Search Paths:** The large number of potential configuration file locations increases the attack surface.  An attacker only needs to gain write access to *one* of these locations.
*   **Home Directory Reliance:**  The heavy reliance on the user's home directory (`~/`) is a significant risk.  If an attacker compromises the user account (even without root privileges), they can modify these files.
*   **Current Working Directory Influence:** The search for a local `.appnamerc` file in the current and parent directories introduces a potential dependency injection vulnerability. If the application is run from an attacker-controlled directory, the attacker can provide a malicious configuration file.
*   **`JSON.parse`:** While `JSON.parse` itself is generally safe against code injection, it's crucial to ensure that the *values* within the JSON are properly validated by the application *after* `rc` loads them. `rc` does *not* perform any validation of the configuration values.
*   **No Built-in Integrity Checks:** `rc` does not perform any integrity checks (e.g., checksums, signatures) on the configuration files it loads.

### 4.2. Attack Surface and Exploitation Techniques

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability in several ways:

1.  **User Account Compromise:**  If the attacker gains access to the user account under which the application runs, they can modify the configuration files in the user's home directory (`~/.${appnamerc}`, etc.).
2.  **`/etc` Modification (Root Required):**  If the attacker has root privileges, they can modify the system-wide configuration files in `/etc/${appname}rc` or `/etc/${appname}/config`.
3.  **Current Working Directory Manipulation:**  If the attacker can influence the directory from which the application is launched, they can place a malicious `.appnamerc` file in that directory or a parent directory.  This could occur, for example, if the application is launched via a script that is vulnerable to command injection.
4.  **Shared Hosting Environments:** In shared hosting environments, other users on the same system might have write access to directories that `rc` searches, allowing them to inject malicious configurations.
5. **Supply Chain Attack:** If attacker can modify `rc` library, he can introduce malicious code that will load configuration from attacker controlled source.

**Exploitation Examples:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  If the application uses a configuration value to construct a shell command (e.g., a path to an executable), the attacker can inject a malicious command into that configuration value.  For example:
    ```json
    {
      "executablePath": "; rm -rf /; echo 'owned'"
    }
    ```
    If the application uses this `executablePath` without proper sanitization, it could lead to RCE.
*   **Data Exfiltration:**  The attacker can modify configuration values that control data destinations (e.g., database connection strings, API endpoints) to redirect data to an attacker-controlled server.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can introduce invalid configuration values that cause the application to crash or enter an infinite loop.  For example, providing a non-numeric value for a configuration option that expects a number.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** If configuration controls authorization settings, the attacker might be able to elevate their privileges within the application.

### 4.3. Mitigation Strategy Evaluation and Implementation Guidance

Let's revisit the proposed mitigation strategies and provide more specific guidance:

1.  **File System Permissions (Strongly Recommended):**

    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** The application should run under a dedicated service account with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  This service account should *not* be a regular user account.
    *   **Read-Only Access:** The service account should have *read-only* access to the configuration files.  *No* user, including the service account, should have write access to the production configuration files.
    *   **Configuration Deployment:** Configuration files should be deployed as part of a controlled deployment process (e.g., using a configuration management tool like Ansible, Chef, or Puppet).  The deployment process should set the correct file permissions.
    *   **Avoid `/etc` for Writable Config:**  Do *not* use `/etc/${appname}rc` or `/etc/${appname}/config` for configuration that needs to be modified at runtime.  These locations should be reserved for system-wide, read-only configuration.
    *   **Avoid Home Directories for Production:**  Do *not* rely on configuration files in user home directories (`~/`) for production deployments.  These locations are too easily compromised.
    *   **Specific Commands:**
        *   Create a dedicated service account (e.g., `appname-service`): `useradd -r -s /sbin/nologin appname-service`
        *   Set ownership of the configuration file: `chown root:appname-service /path/to/config/file`
        *   Set permissions: `chmod 440 /path/to/config/file` (read-only for owner and group)
        *   Ensure the application runs as the `appname-service` user.

2.  **File Integrity Monitoring (Recommended):**

    *   **Tools:** Use a file integrity monitoring (FIM) tool like AIDE, Tripwire, Samhain, or OSSEC.  These tools can detect unauthorized modifications to configuration files.
    *   **Configuration:** Configure the FIM tool to monitor the specific configuration files that `rc` loads.
    *   **Alerting:**  Configure the FIM tool to generate alerts when changes are detected.  These alerts should be sent to a security monitoring system.
    *   **Regular Audits:** Regularly audit the FIM tool's configuration and logs to ensure it is functioning correctly.

3.  **Secure Configuration Storage (Strongly Recommended):**

    *   **Dedicated Configuration Directory:**  Create a dedicated directory for configuration files, separate from the application code and web root.  For example: `/opt/appname/config`.
    *   **Avoid Web Root:**  Never store configuration files within the web root.  This prevents attackers from accessing them directly via HTTP requests.
    *   **Environment Variables for Secrets:**  Store sensitive configuration values (e.g., passwords, API keys) in environment variables, *not* in configuration files.  Use a secure mechanism for managing environment variables (e.g., a secrets management tool).
    *   **Configuration Management Tools:** Use a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible, Chef, Puppet) to manage the deployment and configuration of the application and its configuration files.

4.  **Configuration File Signing (Advanced - Optional):**

    *   **Digital Signatures:**  Digitally sign the configuration files using a private key.  The application can then verify the signature using the corresponding public key before loading the configuration.
    *   **Implementation:**  This requires integrating cryptographic libraries into the application.  You can use libraries like `crypto` (in Node.js) to implement signing and verification.
    *   **Key Management:**  Securely manage the private key used for signing.  This is crucial; if the private key is compromised, the attacker can sign malicious configuration files.
    *   **Performance Overhead:**  Signature verification adds a small performance overhead.

5. **Input Validation (Crucial - Not Directly `rc`'s Responsibility):**

    * **Application-Level Validation:** Even though `rc` loads the configuration, the *application* is responsible for validating the values.  *Never* trust configuration values blindly.
    * **Type Checking:**  Ensure that configuration values are of the expected data type (e.g., number, string, boolean).
    * **Range Checking:**  If a configuration value has a valid range, enforce that range.
    * **Whitelist Validation:**  If a configuration value can only have a limited set of valid values, use a whitelist to validate it.
    * **Sanitization:**  Sanitize configuration values before using them in any sensitive operations (e.g., constructing shell commands, database queries).

6. **Avoid Current Working Directory Dependency (Strongly Recommended):**
    * **Explicit Configuration Path:** Instead of relying on the local `.appnamerc` file search, always specify an explicit configuration file path using the `--config` flag or an environment variable. This eliminates the risk of the application loading a malicious configuration file from the current working directory.

7. **Regular Security Audits (Strongly Recommended):**
    * Conduct regular security audits of the application and its configuration to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities.

## 5. Conclusion

The "Configuration File Tampering" threat is a serious risk for applications using the `rc` library due to its flexible but potentially insecure file loading mechanism.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined above, particularly strict file system permissions, secure configuration storage, and thorough input validation within the application, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this threat.  The advanced mitigation of configuration file signing provides an additional layer of defense but requires careful key management.  Regular security audits are essential to ensure the ongoing security of the application.
