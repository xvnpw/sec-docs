# Deep Analysis: Configuration File Poisoning in `rc`

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the "Configuration File Poisoning" attack surface related to the `rc` library, identify specific vulnerabilities, assess their impact, and propose robust mitigation strategies beyond the initial overview.  The goal is to provide actionable guidance for developers to secure their applications against this attack vector.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the configuration file loading mechanism of the `rc` library (https://github.com/dominictarr/rc) and how attackers can exploit it to compromise applications.  It covers:

*   The standard file loading behavior of `rc`.
*   Specific attack scenarios leveraging this behavior.
*   The impact of successful attacks.
*   Detailed mitigation strategies, including code examples and tool recommendations where appropriate.

*   **Mitigation Strategy Development:**  Proposing practical and effective mitigation strategies, including code examples and tool recommendations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. `rc`'s File Loading Mechanism

The `rc` library loads configuration files from a predefined set of locations, in a specific order of precedence.  This order is crucial to understanding the attack surface:

1.  Command-line arguments (`--key value`).
2.  Environment variables (prefixed, e.g., `myapp_key`).
3.  If the `--config` flag is used, the file specified by that flag.
4.  Files in a list of default locations, searched in *reverse* order:
    *   `./.appnamerc` (current working directory)
    *   `./.appname/config`
    *   `./config/appname`
    *   `$HOME/.appnamerc`
    *   `$HOME/.appname/config`
    *   `$HOME/.config/appname`
    *   `$HOME/.config/appname/config`
    *   `/etc/appnamerc`
    *   `/etc/appname/config`
    *   A system-wide configuration directory (platform-dependent).

The first value found for a given key "wins."  This cascading behavior is a core feature of `rc`, but it also creates a significant attack surface.

### 4.2. Attack Scenarios

Here are several detailed attack scenarios:

*   **Scenario 1: `/etc/appnamerc` Poisoning (Privilege Escalation Required):**
    *   **Attacker Goal:**  Gain control of the application by modifying a system-wide configuration file.
    *   **Prerequisites:**  The attacker has gained root or administrator privileges on the system, or has exploited a separate vulnerability that allows them to write to `/etc/appnamerc`.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  The attacker modifies `/etc/appnamerc` to inject malicious configuration values.  For example, they might change an `apiKey` to one they control, redirect database connections to a malicious server, or disable security features.
        2.  The application, when run by any user, loads the poisoned configuration from `/etc/appnamerc`.
        3.  The attacker's malicious settings take effect, compromising the application.
    *   **Impact:**  Complete application compromise, potential data exfiltration, denial of service, or lateral movement within the system.

*   **Scenario 2: `$HOME/.appnamerc` Poisoning (User-Level Compromise):**
    *   **Attacker Goal:**  Compromise the application when run by a specific user.
    *   **Prerequisites:**  The attacker has gained access to the target user's account, or has exploited a vulnerability that allows them to write to the user's home directory.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  The attacker creates or modifies `$HOME/.appnamerc` to inject malicious configuration.
        2.  When the target user runs the application, the poisoned configuration is loaded.
        3.  The application is compromised in the context of that user.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the user's data and potentially other resources accessible to that user.

*   **Scenario 3: `./.appnamerc` Poisoning (Local Attack, Project-Specific):**
    *   **Attacker Goal:**  Compromise the application when run from a specific directory.  This is particularly relevant in development environments or shared project directories.
    *   **Prerequisites:**  The attacker has write access to the application's working directory or a parent directory.  This could be due to misconfigured permissions, a shared development environment, or a compromised version control system.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  The attacker creates a malicious `./.appnamerc` file in the application's working directory (or a parent directory, exploiting `rc`'s search path).
        2.  When the application is run from that directory, the poisoned configuration is loaded *before* any system-wide or user-specific configurations.
        3.  The application is compromised.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the application when run from the specific directory, potentially affecting developers or automated build processes.  This can be used to inject malicious code into the build process itself.

*   **Scenario 4: Environment Variable Manipulation (Context-Dependent):**
    *   **Attacker Goal:**  Modify the application's behavior by manipulating environment variables.
    *   **Prerequisites:** The attacker can influence the environment in which the application is executed. This might be possible through a compromised shell, a vulnerable web server configuration, or other means.
    *   **Attack Steps:**
        1.  The attacker sets environment variables that `rc` will interpret as configuration values (e.g., `myapp_apiKey=malicious_key`).
        2.  The application loads these environment variables, overriding any conflicting values from configuration files.
        3.  The application is compromised.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to file-based poisoning, but the attack vector is through the environment.

* **Scenario 5: `--config` Flag Manipulation (If Used):**
    * **Attacker Goal:** Force the application to load a malicious configuration file.
    * **Prerequisites:** The attacker can control the command-line arguments passed to the application. This might be possible through a script injection vulnerability, a compromised wrapper script, or other means.
    * **Attack Steps:**
        1. The attacker injects a `--config /path/to/malicious/config` argument.
        2. `rc` loads the specified malicious configuration file, overriding any default configurations.
        3. The application is compromised.
    * **Impact:** Complete application compromise, as the attacker controls the entire configuration.

### 4.3. Vulnerabilities and Inherent Risks

*   **No Input Validation:** `rc` performs *no* validation of the configuration values it loads, beyond ensuring they are valid JSON.  It is entirely up to the application to validate the *semantics* of the configuration. This is a significant vulnerability.
*   **Implicit Trust:** `rc` implicitly trusts all configuration files found in its search path.  It does not distinguish between legitimate and malicious files.
*   **Wide Search Path:** The extensive search path, while convenient, increases the attack surface.  Attackers have multiple locations to potentially inject malicious configurations.
*   **Precedence Rules:** The precedence rules (command-line > environment > files) can be exploited to override legitimate configurations.
*   **Lack of Signing/Verification:** `rc` does not provide any mechanism for verifying the integrity or authenticity of configuration files.

### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed)

Here are detailed mitigation strategies, building upon the initial overview:

1.  **Strict File Permissions (Essential):**

    *   **Principle:**  Apply the principle of least privilege.  Configuration files should be readable *only* by the user account that runs the application.  No other users should have read or write access.  Administrators should have write access only when necessary for configuration changes.
    *   **Implementation (Linux/macOS):**
        ```bash
        # Set ownership to the application user (e.g., 'myappuser')
        chown myappuser:myappuser /etc/myapprc
        # Set permissions to read-only for the owner, no access for others
        chmod 400 /etc/myapprc
        ```
        *   **Important:**  Ensure that the directory containing the configuration file also has appropriate permissions to prevent attackers from creating new files or modifying existing ones.
    * **Implementation (Windows):** Use the `icacls` command or the GUI to set permissions, granting read access only to the application's user account and denying access to other users.

2.  **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) (Highly Recommended):**

    *   **Principle:**  Detect unauthorized modifications to configuration files.
    *   **Tools:**
        *   **AIDE (Advanced Intrusion Detection Environment):**  A free and open-source FIM tool.  It creates a database of file checksums and periodically compares the current state of the files to the database, reporting any discrepancies.
        *   **Tripwire:**  A commercial FIM tool with more advanced features.
        *   **Samhain:** Another open-source option.
        *   **OSSEC:** A host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) that includes FIM capabilities.
    *   **Implementation (AIDE Example):**
        1.  Install AIDE: `sudo apt-get install aide` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `sudo yum install aide` (CentOS/RHEL).
        2.  Initialize the AIDE database: `sudo aide --init`.
        3.  Move the initial database to its final location: `sudo mv /var/lib/aide/aide.db.new.gz /var/lib/aide/aide.db.gz`.
        4.  Configure AIDE to monitor your configuration files (edit `/etc/aide/aide.conf`).  For example:
            ```
            /etc/myapprc p+i+n+u+g+s+b+m+c+md5+sha256+sha512
            ```
        5.  Schedule regular AIDE checks (e.g., using cron): `sudo crontab -e` and add a line like:
            ```
            0 2 * * * /usr/sbin/aide --check
            ```
    *   **Alerting:** Configure AIDE (or your chosen FIM tool) to send alerts (e.g., email) when changes are detected.

3.  **Post-Load File Content Validation (Crucial):**

    *   **Principle:**  Validate the *content* of the configuration after it has been loaded by `rc`.  This is essential because `rc` does not perform any semantic validation.
    *   **Techniques:**
        *   **Schema Validation (Recommended):** Use a schema validation library (e.g., `jsonschema` in Python, `ajv` in Node.js) to define the expected structure and data types of your configuration.
        *   **Manual Validation:**  Write custom code to check the values of specific configuration parameters.  This is less robust than schema validation but can be used for simple checks.
    *   **Implementation (Python with `jsonschema`):**
        ```python
        import rc
        import jsonschema
        from jsonschema import ValidationError

        # Define the configuration schema
        config_schema = {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "apiKey": {"type": "string", "minLength": 32, "maxLength": 64},
                "databaseUrl": {"type": "string", "format": "uri"},
                "port": {"type": "integer", "minimum": 1, "maximum": 65535},
                "enableSecurity": {"type": "boolean"},
            },
            "required": ["apiKey", "databaseUrl", "port", "enableSecurity"],
            "additionalProperties": False,  # Prevent unknown properties
        }

        # Load the configuration using rc
        config = rc('myapp')

        # Validate the configuration against the schema
        try:
            jsonschema.validate(instance=config, schema=config_schema)
            print("Configuration is valid.")
        except ValidationError as e:
            print(f"Configuration validation error: {e}")
            # Handle the error appropriately (e.g., exit, log, use defaults)
            exit(1)

        # Use the validated configuration
        print(f"Using API key: {config['apiKey']}")
        ```
    *   **Implementation (Node.js with `ajv`):**
        ```javascript
        const rc = require('rc');
        const Ajv = require('ajv');
        const ajv = new Ajv(); // options can be passed, e.g. {allErrors: true}

        const configSchema = {
          type: 'object',
          properties: {
            apiKey: { type: 'string', minLength: 32, maxLength: 64 },
            databaseUrl: { type: 'string', format: 'uri' },
            port: { type: 'integer', minimum: 1, maximum: 65535 },
            enableSecurity: { type: 'boolean' },
          },
          required: ['apiKey', 'databaseUrl', 'port', 'enableSecurity'],
          additionalProperties: false,
        };

        const config = rc('myapp');

        const validate = ajv.compile(configSchema);
        const valid = validate(config);
        if (!valid) {
          console.error('Configuration validation error:', validate.errors);
          process.exit(1); // Or handle the error appropriately
        } else {
          console.log('Configuration is valid.');
          console.log(`Using API key: ${config.apiKey}`);
        }
        ```
    * **Handle Validation Errors:**  If validation fails, the application *must* handle the error appropriately.  This might involve:
        *   Exiting with an error message.
        *   Using default values (if safe and appropriate).
        *   Logging the error and continuing (only if the invalid configuration is not critical).
        *   Entering a "safe mode" with limited functionality.
    * **`additionalProperties: false`:** This is a crucial part of the schema. It prevents attackers from adding arbitrary, unexpected properties to the configuration, which could be used to exploit vulnerabilities in the application.

4.  **Read-Only Filesystem (If Feasible):**

    *   **Principle:**  If the configuration files do not need to be modified during normal operation, mount the directory containing them as read-only.  This prevents any modifications, even by privileged users.
    *   **Implementation (Linux):**
        ```bash
        # Mount the configuration directory as read-only
        mount -o ro /etc/myapp
        ```
        *   **Note:** This requires careful planning, as it prevents any legitimate configuration updates without remounting the filesystem as read-write.  This is often suitable for production environments where configuration changes are infrequent and controlled.

5.  **Avoid Default Locations (If Possible):**

    *   **Principle:**  Use a custom, non-standard location for configuration files.  This makes it more difficult for attackers to guess the location and inject malicious configurations.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Use the `--config` flag to specify a custom configuration file path.  This is the most reliable way to override the default search path.
        *   Set the `config` property in the application's `package.json` file (for Node.js applications).
        *   Use a custom environment variable to specify the configuration file path, and check this variable *before* calling `rc`.
    *   **Example (using `--config`):**
        ```bash
        myapp --config /opt/myapp/config/myapp.conf
        ```

6.  **Harden the Environment:**

    * **Principle:** Minimize the risk of environment variable manipulation.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Secure Shell Configuration:** If the application is launched via SSH, ensure that the SSH server is configured securely (e.g., disable `PermitUserEnvironment`).
        * **Web Server Configuration:** If the application is a web application, ensure that the web server is configured to prevent attackers from setting arbitrary environment variables (e.g., through CGI scripts or other interfaces).
        * **Containerization:** If using containers (e.g., Docker), carefully control the environment variables passed to the container. Avoid passing sensitive information as environment variables if possible; use secrets management tools instead.

7. **Least Privilege for Application User:**

    * **Principle:** The application should run under a dedicated user account with the *minimum* necessary privileges. This limits the damage an attacker can do if they compromise the application.
    * **Implementation:**
        * Create a dedicated user account for the application (e.g., `myappuser`).
        * Do *not* run the application as `root` or an administrator.
        * Grant the application user only the necessary permissions to access required resources (e.g., files, network ports).

8. **Regular Security Audits:**

    * **Principle:** Regularly review the application's security posture, including its configuration management practices.
    * **Implementation:**
        * Conduct periodic security audits, including code reviews and penetration testing.
        * Review file permissions and FIM configurations.
        * Stay up-to-date on security best practices and vulnerabilities related to `rc` and other libraries.

9. **Consider Alternatives (If High Security is Required):**

    * If the application has very high security requirements, consider using a more secure configuration management library that provides features like:
        * **Built-in validation:** Libraries that enforce schema validation as part of the loading process.
        * **Encryption:** Libraries that support encrypting sensitive configuration values.
        * **Digital signatures:** Libraries that allow verifying the integrity and authenticity of configuration files.
        * **Centralized configuration management:** Tools like HashiCorp Vault, etcd, or Consul, which provide secure and centralized storage and management of configuration data.

## 5. Conclusion

The `rc` library's configuration file loading mechanism presents a significant attack surface due to its implicit trust, wide search path, and lack of input validation.  "Configuration File Poisoning" is a high-severity risk that can lead to complete application compromise.  By implementing the mitigation strategies outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and improve the overall security of their applications.  The most crucial mitigations are strict file permissions, post-load file content validation (using schema validation), and file integrity monitoring.  For applications with very high security requirements, consider alternatives to `rc` that offer more robust security features.
