# Threat Model Analysis for dominictarr/rc

## Threat: [Configuration File Injection/Overwrite](./threats/configuration_file_injectionoverwrite.md)

**Threat:** Configuration File Injection/Overwrite

* **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to write to or modify configuration files that `rc` loads. This could be achieved through vulnerabilities in other parts of the application or the underlying system. The attacker might inject malicious configurations by overwriting existing files or creating new ones that `rc` prioritizes.

* **Impact:** The attacker can inject arbitrary configuration values, leading to:
    * **Credential Theft:** Modifying database credentials, API keys, or other secrets.
    * **Remote Code Execution:** Altering paths to load malicious modules or scripts.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Changing settings that affect data processing or storage.
    * **Denial of Service:** Configuring resource-intensive settings or disabling critical features.

* **Which `rc` component is affected:** Configuration File Loading Module

* **Risk Severity:** Critical

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement strict file system permissions on configuration files, ensuring only the application user can modify them.
    * Store configuration files in secure locations outside the webroot.
    * Regularly audit configuration files for unexpected changes.
    * Avoid using user-supplied input to determine configuration file paths.
    * Consider using immutable configuration methods where possible.

## Threat: [Environment Variable Injection](./threats/environment_variable_injection.md)

**Threat:** Environment Variable Injection

* **Description:** An attacker can control environment variables when the application is running. This might occur through vulnerabilities in the deployment environment, container orchestration, or by gaining access to the server. The attacker sets malicious environment variables that `rc` picks up and uses for configuration.

* **Impact:** The attacker can inject arbitrary configuration values, leading to similar impacts as configuration file injection, such as:
    * **Credential Theft:** Setting malicious values for database credentials or API keys.
    * **Remote Code Execution:** Overriding paths or settings to load malicious code.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Altering application behavior through configuration changes.
    * **Denial of Service:** Injecting values that cause resource exhaustion.

* **Which `rc` component is affected:** Environment Variable Loading Module

* **Risk Severity:** High

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Carefully control access to the environment where the application runs.
    * Avoid relying solely on environment variables for sensitive configuration.
    * Sanitize or validate environment variables before they are used by the application, even if loaded via `rc`.
    * Consider using a secrets management system for sensitive environment variables.
    * Implement proper isolation and security measures in the deployment environment.

## Threat: [Command-line Argument Injection](./threats/command-line_argument_injection.md)

**Threat:** Command-line Argument Injection

* **Description:** An attacker can influence the command-line arguments passed to the application during startup. This could happen if the application is launched through a vulnerable process or if an attacker gains control over deployment scripts or orchestration tools. The attacker injects malicious configuration values directly as command-line arguments, which `rc` then uses.

* **Impact:** The attacker can inject arbitrary configuration values, potentially overriding other configuration sources, leading to:
    * **Credential Theft:** Injecting malicious credentials via command-line flags.
    * **Remote Code Execution:**  Providing malicious paths or settings through command-line arguments.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Altering application behavior through injected configuration.
    * **Denial of Service:** Injecting resource-intensive configurations.

* **Which `rc` component is affected:** Command-line Argument Parsing Module

* **Risk Severity:** High

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Secure the application deployment process and limit access to deployment scripts.
    * Avoid passing sensitive information directly as command-line arguments.
    * If command-line arguments are necessary for configuration, validate and sanitize them before use by `rc`.
    * Implement proper access controls on systems and tools used to launch the application.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration.md)

**Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration

* **Description:** Developers might inadvertently store sensitive information, such as API keys, database credentials, or encryption keys, directly in configuration files or environment variables that `rc` loads. If these sources are compromised (through any of the above methods or other means), the sensitive information is exposed.

* **Impact:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to other systems, data, or resources by obtaining these sensitive credentials. This can lead to:
    * **Data Breaches:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data.
    * **Account Takeover:** Impersonating legitimate users or services.
    * **Financial Loss:** Unauthorized access to financial accounts or resources.

* **Which `rc` component is affected:** The application's usage of the loaded configuration values (while the direct component isn't in `rc`, the threat is directly related to *how* `rc` loads and makes available this information).

* **Risk Severity:** Critical

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Never store sensitive information directly in configuration files or environment variables.**
    * Use secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) to store and retrieve sensitive data.
    * If storing sensitive data in configuration is unavoidable, encrypt it at rest and in transit.
    * Regularly audit configuration files and environment variables for sensitive information.

## Threat: [Configuration-Driven Command Injection](./threats/configuration-driven_command_injection.md)

**Threat:** Configuration-Driven Command Injection

* **Description:** A configuration value loaded by `rc` is used as part of a system command executed by the application. An attacker can inject malicious commands into the configuration value, which will then be executed by the system.

* **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server with the privileges of the application, potentially leading to:
    * **Remote Code Execution:** Gaining full control over the server.
    * **Data Manipulation or Deletion:** Modifying or deleting sensitive data.
    * **System Compromise:** Installing malware or creating backdoors.

* **Which `rc` component is affected:** The application's usage of the loaded configuration values (while the direct component isn't in `rc`, the threat is directly related to *how* `rc` loads and makes available potentially dangerous values).

* **Risk Severity:** Critical

* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Avoid constructing system commands directly from configuration values.**
    * If executing system commands based on configuration is absolutely necessary, use safe execution methods and carefully sanitize inputs.
    * Consider using libraries or APIs that provide safer alternatives to direct command execution.
    * Implement the principle of least privilege for the application's user.
