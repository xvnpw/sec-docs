## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Configuration via Command Line Arguments](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_configuration_via_command_line_arguments.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits the application's processing of command-line arguments via the `rc` library.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The application uses `rc` to load configuration values from command-line arguments.
    *   The attacker can influence the command-line arguments passed to the application. This could be through direct execution if the attacker has access to the server or indirectly by influencing a parent process that launches the application.
    *   By crafting malicious command-line arguments, the attacker can inject arbitrary configuration values, overriding default settings or values from configuration files.
*   **Potential Impact:** Complete control over application behavior, potentially leading to privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or remote code execution depending on how the configuration is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Configuration via Environment Variables](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_configuration_via_environment_variables.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates environment variables that the `rc` library uses to load configuration.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The application uses `rc` to load configuration values from environment variables.
    *   The attacker can control the environment variables in which the application runs. This could be through direct setting if the attacker has server access or indirectly by influencing the system's environment or a parent process.
    *   By setting malicious environment variables, the attacker can inject arbitrary configuration values, overriding defaults or file-based configurations.
*   **Potential Impact:** Similar to command-line arguments, this can lead to significant control over the application, potentially resulting in privilege escalation, data breaches, or remote code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Configuration via Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_inject_malicious_configuration_via_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker gains the ability to modify or replace the configuration files that the `rc` library loads.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The application relies on `rc` to load configuration from files.
    *   The attacker can achieve write access to the configuration file location through various means:
        *   Direct write access due to misconfigured file permissions.
        *   Exploiting a path traversal vulnerability in the application that allows writing to arbitrary locations.
        *   Compromising the server or a user account with write access.
    *   Once write access is obtained, the attacker can inject malicious configuration values directly into the files.
*   **Potential Impact:** Persistent control over the application's behavior, potentially leading to long-term compromise, data manipulation, or remote code execution depending on the configuration settings modified.

## Attack Tree Path: [Critical Node: Condition: Attacker can modify or replace configuration files](./attack_tree_paths/critical_node_condition_attacker_can_modify_or_replace_configuration_files.md)

**Attack Vector:** This node represents the critical ability of an attacker to alter the application's configuration files.
*   **Mechanism:** As described in the "Inject Malicious Configuration via Configuration Files" path, this can be achieved through various means like exploiting file permission issues, path traversal vulnerabilities, or server compromise.
*   **Significance:** This is a critical node because it directly enables the "Inject Malicious Configuration via Configuration Files" high-risk path, allowing for persistent and potentially widespread control over the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit YAML Parser Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_yaml_parser_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in the YAML parser used by the `rc` library (or a library it depends on) when loading YAML configuration files.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The application uses `rc` to load configuration from YAML files.
    *   The YAML parser has known vulnerabilities, particularly deserialization vulnerabilities.
    *   The attacker crafts a malicious YAML file containing instructions to execute arbitrary code during the deserialization process.
    *   When `rc` loads and the YAML parser processes this malicious file, the attacker's code is executed on the server.
*   **Potential Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the server and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit `.dotsrc` File Loading](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit___dotsrc__file_loading.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages the `rc` library's ability to load configuration from `.dotsrc` files in user home directories or the current working directory.
*   **Mechanism:**
    *   The application and its environment allow `rc` to load `.dotsrc` files.
    *   The attacker can control the content of these `.dotsrc` files. This could be achieved by:
        *   Compromising a user account on the server.
        *   Influencing the environment where the application runs, such as in shared hosting scenarios.
    *   By placing malicious configuration settings within a `.dotsrc` file, the attacker can influence the application's behavior when it is run by the affected user or in the affected directory.
*   **Potential Impact:**  Depending on the configuration options, this can lead to privilege escalation (if the application runs with elevated privileges), data manipulation, or other forms of compromise.
