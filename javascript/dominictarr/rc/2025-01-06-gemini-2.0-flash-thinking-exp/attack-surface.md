# Attack Surface Analysis for dominictarr/rc

## Attack Surface: [Command-line Argument Injection](./attack_surfaces/command-line_argument_injection.md)

**Description:** Attackers can influence application behavior by providing malicious or unexpected values through command-line arguments.

**How `rc` Contributes:** `rc` prioritizes command-line arguments, meaning values provided here will override other configuration sources. This makes it a direct way to inject malicious settings that `rc` then loads.

**Example:** Running the application with `node app.js --database.host=attacker.com` could redirect database connections to a malicious server, as `rc` will load this value for `database.host`.

**Impact:**  Potentially critical, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, or denial of service depending on the affected configuration loaded by `rc`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Implement strict validation and sanitization of configuration values *after* they are loaded by `rc` from command-line arguments. Define expected data types and formats.
* **Users:** Be cautious when running applications with command-line arguments from untrusted sources. Avoid passing sensitive information directly as command-line arguments if possible, as `rc` will make them effective.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_manipulation.md)

**Description:** Attackers who can control the environment in which the application runs can inject malicious configurations through environment variables.

**How `rc` Contributes:** `rc` reads configuration from environment variables, allowing attackers to influence settings that `rc` loads without modifying files or command-line arguments.

**Example:** Setting the environment variable `APP_API_KEY=malicious_key` could replace the legitimate API key used by the application, as `rc` will load this value for `APP_API_KEY`.

**Impact:** High, potentially leading to unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, or disruption of application functionality due to the configuration loaded by `rc`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Avoid relying solely on environment variables for critical security configurations that `rc` will load. Implement mechanisms to verify the source and integrity of environment variables if they are used for sensitive settings.
* **Users:** Secure the environment where the application runs. Limit access to modify environment variables that `rc` might read. Use secure methods for managing and injecting environment variables (e.g., secrets management tools).

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Injection/Modification](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_injectionmodification.md)

**Description:** Attackers gaining write access to configuration file locations can inject or modify settings, leading to various malicious outcomes.

**How `rc` Contributes:** `rc` loads configuration from files based on conventions and specified paths. This makes the integrity of these files crucial for the configurations `rc` will use.

**Example:** An attacker modifying `config/default.json` to change the database credentials could gain access to the application's database because `rc` will load these modified credentials.

**Impact:** Critical, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application, data breaches, or arbitrary code execution based on the malicious configuration loaded by `rc`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Implement appropriate file system permissions (e.g., using `chmod`) to restrict write access to configuration files that `rc` reads to only the necessary user or group. Store sensitive information securely (e.g., using encryption or secrets management) even before `rc` loads it.
* **Users:** Ensure proper file system security and restrict access to configuration directories that `rc` might access. Regularly audit configuration files for unauthorized changes that could be loaded by `rc`.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Path Traversal](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_path_traversal.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to specify configuration file paths (directly or indirectly), attackers might exploit path traversal vulnerabilities to access or modify unintended configuration files.

**How `rc` Contributes:** If the application uses user input to determine which configuration files `rc` loads, it creates an opportunity for path traversal, leading `rc` to load unexpected configurations.

**Example:** An attacker providing a path like `../other_config/sensitive.json` could cause `rc` to load a sensitive configuration file it was not intended to access, if the application logic allows for such path specification.

**Impact:** High, potentially leading to information disclosure, privilege escalation, or modification of critical application settings loaded by `rc`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Avoid allowing user input to directly determine configuration file paths that `rc` will load. If necessary, implement strict validation and sanitization of user-provided paths before using them with `rc`. Use whitelisting of allowed configuration file locations.
* **Users:** Be aware of the potential risks of providing file paths to applications and avoid providing paths to sensitive or unexpected locations that `rc` might then attempt to load.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting Configuration Merging and Precedence](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_configuration_merging_and_precedence.md)

**Description:** Attackers who understand `rc`'s configuration merging order can strategically inject malicious configurations in sources that have higher precedence, effectively overriding legitimate settings.

**How `rc` Contributes:** `rc`'s defined order of precedence for configuration sources creates opportunities for attackers to target specific sources for injection, knowing `rc` will prioritize them.

**Example:** Knowing that command-line arguments override environment variables and configuration files, an attacker might focus on injecting malicious values through command-line arguments if they can influence how the application is launched, ensuring `rc` loads their malicious values.

**Impact:** High, as attackers can selectively override critical settings that `rc` loads to achieve their goals.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Be aware of `rc`'s precedence rules and design the configuration loading process with security in mind. Clearly document the expected configuration sources and their precedence to avoid unintended overrides by `rc`. Consider using a single source of truth for critical configurations to minimize the impact of `rc`'s merging logic.
* **Users:** Understand the configuration loading mechanism of the application (including `rc`'s precedence) and be vigilant about potential injection points based on the precedence rules.
