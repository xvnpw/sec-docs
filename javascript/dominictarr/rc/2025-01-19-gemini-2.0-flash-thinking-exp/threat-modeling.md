# Threat Model Analysis for dominictarr/rc

## Threat: [Configuration Injection via Command-Line Arguments](./threats/configuration_injection_via_command-line_arguments.md)

**Description:** An attacker with control over the application's execution environment can supply malicious configuration values directly through command-line arguments when starting the application. `rc`'s core functionality is to parse these arguments and incorporate them into the application's configuration with high precedence. The attacker leverages `rc`'s argument parsing to inject malicious settings.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the server or within the application's context, leading to data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service. Unintended modification of application behavior, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized actions.

**Affected `rc` Component:** The core `rc` module's argument parsing logic, specifically how it processes `process.argv`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid directly accepting user-provided input as command-line arguments for the application.
* Implement strict validation and sanitization of any configuration values derived from command-line arguments *before* `rc` processes them, if possible, or immediately after.
* Restrict the ability to pass command-line arguments in production environments through process management tools or container configurations.

## Threat: [Configuration Injection via Environment Variables](./threats/configuration_injection_via_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** An attacker with control over the application's execution environment can set malicious environment variables that `rc` will interpret as configuration values. `rc`'s design includes reading and processing environment variables as a standard configuration source. The attacker exploits this built-in functionality of `rc` to inject malicious configurations.

**Impact:** Similar to command-line injection, this can lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service. It can also lead to subtle changes in application behavior that are difficult to trace.

**Affected `rc` Component:** The core `rc` module's environment variable processing logic, specifically how it accesses `process.env`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Limit access to the environment where the application runs.
* Avoid relying on environment variables for critical security-sensitive configurations that `rc` will directly process.
* Validate and sanitize configuration values obtained from environment variables *after* `rc` loads them, before they are used by the application.
* Implement secure environment variable management practices, potentially using secrets management tools that integrate *before* `rc`'s processing.

## Threat: [Configuration File Tampering](./threats/configuration_file_tampering.md)

**Description:** An attacker who gains unauthorized access to the application's file system can modify configuration files that `rc` is designed to load. `rc`'s core functionality involves searching for and parsing configuration files in various formats. The attacker directly targets `rc`'s file loading mechanism to inject malicious configurations.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution if the modified configuration leads to the execution of attacker-controlled code. Altered application behavior, potentially leading to data manipulation, unauthorized access, or denial of service.

**Affected `rc` Component:** The file loading mechanisms within the `rc` module, including the logic for searching and parsing configuration files in various formats (e.g., JSON, INI).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict file system permissions to prevent unauthorized access to configuration files that `rc` reads.
* Store sensitive configuration data in secure locations with restricted access, ideally outside of the direct reach of `rc`'s default search paths.
* Consider encrypting sensitive configuration files at rest.
* Implement integrity checks (e.g., checksums or digital signatures) for configuration files to detect unauthorized modifications *before* `rc` loads them.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_configuration.md)

**Description:** Configuration files or environment variables that `rc` processes might inadvertently contain sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, or private keys. `rc`'s role is to load and make these values accessible to the application. The threat arises from the way `rc` handles and exposes this potentially sensitive data.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to other systems or data breaches due to exposed credentials or keys.

**Affected `rc` Component:** The overall configuration loading process managed by `rc`, which makes the sensitive information accessible to the application.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in configuration files or environment variables that `rc` processes.
* Utilize secure secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to store and retrieve sensitive credentials, integrating these *before* `rc` is used to fetch configurations.
* If direct storage is unavoidable, encrypt sensitive data within configuration files at rest.
* Implement strict access controls to configuration files and the environment where environment variables are set.
* Regularly audit configuration sources for inadvertently stored sensitive information.
