## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious values for existing configuration keys](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_values_for_existing_configuration_keys.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker provides malicious input as command-line arguments for existing configuration keys that the application uses.
* **Impact:** This can alter the application's behavior, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other unintended consequences depending on how the configuration value is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Override existing environment variables used by rc](./attack_tree_paths/override_existing_environment_variables_used_by_rc.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker sets environment variables with the same names that `rc` uses to load configuration, overriding the intended values.
* **Impact:** This can manipulate critical application settings, potentially compromising security or functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce new environment variables that influence rc's behavior](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_new_environment_variables_that_influence_rc's_behavior.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker introduces new environment variables that match `rc`'s naming conventions (e.g., `NODE_CONFIG_DIR`), causing `rc` to load malicious configurations from unexpected locations.
* **Impact:** This can lead to the application loading and using attacker-controlled configuration files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly edit configuration files (if accessible)](./attack_tree_paths/directly_edit_configuration_files__if_accessible_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains direct access to the server's file system (e.g., through compromised credentials or a vulnerability) and modifies existing configuration files.
* **Impact:** This grants the attacker full control over the application's configuration, allowing them to make arbitrary changes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Create files in expected configuration directories](./attack_tree_paths/create_files_in_expected_configuration_directories.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker gains write access to the directories where `rc` expects to find configuration files and creates malicious configuration files.
* **Impact:** This allows the attacker to inject malicious configurations that `rc` will load and the application will use.

## Attack Tree Path: [JavaScript code injection (if application uses `eval` or similar on config values)](./attack_tree_paths/javascript_code_injection__if_application_uses__eval__or_similar_on_config_values_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into configuration values that the application then executes using functions like `eval`.
* **Impact:** This results in arbitrary code execution within the application's context, allowing the attacker to perform any action the application can.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command injection (if configuration values are used in system commands)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection__if_configuration_values_are_used_in_system_commands_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker injects malicious commands into configuration values that are subsequently used in system calls or commands executed by the application.
* **Impact:** This results in arbitrary command execution on the server, allowing the attacker to control the underlying system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Disable security features](./attack_tree_paths/disable_security_features.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates configuration values that control security features, effectively disabling them.
* **Impact:** This weakens the application's security posture, making it more vulnerable to other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Redirect to malicious resources](./attack_tree_paths/redirect_to_malicious_resources.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker alters configuration values that control URLs or file paths, redirecting users or the application itself to malicious resources.
* **Impact:** This can lead to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or other forms of exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Expose sensitive information](./attack_tree_paths/expose_sensitive_information.md)

* **Attack Vector:** An attacker manipulates configuration values to reveal sensitive information that was not intended to be exposed.
* **Impact:** This can lead to data breaches and compromise confidential information.
