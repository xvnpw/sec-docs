# Attack Surface Analysis for dominictarr/rc

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Injection/Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_injectionmanipulation.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can inject or modify configuration settings by writing to files that `rc` reads from.
    * **How `rc` Contributes:** `rc`'s core functionality is to load configuration from various file locations based on a predefined hierarchy. This makes the application vulnerable if these locations are writable by an attacker.
    * **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the application's configuration directory (e.g., `~/.myapprc`) and adds a malicious configuration setting that executes arbitrary code upon application startup or during a specific function call that reads this configuration.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution, credential theft (if database credentials or API keys are stored in configuration), denial of service by modifying critical settings.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Ensure configuration file directories have restricted write permissions, only allowing the application owner or a dedicated service account to modify them.
        * Implement file integrity monitoring to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files.
        * Consider storing sensitive configuration data in secure vaults or environment variables with restricted access rather than directly in files.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_manipulation.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can inject or modify configuration settings by manipulating environment variables that `rc` reads.
    * **How `rc` Contributes:** `rc` is designed to read configuration from environment variables prefixed with the application name. This makes the application vulnerable if the environment where it runs is compromised.
    * **Example:** In a containerized environment, an attacker gains control over the container's environment variables and sets `MYAPP_API_KEY` to a value they control, potentially redirecting API calls to a malicious server.
    * **Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, redirection of application behavior, potential for further exploitation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Run applications in isolated environments with restricted access to modify environment variables.
        * Avoid storing highly sensitive information directly in environment variables if possible. Consider using secrets management solutions.
        * Implement monitoring for unexpected changes in environment variables.

## Attack Surface: [File Path Traversal via Configuration Values](./attack_surfaces/file_path_traversal_via_configuration_values.md)

* **Description:** Attackers can manipulate configuration values that are used to construct file paths, potentially accessing sensitive files outside the intended scope.
    * **How `rc` Contributes:** If configuration values loaded by `rc` are used to dynamically construct file paths within the application, an attacker controlling these values can inject path traversal sequences.
    * **Example:** A configuration setting `plugin_path` is loaded by `rc`, and the application uses this value to load plugins. An attacker modifies this setting to `../../../../etc/passwd`, potentially allowing the application to attempt to load and potentially expose the contents of this sensitive file.
    * **Impact:**  Information disclosure, access to sensitive system files, potential for further exploitation based on the exposed information.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Never directly use configuration values in file path construction without rigorous sanitization and validation.
        * Use absolute paths or carefully constructed relative paths within a defined and restricted directory.
        * Implement checks to ensure that resolved file paths remain within the expected boundaries.
