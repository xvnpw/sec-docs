# Attack Surface Analysis for dominictarr/rc

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Injection and Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_injection_and_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject or modify application configuration by writing to configuration files that `rc` automatically loads from predictable file system locations.
*   **`rc` Contribution:** `rc`'s core design is to search for and load configuration files from a predefined set of directories (e.g., `/etc`, `$HOME`, current directory, `config/`). This broad search path directly creates the attack surface by providing numerous potential injection points across the file system.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to a user's home directory. They create a `.myapprc` file containing a malicious configuration that redirects application logs to a publicly accessible location, exposing sensitive information.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure (High):** Exposing sensitive data through manipulated logging or other configuration-driven features.
    *   **Denial of Service (High):** Overloading resources or causing application crashes by injecting resource-intensive or invalid configurations.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Context Dependent, Potentially Critical):** In scenarios where configuration controls access rights or application behavior in a privileged context, manipulation could lead to privilege escalation.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (Indirect, Potentially Critical):** If the application unsafely uses configuration values (loaded by `rc`) to execute commands or perform other dangerous operations, file injection can become a vector for RCE.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on application's configuration usage and environment)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Input Validation (Critical):**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* configuration values loaded by `rc` before use. Treat all configuration data as untrusted input.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (High):** Run the application with minimal file system permissions to limit the impact of write vulnerabilities.
    *   **Users/System Administrators:**
        *   **Restrict Write Access (Critical):** Secure file permissions on directories searched by `rc` (especially `/etc`, `$HOME`, application directories) to prevent unauthorized modification.

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Injection and Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_injection_and_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject or modify application configuration by manipulating environment variables that `rc` reads for configuration.
*   **`rc` Contribution:** `rc` is explicitly designed to read configuration from environment variables prefixed with the application name or common prefixes like `NODE_`. This direct integration with environment variables makes them a readily available attack vector if the environment is not strictly controlled.
*   **Example:** In a shared hosting environment, an attacker might be able to set environment variables for processes they control. They set `MYAPP_ADMIN_PASSWORD=attacker_password`. If the application using `rc` uses `config.admin_password` for authentication, the attacker can gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High):** Bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms by manipulating configuration-driven credentials or access controls.
    *   **Data Breaches (Potentially Critical):** If environment variables control access to sensitive data or external services, manipulation can lead to data breaches.
    *   **Application Takeover (Potentially Critical):** In extreme cases, manipulating environment variables could allow an attacker to gain full control over the application's behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the sensitivity of configuration controlled by environment variables)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Input Validation (Critical):** Validate and sanitize configuration values from environment variables.
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Environment Variables (High):** For highly sensitive configuration like API keys or passwords, consider more secure secret management solutions instead of relying solely on environment variables.
    *   **Users/System Administrators:**
        *   **Secure Environment Management (Critical):**  Strictly control access to the environment where the application runs. Limit who can set environment variables, especially in shared environments.
        *   **Environment Isolation (High):** Use containerization or virtual machines to isolate application environments and limit the scope of environment variable manipulation.

## Attack Surface: [Command-Line Argument Injection and Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/command-line_argument_injection_and_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can directly influence application configuration by providing malicious or unexpected command-line arguments when the application is executed.
*   **`rc` Contribution:** `rc` parses command-line arguments and prioritizes them over other configuration sources (files, environment). This high precedence makes command-line arguments a potent injection point directly facilitated by `rc`'s design.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains limited execution privileges on a system. They execute the application with `myapp --admin-enabled=true`. If `config.admin_enabled` controls administrative features, the attacker can enable them through command-line injection, potentially gaining unauthorized control.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High):** Enabling administrative features or bypassing access controls through command-line configuration overrides.
    *   **Application Misconfiguration (High):**  Forcing the application into an insecure or unintended state by manipulating critical settings.
    *   **Potentially Command Injection (Indirect, Potentially Critical):** If the application unsafely uses command-line configuration values to construct shell commands, it can become a vector for command injection.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the criticality of configuration controlled by command-line arguments and application usage)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Input Validation (Critical):** Validate and sanitize configuration values from command-line arguments.
        *   **Document Expected Arguments (High):** Clearly document and enforce the expected command-line arguments and their valid values.
    *   **Users/System Administrators:**
        *   **Control Application Execution (Critical):** Restrict who can execute the application and control the command-line arguments passed to it, especially in production environments.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Execution) (High):** Run the application with minimal necessary command-line arguments.
