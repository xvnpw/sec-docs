# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for dominictarr/rc

## Mitigation Strategy: [Explicitly Define Configuration Sources](./mitigation_strategies/explicitly_define_configuration_sources.md)

## Description

*   **Step 1:** In your application's code, when initializing `rc`, use the function signature `rc(appname, defaults, argv, env, configFilesDirs)`.
*   **Step 2:** For `configFilesDirs`, provide an array of *specific* directory paths where your application should look for configuration files. Avoid using default paths or relying on `rc`'s automatic path discovery.
*   **Step 3:**  If possible, set `configFilesDirs` to only include application-specific directories within the project or a dedicated configuration directory outside of user-writable areas.
*   **Step 4:** Review and minimize the use of `argv` and `env` configuration sources if they are not strictly necessary for your application's configuration needs. If used, document clearly which arguments and environment variables are expected.

## List of Threats Mitigated

*   **Configuration File Injection/Override (High Severity):** Malicious actors could place rogue configuration files in default search paths (like user home directories or world-writable temp directories) that `rc` might pick up, overriding legitimate application settings. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.
*   **Path Traversal in Configuration Loading (Medium Severity):** If `rc` is configured to search in broad directories and the application logic doesn't properly validate configuration file paths, attackers might be able to trick `rc` into loading configuration files from unexpected locations outside the intended configuration directories.

## Impact

*   **Configuration File Injection/Override:** Significantly reduces the risk by limiting the attack surface. Attackers can no longer rely on default search paths to inject malicious configurations.
*   **Path Traversal in Configuration Loading:** Reduces the risk by controlling the directories `rc` searches, making it harder to exploit path traversal vulnerabilities during configuration loading.

## Currently Implemented

*   **Implemented in:** Backend service initialization scripts.
*   **Details:** The backend services currently use `rc('myapp', {}, process.argv, process.env, ['./config'])` to limit configuration files to the `./config` directory within the application deployment.

## Missing Implementation

*   **Missing in:**  No missing implementation identified in backend services. However, needs to be reviewed for any new services or components added in the future. Frontend build process might still rely on default `rc` behavior if configuration is handled there.
