# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a flexible and convenient configuration loading mechanism for Node.js applications.
  - Simplify configuration management across different environments (development, testing, production).
  - Enhance developer productivity by abstracting configuration loading logic.
  - Improve application maintainability and adaptability through externalized configuration.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of application misconfiguration due to incorrect or unexpected configuration values loaded by the library. This can lead to application malfunction or security vulnerabilities.
  - Risk of loading configuration from untrusted sources, potentially introducing malicious settings that compromise the application or system.
  - Supply chain risk associated with using a third-party library. If the library is compromised, applications using it could be affected.
  - Risk of exposing sensitive configuration data if not handled properly by the application using the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Dependency management using `npm` or `yarn` for installing and managing the `rc` library and its dependencies. Described in `package.json` and lock files (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) of projects using `rc`.
  - security control: Input validation implemented by applications using `rc` to validate configuration values after they are loaded. Implemented within the application's code that consumes the configuration.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies of `rc`. Risk is mitigated by dependency updates and security audits, but not fully eliminated.
  - accepted risk: Misconfiguration by developers using `rc`. The library itself provides flexibility, but incorrect usage can lead to security issues.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement schema validation for configuration files used with `rc` to enforce expected structure and data types, reducing the risk of unexpected configuration values.
  - security control: Regularly audit dependencies of `rc` for known vulnerabilities using automated tools and manual reviews.
  - security control: Provide clear documentation and best practices for developers on securely using `rc`, including guidance on handling sensitive configuration data and avoiding loading configuration from untrusted sources.
  - security control: Encourage applications using `rc` to implement principle of least privilege when accessing configuration values, minimizing the impact of potential misconfigurations.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the `rc` library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the application that uses `rc` to load its configuration.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the `rc` library itself. Authorization decisions are made by the application based on the loaded configuration and user context.
  - Input Validation: Applications using `rc` must perform thorough input validation on configuration values loaded by `rc` to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity. This is critical as configuration can influence application behavior significantly.
  - Cryptography: The `rc` library itself does not directly handle cryptography. However, applications using `rc` might need to manage cryptographic keys or sensitive data within their configuration. Secure storage and handling of such data is the responsibility of the application, not `rc`. If sensitive data is part of the configuration, applications should use appropriate encryption and secure storage mechanisms, configured and managed independently of `rc`.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Application startup and initialization: Correct configuration is crucial for the application to start up properly and function as intended. Misconfiguration can lead to application failures or unexpected behavior.
  - Feature toggles and application behavior control: Configuration often dictates which features are enabled or disabled and how the application behaves in different environments. Incorrect configuration can lead to unintended feature activation or deactivation, impacting business functionality.
  - Security settings: Configuration can include security-related settings such as authentication methods, authorization policies, and encryption keys. Misconfiguration in these areas can directly lead to security vulnerabilities.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Configuration data itself: Configuration data can range in sensitivity. It may include:
    - Low sensitivity: Application settings that do not expose sensitive information (e.g., UI themes, logging levels).
    - Medium sensitivity: Internal application URLs, non-production database connection strings, API endpoint configurations.
    - High sensitivity: Production database credentials, API keys, secrets, encryption keys, certificates.
  - The sensitivity of configuration data depends heavily on the application and the specific configuration values. It is crucial to identify and classify configuration data based on its potential impact if compromised. Sensitive configuration data requires strong protection measures, such as encryption, secure storage, and access control.
