# Threat Model Analysis for dominictarr/rc

## Threat: [Configuration Injection and Override](./threats/configuration_injection_and_override.md)

**Description:** An attacker might manipulate application configuration by injecting or overriding configuration values. They exploit `rc`'s configuration precedence, targeting sources like command-line arguments, environment variables, or configuration files in predictable locations. The goal is to make malicious configuration values take precedence over intended secure settings, leveraging `rc`'s loading mechanism.
**Impact:** Application misconfiguration, bypassing security controls (authentication, authorization), privilege escalation, and potential data breaches due to exposed sensitive data or access to sensitive resources.
**Affected `rc` component:** Core `rc` module - configuration loading and merging logic, specifically the precedence mechanism.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Clearly define and document intended configuration sources and their precedence.
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all configuration values, especially from environment variables and user-controlled files.
*   Restrict `rc` configuration sources in production to trusted locations.
*   Enforce strong access controls on configuration files and environment variables.

## Threat: [Path Traversal and File Access Vulnerabilities via Configuration Files](./threats/path_traversal_and_file_access_vulnerabilities_via_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Attackers can exploit path traversal by injecting malicious path sequences into configuration values loaded by `rc`. If application code uses these configuration values to construct file paths without validation, attackers can gain unauthorized access to files or directories outside intended paths. `rc` facilitates loading these potentially malicious path values from configuration sources.
**Impact:** Unauthorized reading of sensitive server files, potential writing to arbitrary files, and potentially code execution when combined with other vulnerabilities.
**Affected `rc` component:** Indirectly `rc` - as it loads configuration values. Directly, application code using `rc` loaded configuration for file path construction without validation.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly validate and sanitize configuration values used for file paths to prevent path traversal (e.g., block `../`).
*   Use secure file path handling practices: absolute paths, canonicalization, chroot environments.
*   Apply least privilege to application file system access.

## Threat: [Command Injection Vulnerabilities via Configuration Values](./threats/command_injection_vulnerabilities_via_configuration_values.md)

**Description:** Attackers can inject malicious commands into configuration values loaded by `rc`. If application code uses these configuration values in shell commands or system calls without sanitization, attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the server. `rc` provides the mechanism to load these potentially dangerous values into the application.
**Impact:** Remote code execution, full system compromise, data breaches, data manipulation, and denial of service.
**Affected `rc` component:** Indirectly `rc` - as it loads configuration values. Directly, application code using `rc` loaded configuration in shell commands without sanitization.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using configuration values directly in shell commands.
*   Use parameterized commands or safer alternatives to shell execution.
*   Strictly validate and sanitize configuration values before using them in command execution contexts.
*   Implement least privilege for the application's execution environment.
