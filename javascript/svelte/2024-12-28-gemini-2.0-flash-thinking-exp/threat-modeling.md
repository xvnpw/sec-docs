### High and Critical Svelte-Specific Threats

Here are the high and critical security threats that directly involve the Svelte framework:

* **Threat:** Malicious Code Injection via Compiler Vulnerability
    * **Description:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability within the Svelte compiler itself. They craft malicious Svelte code that, when compiled, injects arbitrary JavaScript or manipulates the generated output in a harmful way. This could happen if the compiler has flaws in how it handles certain syntax or transformations.
    * **Impact:**  Full compromise of the client-side application, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious sites.
    * **Affected Svelte Component:** `@sveltejs/svelte` (the core compiler module).
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update the `@sveltejs/svelte` dependency to the latest stable version, as updates often include security fixes for compiler vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor Svelte's security advisories and community discussions for reports of compiler vulnerabilities.
        * In highly sensitive environments, consider static analysis of the generated JavaScript code as an additional layer of security.
