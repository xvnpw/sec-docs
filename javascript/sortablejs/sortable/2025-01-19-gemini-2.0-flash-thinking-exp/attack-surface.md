# Attack Surface Analysis for sortablejs/sortable

## Attack Surface: [Callback Injection via `onAdd`, `onUpdate`, `onRemove`, `onMove`](./attack_surfaces/callback_injection_via__onadd____onupdate____onremove____onmove_.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts or trigger unintended actions by manipulating data passed to SortableJS's callback functions.

**How Sortable Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SortableJS provides these callback functions to allow developers to react to sorting events. If the application doesn't sanitize or validate the data (e.g., the `item` element, `oldIndex`, `newIndex`) passed to these callbacks, it becomes a vector for attack.

**Example:** An attacker manipulates a dragged item's HTML to include a `<script>` tag. When the `onAdd` callback is triggered, the application might process this element without sanitization, leading to the execution of the malicious script.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, or arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust input validation and sanitization on data received within SortableJS callbacks (`onAdd`, `onUpdate`, etc.) before processing or rendering it.
* Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevent inline script execution.
* Avoid directly manipulating the DOM based on unsanitized data from these callbacks.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsanitized Data in Sortable Items](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_unsanitized_data_in_sortable_items.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts by manipulating the content of sortable items, which are then rendered by the application without proper encoding.

**How Sortable Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SortableJS manages the order of these items. If the application displays the content of these items without sanitization after sorting, it creates an XSS vulnerability.

**Example:** An attacker creates a sortable item with the name `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`. When this item is rendered by the application after sorting, the `onerror` event will trigger, executing the malicious script.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, or arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust output encoding (escaping) when rendering the content of sortable items. This ensures that HTML characters are treated as text and not executed as code.
* Sanitize user-provided content before it is added as a sortable item.

## Attack Surface: [Abuse of `setData` and `getData` for Storing Sensitive Information](./attack_surfaces/abuse_of__setdata__and__getdata__for_storing_sensitive_information.md)

**Description:** Developers might mistakenly use `setData` to store sensitive information directly on the DOM element, which can then be accessed by malicious scripts or through DOM inspection.

**How Sortable Contributes to the Attack Surface:** SortableJS provides `setData` and `getData` methods to associate data with sortable items. While convenient, this data is stored directly in the DOM.

**Example:** Developers use `setData('secretKey', 'sensitiveValue')` on a sortable item. An attacker can then use browser developer tools or malicious JavaScript to access this `secretKey` using `getData('secretKey')`.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid storing sensitive information directly in the DOM using `setData` or any other method.
* Store sensitive information securely on the server-side and associate it with sortable items using secure identifiers.
* If client-side storage is necessary, use secure browser storage mechanisms like `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` with appropriate encryption if needed.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in SortableJS](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_sortablejs.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist within the SortableJS library itself.

**How Sortable Contributes to the Attack Surface:** By including and using the SortableJS library, the application inherits any vulnerabilities present in that library.

**Example:** A known XSS vulnerability is discovered in a specific version of SortableJS. Applications using this vulnerable version are then susceptible to this attack.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could include XSS, remote code execution, or other security breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the severity of the vulnerability (can be Critical or High).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update SortableJS to the latest stable version to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with SortableJS.
* Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to identify and manage dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
