# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sortablejs/sortable

## Mitigation Strategy: [Server-Side Validation of Order Changes (SortableJS Context)](./mitigation_strategies/server-side_validation_of_order_changes__sortablejs_context_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  SortableJS, being a client-side library, allows users to freely reorder items in the browser. After a user finishes sorting, the *new order* of item identifiers is typically sent to the server.
    2.  Crucially, *do not trust this client-provided order directly*.  On the server-side, upon receiving the order from the client (triggered by SortableJS events like `onEnd`), retrieve the *original, server-authoritative* list of item identifiers.
    3.  Compare the received order with the original server-side order. Validate that the client has only *reordered* existing items and has not introduced new, unauthorized identifiers or removed existing ones.
    4.  Specifically check:
        *   All identifiers in the client-provided order are present in the original server-side list.
        *   No identifiers are present in the client-provided order that were *not* in the original server-side list.
        *   The number of identifiers in both lists is the same.
    5.  If validation fails (meaning the client has potentially manipulated the order in an unauthorized way, beyond simple reordering), reject the update request. Do not persist the potentially tampered order.
    6.  Only if validation succeeds, update the server-side representation of the item order based on the client-provided sequence.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Data Manipulation via SortableJS (High Severity):**  Directly mitigates the threat of users manipulating the order in unintended or malicious ways using the client-side SortableJS interface and its events.  Without server-side validation, a malicious user could potentially inject, remove, or duplicate items by manipulating the data sent from SortableJS.
    *   **Data Integrity Violation due to SortableJS Usage (High Severity):** Ensures that the server-side data order remains consistent with authorized actions and is not corrupted by potentially malicious or erroneous client-side sort operations facilitated by SortableJS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side Data Manipulation via SortableJS:** Significantly reduces the risk. Server-side validation, triggered by SortableJS actions, becomes the definitive check against unauthorized manipulation originating from the client-side sorting interface.
    *   **Data Integrity Violation due to SortableJS Usage:** Significantly reduces the risk. By validating the order received from the client against the server's source of truth after a SortableJS interaction, data integrity is strongly maintained in the context of sortable lists.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, implemented in the backend API endpoints that are triggered by SortableJS `onEnd` events on the frontend. Validation logic is present in the `updateSortedItemList` function in the `ListController.java` file, specifically designed to handle order updates coming from the SortableJS interface.

*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation identified in areas where SortableJS is used to reorder lists. Validation is consistently applied to all features utilizing SortableJS for ordering.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Authorization and Access Control (Relevant to SortableJS Actions)](./mitigation_strategies/authorization_and_access_control__relevant_to_sortablejs_actions_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  SortableJS interactions trigger actions that can modify data order on the server. Before processing any server-side request initiated by a SortableJS sort operation (e.g., when handling the data sent after `onEnd`), identify the user who initiated the action.
    2.  Verify that this user has the *necessary authorization* to modify the order of the *specific list or items* being sorted. This is crucial because SortableJS itself doesn't handle permissions â€“ it's purely a UI library.
    3.  Implement server-side authorization checks *specifically for sort operations*. This might involve checking permissions based on the list being modified, the user's role, or other relevant attributes.
    4.  These authorization checks should be performed at the API endpoint level that handles the data sent from SortableJS after a sort operation.
    5.  If the user is not authorized to reorder the list they are attempting to modify via SortableJS, reject the request and return an appropriate authorization error (e.g., 403 Forbidden).  The client-side SortableJS action should not result in a server-side change if authorization fails.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification via SortableJS (High Severity):** Prevents users who should not have permission to reorder certain lists from doing so through the SortableJS interface. SortableJS itself provides the *mechanism* for reordering, but authorization controls *who* can use this mechanism for which data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation related to SortableJS Actions (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting vulnerabilities (not in SortableJS itself, but in the application logic around it) to gain unauthorized access and manipulate data order using the SortableJS functionality.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Data Modification via SortableJS:** Significantly reduces the risk. Authorization, enforced server-side after SortableJS actions, ensures that only permitted users can effectively utilize SortableJS to change data order.
    *   **Privilege Escalation related to SortableJS Actions:** Partially reduces the risk. Proper authorization in the context of SortableJS actions is a key part of a broader strategy to prevent privilege escalation attempts that might involve manipulating UI elements like sortable lists.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, authorization checks are implemented using JWT-based authentication and RBAC in the backend API. Endpoints specifically handling sort operations triggered by SortableJS are protected by authorization middleware that verifies user permissions to modify the relevant lists before processing the order update.

*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation identified in terms of basic authorization for SortableJS-related actions. However, consider reviewing if the current authorization granularity is sufficient for all use cases involving SortableJS. If more fine-grained permissions are needed for different types of sortable lists or items, attribute-based access control could be explored for future enhancements.
