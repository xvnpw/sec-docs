# Threat Model Analysis for sortablejs/sortable

## Threat: [Client-Side Data Tampering for Malicious Input](./threats/client-side_data_tampering_for_malicious_input.md)

**Description:** An attacker, through browser developer tools or client-side script injection, modifies data attributes associated with SortableJS elements or the SortableJS configuration. This can be used to inject malicious payloads into data attributes that are later processed by SortableJS callbacks or server-side logic. For example, an attacker might inject a script into a data attribute that is then used in an `onAdd` callback to dynamically render HTML, leading to XSS.  They could also alter configuration options to bypass client-side security checks or trigger unintended actions.
**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) leading to account compromise, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious sites. Bypassing client-side security checks, potentially leading to unauthorized actions or data manipulation.
**Sortable Component Affected:** Data attributes of SortableJS elements, `Sortable` configuration options, SortableJS callbacks (`onAdd`, `onUpdate`, etc.).
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Server-Side Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize *all* data received from the client, including the sorted order and any associated data attributes, before processing it on the server.
*   **Client-Side Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Sanitize and encode any user-provided data or data attributes *before* using them in SortableJS callbacks or rendering them on the page. Avoid directly using data attributes in a way that could lead to script execution.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict script sources and mitigate XSS risks. Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` directives, especially if dynamic content generation based on data attributes is involved.
*   **Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Locally Hosted SortableJS:** If hosting SortableJS locally, use SRI to ensure the integrity of the library file and prevent tampering.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Misconfigured Callbacks](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_misconfigured_callbacks.md)

**Description:**  If SortableJS callbacks (`onAdd`, `onUpdate`, etc.) are implemented without proper security considerations, they can become a vector for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. This occurs when callbacks dynamically generate HTML content based on unsanitized user input or data attributes and inject it into the DOM. An attacker can craft malicious data that, when processed by a vulnerable callback, injects and executes arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to full account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious websites, and other malicious actions performed in the context of the user's session.
**Sortable Component Affected:** `Sortable` configuration options, SortableJS callbacks (`onAdd`, `onUpdate`, etc.), client-side DOM manipulation within callbacks.
**Risk Severity:** High
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Avoid Dynamic HTML Generation in Callbacks with User Data:**  Minimize or eliminate dynamic HTML generation within SortableJS callbacks, especially when dealing with user-controlled data or data attributes.
*   **Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** If dynamic HTML generation is necessary, strictly sanitize and encode all user-provided data *before* inserting it into the DOM within callbacks. Use appropriate encoding functions for the context (e.g., HTML entity encoding).
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to further mitigate XSS risks. Restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` directives.
*   **Secure Coding Practices for Callbacks:** Treat all data processed within callbacks as potentially untrusted. Follow secure coding principles to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
