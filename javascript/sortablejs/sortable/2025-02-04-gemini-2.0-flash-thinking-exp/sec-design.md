# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is a Javascript library called SortableJS, designed to enable drag-and-drop functionality in web applications. The primary business goal for projects utilizing SortableJS is to enhance user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) by providing intuitive and interactive elements for list reordering and data manipulation directly within the browser. This leads to improved user satisfaction and potentially increased efficiency in web applications.

Business Priorities:
- Enhance User Experience: Provide a smooth and intuitive drag-and-drop interface for web applications.
- Ease of Integration: Ensure the library is easy to integrate into various Javascript frameworks and web projects.
- Performance: Maintain high performance and responsiveness to ensure a seamless user experience.
- Stability and Reliability: Offer a stable and reliable library that minimizes bugs and compatibility issues.
- Maintainability: Ensure the library is well-maintained and updated to address issues and incorporate new features.

Business Risks:
- Security Vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited in applications using it, leading to potential security breaches.
- Performance Issues:  Poorly performing library could negatively impact the user experience of applications using it.
- Compatibility Problems:  Incompatibility with different browsers or Javascript frameworks could limit the library's usability.
- Lack of Maintenance:  If the library is not actively maintained, bugs and security issues may not be addressed, and it may become outdated.
- Supply Chain Risks:  Compromised dependencies or build process could introduce malicious code into the library.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open Source Community Review: The library is open source, allowing for community review of the code, which can help identify potential issues. Implemented through GitHub repository and public contributions.
- security control: Public Issue Tracking:  GitHub issue tracker allows users to report bugs and potential security vulnerabilities. Implemented through GitHub repository issue tracker.
- accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security Contributions: Security relies on the vigilance and contributions of the open-source community, which may not be as comprehensive as dedicated security testing.
- accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities:  The library may depend on other Javascript packages, which could have their own vulnerabilities.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Dependency Scanning: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in the library's dependencies.
- security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the development process to automatically scan the codebase for potential security flaws.
- security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct periodic security audits, potentially by external security experts, to identify and address vulnerabilities.
- security control: Security Awareness Training for Contributors: Provide security awareness training for contributors to promote secure coding practices.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable to this Javascript library itself. Authentication is the responsibility of the web application using SortableJS.
- Authorization: Not applicable to this Javascript library itself. Authorization is the responsibility of the web application using SortableJS.
- Input Validation: While SortableJS primarily handles UI events (drag and drop), applications using it should perform input validation on any data manipulated or submitted based on user interactions with the library. Input validation should be implemented in the application code that uses SortableJS.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to this Javascript library. Cryptography requirements would be determined by the web application using SortableJS if it handles sensitive data.

Build Process Description:
The build process for SortableJS likely involves the following steps, focusing on security aspects:

1. Code Development and Commit: Developers write code, commit changes, and push them to the Source Code Repository (GitHub).
2. CI/CD Trigger: Code changes pushed to the repository trigger the CI/CD system (e.g., GitHub Actions).
3. Build, Test, Lint, Scan: The CI/CD pipeline performs the following actions:
    - Build: Compiles and bundles the Javascript code.
    - Test: Executes automated unit and integration tests.
    - Lint: Runs linters to enforce code style and identify potential code quality issues.
    - Scan: Performs security scans, including:
        - security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Scans the source code for potential vulnerabilities.
        - security control: Dependency Scanning: Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
4. Build Artifacts: If the build, tests, and scans are successful, build artifacts (Javascript files) are created.
5. Publish to CDN & NPM Registry: The build artifacts are published to:
    - CDN: For direct delivery to web browsers.
    - NPM Registry: For developers to install and manage as a dependency in their projects.
    - security control: Signing of published artifacts (e.g., NPM package signing) to ensure integrity and authenticity.

- security control: Code Signing: Signing of published artifacts ensures integrity and authenticity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
The critical business processes being protected are those of the web applications that utilize SortableJS. The library itself is a component that enhances UI/UX, and its failure or compromise could impact the functionality and user experience of these applications. The criticality depends on the specific application using SortableJS. For applications where UI/UX is crucial for user engagement, data manipulation, or critical workflows, SortableJS becomes a more critical component.

Data Sensitivity:
SortableJS itself does not directly handle sensitive data. However, web applications using SortableJS might use it to manipulate or display sensitive data. The sensitivity of the data being indirectly handled depends entirely on the application context. If an application uses SortableJS to reorder lists of financial transactions, personal information, or other sensitive data, then the security of SortableJS and its integration becomes relevant to protecting that sensitive data. The primary data to protect in the context of SortableJS itself is the integrity and availability of the library code to ensure applications using it function correctly and are not compromised by malicious modifications to the library.
