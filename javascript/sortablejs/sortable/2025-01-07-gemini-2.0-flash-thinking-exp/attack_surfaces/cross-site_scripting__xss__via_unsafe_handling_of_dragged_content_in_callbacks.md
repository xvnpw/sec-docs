            "Consider the typical workflow:\n"
            "1. A user (or potentially an attacker) has the ability to influence the content of an element "
            "   that can be dragged.\n"
            "2. The user drags this element.\n"
            "3. A SortableJS callback function (e.g., `onAdd`, `onUpdate`) is triggered.\n"
            "4. The developer's code within this callback accesses the dragged element (often via `evt.item`).\n"
            "5. **The critical point:** If the developer directly uses properties like `innerHTML` or `outerHTML` "
            "   to insert this content into the DOM *without sanitization*, any malicious scripts embedded "
            "   within the dragged element will be executed in the user's browser.\n\n"
            "This highlights the principle of **never trusting user-supplied data**, even if the 'user' in "
