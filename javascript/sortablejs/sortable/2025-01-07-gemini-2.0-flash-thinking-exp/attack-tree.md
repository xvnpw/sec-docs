# Attack Tree Analysis for sortablejs/sortable

Objective: To compromise an application utilizing the SortableJS library by exploiting vulnerabilities or weaknesses within SortableJS itself or its integration. (Focusing on high-risk areas)

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   **Introduce Malicious Content via SortableJS** (Critical Node)
    *   **Inject Malicious Payloads via Data Attributes** (High-Risk Path)
        *   Drag Elements with Crafted Data Attributes Containing XSS Payloads
    *   **Manipulate Displayed Content via Order** (High-Risk Path)
        *   Reorder Elements to Mislead Users (e.g., hide important warnings, promote malicious content)
    *   **Exploit Callback Functions** (Critical Node)
        *   Intercept or Manipulate Callback Data to Inject Scripts or Trigger Malicious Actions
*   Cause Denial of Service/Disruption via SortableJS
    *   **Server-Side Overload (Indirect)** (High-Risk Path)
        *   Generate Excessive Update Requests by Rapidly Reordering Elements
*   **Exploit SortableJS Configuration Weaknesses** (Critical Node)
    *   **Insecure Default Options** (High-Risk Path)
        *   Leverage Default Settings that Allow Unintended Behavior (e.g., cross-group dragging when not desired)
    *   **Missing Security Configurations** (High-Risk Path)
        *   Exploit Lack of Input Validation on Data Associated with Sortable Elements

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Content via SortableJS (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_content_via_sortablejs__critical_node_.md)

This branch represents a significant risk because successful injection of malicious content can lead to severe consequences, including compromising user sessions and gaining unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Payloads via Data Attributes (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_payloads_via_data_attributes__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application renders data attributes associated with the draggable elements without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious scripts (XSS) by crafting elements with malicious data attributes and then dragging them. When these attributes are rendered, the script could execute.
**Likelihood:** Medium to High
**Impact:** High
**Effort:** Medium
**Skill Level:** Medium
**Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Displayed Content via Order (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_displayed_content_via_order__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** By strategically reordering elements, an attacker can manipulate the user's perception of the content. This could involve hiding important warnings, promoting malicious links by placing them at the top, or creating misleading interfaces.
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium
**Effort:** Low
**Skill Level:** Low
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Callback Functions (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_callback_functions__critical_node_.md)

**Attack Vector:** SortableJS provides callback functions (e.g., `onAdd`, `onUpdate`) that are triggered during drag-and-drop operations. If the application doesn't properly handle data passed to or from these callbacks, an attacker might intercept or manipulate this data to inject scripts or trigger unintended actions.
**Likelihood:** Low to Medium
**Impact:** Medium to High
**Effort:** Medium to High
**Skill Level:** Medium to High
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service/Disruption via SortableJS](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_servicedisruption_via_sortablejs.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Overload (Indirect) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_overload__indirect___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application sends an update request to the server after each drag-and-drop operation, a rapid series of reordering actions could generate a large number of requests, potentially overloading the server.
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Medium to High
**Effort:** Low to Medium
**Skill Level:** Low to Medium
**Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit SortableJS Configuration Weaknesses (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_sortablejs_configuration_weaknesses__critical_node_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Default Options (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_default_options__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** SortableJS might have default options that, if left unchanged, could introduce vulnerabilities. For example, allowing dragging between different groups when it's not intended could lead to unauthorized data manipulation or access.
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Low to Medium
**Effort:** Low
**Skill Level:** Low to Medium
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium to High

## Attack Tree Path: [Missing Security Configurations (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/missing_security_configurations__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Failing to implement proper input validation on data associated with Sortable elements (e.g., IDs, data attributes) could allow attackers to manipulate this data and potentially exploit vulnerabilities in the application's backend when the reordered data is processed.
**Likelihood:** Medium to High
**Impact:** Medium to High
**Effort:** Low to Medium
**Skill Level:** Medium
**Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
