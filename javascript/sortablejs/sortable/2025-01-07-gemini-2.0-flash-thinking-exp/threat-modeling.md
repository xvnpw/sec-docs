# Threat Model Analysis for sortablejs/sortable

## Threat: [Malicious Reordering and Data Corruption](./threats/malicious_reordering_and_data_corruption.md)

**Description:** An attacker might manipulate the drag-and-drop interface provided by SortableJS to reorder elements in a way that causes incorrect data processing or unintended consequences. They could drag critical items to incorrect positions, disrupting workflows or altering the intended logical flow of the application.

**Impact:** Data corruption, business logic errors leading to incorrect application behavior, potential denial of service if the application's functionality is heavily dependent on the order of elements, or unauthorized actions if the order influences permissions.

**Affected Component:** Core drag-and-drop functionality, specifically the `toArray()` method or event handlers that capture the final order.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement server-side validation of the final order after any sort operation.
* Enforce authorization checks based on the validated final order before processing any data.
* Utilize unique identifiers for each sortable item and validate these identifiers on the server-side to ensure data integrity.

## Threat: [Injection via `onAdd`, `onUpdate`, or other callbacks](./threats/injection_via__onadd____onupdate___or_other_callbacks.md)

**Description:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts or HTML into the data associated with draggable elements. When these elements are moved or added, the application's callback functions (like `onAdd` or `onUpdate`) might process this unsanitized data, potentially rendering it in the DOM.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other client-side attacks.

**Affected Component:** Event handlers and callback functions (`onAdd`, `onUpdate`, etc.) defined in the SortableJS options.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly sanitize and validate any data received in SortableJS callback functions before using it to update the DOM or sending it to the server.
* Utilize appropriate output encoding techniques when rendering data received from callbacks to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
