# Attack Surface Analysis for sortablejs/sortable

## Attack Surface: [Altered Item Order](./attack_surfaces/altered_item_order.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious manipulation of the order of sortable elements to achieve an unauthorized outcome.
*   **SortableJS Contribution:** SortableJS *is* the mechanism that enables client-side reordering, making this attack directly dependent on its functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker reorders steps in a workflow to bypass a required approval step, or changes the priority of tasks to gain an unfair advantage, or modifies the order of financial transactions.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized actions, incorrect processing, data corruption, potential financial loss, or privilege escalation.  The impact is directly tied to how the application uses the order.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Critical if order affects security-critical operations or financial data).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Order Validation:** The server *must* independently verify the received order against a known-good state or a set of business rules.  *Never* trust the client-provided order.
    *   **Cryptographic Hashing (Optional, but Recommended):** Hash the initial, valid order and compare it to a hash of the received order to detect any unauthorized changes.
    *   **Auditing:** Log all order changes, including the user, timestamp, and before/after states.

## Attack Surface: [Injection of Invalid Data (via Data Attributes)](./attack_surfaces/injection_of_invalid_data__via_data_attributes_.md)

*   **Description:** Modification of data attributes associated with sortable elements to inject malicious values.
*   **SortableJS Contribution:** SortableJS allows elements to have data attributes, and these attributes are transmitted during drag-and-drop operations.  The library itself doesn't validate these attributes, making it a conduit for this attack.
*   **Example:** An attacker changes a `data-id` attribute to point to a different, unauthorized resource, or injects JavaScript code into a `data-description` attribute that is later rendered without sanitization (leading to XSS).
*   **Impact:** Indirect XSS, unauthorized access to resources, data corruption, potential for code execution (if XSS is successful).
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (XSS is typically High; unauthorized resource access can be Critical).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Data Attribute Whitelisting:** The server should *only* accept a predefined, strictly limited set of data attributes.
    *   **Data Attribute Validation:**  Rigorously validate the *content* of *each* allowed data attribute (type, length, format, allowed values).
    *   **Input Sanitization (for Rendering):** If data attributes are ever rendered back to the user, use proper output encoding/sanitization to prevent XSS. This is crucial.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use a strong CSP to restrict the execution of inline scripts, significantly mitigating the impact of XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Event Handler Exploitation (Indirect XSS)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_event_handler_exploitation__indirect_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into SortableJS event handlers.
*   **SortableJS Contribution:** SortableJS *provides* the event system (`onAdd`, `onUpdate`, `onRemove`, etc.) that allows developers to attach JavaScript code.  This event system is the direct vector for this attack.
*   **Example:** If the application dynamically generates event handler code based on user input *without any sanitization*, an attacker could inject malicious script (e.g., `<div ondrag="alert('XSS'); //maliciousCode()">`).
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Event Handlers:**  *Strongly* prefer static event handlers.  Dynamic generation is extremely risky.
    *   **Extremely Rigorous Input Sanitization (If Unavoidable):** If dynamic event handlers are *absolutely* necessary, use a robust sanitization library and a very strict whitelist of allowed characters.  This is a very high-risk approach and should be avoided if at all possible.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  A strong CSP is *essential* to prevent the execution of inline scripts, significantly mitigating the risk of XSS. This is the most important mitigation for this attack.
