# Attack Tree Analysis for sortablejs/sortable

Objective: Manipulate Application State/Data via SortableJS

## Attack Tree Visualization

*   **1. Abuse Event Handling**

    *   **1.1 Inject Malicious Event Handlers**

        *   **1.1.1 Overwrite Existing Handler with Malicious Code:**

            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Rationale:** This is a classic XSS attack, but specifically targeting SortableJS event handlers.  If the application dynamically constructs event handler code using user-supplied input without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript.  This is a common vulnerability pattern in web applications, making it relatively likely if input validation is weak.  The impact is high because the attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or modifying the page content.  The effort is low because the attacker only needs to find a way to inject the malicious code into the event handler.  The skill level is intermediate because the attacker needs to understand JavaScript and how to craft XSS payloads.  Detection difficulty is medium because while standard XSS detection tools might catch some instances, a cleverly crafted payload might bypass them, especially if it's specific to the application's logic.

        *   **1.1.2 Hijack Existing Handler to Execute Arbitrary Code:**

            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Medium
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Rationale:** This attack leverages vulnerabilities in how the application *uses* the data provided by SortableJS events.  Even if the event handler itself isn't directly overwritten, if the application uses event data (like `event.item.innerHTML`) in an unsafe way (e.g., directly inserting it into the DOM using `innerHTML` without sanitization), an attacker can inject malicious code.  The likelihood is medium because it depends on the application's specific implementation.  The impact is high, similar to 1.1.1, as it allows for arbitrary code execution.  The effort is medium because the attacker needs to understand the application's event handling logic to craft a suitable payload.  The skill level is intermediate, requiring knowledge of JavaScript and DOM manipulation. Detection difficulty is medium, similar to 1.1.1.

*   **2. Exploit Configuration Options**

    *   **2.2 Inject XSS via Option Values**

        *   **2.2.1 `setData` Payload:**

            *   **Likelihood:** Medium
            *   **Impact:** High
            *   **Effort:** Low
            *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
            *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
            *   **Rationale:** The `setData` method allows setting arbitrary data on a dragged element.  If the application later retrieves this data and inserts it into the DOM without proper sanitization (e.g., using `innerHTML`), an attacker can inject an XSS payload.  The likelihood is medium because it depends on how the application uses the `setData` method.  The impact is high due to the potential for arbitrary code execution.  The effort is low, as crafting the payload is relatively straightforward.  The skill level is intermediate, requiring knowledge of XSS and how the application handles the data. Detection difficulty is medium, similar to other XSS vulnerabilities.
