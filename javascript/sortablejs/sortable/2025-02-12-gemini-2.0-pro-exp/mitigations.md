# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sortablejs/sortable

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Handling of `setData`](./mitigation_strategies/careful_handling_of__setdata_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Sensitive Data:** Do *not* store sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personal information) directly using SortableJS's `setData` method. This method is part of the SortableJS API and is used for drag-and-drop data transfer.
    2.  **Use Identifiers:** If data transfer between lists is required, use a unique, non-sensitive identifier (e.g., a database ID) instead of the actual data. Pass this identifier through `setData`.
    3.  **Server-Side Retrieval:** The receiving list's event handler (e.g., `onAdd`, which is a SortableJS event) should use this identifier to retrieve the full data from a secure source (typically the server) using an API call.  Do *not* directly use the data from `setData` in the DOM without further processing.
    4.  **Sanitize/Escape (if unavoidable):** If you *absolutely must* use `setData` with user-provided content (strongly discouraged), sanitize and escape that content (using a library like DOMPurify) *before* setting it via `event.dataTransfer.setData()`. The receiving list's `onAdd` (or similar) event handler should *also* treat this data as untrusted and re-sanitize/escape it if it will be displayed in the DOM. This is a double layer of protection.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Data Exposure (Severity: Variable, depends on the data) - Sensitive data could be exposed if intercepted or if the browser's developer tools are used, as `setData` uses the browser's DataTransfer object.
    *   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Severity: High) - If user-provided, unsanitized data is transferred via `setData` and then rendered without escaping.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Data Exposure: Risk significantly reduced by avoiding sensitive data in `setData`.
    *   XSS: Risk significantly reduced if sanitization/escaping is implemented on both the sending (before `setData`) and receiving (in the event handler) ends.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Mostly implemented. We are using IDs to transfer data between lists, not the data itself.

*   **Missing Implementation:** No missing implementation identified. We should add a code comment to explicitly document this security consideration within the SortableJS event handlers.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict `handle` and `draggable` Selectors](./mitigation_strategies/restrict__handle__and__draggable__selectors.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze UI:** Carefully analyze the user interface and determine precisely which elements *need* to be draggable and which parts of those elements should act as drag handles. This is crucial for limiting the scope of SortableJS's influence.
    2.  **Use Specific Selectors:** When initializing SortableJS, use its configuration options:
        *   **`draggable`:** Use specific CSS class names or IDs to target only the intended draggable elements. Avoid using tag names or overly broad selectors.  Example: `draggable: ".sortable-item"` (good) vs. `draggable: "div"` (bad). This option directly controls which elements SortableJS will manage.
        *   **`handle`:** If only a specific part of the draggable element should initiate the drag, use a specific CSS selector for the handle. Example: `handle: ".drag-handle"` (good) vs. no handle (bad, as the entire element becomes the drag handle). This option further refines the interaction with SortableJS.
    3.  **Review Regularly:** Periodically review these selectors (within the SortableJS initialization code) to ensure they remain as restrictive as possible and haven't been accidentally broadened during UI updates.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Unexpected UI Behavior (Severity: Low to Medium) - Users might accidentally drag elements they shouldn't, leading to confusion or unintended data changes. This is directly related to how SortableJS is configured to interact with the DOM.
    *   **Threat:** Limited Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Low) - In some edge cases, overly broad selectors could make it easier for a malicious user to trigger a large number of unintended drag events, impacting SortableJS's performance.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unexpected UI Behavior: Risk significantly reduced.
    *   Limited DoS: Risk slightly reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. We are using class names for `draggable`, but the `handle` option is not used, making the entire item the drag handle.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `frontend/components/SortableList.js`:  Add a specific `handle` class to the item elements and configure SortableJS to use it within its initialization options.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Mitigate DoS via Excessive Operations (Event Handler Throttling/Debouncing)](./mitigation_strategies/mitigate_dos_via_excessive_operations__event_handler_throttlingdebouncing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Event Handlers:** Identify the SortableJS event handlers that are most likely to be triggered frequently (e.g., `onUpdate`, `onAdd`, `onRemove`, `onSort`). These are the functions *within your code* that are called by SortableJS.
    2.  **Implement Throttling/Debouncing:** Within these event handlers:
        *   **Throttling:** Use a throttling function (e.g., `_.throttle` from Lodash) to limit the *rate* at which the event handler's *logic* can be executed.  This ensures the core logic of the handler is called at most once every X milliseconds, even if SortableJS fires the event more frequently.
        *   **Debouncing:** Use a debouncing function (e.g., `_.debounce` from Lodash) to delay the execution of the event handler's *logic* until a certain amount of time has passed since the last event from SortableJS. This is useful for events that might fire rapidly in succession (e.g., during a fast drag).
    3.  **Busy Indicator:** While a sort operation is in progress (especially if it involves server communication triggered by a SortableJS event), display a visual "busy" indicator (e.g., a spinner) and disable further sorting interactions. This prevents the user from triggering multiple overlapping operations *through* SortableJS. This involves disabling SortableJS temporarily using its `option` method: `sortable.option("disabled", true);` and re-enabling it later: `sortable.option("disabled", false);`.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Threat:** Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Low to Medium) - A malicious user could trigger a large number of SortableJS events, making the application unresponsive in their browser due to excessive processing within the event handlers.
    *   **Threat:** Server-Side Denial of Service (DoS) (Severity: Low to Medium) - If SortableJS events trigger server requests, excessive events could overload the server. This mitigation helps reduce the number of events that reach the server-side logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Client-Side DoS: Risk significantly reduced with throttling/debouncing and a busy indicator (which temporarily disables SortableJS).
    *   Server-Side DoS: Risk reduced by limiting the frequency of server requests originating from SortableJS events.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `frontend/components/SortableList.js`: Implement throttling or debouncing for the `onUpdate`, `onAdd`, and `onRemove` event handlers (these are the functions called *by* SortableJS).
    *   `frontend/components/SortableList.js`: Add a busy indicator and disable sorting (using `sortable.option("disabled", true/false)`) during server communication initiated by SortableJS events.
