## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified that meet the specified criteria for inclusion.

**Reasoning:**

After reviewing the provided project files and applying the filtering criteria for external attacker scenarios targeting publicly available instances, no vulnerabilities ranked "high" or "critical" were found that are valid, not already mitigated, and not excluded by the given conditions.

Specifically:

* **Lack of Source Code:** The provided files are primarily documentation, configuration for CI/CD, and issue/PR templates. They do not include the source code of the VS Code extension itself.  Therefore, a detailed source code analysis to identify vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker is not possible based on these files alone.
* **Exclusion Criteria Applicability:**  Without source code, it's impossible to determine if vulnerabilities are caused by insecure coding patterns, missing documentation, or are DoS vulnerabilities within the extension's logic.
* **Inclusion Criteria Applicability:**  Similarly, without source code, it's impossible to validate the existence of high or critical vulnerabilities, their mitigation status, or to perform detailed source code analysis and security test case design as requested for inclusion.

**Conclusion:**

Based solely on the provided documentation and configuration files, there are no identifiable high or critical vulnerabilities that meet the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria for an external attacker targeting a publicly available instance. A comprehensive security assessment would require access to and analysis of the VS Code extension's source code.
