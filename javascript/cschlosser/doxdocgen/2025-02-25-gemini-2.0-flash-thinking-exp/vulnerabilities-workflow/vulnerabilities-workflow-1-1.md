## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance of the application could be identified.

The provided files consist of documentation (README, CHANGELOG), issue and pull request templates, and CI/CD workflow configurations. These files do not contain the application's source code itself, which is necessary to perform a comprehensive security vulnerability analysis.

VS Code extensions, like the one described, primarily operate within the VS Code environment.  Potential vulnerabilities would typically involve:
-  Local code execution within VS Code if the extension has flaws in its code processing or execution.
-  Unauthorized access to the user's workspace files if the extension improperly handles file system permissions or operations.

However, without access to the source code of the VS Code extension, it is impossible to identify specific vulnerabilities. The provided files do not reveal any inherent vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker targeting a publicly available instance.

Therefore, based solely on the provided documentation and configuration files, no vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria could be found.

It is recommended to provide the source code of the VS Code extension for a thorough security assessment.
