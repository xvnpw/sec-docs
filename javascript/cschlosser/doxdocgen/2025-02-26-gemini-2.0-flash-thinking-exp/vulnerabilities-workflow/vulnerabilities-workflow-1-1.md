Okay, I understand. You haven't provided a list of vulnerabilities yet.

As stated in your initial response, if no vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria are identified in the project files, or if after filtering, no vulnerabilities remain, then the vulnerability list should indeed be empty.

Therefore, based on the current information, the provided response:

```markdown
## Vulnerability List

There are no identified vulnerabilities in the provided project files that meet the criteria of being high rank, triggerable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance, and introduced by the project itself. The project is a VS Code extension for generating Doxygen comments, which operates within the secure environment of VS Code and does not have a publicly accessible instance in the traditional sense of a web application.

Therefore, the vulnerability list remains empty.
```

is correct and aligns with the instructions if no vulnerabilities meeting the criteria exist or have been provided yet.

**Please provide the list of vulnerabilities you are referring to, and I will then update it according to your instructions.**

Once you provide the list, I will:

1.  **Go through each vulnerability.**
2.  **Apply the exclusion and inclusion criteria.**
3.  **Format the valid vulnerabilities in markdown format** with the requested sections (vulnerability name, description, impact, rank, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, security test case).

**Looking forward to receiving the vulnerability list!**
