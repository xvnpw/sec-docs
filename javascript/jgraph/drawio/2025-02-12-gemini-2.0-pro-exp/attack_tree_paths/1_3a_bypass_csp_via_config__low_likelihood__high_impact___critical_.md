# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.3a Bypass CSP via Config

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the feasibility, impact, and mitigation strategies for the attack path "1.3a Bypass CSP via Config" within the context of an application utilizing the draw.io (jgraph/drawio) library.  We aim to move beyond the high-level description and delve into the specific technical details that would enable or prevent such an attack.  This includes identifying potential vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and concrete examples where possible.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to the development team to harden the application against this specific threat.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack path 1.3a, "Bypass CSP via Config."  We will consider:

*   **draw.io Configuration:**  We will examine the available configuration options within draw.io, focusing on those related to security, scripting, external resource loading, and any settings that could potentially influence the application's Content Security Policy (CSP).  This includes both client-side and server-side configurations if applicable.
*   **CSP Implementation:** We will analyze how the *hosting application* implements its CSP.  This is crucial because draw.io itself doesn't enforce a CSP; the embedding application does.  We'll look for common CSP misconfigurations or weaknesses that could be exploited in conjunction with a draw.io configuration vulnerability.
*   **JavaScript Injection Vectors:** We will explore how an attacker might attempt to inject malicious JavaScript through draw.io configuration settings, considering various input methods and potential sanitization bypasses.
*   **Impact on draw.io and the Host Application:** We will assess the potential consequences of a successful CSP bypass, including the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript, exfiltrate data, deface the application, and compromise user accounts.  We'll differentiate between impacts on the draw.io component itself and the broader application.
* **Mitigation and Detection:** We will explore the best practices to mitigate and detect this attack.

We will *not* cover:

*   Other attack tree paths.
*   General draw.io vulnerabilities unrelated to CSP bypass via configuration.
*   Vulnerabilities in the hosting application that are entirely independent of draw.io.

### 1.3 Methodology

This analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the publicly available source code of draw.io (from the provided GitHub repository: [https://github.com/jgraph/drawio](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio)) to identify configuration options and code paths that handle these options.  We will pay particular attention to how configuration values are used, especially in contexts related to:
    *   Loading external resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.).
    *   Generating HTML or JavaScript dynamically.
    *   Interacting with the DOM.
    *   Handling user input.
    *   Any code that explicitly mentions "CSP" or related terms.

2.  **Documentation Review:** We will thoroughly review the official draw.io documentation, including any available configuration guides, API references, and security advisories.  We will search for documented features or settings that could be misused to bypass CSP.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):**  We will set up a test environment with a basic application embedding draw.io.  We will then attempt to manipulate various configuration options to see if we can inject and execute JavaScript in violation of a deliberately strict CSP.  This will involve:
    *   Setting up a web server with a strong CSP header.
    *   Embedding draw.io in a simple HTML page.
    *   Experimenting with different configuration settings (passed via URL parameters, JavaScript API, or server-side configuration).
    *   Using browser developer tools to monitor network requests, console output, and the DOM for evidence of successful JavaScript injection.

4.  **Threat Modeling:** We will use threat modeling principles to identify potential attack scenarios and assess their likelihood and impact.  This will help us prioritize our investigation and focus on the most critical areas.

5.  **Vulnerability Research:** We will search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities or security research related to draw.io and CSP bypasses.  This will help us identify known attack vectors and learn from previous findings.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.3a

### 2.1 Potential Configuration Vulnerabilities

Based on initial code and documentation review, the following configuration options and areas within draw.io warrant further investigation:

*   **`math` Configuration:** draw.io supports mathematical typesetting using libraries like MathJax.  The `math` configuration option controls this feature.  Historically, MathJax has had vulnerabilities that could lead to XSS.  We need to determine:
    *   Which version of MathJax (or alternative) is used by draw.io.
    *   How the `math` configuration is handled and if it allows specifying arbitrary MathJax configuration options.
    *   If the hosting application's CSP allows loading scripts from the domains used by MathJax.  A misconfigured CSP here could be a significant weakness.

*   **`toolbarConfig` and `plugins`:** draw.io allows customizing the toolbar and adding plugins.  These configurations could potentially be abused to:
    *   Load malicious JavaScript files disguised as plugins.
    *   Inject malicious code into toolbar button actions or event handlers.
    *   Override default toolbar configurations to introduce unsafe behavior.

*   **`defaultCustomFonts` and `customFonts`:** These options control the fonts used in diagrams.  While less likely to be a direct vector for JavaScript injection, they could potentially be used in a "font smuggling" attack, where a malicious font file is loaded to exploit vulnerabilities in the browser's font rendering engine.  This is a lower-probability attack but should be considered.

*   **`urlParams`:** draw.io can be configured via URL parameters.  We need to examine how these parameters are parsed and handled, looking for any that could be used to inject code or override security settings.  This is a high-priority area for investigation.

*   **`embed` Mode and PostMessage API:** When draw.io is embedded in another application, it often communicates using the `postMessage` API.  We need to analyze how messages are handled, looking for any potential vulnerabilities that could allow an attacker to send malicious messages to draw.io and trigger unintended behavior.

*   **Server-Side Configuration (draw.io Desktop/draw.io for Confluence/Jira):** If the application uses a server-side component of draw.io (e.g., draw.io Desktop or the Confluence/Jira plugins), we need to examine the server-side configuration options as well.  These could include settings related to:
    *   File storage and access control.
    *   External resource loading.
    *   User authentication and authorization.

### 2.2 CSP Implementation Analysis (Hypothetical Examples)

The effectiveness of any draw.io configuration-based attack depends heavily on the hosting application's CSP.  Here are some examples of CSP configurations and how they might interact with potential draw.io vulnerabilities:

*   **Weak CSP:**
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
    ```
    This CSP is extremely weak.  `'unsafe-inline'` allows inline scripts, making XSS trivial.  Any draw.io configuration that allows injecting inline scripts would bypass this CSP.

*   **Slightly Stronger CSP:**
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://trusted-cdn.com;
    ```
    This CSP is better, but it still allows scripts from a specific CDN.  If an attacker can find a way to load a malicious script from `trusted-cdn.com` (e.g., by compromising the CDN or finding an existing vulnerable script on the CDN), they could bypass the CSP.  If draw.io's `plugins` configuration allows loading scripts from arbitrary URLs, and the application trusts `trusted-cdn.com`, this could be a viable attack vector.

*   **Strong CSP (with nonce):**
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'nonce-randomValue123';
    ```
    This CSP uses a nonce, which is a cryptographically secure random value that must be included in the `<script>` tag for the script to be executed.  This is a much stronger defense against XSS.  To bypass this CSP, an attacker would need to:
    *   Find a way to inject a `<script>` tag with the correct nonce.  This is very difficult unless there's a separate vulnerability that allows leaking the nonce.
    *   Find a way to execute code without using a `<script>` tag (e.g., through a data URI or a different type of injection).

*   **Strong CSP (with hash):**
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'sha256-hashOfScriptContent';
    ```
    This CSP uses a hash of the script content.  The browser will only execute the script if its hash matches the one specified in the CSP.  This is also a strong defense.  To bypass this, the attacker would need to find a way to inject a script with a pre-calculated hash that matches a known vulnerability.

* **CSP with MathJax:**
    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com;
    ```
    If the application uses MathJax and the CSP allows scripts from `cdnjs.cloudflare.com` (a common CDN for MathJax), the attacker might try to exploit a vulnerability in the specific version of MathJax loaded from that CDN.

### 2.3 JavaScript Injection Vectors

Given the potential configuration vulnerabilities and CSP scenarios, here are some specific JavaScript injection vectors an attacker might attempt:

1.  **MathJax Configuration Injection:**  If the `math` configuration allows specifying arbitrary MathJax options, the attacker could try to inject malicious JavaScript code into a MathJax configuration setting that is known to be vulnerable.

2.  **Plugin URL Manipulation:** If the `plugins` configuration allows specifying URLs for plugins, the attacker could provide a URL pointing to a malicious JavaScript file hosted on a server they control.  This would require the hosting application's CSP to allow loading scripts from that domain.

3.  **Toolbar Configuration Tampering:**  The attacker could try to modify the `toolbarConfig` to add a custom toolbar button with a malicious `onclick` handler or to override an existing button's behavior.

4.  **URL Parameter Injection:**  The attacker could try to inject malicious JavaScript code into URL parameters that are used to configure draw.io.  This would require finding a parameter that is not properly sanitized and is used in a context where JavaScript can be executed.

5.  **PostMessage API Exploitation:**  The attacker could try to send malicious messages to draw.io via the `postMessage` API, hoping to trigger a vulnerability that allows executing arbitrary code.

### 2.4 Impact Assessment

A successful CSP bypass via draw.io configuration would have a **high impact**.  The attacker could:

*   **Execute Arbitrary JavaScript:** This is the primary consequence.  The attacker could run any JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser session.
*   **Steal Sensitive Data:**  The attacker could access and exfiltrate cookies, local storage data, session tokens, and any other information available to JavaScript within the application's domain.
*   **Deface the Application:**  The attacker could modify the content of the page, inject malicious content, or redirect the user to a phishing site.
*   **Compromise User Accounts:**  The attacker could use stolen session tokens to impersonate the user and perform actions on their behalf.
*   **Bypass Other Security Controls:**  A CSP bypass often makes other XSS attacks easier, as it removes a major layer of defense.
* **Impact on draw.io:** The attacker could manipulate the diagram data, potentially inserting malicious content or altering existing diagrams.
* **Impact on Host Application:** The attacker could leverage the compromised draw.io instance to attack the host application, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or functionality beyond the draw.io component.

### 2.5 Mitigation Strategies

The following mitigation strategies are recommended to address the identified risks:

1.  **Strict CSP:** Implement a strict CSP that minimizes the use of `'unsafe-inline'`, `'unsafe-eval'`, and wildcard sources.  Use nonces or hashes for inline scripts whenever possible.  Carefully review the `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, `font-src`, `connect-src`, and `frame-src` directives to ensure they only allow necessary resources.

2.  **Configuration Validation and Sanitization:**  Thoroughly validate and sanitize all draw.io configuration options, especially those related to:
    *   `math` (ensure a secure version of MathJax is used and that arbitrary configuration options cannot be injected).
    *   `plugins` (restrict plugin loading to trusted sources or disable plugins entirely if not needed).
    *   `toolbarConfig` (validate and sanitize any custom toolbar configurations).
    *   `urlParams` (ensure all URL parameters are properly parsed, validated, and sanitized).
    *   `customFonts` and `defaultCustomFonts` (validate font URLs and consider using subresource integrity (SRI) to ensure font files haven't been tampered with).

3.  **Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation for any user-provided data that is used to generate draw.io diagrams or configure draw.io settings.  This includes data entered directly into draw.io, as well as data passed to draw.io from the hosting application.

4.  **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application, including the draw.io integration, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

5.  **Penetration Testing:** Perform regular penetration testing to simulate real-world attacks and identify weaknesses in the application's security posture.

6.  **Stay Up-to-Date:** Keep draw.io and all its dependencies (including MathJax, if used) up-to-date with the latest security patches.

7.  **Least Privilege:** Run draw.io with the least privilege necessary.  Avoid granting it unnecessary permissions or access to sensitive resources.

8.  **Content Security Policy Reporting:** Implement CSP reporting to monitor for any violations of the CSP.  This can help detect attempted attacks and identify areas where the CSP needs to be tightened. Use `report-uri` or `report-to` directives.

9. **Secure Communication:** If using `postMessage`, validate the origin of messages and sanitize the message data before processing it.

10. **Server-Side Hardening (if applicable):** If using a server-side component of draw.io, ensure that the server is properly configured and secured, with appropriate access controls, file permissions, and security updates.

### 2.6 Detection Strategies

*   **CSP Violation Reports:** Monitor CSP violation reports for any attempts to load resources from unauthorized sources or execute inline scripts.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Use a WAF to detect and block common XSS attack patterns.
*   **Intrusion Detection System (IDS):** Implement an IDS to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
*   **Log Monitoring:** Monitor application logs for any unusual activity, such as unexpected configuration changes or errors related to script execution.
*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Use a SIEM system to aggregate and analyze security logs from various sources, including the web server, application server, and WAF.
* **Regular Expression Monitoring:** Monitor configuration files for suspicious regular expressions that could be used for malicious purposes.

## 3. Conclusion

The attack path "1.3a Bypass CSP via Config" in draw.io presents a credible threat, particularly if the hosting application has a weak or misconfigured CSP.  The analysis highlights several potential configuration vulnerabilities within draw.io that could be exploited to inject malicious JavaScript.  By implementing the recommended mitigation and detection strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and improve the overall security of the application.  Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. The most important mitigation is a strong, well-configured CSP on the *hosting* application. draw.io itself does not enforce a CSP.
