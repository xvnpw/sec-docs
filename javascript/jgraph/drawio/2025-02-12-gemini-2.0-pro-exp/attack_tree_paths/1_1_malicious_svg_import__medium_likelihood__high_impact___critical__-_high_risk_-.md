Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis: Malicious SVG Import in draw.io

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the "Malicious SVG Import" attack path within the draw.io application.  This includes understanding the specific vulnerabilities that could be exploited, the potential impact of a successful attack, and the effectiveness of existing and potential mitigation strategies.  The ultimate goal is to provide actionable recommendations to reduce the risk associated with this attack vector.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploitation of draw.io's SVG import functionality.
*   **Vulnerability Type:**  Primarily Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities arising from improper handling of malicious JavaScript embedded within SVG files.  We will also consider other potential vulnerabilities related to SVG parsing, such as XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, if relevant.
*   **Target Application:**  The draw.io application, specifically referencing the codebase at [https://github.com/jgraph/drawio](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).
*   **Impact:**  Focus on the impact on the client-side (user's browser), including data exfiltration, session hijacking, and defacement.  We will briefly touch on potential server-side impacts if the compromised client can be used to escalate privileges.
* **Exclusions:** We will not deeply analyze other attack vectors (e.g., phishing, social engineering) that might lead to the *delivery* of a malicious SVG.  We are focused on the *handling* of the SVG once it's provided to the application.

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examine the draw.io source code (specifically the SVG import and parsing logic) to identify potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.  This will involve searching for:
    *   Inadequate input sanitization and validation.
    *   Use of vulnerable libraries or functions.
    *   Patterns known to be susceptible to XSS or XXE attacks.
    *   Areas where user-supplied data is directly used in DOM manipulation or `eval()`-like functions.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Investigate known vulnerabilities related to SVG parsing and XSS in general, and specifically in libraries used by draw.io (e.g., JavaScript XML/SVG parsers).  This will include searching CVE databases, security advisories, and research papers.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Testing):**  If feasible, perform dynamic testing by crafting malicious SVG files and observing the application's behavior.  This could involve:
    *   **Fuzzing:**  Providing a wide range of malformed and potentially malicious SVG inputs to identify unexpected behavior or crashes.
    *   **Manual Testing:**  Creating specific SVG payloads designed to trigger XSS or other vulnerabilities.
4.  **Threat Modeling:**  Consider various attack scenarios and how an attacker might exploit the identified vulnerabilities.  This will help assess the likelihood and impact of different attack variations.
5.  **Mitigation Analysis:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of existing security controls and propose additional mitigation strategies to reduce the risk.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1 Malicious SVG Import

### 2.1 Threat Model and Attack Scenarios

**Threat Actor:**  A remote attacker with the ability to provide an SVG file to a draw.io user.  This could be achieved through various means, including:

*   **Direct Upload:**  If draw.io allows users to upload SVG files directly (e.g., for sharing or collaboration), the attacker could upload a malicious file.
*   **Embedded Link:**  The attacker could host a malicious SVG file on a web server and trick the user into opening it within draw.io (e.g., via a phishing email or a malicious website).
*   **Data URI:** The attacker could embed the malicious SVG directly within a URL using a data URI scheme, bypassing file upload restrictions.
*   **Import from URL:** If draw.io supports importing diagrams from URLs, the attacker could provide a URL pointing to a malicious SVG.

**Attack Scenario (XSS):**

1.  **Delivery:** The attacker delivers a crafted SVG file containing malicious JavaScript within `<script>` tags, event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`), or other potentially executable contexts.  The SVG might use obfuscation techniques to evade simple detection.
2.  **Import:** The victim user imports the malicious SVG file into draw.io, either through direct upload, a link, or another import method.
3.  **Parsing:** draw.io's SVG parser processes the malicious file.  If the parser is vulnerable or the sanitization is insufficient, the malicious JavaScript is not neutralized.
4.  **Execution:** The malicious JavaScript executes within the context of the draw.io application in the user's browser.
5.  **Exploitation:** The attacker's script can now perform various actions, including:
    *   **Stealing Cookies:** Accessing and exfiltrating the user's session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    *   **Reading/Modifying Data:** Accessing and potentially modifying the user's diagrams or other data within draw.io.
    *   **Keylogging:**  Capturing the user's keystrokes.
    *   **Redirecting the User:**  Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   **Defacement:**  Altering the appearance of the draw.io interface.
    *   **Further Exploitation:**  Potentially using the compromised client to launch further attacks against the server or other users.

**Attack Scenario (XXE - Less Likely, but Worth Considering):**

1.  **Delivery:** The attacker delivers a crafted SVG file containing malicious XML External Entity (XXE) declarations.
2.  **Import:** The victim user imports the malicious SVG file.
3.  **Parsing:**  If the XML parser used by draw.io is configured to resolve external entities, it may attempt to fetch resources from attacker-controlled locations.
4.  **Exploitation:**  This could lead to:
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Reading local files on the server (if the parser runs server-side).
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Making requests to internal or external systems from the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Consuming server resources by fetching large or recursive entities.

### 2.2 Code Review Findings (Hypothetical - Requires Access to draw.io Codebase)

This section would contain specific code snippets and analysis based on the actual draw.io codebase.  Since I don't have direct access, I'll provide hypothetical examples and areas of concern:

**Areas of Concern:**

*   **`mxSvgCanvas2D.prototype.parseSvg` (or similar function):**  This is a likely entry point for SVG parsing.  We need to examine how this function handles:
    *   `<script>` tags: Are they completely removed, or is there an attempt to sanitize them?  Sanitization is notoriously difficult and error-prone.
    *   Event Handlers:  Are attributes like `onload`, `onclick`, `onerror` properly sanitized or removed?
    *   CDATA Sections:  Are CDATA sections properly handled to prevent embedded scripts?
    *   Foreign Objects:  Does the parser allow `<foreignObject>` elements, which can contain arbitrary HTML and JavaScript?
    *   `xlink:href` Attributes:  Are these attributes validated to prevent referencing malicious scripts or resources?
    *   Use of `innerHTML` or `outerHTML`:  Directly setting `innerHTML` or `outerHTML` with user-supplied SVG content is a major XSS risk.
    *   `eval()` or `Function()`:  Any use of `eval()` or `Function()` with user-supplied data is extremely dangerous.
*   **XML Parsing Library:**  Identify the specific XML/SVG parsing library used by draw.io.  Research known vulnerabilities in that library.
*   **Input Validation:**  Check for any input validation or sanitization routines applied to the SVG content *before* parsing.  Are these routines robust enough to handle various obfuscation techniques?
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Examine the CSP headers used by draw.io.  A well-configured CSP can significantly mitigate XSS attacks, even if vulnerabilities exist in the parsing logic.  Look for:
    *   `script-src`:  Does it allow `'unsafe-inline'` or `'unsafe-eval'`?  These should be avoided.
    *   `object-src`:  Does it restrict the loading of plugins and embedded content?
    *   `img-src`: Does it restrict to only trusted sources?

**Hypothetical Code Snippet (Vulnerable):**

```javascript
function parseSVG(svgString) {
  let parser = new DOMParser();
  let svgDoc = parser.parseFromString(svgString, "image/svg+xml");
  let container = document.getElementById("svgContainer");
  container.innerHTML = svgDoc.documentElement.outerHTML; // VULNERABLE!
}
```

This code is vulnerable because it directly sets the `innerHTML` of a container element with the parsed SVG content.  If `svgString` contains malicious JavaScript, it will be executed.

**Hypothetical Code Snippet (Less Vulnerable, but Still Risky):**

```javascript
function parseSVG(svgString) {
  let parser = new DOMParser();
  let svgDoc = parser.parseFromString(svgString, "image/svg+xml");
  let sanitizedSVG = sanitizeSVG(svgDoc.documentElement); // Sanitization function
  let container = document.getElementById("svgContainer");
  container.appendChild(sanitizedSVG);
}

function sanitizeSVG(svgElement) {
  // ... (Implementation of sanitization logic) ...
  // Remove <script> tags (but what about event handlers, CDATA, etc.?)
  let scriptTags = svgElement.getElementsByTagName("script");
  for (let i = scriptTags.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    scriptTags[i].parentNode.removeChild(scriptTags[i]);
  }
  // ... (Other sanitization steps) ...
  return svgElement;
}
```

This code is less vulnerable because it attempts to sanitize the SVG content.  However, the effectiveness of the sanitization depends entirely on the implementation of `sanitizeSVG()`.  It's very difficult to write a completely secure SVG sanitizer.

### 2.3 Vulnerability Research

*   **Known SVG XSS Vectors:**  Research common techniques used to embed malicious JavaScript in SVG files.  This includes:
    *   `<script>` tags (with various encodings and obfuscation).
    *   Event handlers (`onload`, `onclick`, `onerror`, etc.).
    *   CDATA sections.
    *   Foreign objects (`<foreignObject>`).
    *   `xlink:href` attributes.
    *   CSS-based XSS (using `<style>` tags or inline styles).
    *   Animation-based XSS (using `<animate>` or `<animateTransform>`).
*   **CVE Database:**  Search the CVE database for vulnerabilities related to:
    *   "draw.io"
    *   "jgraph"
    *   "mxGraph" (the underlying library)
    *   Specific XML/SVG parsing libraries used by draw.io (if known).
    *   General SVG parsing vulnerabilities.
*   **Security Advisories:**  Check for security advisories related to draw.io, mxGraph, and related libraries.
*   **Research Papers:**  Search for academic research papers on SVG security and XSS vulnerabilities.

### 2.4 Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing/Testing) - Conceptual

This section describes the *approach* to dynamic analysis.  Actual execution would require a testing environment and the draw.io application.

**Fuzzing:**

1.  **Tool Selection:**  Choose a suitable fuzzing tool.  Options include:
    *   **AFL (American Fuzzy Lop):**  A general-purpose fuzzer that can be adapted for SVG files.
    *   **Peach Fuzzer:**  A framework specifically designed for fuzzing file formats.
    *   **Custom Fuzzing Script:**  A Python script (or similar) that generates mutated SVG files.
2.  **Input Corpus:**  Create a corpus of valid SVG files to use as a starting point for fuzzing.  These files should cover a wide range of SVG features.
3.  **Mutation Strategy:**  Define how the fuzzer will mutate the input files.  This could involve:
    *   Bit flipping.
    *   Byte insertion/deletion.
    *   Replacing values with random data.
    *   Inserting known XSS payloads.
4.  **Monitoring:**  Monitor the draw.io application for crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior while fuzzing.  This could involve:
    *   Using a debugger.
    *   Monitoring browser console logs.
    *   Observing network traffic.
5.  **Triage:**  Analyze any crashes or errors to determine if they represent exploitable vulnerabilities.

**Manual Testing:**

1.  **Payload Creation:**  Craft specific SVG payloads designed to trigger XSS or other vulnerabilities.  These payloads should target the areas of concern identified during the code review.  Examples:
    *   `<svg><script>alert(1)</script></svg>` (Basic XSS)
    *   `<svg onload="alert(1)"></svg>` (Event handler)
    *   `<svg><foreignObject><body onload="alert(1)"></foreignObject></svg>` (Foreign object)
    *   `<svg><a xlink:href="javascript:alert(1)"><rect width="100" height="100"/></a></svg>` (xlink:href)
    *   SVG files with large numbers of nested elements (to test for stack overflow vulnerabilities).
    *   SVG files with invalid XML syntax (to test for parser robustness).
2.  **Testing Procedure:**
    *   Import each crafted SVG file into draw.io.
    *   Observe the application's behavior.  Does the JavaScript execute?  Are there any errors or warnings?
    *   Use browser developer tools to inspect the DOM and network traffic.
3.  **Documentation:**  Carefully document the results of each test, including the payload used, the observed behavior, and any potential vulnerabilities identified.

### 2.5 Mitigation Analysis and Recommendations

**Existing Mitigations (Hypothetical - Based on Common Practices):**

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  A strong CSP is the *most effective* mitigation against XSS.  draw.io *should* have a CSP that:
    *   Disallows `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` in `script-src`.
    *   Restricts `object-src` to `'none'` (or a very limited set of trusted sources).
    *   Restricts `img-src` to trusted sources.
    *   Uses a `nonce` or `hash` for any inline scripts that are absolutely necessary.
*   **Input Sanitization:**  draw.io likely performs *some* input sanitization on SVG files.  However, as discussed earlier, complete sanitization of SVG is extremely difficult.
*   **Library Updates:**  Regularly updating the XML/SVG parsing library and other dependencies can help mitigate known vulnerabilities.

**Recommended Mitigations:**

1.  **Strengthen CSP:**  Review and strengthen the existing CSP.  Ensure it is as restrictive as possible without breaking legitimate functionality.  Prioritize using a `nonce` or `hash` for inline scripts over `'unsafe-inline'`.
2.  **Avoid Direct DOM Manipulation:**  Refactor the code to avoid directly setting `innerHTML` or `outerHTML` with user-supplied SVG content.  Use safer methods like `createElement` and `appendChild` to build the DOM tree.
3.  **Consider a Dedicated SVG Sanitizer:**  Instead of relying on custom sanitization logic, consider using a well-vetted, dedicated SVG sanitization library.  Examples include:
    *   **DOMPurify:**  A popular and robust HTML/SVG sanitizer.  It's designed to prevent XSS and is actively maintained.
    *   **svg-sanitizer:**  A library specifically designed for sanitizing SVG files.
4.  **Disable Risky SVG Features:**  If possible, disable or restrict SVG features that are commonly used for XSS attacks, such as:
    *   `<script>` tags (completely remove them).
    *   Event handlers (remove all event handler attributes).
    *   `<foreignObject>` elements (if not essential).
    *   `xlink:href` attributes (validate them carefully or disallow them).
5.  **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address vulnerabilities.
6.  **Vulnerability Disclosure Program:**  Implement a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
7.  **Input Validation (Defense in Depth):** While sanitization is the primary defense, implement robust input validation *before* parsing the SVG. This can help catch obviously malicious inputs and reduce the load on the sanitizer.  This validation should:
    * Check file size limits.
    * Check for valid XML structure (at a high level).
    * Blacklist known malicious patterns (but be aware that this is easily bypassed).
8. **Sandboxing (If Feasible):** Consider rendering the SVG content within a sandboxed `<iframe>` to isolate it from the main application context. This can limit the impact of a successful XSS attack. However, this may impact functionality if the SVG needs to interact with the main application.
9. **Educate Developers:** Provide developers with training on secure coding practices, specifically focusing on XSS prevention and SVG security.

### 2.6 Conclusion

The "Malicious SVG Import" attack path in draw.io presents a significant security risk due to the inherent complexity of SVG and the potential for XSS vulnerabilities. While draw.io likely has some existing mitigations, a comprehensive approach involving a strong CSP, robust sanitization (preferably using a dedicated library), and careful code review is essential to minimize this risk. Regular security audits, dynamic testing, and developer education are also crucial for maintaining a strong security posture. The recommendations provided above should be prioritized based on their effectiveness and feasibility, with CSP strengthening and the use of a dedicated sanitizer being the most critical.
