# Deep Analysis of draw.io Attack Tree Path: 1.1a Craft SVG with XSS

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the feasibility, impact, and mitigation strategies for the Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability identified in attack tree path 1.1a, specifically focusing on maliciously crafted SVG files imported into draw.io.  We aim to determine the *precise* mechanisms by which XSS can be achieved, the *specific* draw.io components involved, and the *effectiveness* of various mitigation techniques.  This goes beyond a general understanding of XSS and delves into the draw.io implementation.

## 2. Scope

This analysis is limited to the following:

*   **Vulnerability:**  Stored XSS via SVG file import in draw.io.  We are *not* considering other potential XSS vectors (e.g., through URL parameters, other input fields).
*   **draw.io Version:**  The analysis will primarily target the latest stable release of draw.io available on GitHub (https://github.com/jgraph/drawio).  If significant version-specific differences are identified, they will be noted.  We will also examine older, potentially vulnerable versions if publicly available exploits exist.
*   **Attack Surface:**  The analysis focuses on the client-side JavaScript code responsible for parsing and rendering SVG files.  We will examine server-side components only insofar as they interact with the SVG import process (e.g., file storage, initial sanitization attempts).
*   **Mitigation:**  We will evaluate the effectiveness of client-side and server-side sanitization techniques, focusing on practical implementation within the draw.io context.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  We will perform a detailed static analysis of the relevant draw.io JavaScript code, specifically focusing on:
    *   The `mxSvgCanvas2D` class and related functions responsible for SVG rendering.
    *   The `mxClient.js` file and other core components involved in file handling and diagram loading.
    *   Any existing sanitization routines or security-related code (e.g., calls to `DOMPurify`, if present).
    *   Identification of potential bypasses for existing sanitization.

2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing & Manual Testing):**
    *   **Fuzzing:** We will use a fuzzer (e.g., a modified version of a general-purpose web fuzzer or a specialized SVG fuzzer) to generate a large number of malformed and potentially malicious SVG files.  These files will be imported into draw.io, and the application's behavior will be monitored for signs of XSS execution (e.g., JavaScript alerts, network requests, DOM manipulation).
    *   **Manual Testing:**  We will craft specific SVG payloads designed to exploit potential vulnerabilities identified during code review.  These payloads will include:
        *   Basic XSS payloads (e.g., `<svg><script>alert(1)</script></svg>`).
        *   Payloads targeting specific SVG elements and attributes (e.g., `<animate>`, `<use>`, `<foreignObject>`).
        *   Payloads attempting to bypass known sanitization techniques (e.g., character encoding, attribute filtering).
        *   Payloads using obfuscation techniques (e.g., nested SVG elements, data URIs).

3.  **Vulnerability Research:**
    *   We will search for publicly disclosed vulnerabilities related to SVG handling in draw.io and similar libraries (e.g., mxGraph).
    *   We will analyze any existing proof-of-concept (PoC) exploits to understand the underlying attack vectors.

4.  **Mitigation Testing:**
    *   We will implement and test various mitigation strategies, including:
        *   **DOMPurify:**  We will configure DOMPurify with different settings and test its effectiveness against our crafted payloads.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  We will evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of using CSP to restrict script execution within the draw.io context.
        *   **Custom Sanitization:**  If necessary, we will develop and test custom sanitization routines to address specific vulnerabilities not covered by existing libraries.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 1.1a

### 4.1.  Code Review Findings

Based on a preliminary review of the draw.io codebase (specifically targeting `mxSvgCanvas2D`, `mxClient.js`, and related files), the following observations are made:

*   **SVG Parsing:** draw.io uses the browser's built-in SVG rendering engine.  This means that the security of the SVG parsing itself is largely dependent on the browser's implementation.  However, draw.io *does* perform some pre-processing and manipulation of the SVG content before rendering.
*   **Potential Vulnerability Points:**
    *   **`innerHTML` and `outerHTML`:**  Any use of `innerHTML` or `outerHTML` with unsanitized SVG content is a major red flag.  We need to identify all instances of these properties being used and analyze the context.
    *   **Event Handlers:**  draw.io might handle SVG event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`) in a way that allows for script execution.  We need to examine how these events are processed.
    *   **`createElementNS` and `setAttributeNS`:**  While generally safer than `innerHTML`, these methods can still be vulnerable if used incorrectly.  We need to verify that attribute values are properly sanitized.
    *   **`foreignObject`:**  The `<foreignObject>` element allows embedding arbitrary HTML content within an SVG.  This is a high-risk area that requires careful scrutiny.  draw.io may have specific handling for this element.
    *   **Data URIs:**  SVG elements can reference external resources using data URIs.  These URIs can contain embedded JavaScript code.

*   **Existing Sanitization (Preliminary):**  The codebase *does* appear to contain some attempts at sanitization, but the extent and effectiveness are unclear without further investigation.  Mentions of `mxUtils.sanitizeHtml` and potential use of regular expressions for filtering are present, but these may be insufficient or easily bypassed.

### 4.2. Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing and Manual Testing) - Results (Hypothetical - Requires Actual Testing)

This section will be populated with the results of the fuzzing and manual testing.  For now, we present *hypothetical* findings to illustrate the types of vulnerabilities we might discover:

*   **Fuzzing:**  The fuzzer might reveal that certain combinations of malformed SVG attributes or deeply nested elements cause unexpected behavior, potentially leading to script execution.  For example, a fuzzer might discover that a specific sequence of characters within a `<desc>` tag bypasses the sanitization routine.

*   **Manual Testing (Examples):**
    *   **Basic Payload:** `<svg><script>alert(1)</script></svg>` - This might be blocked by basic sanitization.
    *   **Bypass 1:** `<svg><script>al\u0065rt(1)</script></svg>` - Using Unicode escapes to bypass simple string matching.
    *   **Bypass 2:** `<svg><animate onbegin="alert(1)" attributeName="x" from="0" to="100" dur="1s"/></svg>` - Using an event handler on the `<animate>` element.
    *   **Bypass 3:** `<svg><foreignObject width="100" height="100"><body xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"><script>alert(1)</script></body></foreignObject></svg>` - Using a `<foreignObject>` to embed HTML and JavaScript.
    *   **Bypass 4:** `<svg><image xlink:href="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E%3C/svg%3E"/></svg>` - Using a data URI to embed a malicious SVG within an `<image>` element.
    *  **Bypass 5:** `<svg><a xlink:href="javascript:alert(1)"><rect width="100" height="100" fill="red"/></a></svg>` - Exploiting xlink:href attribute.

### 4.3. Vulnerability Research

We would search for existing CVEs related to draw.io and mxGraph, as well as general SVG XSS vulnerabilities.  This research would inform our testing and help us identify known attack vectors.  For example, we might find a previously reported vulnerability related to the `<use>` element or a specific browser-specific SVG parsing issue.

### 4.4. Mitigation Testing

*   **DOMPurify:**  We would test DOMPurify with various configurations, including:
    *   `ALLOWED_TAGS`:  Explicitly allowing only a minimal set of safe SVG elements.
    *   `ALLOWED_ATTR`:  Explicitly allowing only a minimal set of safe SVG attributes.
    *   `FORBID_TAGS`:  Explicitly forbidding known dangerous elements like `<script>`, `<foreignObject>`, etc.
    *   `FORBID_ATTR`:  Explicitly forbidding known dangerous attributes like `onload`, `onclick`, `xlink:href` (with careful consideration for legitimate uses).
    *   `USE_PROFILES`:  Using the `svg` profile and potentially customizing it further.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  We would explore using a CSP to restrict script execution.  A suitable CSP might include:
    *   `script-src 'self'`:  Allowing scripts only from the same origin.  This would prevent inline scripts and scripts loaded from external sources.
    *   `object-src 'none'`:  Preventing the loading of plugins (which could potentially be used to bypass security restrictions).
    *   `img-src 'self' data:`: Allowing images from the same origin and data URIs (necessary for some draw.io functionality, but requires careful sanitization of data URIs).
    *   `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'`: Allowing inline styles (often used by draw.io), but this is a potential risk and should be minimized if possible.

*   **Custom Sanitization:**  If DOMPurify and CSP prove insufficient, we would develop custom sanitization routines to address specific vulnerabilities.  This might involve:
    *   Regular expressions to remove or escape dangerous characters and patterns.
    *   Custom parsing logic to validate SVG structure and attribute values.
    *   Whitelisting of allowed elements and attributes.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations (Preliminary)

Based on the *preliminary* analysis (pending the completion of dynamic testing and vulnerability research), the following conclusions and recommendations are made:

*   **High Risk:**  The potential for XSS via SVG import in draw.io is a significant security concern.  The complexity of SVG and the browser's rendering engine create numerous opportunities for bypasses.
*   **DOMPurify is Essential:**  Rigorous sanitization using a dedicated library like DOMPurify is absolutely crucial.  The default configuration of DOMPurify may not be sufficient, and careful customization is required.
*   **CSP is Recommended:**  Implementing a strong CSP can provide an additional layer of defense by restricting script execution.
*   **Continuous Monitoring:**  Regular security audits, penetration testing, and vulnerability scanning are necessary to identify and address new vulnerabilities as they emerge.
*   **Disable SVG Import if Possible:** If the functionality to import SVG files is not essential for the application, disabling it entirely is the most secure option.
* **Server-side validation:** Even with client-side sanitization, it is crucial to implement server-side validation of uploaded SVG files. This acts as a second layer of defense and prevents attackers from bypassing client-side checks.

This deep analysis provides a framework for a thorough investigation of the XSS vulnerability in draw.io. The hypothetical findings and recommendations will be refined and updated as the analysis progresses. The key takeaway is that a multi-layered approach to security, combining code review, dynamic testing, vulnerability research, and robust mitigation techniques, is essential to protect against this type of attack.
