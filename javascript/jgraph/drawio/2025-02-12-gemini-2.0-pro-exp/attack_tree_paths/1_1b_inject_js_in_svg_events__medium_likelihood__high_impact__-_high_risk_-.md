Okay, here's a deep analysis of the specified attack tree path, formatted as Markdown:

# Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Inject JS in SVG Events (draw.io)

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly investigate the feasibility, impact, and mitigation strategies for the attack vector described as "Inject JS in SVG events" within the context of a web application utilizing the draw.io (jgraph/drawio) library.  We aim to provide actionable recommendations for the development team to prevent this specific type of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.  This includes understanding *how* an attacker might achieve this, *why* existing mitigations might fail, and *what* concrete steps can be taken to ensure robust protection.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the following:

*   **Attack Vector:**  Injection of malicious JavaScript code within SVG event attributes (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`, `onerror`, etc.) within SVG images processed by the draw.io library.
*   **Target Application:**  A hypothetical web application that integrates draw.io for diagram creation and/or display.  We assume the application allows users to upload, import, or create SVG content.
*   **Library:**  The `jgraph/drawio` library, specifically its handling of SVG content.  We will consider both the library's built-in security features and potential bypasses.
*   **Exclusions:**  This analysis *does not* cover other XSS attack vectors (e.g., script tag injection, HTML attribute injection outside of SVG events), other types of attacks (e.g., CSRF, SQL injection), or vulnerabilities in other parts of the application stack (e.g., server-side vulnerabilities).

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will detail the attacker's perspective, including their goals, capabilities, and potential attack steps.
2.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  We will examine how draw.io processes SVG content, identify potential weaknesses in its sanitization and parsing mechanisms, and explore known bypass techniques for SVG event-based XSS.
3.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will analyze the potential consequences of a successful attack, considering the impact on user data, application functionality, and overall security.
4.  **Mitigation Strategies:**  We will propose concrete, actionable recommendations for mitigating the vulnerability, including code-level changes, configuration adjustments, and security best practices.
5.  **Testing Recommendations:** We will outline specific testing strategies to verify the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.1b Inject JS in SVG events

### 2.1 Threat Modeling

*   **Attacker Goal:**  The primary goal is to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim user's browser session.  This could lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the user's session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
    *   **Data Theft:**  Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data displayed within the draw.io diagram or elsewhere on the page.
    *   **Defacement:**  Modifying the content of the page, including the diagram itself.
    *   **Phishing:**  Displaying fake login forms or other deceptive content to trick the user into revealing credentials.
    *   **Drive-by Downloads:**  Silently downloading and executing malware on the user's system.
    *   **Keylogging:** Capturing user keystrokes.
    *   **Client-Side Reconnaissance:** Gathering information about the user's browser, plugins, and operating system.

*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs the ability to inject a crafted SVG image into the application.  This could be achieved through:
    *   **Direct Upload:**  If the application allows users to upload SVG files, the attacker can directly upload a malicious SVG.
    *   **Import from URL:**  If the application allows importing diagrams from external URLs, the attacker can host a malicious SVG on a controlled server.
    *   **Exploiting Other Vulnerabilities:**  The attacker might leverage another vulnerability (e.g., a file upload bypass, a cross-site scripting vulnerability in a different part of the application) to inject the SVG.
    *   **Social Engineering:**  Tricking a legitimate user into uploading or importing the malicious SVG.

*   **Attack Steps:**
    1.  **Craft Malicious SVG:** The attacker creates an SVG image containing malicious JavaScript code within event attributes.  Examples:
        *   `<svg onload="alert('XSS')">`
        *   `<circle onmouseover="javascript:/*malicious code here*/">`
        *   `<image xlink:href="data:image/svg+xml;base64,..." onerror="/*malicious code*/">` (using a data URI to embed the SVG)
        *   `<animate onbegin="/*malicious code*/" attributeName="x" from="0" to="100" dur="5s" />`
        *   Using CDATA sections to try and obfuscate the code: `<svg onload="alert('XSS')"><![CDATA[ ]]></svg>`
    2.  **Inject SVG:** The attacker uses one of the methods described above to inject the crafted SVG into the application.
    3.  **Trigger Event:** The attacker (or an unsuspecting victim) triggers the embedded JavaScript by interacting with the SVG element in a way that activates the malicious event handler (e.g., hovering over the element, loading the page, clicking on the element).
    4.  **Execute Payload:** The victim's browser executes the attacker's JavaScript code, leading to the consequences described above.

### 2.2 Vulnerability Analysis

*   **draw.io's SVG Handling:** draw.io, at its core, is a JavaScript-based diagramming library.  It relies on the browser's built-in SVG rendering capabilities.  While draw.io *does* implement sanitization to prevent XSS, it's crucial to understand that this sanitization is not foolproof and can be bypassed.  The library likely uses a combination of techniques:
    *   **DOMPurify (or similar):**  A common approach is to use a dedicated HTML/SVG sanitization library like DOMPurify.  These libraries attempt to parse the SVG content and remove or escape potentially dangerous elements and attributes.
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Allowing only a specific set of known-safe SVG elements and attributes.
    *   **Blacklisting:**  Explicitly blocking known-dangerous elements and attributes.
    *   **Regular Expressions:**  Using regular expressions to detect and remove or escape potentially malicious patterns.

*   **Potential Weaknesses and Bypasses:**
    *   **DOMPurify Bypasses:**  DOMPurify, while robust, is not perfect.  Researchers have discovered bypasses over time.  Attackers may use mutated SVG payloads or exploit edge cases in the parsing logic to circumvent the sanitization.  Staying up-to-date with the latest DOMPurify version is crucial, but not a guarantee of complete security.
    *   **Incomplete Whitelisting/Blacklisting:**  If draw.io uses a whitelist or blacklist approach, it's possible that certain less common but still valid SVG event attributes are overlooked, allowing attackers to inject code through those attributes.
    *   **Regular Expression Errors:**  Regular expressions can be complex and prone to errors.  A poorly crafted regular expression might fail to detect certain malicious patterns, or it might inadvertently remove legitimate content.
    *   **Browser-Specific Quirks:**  Different browsers may handle SVG parsing and event handling slightly differently.  An attacker might craft a payload that works in one browser but not another, or that exploits a specific browser bug.
    *   **Nested SVG Contexts:**  SVG can be nested within other SVG elements.  Sanitization might not be applied recursively or correctly to all nested contexts.
    *   **ForeignObject Element:**  The `<foreignObject>` element in SVG allows embedding arbitrary HTML content.  While this should be heavily sanitized, bypasses might exist.
    *   **CDATA Sections:** While CDATA sections are intended for literal text, attackers might try to use them to obfuscate malicious code and bypass simple string-based checks.
    *   **Mutation XSS (mXSS):**  This type of XSS relies on the browser's DOM manipulation to transform seemingly harmless content into malicious code.  Attackers might inject code that, after being processed by the browser, becomes executable.

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful SVG event-based XSS attack is **High**, as stated in the original attack tree.  The consequences are identical to those outlined in the Threat Modeling section (session hijacking, data theft, defacement, phishing, etc.).  The severity stems from the fact that the attacker gains complete control over the user's browser session within the context of the vulnerable application.  This allows them to perform any action the user could perform, potentially leading to significant data breaches and reputational damage.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies

A multi-layered approach is essential for mitigating this vulnerability:

1.  **Update Dependencies:** Ensure that draw.io and any underlying sanitization libraries (like DOMPurify) are updated to the *latest* versions.  Regularly check for security updates and apply them promptly.

2.  **Robust Sanitization:**
    *   **Configure DOMPurify (if used):**  If draw.io uses DOMPurify, configure it with the most restrictive settings possible.  Specifically:
        *   `ALLOWED_ATTR`:  Explicitly list *only* the absolutely necessary SVG attributes.  Do *not* include any event attributes (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`, etc.) in this list.
        *   `FORBID_ATTR`:  Explicitly forbid *all* event attributes, even those that might seem obscure.  This acts as a double-check.
        *   `ALLOWED_TAGS`:  Restrict the allowed SVG tags to the minimum required set.
        *   `SAFE_FOR_TEMPLATES`: Set to `true` if applicable.
        *   `RETURN_DOM_FRAGMENT`: Consider using this option for more control over the sanitized output.
    *   **Custom Sanitization (if necessary):**  If draw.io's built-in sanitization or DOMPurify is insufficient, implement *additional* custom sanitization logic.  This could involve:
        *   **Attribute Removal:**  Iterate through all SVG elements and remove *all* attributes that start with "on" (case-insensitive).
        *   **Regular Expression Checks (with caution):**  Use regular expressions to detect and remove potentially malicious patterns, but be extremely careful to avoid false positives and bypasses.  Thoroughly test any regular expressions used.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Integration:** Leverage CSP to further restrict the execution of inline scripts.

3.  **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of any successful XSS, even if the sanitization fails.  Specifically:
    *   `script-src`:  Avoid using `'unsafe-inline'`.  Ideally, use a nonce-based approach or a strict whitelist of trusted script sources.  If you must use `'unsafe-inline'`, combine it with `'strict-dynamic'` to mitigate some of the risks.
    *   `object-src`:  Set to `'none'` to prevent the loading of potentially malicious plugins.
    *   `img-src`: Control the sources from which images (including SVGs) can be loaded. Consider using a whitelist of trusted domains.
    *   `frame-src` and `child-src`: Control allowed iframes.
    *   `report-uri` or `report-to`:  Configure CSP reporting to monitor for violations and identify potential attacks.

4.  **Input Validation (Server-Side):**  While client-side sanitization is crucial, *never* rely on it alone.  Implement server-side validation to ensure that any SVG data received from the client is well-formed and does not contain potentially malicious content.  This acts as a second layer of defense.

5.  **Output Encoding:**  Ensure that any SVG data displayed to the user is properly encoded to prevent the browser from interpreting it as executable code.  This is particularly important if the SVG content is dynamically generated or modified on the server.

6.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration tests to identify and address potential vulnerabilities, including XSS.  These tests should specifically target the SVG handling functionality of draw.io.

7.  **Educate Developers:**  Ensure that all developers working on the application are aware of the risks of XSS and the best practices for preventing it.  Provide training on secure coding techniques and the proper use of sanitization libraries.

### 2.5 Testing Recommendations

Thorough testing is critical to verify the effectiveness of the implemented mitigations:

1.  **Unit Tests:**  Create unit tests that specifically target the sanitization logic.  These tests should include a variety of malicious SVG payloads, including:
    *   Basic payloads with `onload`, `onclick`, etc.
    *   Payloads using different casing (e.g., `OnLoAd`).
    *   Payloads with obfuscation techniques (e.g., using character encoding, CDATA sections).
    *   Payloads targeting less common event attributes.
    *   Payloads attempting to bypass DOMPurify (if used).
    *   Payloads with nested SVG contexts.
    *   Payloads using the `<foreignObject>` element.

2.  **Integration Tests:**  Create integration tests that simulate user interactions with the application, including uploading, importing, and displaying SVG diagrams.  These tests should verify that malicious SVG content is properly sanitized and does not result in XSS.

3.  **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Engage a security expert to perform manual penetration testing, specifically focusing on the SVG handling functionality.  The penetration tester should attempt to bypass the implemented mitigations and execute arbitrary JavaScript code.

4.  **Fuzz Testing:**  Use a fuzzing tool to generate a large number of random or semi-random SVG inputs and feed them to the application.  This can help identify unexpected vulnerabilities or edge cases that might be missed by other testing methods.

5.  **Browser Compatibility Testing:**  Test the application in a variety of different browsers (including older versions) to ensure that the mitigations are effective across all supported platforms.

6.  **CSP Violation Monitoring:**  Monitor CSP violation reports to identify any attempts to bypass the CSP and execute malicious code.

By following these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of SVG event-based XSS vulnerabilities in their application using draw.io. The key is a layered defense, combining robust sanitization, a strong CSP, server-side validation, and thorough testing.
