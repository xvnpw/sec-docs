Okay, let's perform a deep analysis of the "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Embedded Scripts" attack surface in drawio, as described.

## Deep Analysis: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in drawio via Embedded Scripts

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

*   **Objective:**  To thoroughly understand the XSS vulnerability related to embedded scripts in drawio, identify specific attack vectors, assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and provide actionable recommendations for developers to eliminate or significantly reduce the risk.  We aim to go beyond the general description and pinpoint the exact mechanisms that could be exploited.

*   **Scope:** This analysis focuses *exclusively* on the XSS vulnerability arising from the potential for embedding and executing JavaScript code within drawio diagrams.  We will consider:
    *   drawio's configuration options related to scripting.
    *   The XML/data structure used to represent diagrams.
    *   The rendering and event handling mechanisms within drawio.
    *   The interaction between drawio and the host application.
    *   The effectiveness of Content Security Policy (CSP) in this specific context.
    *   We will *not* cover other potential XSS vulnerabilities in the host application itself, unless they directly interact with the drawio component.

*   **Methodology:**
    1.  **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  We will examine the publicly available drawio source code (from the provided GitHub repository) to identify:
        *   Functions and modules responsible for parsing, rendering, and executing diagram content.
        *   Any existing input validation or sanitization routines.
        *   Configuration options that control script execution.
        *   Event handling mechanisms (e.g., `onclick`, custom actions).
    2.  **Dynamic Analysis (Testing):** We will create test diagrams containing various forms of potentially malicious JavaScript payloads.  We will then load these diagrams into a test environment (a simple web application embedding drawio) and observe the behavior.  This will involve:
        *   Testing different drawio configurations (e.g., enabling/disabling scripting).
        *   Attempting to bypass any identified sanitization routines.
        *   Testing the effectiveness of different CSP configurations.
        *   Using browser developer tools to inspect the DOM and network requests.
    3.  **Threat Modeling:** We will systematically identify potential attack vectors and scenarios, considering different user roles and privileges.
    4.  **Mitigation Verification:** We will evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies by attempting to exploit the vulnerability after each mitigation is applied.
    5.  **Documentation:**  We will clearly document our findings, including specific code examples, attack scenarios, and recommendations.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

Based on the initial description and our understanding of XSS vulnerabilities, we can break down the attack surface into several key areas:

**2.1.  Diagram Data Structure and Parsing:**

*   **XML Structure:** drawio diagrams are typically stored in an XML-based format (or a compressed version of it).  The `<action>` tag, as mentioned in the example, is a prime suspect.  We need to understand:
    *   How are `<action>` tags parsed and processed?
    *   Are there other XML elements or attributes that could be used to inject script code?  (e.g., event handlers on shapes, custom properties, links).
    *   Is there any validation or escaping performed during the parsing of the XML?
    *   How is the `CDATA` section within the `<action>` tag handled?  Is it treated as plain text, or is it evaluated in any way?
*   **JSON Structure:** drawio can also use JSON.  The same questions apply, but focusing on how JSON objects and properties are parsed and handled.
*   **Compressed Data:**  If the diagram data is compressed (e.g., using DEFLATE), we need to understand how the decompression process handles potentially malicious data.  Could a crafted compressed payload trigger a vulnerability?

**2.2.  Rendering and Event Handling:**

*   **JavaScript Execution Context:**  When a diagram is rendered, in what context is the JavaScript code within `<action>` tags (or other potentially executable elements) executed?
    *   Is it executed in the context of the drawio iframe (if one is used)?
    *   Is it executed in the context of the main application window?  (This is much more dangerous).
    *   Are there any sandboxing mechanisms in place?
*   **Event Handling:**
    *   How are events (like `onclick`) attached to diagram elements?
    *   Are these event handlers created using `innerHTML`, `setAttribute`, or other potentially unsafe methods?
    *   Is there any opportunity for an attacker to inject code into the event handling logic itself?
*   **Custom Actions:**
    *   How are custom actions defined and executed?
    *   Is there any validation or sanitization of the code within custom actions?
    *   Can custom actions be triggered automatically (e.g., on diagram load), or do they require user interaction?

**2.3.  Configuration Options:**

*   **Scripting Control:**  drawio *should* have configuration options to disable or restrict scripting.  We need to identify these options and verify their effectiveness.
    *   Are there different levels of scripting control (e.g., completely disable, allow only certain functions, allow only from trusted sources)?
    *   Can these options be bypassed by a malicious user?
    *   Are these options clearly documented and easy to use?
*   **Other Security-Relevant Options:**  Are there other configuration options that could impact the XSS vulnerability (e.g., options related to data loading, external resources, or sandboxing)?

**2.4.  Interaction with the Host Application:**

*   **Communication:**  How does drawio communicate with the host application?
    *   Does it use `postMessage`?
    *   Does it directly access the DOM of the host application?
    *   Could an attacker exploit this communication channel to inject code into the host application?
*   **Data Exchange:**  How is diagram data passed between drawio and the host application?
    *   Is the data sanitized or validated by the host application before being passed to drawio?
    *   Is the data sanitized or validated by drawio before being passed back to the host application?

**2.5.  Content Security Policy (CSP) Analysis:**

*   **`script-src` Directive:**  A strong CSP with a restrictive `script-src` directive is crucial.  We need to determine:
    *   What is the recommended `script-src` directive for use with drawio?
    *   Does drawio require any specific sources to be whitelisted in `script-src`?
    *   Can an attacker bypass the `script-src` directive by using techniques like:
        *   **Inline script injection:**  (This should be blocked by a strong CSP).
        *   **Loading scripts from whitelisted sources:** (e.g., if `*.example.com` is whitelisted, could an attacker host a malicious script on a subdomain of `example.com`?)
        *   **Using non-script vectors to execute code:** (e.g., exploiting vulnerabilities in other directives like `object-src` or `frame-src`).
*   **`object-src` Directive:**  drawio might use `<object>` or `<embed>` tags for certain features.  A restrictive `object-src` directive is important to prevent the loading of malicious plugins.
*   **`frame-src` Directive:**  If drawio uses iframes, a restrictive `frame-src` directive is important to prevent the loading of malicious content in iframes.
*   **`base-uri` Directive:**  A restrictive `base-uri` directive can help prevent attackers from hijacking relative URLs.
*   **`report-uri` Directive:**  Using `report-uri` (or `report-to`) is essential for monitoring CSP violations and identifying potential attacks.

**2.6. Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

Based on the above analysis, we can identify several potential attack vectors:

*   **Direct Injection into `<action>` tags:**  The most obvious attack vector, as described in the initial example.
*   **Injection into other XML attributes:**  Attempting to inject script code into attributes like `title`, `desc`, or custom properties.
*   **Exploiting parsing vulnerabilities:**  Crafting a malformed XML or JSON payload that triggers a vulnerability in the parsing logic, leading to script execution.
*   **Bypassing sanitization routines:**  If drawio has sanitization routines, attempting to find ways to bypass them (e.g., using character encoding tricks, double encoding, or exploiting regular expression flaws).
*   **Exploiting configuration weaknesses:**  If the drawio configuration allows scripting, or if the CSP is weak or misconfigured, exploiting these weaknesses to inject and execute code.
*   **Social Engineering:**  Tricking a user into opening a malicious diagram file or pasting malicious diagram data into drawio.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting Inclusion (XSSI):** If diagram is loaded from different origin, attacker can try to include it and read content.

**2.7. Mitigation Verification:**

For each proposed mitigation strategy, we will perform the following steps:

1.  **Implement the mitigation:**  Apply the mitigation (e.g., disable scripting, configure CSP, implement input validation).
2.  **Attempt to exploit the vulnerability:**  Use the attack vectors described above to try to bypass the mitigation.
3.  **Analyze the results:**  Determine whether the mitigation was successful in preventing the attack.  If the attack was successful, identify the reason for the failure and refine the mitigation.

### 3. Recommendations (Preliminary)

Based on the initial analysis, the following recommendations are crucial:

*   **Prioritize Disabling Scripting:**  The most effective mitigation is to completely disable script execution within drawio diagrams, if possible.  This eliminates the primary attack vector.
*   **Strong CSP:**  Implement a *very* strict CSP, with a restrictive `script-src` directive that only allows scripts from trusted sources (ideally, only the same origin as the host application).  Include `object-src`, `frame-src`, `base-uri`, and `report-uri` directives.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization (If Scripting is Necessary):**  If scripting *cannot* be disabled, implement extremely rigorous input validation and sanitization.  This is a complex and error-prone task, and should be approached with extreme caution.  Consider using a well-vetted sanitization library.  Focus on:
    *   **Whitelisting:**  Allow only a specific set of characters and patterns, rather than trying to blacklist malicious ones.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:**  The sanitization rules should be tailored to the specific context in which the data will be used (e.g., XML attribute, `CDATA` section, JSON property).
    *   **Regular Expression Security:**  If regular expressions are used for validation, ensure they are carefully crafted to avoid ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerabilities.
*   **Output Encoding:**  Ensure that all output from drawio is properly encoded to prevent any injected code from being interpreted as executable.  This includes data displayed in the diagram itself, as well as data passed back to the host application.
*   **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the drawio integration, including code reviews and penetration testing.
*   **Stay Updated:**  Keep drawio and all related libraries up to date to ensure that any security vulnerabilities are patched promptly.
* **User Education:** Educate users about risks of opening untrusted diagrams.

This deep analysis provides a framework for a thorough investigation of the XSS vulnerability in drawio. The next steps would involve performing the code review, dynamic analysis, and mitigation verification as outlined in the methodology. This will provide concrete evidence and specific recommendations for developers to secure their drawio implementation.
