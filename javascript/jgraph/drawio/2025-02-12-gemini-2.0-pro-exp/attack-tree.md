## Attack Tree Path: [1. Achieve XSS via draw.io (Medium Likelihood / High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/1__achieve_xss_via_draw_io__medium_likelihood__high_impact_.md)

This is the primary, high-risk attack vector. Successful XSS allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of a user's session, leading to potential account takeover, data theft, and further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Malicious SVG Import (Medium Likelihood / High Impact) [CRITICAL] -> HIGH RISK ->](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_malicious_svg_import__medium_likelihood__high_impact___critical__-_high_risk_-.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in draw.io's SVG import functionality to inject malicious JavaScript.  SVG is a complex format, making complete sanitization challenging.
**Why it's Critical:** SVG import is a common feature, and XSS vulnerabilities in SVG parsing are well-known.
**Why it's High Risk:** The combination of medium likelihood and high impact makes this a high-risk path.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1a Craft SVG with XSS (Medium Likelihood / High Impact) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1a_craft_svg_with_xss__medium_likelihood__high_impact___critical_.md)

**Description:** The attacker creates a specially crafted SVG file containing JavaScript code within `<script>` tags or event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`).  If draw.io doesn't properly sanitize these elements, the JavaScript will execute when the diagram is loaded.
**Likelihood:** Medium - While draw.io likely has some sanitization, bypasses are possible.
**Impact:** High - Complete compromise of the user's session.
**Effort:** Low - Basic XSS payloads are readily available.
**Skill Level:** Medium - Requires understanding of SVG and XSS.
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring network traffic or analyzing uploaded SVGs, but obfuscation can hinder detection.
**Mitigation:** Rigorous SVG sanitization using a dedicated library (e.g., DOMPurify configured for SVG).  Disable SVG import if not essential.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1b Inject JS in SVG events (Medium Likelihood / High Impact) -> HIGH RISK ->](./attack_tree_paths/1_1b_inject_js_in_svg_events__medium_likelihood__high_impact__-_high_risk_-.md)

**Description:**  Even if `<script>` tags are blocked, attackers can inject JavaScript into SVG event attributes (like `onload`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`).
**Likelihood:** Medium - Similar to 1.1a, bypasses are possible.
**Impact:** High - Complete compromise of the user's session.
**Effort:** Medium - Requires more specific knowledge of SVG event handling.
**Skill Level:** Medium - Requires understanding of SVG event attributes and XSS.
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Similar to 1.1a.
**Mitigation:** Ensure the sanitization library explicitly handles and removes/escapes dangerous event attributes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2a Exploit MXFile parsing bugs (Low Likelihood / High Impact) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2a_exploit_mxfile_parsing_bugs__low_likelihood__high_impact___critical_.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft a malicious .drawio (MXFile) file that exploits a vulnerability in draw.io's XML parser (e.g., buffer overflow, XML injection).
**Likelihood:** Low - The MXFile format is specific to draw.io and likely receives more security scrutiny.
**Impact:** High - Complete compromise of the user's session.
**Effort:** High - Requires significant effort to find and exploit a parsing vulnerability (fuzzing, reverse engineering).
**Skill Level:** High - Requires advanced vulnerability research skills.
**Detection Difficulty:** High - Very difficult without specific knowledge of the vulnerability.
**Mitigation:** Keep draw.io updated.  Fuzz test the MXFile parsing functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3a Bypass CSP via Config (Low Likelihood / High Impact) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_3a_bypass_csp_via_config__low_likelihood__high_impact___critical_.md)

**Description:** The attacker finds a way to inject malicious JavaScript through draw.io's configuration options, bypassing the application's Content Security Policy (CSP).
**Likelihood:** Low - Requires finding a configuration option that allows overriding the CSP.
**Impact:** High - Weakens defenses against XSS, making other XSS attacks easier.
**Effort:** Medium - Requires understanding draw.io's configuration and finding a suitable option.
**Skill Level:** High - Requires deep understanding of CSP and draw.io's configuration.
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring configuration changes and network traffic.
**Mitigation:** Review all draw.io configuration options.  Ensure the application's CSP is correctly configured and enforced.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Flaws in Plugin Handling (Medium Likelihood/ High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_flaws_in_plugin_handling__medium_likelihood_high_impact_.md)

**Description:** This attack vector leverages vulnerabilities within draw.io plugins.
**Why it's High Risk:** Plugins extend functionality, increasing the attack surface.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4a Exploit Plugin API (Low Likelihood / High Impact) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4a_exploit_plugin_api__low_likelihood__high_impact___critical_.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability in the plugin API itself allows a malicious plugin to execute arbitrary code.
**Likelihood:** Low - Requires finding a vulnerability in the core plugin API.
**Impact:** High - Widespread exploitation potential.
**Effort:** High - Requires significant reverse engineering and vulnerability research.
**Skill Level:** High - Requires expert-level security knowledge.
**Detection Difficulty:** High - Difficult without specific knowledge of the vulnerability.
**Mitigation:** Implement plugin sandboxing.  Carefully vet the draw.io plugin API code.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4b Inject JS via Plugin (Medium Likelihood / High Impact)](./attack_tree_paths/1_4b_inject_js_via_plugin__medium_likelihood__high_impact_.md)

**Description:** A malicious plugin directly injects JavaScript into the application.
**Likelihood:** Medium - More likely if untrusted plugins are used.
**Impact:** High - Complete compromise of the user's session.
**Effort:** Medium - Depends on the complexity of creating a malicious plugin.
**Skill Level:** Medium - Requires knowledge of plugin development and XSS.
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium - Can be detected by monitoring plugin behavior and network traffic.
**Mitigation:** Implement code signing for plugins.  Monitor plugin behavior.  Vett plugins carefully. Disable if not essential.
