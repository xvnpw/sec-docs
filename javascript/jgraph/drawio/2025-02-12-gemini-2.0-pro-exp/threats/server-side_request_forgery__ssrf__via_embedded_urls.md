Okay, here's a deep analysis of the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) threat, tailored for a development team using draw.io, as per your specifications:

## Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in draw.io

### 1. Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the SSRF vulnerability related to embedded URLs in draw.io diagrams, assess its potential impact on our application, and define concrete steps to mitigate the risk.  We aim to provide actionable guidance for developers to prevent this vulnerability.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the SSRF vulnerability arising from draw.io's handling of URLs embedded within diagrams.  It covers:

*   The server-side components of our application that interact with draw.io, particularly those involved in rendering, processing, or exporting diagrams.
*   The draw.io library itself (`mxGraph`, `mxImageExport`, and related components).
*   The interaction between draw.io and any backend services that might fetch data based on embedded URLs.
*   The network architecture and how it might exacerbate or mitigate the SSRF risk.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other types of SSRF vulnerabilities unrelated to draw.io.
*   Client-side vulnerabilities in draw.io (unless they directly contribute to the server-side SSRF).
*   General security best practices unrelated to this specific threat.

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Code Review:** Examine the application's codebase to identify how draw.io is integrated and how URLs from diagrams are handled.  This includes searching for relevant API calls, configuration settings, and custom code that interacts with draw.io.
2.  **Library Analysis:** Review the draw.io library documentation and, if necessary, the source code (it's open source) to understand how it handles URLs and external resource loading.  Focus on `mxGraph`, `mxImageExport`, and any URL-related functions.
3.  **Network Analysis:** Map the network architecture to understand how the server-side components that process draw.io diagrams are connected to other internal and external systems.
4.  **Vulnerability Testing (Conceptual):**  Describe how we *would* test for this vulnerability, even if we don't perform the actual testing in this document. This helps developers understand the attacker's perspective.
5.  **Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**  Based on the findings, refine the initial mitigation strategies into concrete, actionable steps with specific implementation details.
6.  **Documentation:**  Clearly document the findings, risks, and mitigation strategies in a format easily understood by developers.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat

**2.1 Code Review Findings (Hypothetical Example):**

Let's assume our application uses draw.io for collaborative diagramming and has a server-side component that generates PDF exports of diagrams.  Our code review might reveal the following:

*   **Diagram Storage:** Diagrams are stored as XML files in a database.
*   **PDF Export:**  A backend service uses `mxImageExport` (or a similar library) to render the diagram XML and generate a PDF.  This service runs on a server within our internal network.
*   **URL Handling:**  The code doesn't explicitly validate or sanitize URLs extracted from the diagram XML before passing them to `mxImageExport`.  It relies on draw.io to handle URLs safely.
*   **Image Loading:** The application allows users to embed images in diagrams using URLs.  These URLs are stored directly in the diagram XML.

**2.2 Library Analysis (draw.io):**

*   **`mxGraph`:** This is the core library for creating and manipulating diagrams.  It handles the structure of the diagram, including shapes, connections, and attributes.  It likely has mechanisms for storing and retrieving URLs associated with shapes (e.g., hyperlinks, image sources).
*   **`mxImageExport`:** This component (or a similar server-side rendering library) is responsible for converting the diagram into an image format (like PNG or PDF).  It likely needs to fetch external resources (like images) referenced by URLs within the diagram.
*   **URL Handling (Potential Weakness):**  Older versions of draw.io, or configurations that haven't been hardened, might not have robust SSRF protections.  The library might attempt to fetch resources from *any* URL provided in the diagram, without sufficient validation or restrictions.  This is the core of the vulnerability.
* **Configuration Options:** draw.io provides configuration options that can impact URL handling. For example, there might be settings to disable external resource loading or to specify a proxy server.

**2.3 Network Analysis:**

*   **Server Location:** The server running the PDF export service is located within the internal network.
*   **Internal Services:**  This server has access to other internal services, such as databases, file servers, and potentially sensitive internal APIs.
*   **External Access:**  The server likely has limited or no direct access to the public internet, but this needs to be verified.  A firewall should be in place.

**2.4 Vulnerability Testing (Conceptual):**

To test for this vulnerability, an attacker (or a security tester) would:

1.  **Create a Diagram:** Create a draw.io diagram.
2.  **Embed Malicious URLs:**  Embed URLs pointing to internal resources within the diagram.  Examples:
    *   `http://localhost:8080/admin` (Attempt to access a local admin panel)
    *   `http://192.168.1.100:22` (Attempt to access an internal server via SSH)
    *   `file:///etc/passwd` (Attempt to read a local file)
    *   `http://internal-api.example.com/sensitive-data` (Attempt to access an internal API)
3.  **Trigger Server-Side Processing:**  Use the application's functionality (e.g., the PDF export feature) to trigger the server-side component to process the diagram.
4.  **Monitor Network Traffic:**  Monitor the server's network traffic to see if it attempts to connect to the malicious URLs.  Tools like Wireshark or tcpdump could be used.
5.  **Analyze Responses:**  If the server attempts to connect, analyze the responses to see if any sensitive information is leaked.

**2.5 Mitigation Strategy Refinement:**

Based on the analysis, we refine the mitigation strategies:

1.  **URL Whitelisting (Highest Priority):**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Create a configuration file (e.g., `allowed_domains.json`) that lists the allowed domains and protocols for embedded URLs.  Example:
            ```json
            {
              "allowed_domains": [
                "example.com",
                "images.example.com",
                "cdn.example.net"
              ],
              "allowed_protocols": [
                "https",
                "http"
              ]
            }
            ```
        *   Modify the server-side code to:
            1.  Parse the diagram XML.
            2.  Extract all URLs (from image sources, hyperlinks, etc.).
            3.  For each URL:
                *   Check if the protocol is in the `allowed_protocols` list.
                *   Check if the domain is in the `allowed_domains` list.
                *   If either check fails, reject the URL (replace it with a placeholder, log an error, and *do not* attempt to fetch the resource).
    *   **Testing:**  Create diagrams with URLs that are both allowed and disallowed by the whitelist.  Verify that only allowed URLs are fetched.

2.  **Network Segmentation (High Priority):**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Ensure the server running the draw.io processing component (e.g., the PDF export service) is in a separate network segment (e.g., a DMZ or a dedicated application tier) with limited access to other internal networks.
        *   Use a firewall to strictly control inbound and outbound traffic to this server.  Only allow necessary connections.
    *   **Testing:**  Use network scanning tools to verify that the server cannot access sensitive internal resources.

3.  **Disable URL Loading (If Possible - Medium Priority):**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Investigate draw.io's configuration options to see if external resource loading can be completely disabled.  This might involve setting specific flags or properties when initializing draw.io.
        *   If a complete disable is not possible, explore options to disable specific types of resource loading (e.g., images).
    *   **Testing:**  Create diagrams with embedded URLs and verify that the server does not attempt to fetch them.

4.  **Input Validation (Medium Priority):**
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   In addition to whitelisting, implement input validation to reject URLs that contain suspicious characters or patterns.  For example:
            *   Reject URLs containing `..` (parent directory traversal).
            *   Reject URLs containing control characters.
            *   Reject URLs containing known SSRF payloads (e.g., `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`).
        *   Use a regular expression to enforce a strict URL format.
    *   **Testing:**  Create diagrams with URLs containing various suspicious characters and patterns.  Verify that these URLs are rejected.

5. **Update draw.io (High Priority):**
    * **Implementation:**
        * Regularly update the draw.io library to the latest version. Newer versions may include security fixes that address SSRF vulnerabilities.
        * Subscribe to draw.io's security advisories or release notes to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
    * **Testing:** After updating, re-run the vulnerability tests described above to ensure the update hasn't introduced any regressions.

6. **Least Privilege (High Priority):**
    * **Implementation:**
        * Ensure that the user account under which the server-side draw.io processing component runs has the *minimum* necessary privileges. It should not have administrative access or unnecessary permissions.
    * **Testing:** Review the user account's permissions and verify that they are restricted to only what's required for the application to function.

7. **Monitoring and Alerting (Medium Priority):**
    * **Implementation:**
        * Implement logging to record any attempts to access disallowed URLs.
        * Set up alerts to notify administrators of any suspicious activity, such as repeated attempts to access internal resources.
    * **Testing:** Trigger the SSRF vulnerability (in a controlled testing environment) and verify that logs are generated and alerts are triggered.

### 3. Conclusion

The SSRF vulnerability in draw.io, stemming from embedded URLs, poses a significant risk to applications that process diagrams server-side. By implementing a combination of URL whitelisting, network segmentation, input validation, and other mitigation strategies, we can significantly reduce this risk.  Regular security reviews, updates, and monitoring are crucial to maintaining a secure environment. This deep analysis provides a clear roadmap for developers to address this vulnerability and protect the application from potential attacks.
