# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jgraph/drawio

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Drawio Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_drawio_library.md)

**Description:**

1.  Establish a process to actively monitor the official drawio GitHub repository (https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) for new releases, security advisories, and reported vulnerabilities.
2.  Subscribe to release notifications or use automated tools to track updates specifically for the drawio library and its dependencies.
3.  Upon the release of a new stable version of drawio, especially those addressing security concerns, prioritize planning and scheduling an update within your application.
4.  Before deploying the updated drawio library to production, conduct thorough testing in a staging environment to verify compatibility with your application and identify any potential regressions in drawio functionality.
5.  Update your application's dependencies to incorporate the latest stable and secure version of the drawio library.
6.  After deployment to production, perform post-deployment verification to ensure the updated drawio library is functioning as expected.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   Exploitation of Known Drawio Vulnerabilities - High severity (if vulnerabilities are critical) to Medium severity (for less critical vulnerabilities).

**Impact:** High reduction in the risk of attackers exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities present in older versions of the drawio library. The impact is directly proportional to the severity of the vulnerabilities addressed in each update.

**Currently Implemented:** A manual quarterly check for updates is performed.

**Missing Implementation:** Automation of the update monitoring process and integration into the CI/CD pipeline for faster and more reliable updates is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize and Validate User-Provided Diagram Data](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_and_validate_user-provided_diagram_data.md)

**Description:**

1.  When your application allows users to upload or import drawio diagrams (typically in `.drawio` or `.xml` formats), implement robust server-side validation and sanitization of the diagram data *before* any processing or storage.
2.  Utilize a secure XML parsing library on the server-side to process the diagram XML. Avoid XML parsers known to be vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
3.  Validate the structure of the diagram XML against the expected drawio diagram schema to ensure it conforms to the correct format and prevent processing of malformed or intentionally malicious XML structures designed to exploit parsing vulnerabilities.
4.  Sanitize the diagram XML by systematically removing or neutralizing potentially harmful elements and attributes that are not essential for core drawio diagram functionality. This may include:
    *   Stripping or encoding potentially dangerous attributes like `xlink:href` or `data-uri` if they are not strictly required and could be misused for malicious purposes.
    *   Removing or sanitizing any embedded scripts, event handlers, or custom code snippets that might be present within diagram elements and could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   Restricting the allowed XML tags and attributes to a safe and necessary subset required for rendering and functionality of drawio diagrams within your application.
5.  Implement logging to record all sanitization actions performed on diagram data for auditing, debugging, and security monitoring purposes.
6.  Store only the sanitized and validated diagram data within your application's storage mechanisms.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   XML External Entity (XXE) Injection - High severity (if server-side XML processing is vulnerable)
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Diagram Data - Medium to High severity (depending on how diagram data is rendered and processed client-side)
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Malformed XML - Medium severity (if the XML parser is susceptible to resource exhaustion attacks from maliciously crafted XML)

**Impact:** High reduction in XXE and XSS risks originating from malicious or crafted drawio diagram files. Medium reduction in DoS risks related to XML parsing.

**Currently Implemented:** Basic file type validation to accept only `.drawio` and `.xml` files is in place.

**Missing Implementation:** Server-side XML parsing, schema validation against drawio schema, and comprehensive sanitization of diagram XML content are not yet implemented. This is a critical security gap in handling user-provided drawio diagrams.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review Drawio Configuration Options](./mitigation_strategies/review_drawio_configuration_options.md)

**Description:**

1.  Conduct a thorough review of all available configuration options provided by the drawio library, referring to the official drawio documentation and configuration guides.
2.  Identify drawio configuration settings that control features that could potentially introduce security risks if misconfigured or left at default insecure values.  Pay close attention to options related to:
    *   Enabling or disabling the execution of embedded JavaScript or custom scripts within drawio diagrams.
    *   Control over external resource loading, such as fonts, images, or stylesheets, from remote URLs.
    *   Settings related to diagram export and import formats and their associated security implications.
3.  Disable or restrict any drawio configuration options that are not strictly necessary for your application's intended drawio functionality and could increase the attack surface or introduce potential vulnerabilities.
4.  Document the chosen drawio configuration settings, including the rationale behind disabling or restricting specific features for security purposes. This documentation should be maintained for future reference and security audits.
5.  Incorporate a periodic review of drawio configuration settings as part of your regular security maintenance and update processes to ensure that the configuration remains secure and aligned with your application's security requirements as drawio evolves.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Medium to High severity (if drawio configuration allows execution of arbitrary scripts within diagrams)
*   Information Disclosure - Low to Medium severity (depending on the configuration and exposed features, potentially revealing internal information)

**Impact:** Medium reduction in XSS and Information Disclosure risks by disabling or restricting unnecessary and potentially risky drawio features through configuration.

**Currently Implemented:** Default drawio configuration is currently in use without specific security hardening adjustments.

**Missing Implementation:** A dedicated security review of drawio configuration options and the application of hardening settings to disable or restrict risky features is needed to minimize potential attack vectors.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Input Validation on Diagram Editing Features](./mitigation_strategies/implement_input_validation_on_diagram_editing_features.md)

**Description:**

1.  If your application exposes drawio's interactive diagram editing interface to users, implement both client-side and server-side input validation for all user actions and data inputs within the editor.
2.  Validate diagram element properties that users can modify through the editor, such as text content, URLs associated with shapes, custom attributes, and any other user-editable fields. Ensure that these inputs conform to expected formats and do not contain malicious code or unexpected characters that could be exploited.
3.  If your application's drawio integration allows for custom scripts or expressions within diagrams (which is generally discouraged for security reasons and should ideally be disabled or heavily restricted), implement extremely strict validation and sanitization of these inputs to rigorously prevent script injection vulnerabilities.
4.  Implement limits on the size and complexity of diagrams that users can create or edit through the drawio editor. This helps to prevent potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks or performance degradation caused by excessively large or complex diagrams that consume excessive resources.
5.  On the server-side, re-validate all diagram data received from the client-side drawio editor before saving or further processing it. This server-side validation acts as a crucial defense-in-depth measure, even if client-side validation is already in place, to ensure data integrity and security.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Diagram Editing - Medium severity (if the drawio editor allows users to inject malicious content into diagram elements or properties)
*   Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Diagrams - Low to Medium severity (depending on the potential for resource exhaustion caused by processing excessively complex diagrams created through the editor)

**Impact:** Medium reduction in XSS and DoS risks that could arise from malicious or unintended user interactions within the drawio editor interface.

**Currently Implemented:** Basic client-side validation exists for some general input fields within the application, but specific input validation tailored to the drawio editor and its features is not yet implemented.

**Missing Implementation:** Comprehensive input validation specifically designed for drawio editing features, covering both client-side and server-side, is required. This validation should focus on preventing script injection and mitigating DoS risks associated with diagram complexity.
