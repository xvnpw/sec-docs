*   **Malicious Diagram Definitions (XML/SVG leading to XXE)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can craft malicious draw.io diagram files (often XML-based) containing external entity declarations. When these diagrams are processed by the server or client application, it can lead to the disclosure of local files or internal network resources.
    *   **How drawio Contributes:** draw.io uses XML as a primary format for storing diagram definitions. If the application parses this XML without proper sanitization or disabling of external entities, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A malicious diagram includes code like `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" > ]><diagram>&xxe;</diagram>`. When the application parses this, it might attempt to read and potentially expose the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for further attacks by gaining access to sensitive files or internal services.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Disable XML External Entity (XXE) processing in the XML parser used to handle draw.io files. This is the most effective mitigation.
            *   If disabling XXE is not feasible, implement strict input validation and sanitization of diagram files, specifically looking for and removing external entity declarations.
            *   Use a non-vulnerable XML parser or keep the parser library up-to-date with security patches.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious about opening draw.io files from untrusted sources.

*   **Malicious Diagram Definitions (SVG leading to XSS)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers can embed malicious JavaScript code within SVG elements of a draw.io diagram. When the application renders or displays this SVG, the embedded script can execute in the user's browser.
    *   **How drawio Contributes:** draw.io allows exporting diagrams as SVG, which can contain embedded scripts. If the application directly renders this SVG without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable to XSS.
    *   **Example:** A malicious diagram exported as SVG contains `<svg><script>alert('XSS')</script></svg>`. When a user views this SVG in the application, the alert will execute.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Sanitize SVG output before rendering it in the browser. Remove or neutralize any `<script>` tags or event handlers that could execute JavaScript.
            *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevent inline script execution.
            *   Avoid directly rendering user-uploaded SVG content. Consider converting it to a safer format (e.g., raster image) if dynamic interactivity is not required.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Be cautious about interacting with draw.io diagrams from untrusted sources, especially if they are rendered as SVG.

*   **Malicious Custom JavaScript/Plugins**
    *   **Description:** If the application allows users to upload or utilize custom draw.io plugins or JavaScript extensions, attackers can introduce malicious code that can compromise the user's session or the application itself.
    *   **How drawio Contributes:** draw.io provides an API for extending its functionality through custom JavaScript and plugins. This extensibility, while powerful, introduces a risk if not carefully controlled.
    *   **Example:** A malicious plugin could contain code that steals user credentials, modifies diagram data without authorization, or makes unauthorized requests to external services.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data manipulation, unauthorized access, potential for server-side attacks if the plugin interacts with the server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict controls over the installation and execution of custom plugins.
            *   Code review all custom plugins before allowing their use.
            *   Run custom plugin code in a sandboxed environment with limited permissions.
            *   Provide a well-defined and secure API for plugin development to minimize the risk of vulnerabilities.
            *   Consider disabling or restricting the use of custom plugins if the risk is too high.
        *   **Users:**
            *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
            *   Be aware of the permissions requested by plugins.
