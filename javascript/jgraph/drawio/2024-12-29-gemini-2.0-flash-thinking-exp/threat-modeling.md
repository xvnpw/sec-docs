*   **Threat:** Client-Side Scripting (XSS) via Diagram Content
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious diagram containing embedded JavaScript or other active content. When a user views this diagram within the application, the malicious script executes in their browser. This could involve manipulating the DOM, stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or performing actions on their behalf. This directly involves draw.io's rendering of diagram content.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application interface, spreading malware to other users.
    *   **Affected draw.io Component:**  Rendering engine, specifically the part responsible for interpreting and displaying diagram elements and their attributes. This includes handling text within shapes, labels, and potentially embedded media or links.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to control the resources the browser is allowed to load.
        *   Sanitize and escape all diagram content *before* rendering it in the browser. This includes text within shapes, labels, and any attributes that might contain user-controlled data.
        *   Avoid using `innerHTML` or similar methods to render diagram content directly. Prefer safer DOM manipulation techniques.
        *   Regularly review and update the draw.io library to benefit from security patches.

*   **Threat:** Compromised Dependency
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency of the draw.io library. This could involve injecting malicious code into a library that draw.io relies on. When the application loads draw.io, the malicious code from the compromised dependency is also executed. This directly impacts the security of the draw.io library itself.
    *   **Impact:**  Full compromise of the client-side application, potential server-side compromise if the malicious code has access to backend resources or if server-side rendering is used. Data exfiltration, denial of service, and other malicious activities are possible.
    *   **Affected draw.io Component:**  The build process and dependency management of the draw.io library itself. This affects the entire library as the malicious code could be injected anywhere within the dependency tree.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Use dependency management tools with security scanning capabilities to identify and flag known vulnerabilities in draw.io's dependencies.
        *   Regularly update the draw.io library to benefit from updates that might address vulnerabilities in its dependencies.
        *   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to monitor the security of the application's dependencies.
        *   Implement subresource integrity (SRI) for draw.io and its dependencies if loaded from a CDN to ensure the integrity of the files.

*   **Threat:** External Resource Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a diagram that includes references to malicious external resources (e.g., images, stylesheets, scripts). When the application renders this diagram *using draw.io's rendering capabilities*, the browser attempts to load these resources from the attacker's server. This directly involves how draw.io handles external resources within diagrams.
    *   **Impact:**  Client-side scripting (XSS), information disclosure (e.g., IP address, browser information), potential for drive-by downloads if the external resource is a malicious file.
    *   **Affected draw.io Component:**  The part of the rendering engine that handles external resource references within diagram elements (e.g., image URLs, stylesheet links).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the domains from which the application can load resources.
        *   Sanitize and validate URLs within diagram data *before* draw.io attempts to load them.
        *   Avoid directly loading external resources referenced in the diagram. Consider downloading and serving them from your own domain or using a proxy.
        *   If external resources are necessary, implement a whitelist of allowed domains or protocols.
