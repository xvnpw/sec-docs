## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Drawio](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_drawio.md)

*   This path encompasses attacks that target vulnerabilities within the Drawio library running in the user's browser. Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of malicious code within the user's session, potentially compromising their data or allowing actions to be performed on their behalf.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH - CRITICAL NODE - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Diagram Content:**
        *   **HIGH-RISK PATH - Inject Malicious JavaScript in Diagram Data:** An attacker crafts a diagram containing malicious JavaScript code embedded within the diagram data (e.g., SVG attributes, XML elements).
        *   **CRITICAL NODE - Application renders diagram without proper sanitization (CRITICAL NODE):** When the application renders this diagram in a user's browser *without proper sanitization*, the embedded script executes. This can allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user. This is a **CRITICAL NODE** because it's the point where the malicious script is executed due to a lack of security measures.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Drawio Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_drawio_configuration.md)

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Drawio Configuration:**
        *   Application allows user-controlled Drawio configuration: If the application allows users to customize Drawio's configuration (e.g., loading custom plugins, themes, or setting custom editor configurations).
        *   Inject malicious scripts through configuration options (e.g., custom plugins, themes): An attacker can inject malicious scripts through these configuration options. Drawio's plugin mechanism, while powerful, can be a significant attack vector if not handled securely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Drawio's Plugin Mechanism](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_drawio's_plugin_mechanism.md)

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH - Exploiting Drawio's Plugin Mechanism:**
        *   Application allows users to load custom Drawio plugins: If the application allows users to load custom Drawio plugins.
        *   **CRITICAL NODE - Upload or inject a malicious plugin containing harmful code (CRITICAL NODE):** An attacker can upload or inject a malicious plugin containing harmful code. This code can then execute within the user's browser context, potentially compromising their session or system. This is a **CRITICAL NODE** because it introduces external, potentially malicious code into the application's environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Processing of Drawio Data](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_processing_of_drawio_data.md)

*   This path focuses on vulnerabilities that arise when the application processes diagram data on the server-side. Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized access to server resources, information disclosure, or even remote code execution on the server.

    *   **HIGH-RISK PATH - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Diagram Content:**
        *   Inject URLs pointing to internal resources or external services within the diagram data (e.g., in image links, hyperlinks): An attacker injects URLs pointing to internal resources or external services within the diagram data.
        *   Application's server-side processing of the diagram fetches these resources without proper validation: The server, without proper validation, attempts to fetch these resources, potentially exposing internal services or allowing the attacker to interact with external systems on behalf of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via Diagram Data](./attack_tree_paths/xml_external_entity__xxe__injection_via_diagram_data.md)

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH - CRITICAL NODE - XML External Entity (XXE) Injection via Diagram Data:**
        *   Inject malicious XML entities within the diagram data (if the application parses it as XML): An attacker injects malicious XML entities within the diagram data.
        *   **CRITICAL NODE - Application's server-side XML parser processes these entities, potentially leading to information disclosure or remote code execution (CRITICAL NODE):** If the application parses the diagram data as XML on the server-side *and processes these malicious entities*, it can lead to information disclosure (reading local files on the server) or even remote code execution if the server's XML parser is vulnerable. This is a **CRITICAL NODE** because it directly leads to severe consequences due to insecure XML parsing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **CRITICAL NODE - Deserialization Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Application serializes and deserializes Drawio diagram data: If the application serializes and deserializes Drawio diagram data (e.g., for storage or transmission).
        *   **CRITICAL NODE - Inject malicious serialized objects within the diagram data that, upon deserialization, execute arbitrary code on the server (CRITICAL NODE):** An attacker can inject malicious serialized objects within the diagram data. Upon deserialization *by the server*, these objects can execute arbitrary code on the server. This is a **CRITICAL NODE** due to the potential for immediate and complete server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Path Traversal via Diagram Filenames/Paths](./attack_tree_paths/path_traversal_via_diagram_filenamespaths.md)

*   **HIGH-RISK PATH - Path Traversal via Diagram Filenames/Paths:**
        *   Application allows users to specify filenames or paths related to diagrams: If the application allows users to specify filenames or paths related to diagrams (e.g., for saving or exporting).
        *   Inject malicious paths to access or overwrite sensitive files on the server: An attacker can inject malicious paths to access or overwrite sensitive files on the server's file system.
