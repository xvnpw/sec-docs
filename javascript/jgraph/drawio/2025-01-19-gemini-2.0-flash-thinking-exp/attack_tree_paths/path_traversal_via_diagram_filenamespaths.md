#### HIGH-RISK PATH - Path Traversal via Diagram Filenames/Paths

This high-risk path highlights a critical vulnerability where the application's handling of user-provided filenames or paths for diagram-related operations can be exploited to access or manipulate files outside the intended directory.

**Step 1: Application allows users to specify filenames or paths related to diagrams**

*   **Description:** This step establishes the prerequisite condition for the vulnerability. It means that the draw.io application, in some functionality, allows users to input or control the names or paths used when interacting with diagram files. This could occur during:
    *   **Saving Diagrams:** When a user saves a diagram, they typically provide a filename and potentially a location (path) to save it.
    *   **Exporting Diagrams:**  Similar to saving, exporting often involves specifying a filename and destination path for the exported file (e.g., PNG, SVG).
    *   **Potentially Loading Diagrams (Less Likely for this Specific Path but worth considering):** While the provided path focuses on saving/exporting, if the application allows loading diagrams by specifying a path, this could also be a point of vulnerability.
*   **Potential Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Direct Filename Input:**  The user interface directly allows typing in the filename and potentially a directory path.
    *   **API Parameters:** If the application has an API for saving or exporting diagrams, the filename and path might be parameters in the API request.
    *   **Configuration Files:** In some scenarios, configuration files might influence the default save locations or filename patterns, which could be manipulated if accessible.
*   **Impact:** This step itself doesn't cause harm, but it sets the stage for the exploitation in the next step. The impact is the *potential* for malicious path injection.
*   **Likelihood:**  High, as most applications dealing with file storage require users to specify filenames.
*   **Mitigation Strategies (at this stage, focusing on secure design):**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the application so that the user's ability to specify paths is limited to the intended directories.
    *   **Centralized File Handling:** Implement a centralized module for file operations to enforce security policies consistently.

**Step 2: Inject malicious paths to access or overwrite sensitive files on the server**

*   **Description:** This is the exploitation phase where an attacker leverages the ability to specify filenames or paths to inject malicious sequences that allow them to traverse the file system beyond the intended directory.
*   **Potential Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Relative Path Traversal:** Using sequences like `../` to navigate up the directory structure. For example, if the intended save directory is `/var/www/drawio/diagrams/`, an attacker could input a filename like `../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to access the system's password file.
    *   **Absolute Path Injection:** Providing an absolute path to a sensitive file. For example, specifying `/etc/shadow` as the filename.
    *   **URL Encoding/Double Encoding:**  Obfuscating malicious path sequences using URL encoding or double encoding to bypass basic input validation. For example, `..%2F` or `..%252F`.
    *   **Operating System Specific Paths:** Utilizing path separators specific to the underlying operating system (e.g., `\` on Windows if the server is running Windows).
*   **Impact:** This step can have severe consequences:
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Accessing sensitive files containing user data, configuration details, or application secrets.
    *   **Integrity Violation:** Overwriting critical system files, application binaries, or user data, leading to application malfunction or data corruption.
    *   **Availability Disruption:**  Overwriting essential files required for the application or operating system to function, leading to denial of service.
    *   **Potential for Remote Code Execution (Indirect):** In some scenarios, overwriting specific configuration files or application components could indirectly lead to remote code execution.
*   **Likelihood:**  Depends on the robustness of input validation and sanitization implemented by the application. If these measures are weak or absent, the likelihood is high.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Validation:** Implement robust validation on all user-provided filenames and paths. This includes:
        *   **Allowlisting:** Define a set of allowed characters and patterns for filenames.
        *   **Blacklisting:**  Block known malicious sequences like `../`, absolute paths, and encoded characters. However, blacklisting is generally less effective than allowlisting.
        *   **Canonicalization:** Convert the provided path to its canonical (absolute and normalized) form to identify and prevent traversal attempts.
    *   **Path Sanitization:**  Remove or replace potentially malicious characters or sequences from the input path.
    *   **Chroot Jails/Sandboxing:**  Restrict the application's access to a specific directory tree, preventing it from accessing files outside that boundary.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (File System Permissions):** Ensure the application process runs with the minimum necessary file system permissions.
    *   **Secure File Handling APIs:** Utilize secure file handling APIs provided by the programming language or framework that automatically handle path normalization and prevent traversal.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Proactively identify and address potential path traversal vulnerabilities.

### Overall Risk Assessment

The "Path Traversal via Diagram Filenames/Paths" attack path represents a **high-risk vulnerability**. The potential impact of a successful attack is significant, ranging from data breaches to complete system compromise. The likelihood depends heavily on the security measures implemented by the development team. Without proper input validation and secure file handling, this vulnerability is easily exploitable.

### Recommendations for the Development Team

1. **Prioritize Input Validation and Sanitization:** Implement strict validation and sanitization on all user-provided filenames and paths used for saving, exporting, and potentially loading diagrams. Focus on allowlisting and canonicalization techniques.
2. **Enforce the Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application process runs with the minimum necessary file system permissions.
3. **Utilize Secure File Handling APIs:** Leverage built-in security features of the programming language and framework to handle file operations securely.
4. **Implement Path Canonicalization:**  Convert user-provided paths to their canonical form before performing any file system operations.
5. **Consider Chroot Jails or Sandboxing:** If feasible, restrict the application's file system access to a specific directory.
6. **Conduct Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Specifically test for path traversal vulnerabilities in the diagram saving and exporting functionalities.
7. **Educate Developers:** Ensure the development team is aware of path traversal vulnerabilities and best practices for secure file handling.
8. **Implement Security Logging and Monitoring:** Log file access attempts, especially those that deviate from expected patterns, to detect and respond to potential attacks.

By addressing these recommendations, the development team can significantly reduce the risk associated with the "Path Traversal via Diagram Filenames/Paths" vulnerability and enhance the overall security of the draw.io application.
