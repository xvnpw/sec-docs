### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: SSRF via Diagram Content

#### 4.1. Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Path

The "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Diagram Content" attack path unfolds as follows:

1. **Attacker Injects Malicious URLs:** The attacker crafts a drawio diagram containing malicious URLs. These URLs can be embedded in various elements within the diagram data, such as:
    *   **Image Links:**  The `<img>` tags within the diagram's XML structure can have their `src` attribute set to a malicious URL.
    *   **Hyperlinks:** Shapes and text elements can have associated hyperlinks pointing to attacker-controlled or internal resources.
    *   **Potentially other elements:** Depending on how the server-side processing handles the diagram data, other elements might be susceptible to URL injection.

    **Example of malicious diagram data (simplified):**

    ```xml
    <mxGraphModel>
      <root>
        <mxCell id="0"/>
        <mxCell id="1" parent="0"/>
        <mxCell id="2" value="My Shape" style="shape=rectangle;perimeter=ellipsePerimeter;html=1;align=center;verticalAlign=top;" vertex="1" parent="1">
          <mxGeometry x="20" y="20" width="100" height="40" as="geometry"/>
        </mxCell>
        <mxCell id="3" value="Click Me" style="text;html=1;strokeColor=null;fillColor=null;align=center;verticalAlign=middle;whiteSpace=wrap;rounded=0;" vertex="1" parent="1">
          <mxGeometry x="150" y="20" width="60" height="30" as="geometry"/>
        </mxCell>
        <mxCell id="4" value="" style="edgeStyle=orthogonalEdgeStyle;rounded=0;orthogonalLoop=1;jettySize=auto;html=1;" edge="1" parent="1" source="2" target="3">
          <mxGeometry relative="1" as="geometry"/>
        </mxCell>
        <mxCell id="5" value="" style="image;html=1;labelBackgroundColor=none;image=https://internal.example.com/sensitive-data.txt" vertex="1" parent="1">
          <mxGeometry x="250" y="20" width="80" height="80" as="geometry"/>
        </mxCell>
        <mxCell id="6" value="External Link" style="text;html=1;strokeColor=null;fillColor=null;align=center;verticalAlign=middle;whiteSpace=wrap;rounded=0;fontColor=#0000FF;textDecoration=underline;" vertex="1" parent="1" link="https://attacker.com/steal-data">
          <mxGeometry x="350" y="20" width="100" height="30" as="geometry"/>
        </mxCell>
      </root>
    </mxGraphModel>
    ```

    In this example, `mxCell id="5"` attempts to load an image from an internal resource, and `mxCell id="6"` contains a hyperlink to an external attacker-controlled site.

2. **Server-Side Processing Fetches Resources:** When the application processes this diagram data on the server-side (e.g., for rendering a preview, converting to another format, or extracting information), it encounters these URLs. Without proper validation and sanitization, the server-side code attempts to fetch the resources pointed to by these URLs.

3. **SSRF Exploitation:** This is where the SSRF vulnerability is exploited. The server, acting on behalf of the attacker, makes requests to:
    *   **Internal Resources:** The attacker can target internal services, databases, or APIs that are not directly accessible from the public internet. This can lead to:
        *   **Information Disclosure:** Accessing sensitive configuration files, internal documentation, or data from internal systems.
        *   **Unauthorized Actions:** Triggering actions on internal services that the attacker would not normally be able to perform.
    *   **External Services:** The attacker can make the server interact with external services, potentially:
        *   **Port Scanning:** Probing open ports on internal or external networks.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Sending sensitive data to attacker-controlled servers.
        *   **Launching Attacks:** Using the server as a proxy to launch attacks against other systems.

#### 4.2. Vulnerability Analysis

The core vulnerabilities enabling this attack are:

*   **Lack of Input Validation and Sanitization:** The server-side processing of the drawio diagram data does not adequately validate or sanitize URLs embedded within the diagram. This allows malicious URLs to be processed without scrutiny.
*   **Unrestricted Outbound Requests:** The server-side application is configured to make outbound HTTP requests without proper restrictions or filtering. This allows the server to fetch arbitrary URLs provided in the diagram data.
*   **Insufficient Network Segmentation:**  If internal resources are accessible from the server processing the drawio data, the SSRF attack can reach these resources.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment

A successful SSRF attack via diagram content can have significant consequences:

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Accessing sensitive data residing on internal systems or exposed through internal services.
*   **Integrity Compromise:** Modifying data on internal systems if the targeted internal services allow write operations.
*   **Availability Disruption:**  Overloading internal services with requests, potentially leading to denial of service.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  If the attack is successful and publicized, it can damage the organization's reputation and erode trust.
*   **Compliance Violations:**  Exposure of sensitive data may lead to violations of data privacy regulations.
*   **Potential for Remote Code Execution (Indirect):** While not direct RCE on the drawio application itself, SSRF can be a stepping stone to RCE on vulnerable internal services.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of SSRF via diagram content, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Robust URL Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   Implement strict validation of URLs extracted from the drawio diagram data.
    *   Use a whitelist approach, allowing only known and trusted URL schemes (e.g., `https://` for external images from trusted sources).
    *   Sanitize URLs to remove potentially malicious characters or encoding.
*   **Restrict Outbound Requests:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to control and filter outbound HTTP requests made by the server-side application.
    *   Use an allow-list of allowed destination hosts or IP addresses.
    *   Consider using a dedicated proxy server for outbound requests, allowing for centralized control and monitoring.
*   **Network Segmentation:**
    *   Isolate the server processing drawio data from sensitive internal resources using firewalls and network segmentation.
    *   Implement the principle of least privilege, granting the server access only to the resources it absolutely needs.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** While primarily a client-side protection, if the processed diagram data is rendered in a web browser, a strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of injected malicious content.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Input Validation Libraries:** Utilize well-vetted and maintained libraries specifically designed for input validation and sanitization.
*   **Disable Unnecessary Features:** If the application doesn't require fetching external resources from diagram data, consider disabling this functionality altogether.
*   **Error Handling and Logging:** Implement proper error handling to prevent revealing internal information during failed requests. Log all outbound requests for auditing and monitoring purposes.

#### 4.5. Specific Considerations for Drawio

*   **XML Parsing:**  Be particularly cautious with how the server-side application parses the drawio XML data. Ensure that the XML parser is configured securely to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks, which can be related to SSRF.
*   **Image Handling Libraries:** If the application uses libraries to process images referenced in the diagram, ensure these libraries are up-to-date and free from known vulnerabilities.
*   **Custom Plugins/Extensions:** If the drawio implementation allows for custom plugins or extensions, these should be carefully reviewed for potential SSRF vulnerabilities.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Diagram Content" attack path represents a significant security risk for applications processing drawio data on the server-side. By understanding the mechanics of this attack, the underlying vulnerabilities, and the potential impact, development teams can implement effective mitigation strategies. Prioritizing robust input validation, strict control over outbound requests, and proper network segmentation are crucial steps in preventing this type of exploitation. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are essential to maintain a strong security posture.
