## Deep Analysis of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Diagram Import/Export in Draw.io Integration

This document provides a deep analysis of the potential Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) threat associated with the integration of the Draw.io library (https://github.com/jgraph/drawio) into our application, specifically focusing on diagram import and export functionalities.

### 1. Define Objective of Deep Analysis

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the potential risks associated with the identified SSRF threat in the context of our application's integration with Draw.io. This includes:

*   Verifying the feasibility of the threat based on Draw.io's architecture and our integration methods.
*   Identifying potential attack vectors and their likelihood.
*   Evaluating the potential impact of a successful SSRF attack.
*   Recommending specific and actionable mitigation strategies to minimize or eliminate the risk.

### 2. Scope

This analysis will focus specifically on the following aspects related to the SSRF threat:

*   **Diagram Import Functionality:**  How our application utilizes Draw.io's capabilities to import diagrams from external sources, particularly focusing on the handling of URLs provided by users.
*   **Diagram Export Functionality:** How our application utilizes Draw.io's capabilities to export diagrams to external destinations, again focusing on the handling of user-provided URLs or service endpoints.
*   **Client-Side Request Initiation:**  Whether the Draw.io client-side code directly initiates HTTP requests based on user input during import/export operations.
*   **Our Application's Integration Logic:** How our application interacts with the Draw.io library and handles user input related to import/export URLs.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:** Evaluating the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed mitigation strategies within our application's architecture.

This analysis will **not** cover:

*   Other potential vulnerabilities within the Draw.io library itself (unless directly relevant to the SSRF threat).
*   Network infrastructure security beyond the immediate context of the application.
*   Authentication and authorization mechanisms within our application (unless directly related to preventing SSRF).

### 3. Methodology

The following methodology will be employed for this deep analysis:

1. **Review Threat Description:**  Thoroughly review the provided threat description to understand the core vulnerability and its potential impact.
2. **Analyze Draw.io Architecture (Client-Side Focus):** Examine the Draw.io client-side codebase (specifically the import and export modules) to understand how it handles external URLs. This will involve:

7. **Document Findings and Recommendations:**  Compile the findings of the analysis into a comprehensive report with specific recommendations for mitigation.

### 4. Deep Analysis of SSRF Threat

**4.1 Understanding the Vulnerability:**

The core of this threat lies in the possibility that the Draw.io client-side code, running within the user's browser, directly makes HTTP requests to URLs provided by the user during diagram import or export. If this is the case, an attacker could manipulate these URLs to target internal resources or external services that the user's browser has access to, but the attacker should not.

**4.2 Potential Attack Vectors:**

If Draw.io directly handles external requests client-side, several attack vectors become possible:

*   **Accessing Internal Network Resources:** An attacker could provide a URL pointing to an internal IP address or hostname within the user's organization's network. This could allow them to:
    *   Scan internal ports and services.
    *   Access internal APIs or administrative interfaces that are not exposed to the public internet.
    *   Retrieve sensitive information from internal systems.
    *   Potentially interact with internal services to trigger actions.
    *   Example malicious import URL: `http://192.168.1.100:8080/admin`

*   **Accessing Cloud Metadata Services:** If the application is hosted in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP), an attacker could target the cloud provider's metadata service. This service often provides sensitive information about the instance, such as API keys, instance roles, and other credentials.
    *   Example malicious import URL (AWS): `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/`

*   **Interacting with Arbitrary External Services:** While less directly impactful than accessing internal resources, an attacker could potentially use the user's browser to make requests to arbitrary external services, potentially for:
    *   Denial-of-service attacks against specific targets.
    *   Leaking information by sending requests to attacker-controlled servers.

**4.3 Impact Assessment (Detailed):**

The impact of a successful SSRF attack in this scenario can be significant:

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Accessing internal resources could lead to the exposure of sensitive data, configuration files, or API keys.
*   **Integrity Violation:**  In some cases, attackers might be able to interact with internal services to modify data or configurations.
*   **Availability Disruption:**  Attacks targeting internal services could potentially disrupt their availability.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Gaining access to internal systems could be a stepping stone for further attacks within the organization's network.
*   **Reputation Damage:**  A successful attack could damage the reputation of the application and the organization.

**4.4 Draw.io Specific Considerations:**

It's crucial to understand how Draw.io handles import and export operations. While Draw.io is primarily a client-side JavaScript library, its functionalities might involve making requests to external resources depending on the specific import/export methods used.

*   **Import from URL:** If Draw.io's client-side code directly fetches the diagram data from a provided URL, it is vulnerable to client-side SSRF.
*   **Export to URL:** Similarly, if exporting involves sending the diagram data to a user-specified URL directly from the client-side, it presents an SSRF risk.

**4.5 Our Application's Role:**

Our application's integration with Draw.io is critical in mitigating this threat. If our application directly passes user-provided URLs to Draw.io's client-side import/export functions without any validation or sanitization, the vulnerability is likely to be exploitable.

**4.6 Limitations of Client-Side SSRF:**

It's important to note that client-side SSRF has limitations compared to server-side SSRF:

*   **Origin Restrictions (CORS):** Browsers enforce the Same-Origin Policy and CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), which can restrict the ability to access resources on different domains. However, this doesn't prevent attacks against resources on the same origin or those with permissive CORS policies.
*   **Limited Network Access:** The browser's network access is typically limited to what the user's machine can reach.

Despite these limitations, client-side SSRF can still pose a significant risk, especially when targeting internal network resources.

**4.7 Evaluation of Proposed Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Restrict Allowed Sources/Destinations (Whitelisting):** This is a highly effective mitigation strategy. By implementing a whitelist of allowed URLs or domains within our application's logic, we can prevent users from providing arbitrary URLs that could lead to SSRF. This should be implemented **on the server-side** to ensure it cannot be bypassed by manipulating client-side code.

*   **Robust Validation and Sanitization:**  While helpful, relying solely on client-side validation is insufficient as it can be bypassed. Server-side validation and sanitization of URLs are crucial. This includes:
    *   Verifying the URL scheme (e.g., allowing only `https`).
    *   Parsing the URL to extract the hostname and path.
    *   Checking the hostname against the whitelist.
    *   Potentially resolving the hostname to an IP address and checking if it's within an allowed range (though this can be complex and prone to bypasses).

*   **Handle Import/Export on the Server-Side:** This is the most robust mitigation strategy. By handling the import and export operations on our server, we have complete control over the requests being made. The client-side would send a request to our server with the desired URL, and our server would then make the actual request, applying necessary security checks and preventing direct client-side SSRF.

### 5. Conclusion

Based on this analysis, the potential for SSRF via diagram import/export in our Draw.io integration is a **high-risk** threat if Draw.io's client-side code directly handles external requests based on user-provided URLs and our application doesn't implement sufficient server-side controls.

While client-side SSRF has limitations, it can still be exploited to access internal resources and potentially cause significant damage.

The proposed mitigation strategies, particularly **server-side handling of import/export operations** and **server-side whitelisting**, are crucial for mitigating this risk effectively.

### 6. Recommendations

The following recommendations are made to address the identified SSRF threat:

1. **Prioritize Server-Side Handling:** Implement server-side logic to handle all diagram import and export operations that involve external URLs. The client-side should send a request to our server with the URL, and the server will perform the actual request after validation.
2. **Implement Server-Side Whitelisting:** If server-side handling is not immediately feasible for all import/export scenarios, implement a strict whitelist of allowed domains or URLs for import and export operations on the server-side.
3. **Robust Server-Side URL Validation and Sanitization:**  Regardless of the approach taken, implement robust server-side validation and sanitization of all user-provided URLs before they are used in any import/export process. This should include:
    *   Verifying the URL scheme (e.g., allow only `https`).
    *   Parsing the URL to extract components.
    *   Checking against the whitelist (if implemented).
    *   Consider blocking access to private IP address ranges.
4. **Review Draw.io Documentation and Code:**  Thoroughly review the Draw.io documentation and potentially the source code to confirm how import/export functionalities are implemented and whether client-side requests are involved.
5. **Security Testing:** Conduct thorough security testing, including penetration testing, to verify the effectiveness of the implemented mitigation strategies and identify any remaining vulnerabilities.
6. **Educate Developers:** Ensure developers are aware of the SSRF threat and best practices for secure URL handling.

By implementing these recommendations, we can significantly reduce the risk of SSRF and protect our application and its users from potential attacks.
