### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Maliciously Crafted Diagram Files (SVG with Embedded Scripts)

#### 4.1. Detailed Examination of the Attack Vector

The core of this attack surface lies in the ability to embed executable code within SVG files. While SVG is primarily a vector graphics format, it allows for the inclusion of JavaScript through several mechanisms:

* **`<script>` tags:**  The most direct method is embedding JavaScript code within `<script>` tags directly within the SVG markup. When the browser renders the SVG, it will execute the script.
* **`javascript:` URLs:**  JavaScript code can be embedded within attributes that accept URLs, such as `href` in `<a>` tags or event handlers like `onload` or `onclick`. When these elements are interacted with or loaded, the JavaScript code within the URL will execute.
* **Event Handlers:**  SVG elements can have event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`, `onmouseover`) that can execute JavaScript code when the corresponding event occurs.

**How drawio Contributes (Elaboration):**

`drawio`'s functionality to export diagrams as SVG is the key enabler for this attack. While `drawio` itself might have internal safeguards, the exported SVG file becomes a standalone entity. If the application using `drawio` then directly renders this exported SVG without proper sanitization, it becomes vulnerable.

The process typically involves:

1. **Attacker creates a malicious diagram:** The attacker uses `drawio` (or any SVG editor) to create a diagram and intentionally embeds malicious JavaScript code using one of the methods described above.
2. **Attacker exports the diagram as SVG:** The attacker exports the diagram from `drawio` in SVG format. This SVG file now contains the malicious script.
3. **User interaction within the application:**
    * **Upload:** A user uploads the malicious SVG file to the application.
    * **Storage:** The application stores the SVG file.
    * **Rendering/Viewing:** When another user (or even the same user) views the diagram within the application, the application renders the stored SVG file.
4. **Script Execution:** If the application directly renders the SVG without sanitization, the browser interprets the embedded JavaScript and executes it within the user's browser context.

**Example Breakdown:**

The provided example `<svg><script>alert('XSS')</script></svg>` clearly demonstrates the use of the `<script>` tag. When a browser renders this SVG, it encounters the `<script>` tag and executes the JavaScript code within it, resulting in an alert box.

More sophisticated attacks could involve:

* **Stealing session cookies:** `document.cookie` can be accessed and sent to an attacker's server.
* **Redirecting to malicious websites:** `window.location.href` can be used to redirect the user.
* **Keylogging:**  Event listeners can be attached to capture user input.
* **Defacing the application:**  The DOM can be manipulated to alter the appearance of the page.

#### 4.2. Impact Assessment (Detailed)

The impact of a successful XSS attack via malicious SVG files can be severe:

* **Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** This is the primary impact. The malicious script executes within the victim's browser, under the application's origin.
    * **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can steal session cookies, allowing them to impersonate the victim and gain unauthorized access to their account.
    * **Cookie Theft:**  Sensitive information stored in cookies can be exfiltrated.
    * **Credential Harvesting:**  Fake login forms can be injected to steal usernames and passwords.
    * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Users can be silently redirected to phishing sites or websites hosting malware.
    * **Defacement:** The application's interface can be altered to display misleading or harmful content.
    * **Information Disclosure:**  Sensitive data displayed on the page can be accessed and exfiltrated.
    * **Execution of Arbitrary Code:**  In some cases, vulnerabilities in the user's browser or plugins could be exploited to execute arbitrary code on their machine.

**Impact Categorization:**

* **Confidentiality:**  High. Sensitive user data, session cookies, and other confidential information can be compromised.
* **Integrity:** High. The application's interface and data displayed can be manipulated, leading to a loss of trust and potential misinformation.
* **Availability:** Medium. While the application itself might remain available, the user experience can be severely disrupted, and users might be redirected away from the legitimate application.

#### 4.3. Evaluation of Mitigation Strategies

**4.3.1. Server-Side SVG Sanitization:**

* **Strengths:**
    * **Proactive Defense:** Sanitization happens before the SVG is rendered to the user, preventing malicious scripts from ever reaching the browser.
    * **Centralized Control:**  Sanitization logic is implemented on the server, ensuring consistent application across all users.
    * **Effective against known threats:** Well-maintained sanitization libraries like DOMPurify can effectively remove or neutralize common XSS vectors in SVG.

* **Weaknesses:**
    * **Bypass Potential:** Attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass sanitization rules. Regular updates to the sanitization library are crucial.
    * **Complexity:**  Implementing robust sanitization can be complex, requiring careful consideration of various SVG elements and attributes.
    * **Performance Overhead:** Sanitization adds processing overhead to the server.
    * **Potential for Over-Sanitization:**  Aggressive sanitization might inadvertently remove legitimate SVG features or break the intended rendering of the diagram.

**Key Considerations for Effective Sanitization:**

* **Whitelist Approach:**  Prefer a whitelist approach, allowing only known safe elements and attributes, rather than blacklisting potentially dangerous ones.
* **Attribute Sanitization:**  Carefully sanitize attributes that can accept URLs or JavaScript code (e.g., `href`, `xlink:href`, event handlers).
* **Regular Updates:**  Keep the sanitization library up-to-date to address newly discovered bypass techniques.
* **Contextual Sanitization:**  Consider the specific context in which the SVG is being used. Different levels of sanitization might be appropriate for different use cases.

**4.3.2. Content Security Policy (CSP):**

* **Strengths:**
    * **Defense in Depth:** CSP provides an additional layer of security even if sanitization is bypassed.
    * **Mitigates various XSS attacks:** CSP can prevent inline scripts, restrict script sources, and prevent other types of XSS.
    * **Browser-Level Enforcement:** CSP is enforced by the user's browser, providing a strong security mechanism.

* **Weaknesses:**
    * **Implementation Complexity:**  Configuring CSP correctly can be challenging, especially for complex applications.
    * **Potential for Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configured CSP can break application functionality or provide a false sense of security.
    * **Browser Compatibility:**  Older browsers might not fully support CSP.
    * **Reporting Challenges:**  Monitoring and analyzing CSP violation reports can be complex.

**Key Considerations for Effective CSP:**

* **Start with a restrictive policy:** Begin with a strict policy that only allows necessary resources and gradually relax it as needed.
* **`script-src` directive:**  Carefully define allowed sources for JavaScript. Avoid using `'unsafe-inline'` which defeats the purpose of CSP for inline script protection. Consider using nonces or hashes for inline scripts if absolutely necessary.
* **`object-src` directive:** Restrict the sources from which plugins (like Flash) can be loaded.
* **`frame-ancestors` directive:**  Prevent the application from being embedded in malicious iframes.
* **Report-URI or report-to directive:**  Configure CSP reporting to monitor for violations and identify potential attacks or misconfigurations.

#### 4.4. Identifying Potential Weaknesses and Gaps

* **Client-Side Rendering without Sanitization:** If the application relies solely on client-side JavaScript to render the SVG without any server-side sanitization, it is highly vulnerable.
* **Insufficient Sanitization Rules:**  If the server-side sanitization rules are not comprehensive or up-to-date, attackers might find ways to craft SVG files that bypass the filters.
* **Misconfigured CSP:**  A poorly configured CSP might not effectively prevent the execution of malicious inline scripts or scripts from attacker-controlled domains.
* **User Education Gaps:**  Users might not be aware of the risks associated with uploading untrusted SVG files.
* **Lack of Input Validation Beyond SVG Structure:**  The application might not be validating the content of the SVG beyond its basic structure, allowing malicious scripts to slip through.
* **Focus on `<script>` Tag Only:**  Overlooking other methods of embedding JavaScript, such as `javascript:` URLs in attributes or event handlers, can leave vulnerabilities open.

#### 4.5. Actionable Recommendations

To effectively mitigate the risk of maliciously crafted SVG files, the following recommendations should be implemented:

1. **Prioritize Server-Side SVG Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side sanitization using a well-vetted library like DOMPurify. Configure it with a strict whitelist approach, focusing on allowing only safe SVG elements and attributes. Regularly update the sanitization library.
2. **Implement a Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Deploy a strict CSP that disallows inline scripts (`'unsafe-inline'`) and restricts script sources to trusted domains. Consider using nonces or hashes for any necessary inline scripts. Configure CSP reporting to monitor for violations.
3. **Input Validation Beyond SVG Structure:**  Implement additional input validation to check the content of uploaded SVG files for potentially malicious patterns beyond just the XML structure.
4. **Educate Users:**  Inform users about the potential risks of uploading SVG files from untrusted sources. Provide guidance on how to identify potentially malicious files.
5. **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting this attack surface to identify any weaknesses in the implemented mitigations.
6. **Consider Sandboxing SVG Rendering:** Explore the possibility of rendering SVG files in a sandboxed environment (e.g., using an iframe with restricted permissions) to limit the potential impact of malicious scripts.
7. **Monitor for Suspicious Activity:** Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect unusual activity related to SVG file uploads or rendering, which could indicate an attempted attack.
8. **Stay Updated on Security Best Practices:** Continuously monitor security advisories and research new attack techniques related to SVG and XSS to ensure the application's defenses remain effective.
