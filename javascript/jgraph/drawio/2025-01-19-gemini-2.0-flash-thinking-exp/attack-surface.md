# Attack Surface Analysis for jgraph/drawio

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Diagram Files (SVG with Embedded Scripts)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_diagram_files__svg_with_embedded_scripts_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can create diagram files (often in SVG format) that contain embedded JavaScript or other active content. When these diagrams are loaded or rendered by the application, the malicious script can execute within the user's browser.
    *   **How drawio Contributes:** draw.io allows users to export diagrams as SVG, which can embed `<script>` tags or use `javascript:` URLs within SVG elements. If the application directly renders this SVG without sanitization, the embedded scripts will execute.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a `.drawio` file that, when exported as SVG by the application, contains `<svg><script>alert('XSS')</script></svg>`. When another user views this diagram, the `alert('XSS')` will execute in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, or execution of arbitrary code within the user's browser context.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Server-Side SVG Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side sanitization of SVG content before rendering it in the application. Remove or neutralize potentially harmful elements and attributes like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `onload`, `onerror`, and `javascript:` URLs. Libraries like DOMPurify can be used for this purpose.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevents inline script execution. This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Maliciously Crafted Diagram Files (XML External Entity - XXE)](./attack_surfaces/maliciously_crafted_diagram_files__xml_external_entity_-_xxe_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can craft diagram files (typically in the underlying XML format of `.drawio` files) that exploit XML External Entity (XXE) vulnerabilities. This allows them to access local files on the server or internal network resources.
    *   **How drawio Contributes:** draw.io uses XML to store diagram definitions. If the server-side processing of these `.drawio` files (if any) uses an XML parser that is not properly configured to prevent XXE, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** A malicious `.drawio` file contains an external entity definition like `<!DOCTYPE foo [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]><mxGraphModel><root><mxCell value="&xxe;"/></root></mxGraphModel>`. If the server-side processing parses this without disabling external entities, it could expose the contents of `/etc/passwd`.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure (access to sensitive files), denial of service, and potentially remote code execution in some scenarios.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable External Entities in XML Parsers:** Ensure that the XML parser used for processing `.drawio` files on the server has external entity processing disabled by default or is explicitly configured to do so. This is the primary defense against XXE.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Vulnerabilities in the draw.io Library](./attack_surfaces/client-side_vulnerabilities_in_the_draw_io_library.md)

*   **Description:** The draw.io JavaScript library itself might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., DOM-based XSS, prototype pollution) that could be exploited if an attacker can influence the data processed by the library.
    *   **How drawio Contributes:** The application relies on the draw.io library for rendering and interacting with diagrams. Vulnerabilities within this library directly impact the application's security.
    *   **Example:** A specific version of the draw.io library might have a known DOM-based XSS vulnerability that can be triggered by crafting a diagram with specific properties.
    *   **Impact:** Client-side XSS, denial of service, unexpected behavior within the diagram rendering.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep draw.io Library Updated:** Regularly update the draw.io library to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities. Subscribe to security advisories and release notes.
        *   **Security Audits and Static Analysis:** Consider performing security audits or using static analysis tools on the draw.io library (if feasible) or relying on community efforts and reports.
