# Threat Model Analysis for jgraph/drawio

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Diagram Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_diagram_content.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Diagram Content
    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a diagram file containing malicious JavaScript code embedded within diagram elements (e.g., labels, attributes, custom XML). When a user opens this diagram within the application, the malicious script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the user to a phishing site, or perform actions on their behalf within the application. This vulnerability resides within Draw.io's diagram parsing and rendering logic.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, unauthorized actions within the application, reputation damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** Diagram Rendering Engine (within Draw.io).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust sanitization and encoding of diagram data *by the integrating application* before rendering it in the browser. This should ideally happen after Draw.io processes the diagram data.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and executed. This is a browser-level security mechanism that can mitigate the impact of XSS.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed iframe to render diagrams, limiting the impact of any executed scripts.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution Vulnerability](./threats/prototype_pollution_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Draw.io's code that allows them to manipulate the prototype of built-in JavaScript objects. This can lead to unexpected behavior, security bypasses, or even the ability to execute arbitrary code within the context of the Draw.io component. This is a vulnerability within Draw.io's JavaScript codebase.
    *   **Impact:**  Significant security compromise, potential for arbitrary code execution within the Draw.io context, data manipulation, or denial of service affecting the diagramming functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** Various modules within Draw.io that handle object creation and manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Draw.io library updated to the latest version, as security patches often address prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization *by the integrating application* before passing data to Draw.io, to prevent the introduction of malicious data that could trigger these vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Diagram Import/Export (if Draw.io handles external requests directly)](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_diagram_importexport__if_draw_io_handles_external_requests_di_54223e8b.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Diagram Import/Export (if Draw.io handles external requests directly)
    *   **Description:** If the application allows importing diagrams from arbitrary URLs or exporting diagrams to external services *and Draw.io's client-side code directly initiates these requests*, and if Draw.io's implementation is vulnerable, an attacker could provide a malicious URL that causes the user's browser (running Draw.io code) to make requests to internal or external resources that it should not have access to.
    *   **Impact:**  Access to internal resources from the user's browser, potential for data exfiltration, or launching attacks against other systems from the user's context.
    *   **Affected Component:** Modules within Draw.io responsible for handling diagram import and export functionalities that involve external URLs.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Restrict the allowed sources for diagram imports and destinations for exports to a predefined whitelist *within the integrating application's logic*.
        *   Implement robust validation and sanitization of URLs provided for import/export operations *before passing them to Draw.io*.
        *   Ideally, handle import/export operations on the server-side to have more control over the requests being made.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Draw.io relies on various third-party JavaScript libraries. If these dependencies have known high or critical severity vulnerabilities, an attacker could potentially exploit them through the Draw.io integration. This is a risk inherent in Draw.io's dependency management.
    *   **Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability in the dependency, but it could range from XSS to remote code execution within the user's browser while using Draw.io.
    *   **Affected Component:** The specific modules within Draw.io that utilize the vulnerable dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability (High to Critical).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update the Draw.io library to benefit from updates to its dependencies.
        *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in Draw.io's dependencies. This is something the developers of the integrating application should do.
