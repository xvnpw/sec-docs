# Threat Model Analysis for jgraph/drawio

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Diagram Data](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_diagram_data.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Diagram Data
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious diagram file (e.g., XML, JSON) containing embedded JavaScript code. When a user opens or renders this diagram within the draw.io editor embedded in the application, the malicious JavaScript executes in the user's browser, within the application's context. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, deface the application, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, session hijacking, defacement of the application, redirection to malicious sites, unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected Drawio Component:** Diagram parsing and rendering modules (e.g., XML/JSON parsing, diagram rendering engine).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep draw.io library updated: Regularly update to the latest stable version to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Server-side diagram data sanitization:  If feasible, validate and sanitize diagram data on the server-side before it's processed by the client-side draw.io library.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded and disable inline script execution.
    *   Input validation on client-side: While server-side is preferred, perform client-side input validation on diagram data before processing by draw.io if server-side validation is not possible or as an additional layer of defense.

## Threat: [DOM-Based XSS due to Client-Side Rendering Logic](./threats/dom-based_xss_due_to_client-side_rendering_logic.md)

*   **Threat:** DOM-Based XSS due to Client-Side Rendering Logic
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in draw.io's client-side JavaScript code that manipulates the DOM. Malicious input, potentially injected through other application features or user interactions, is processed by draw.io's rendering logic in a way that leads to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the user's browser. The attacker might manipulate the page content, steal user data, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, session hijacking, defacement of the application, unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected Drawio Component:** Client-side JavaScript code responsible for DOM manipulation and rendering (e.g., UI components, event handlers, rendering functions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep draw.io library updated: Regularly update to the latest stable version to benefit from security fixes addressing DOM-based XSS.
    *   Security audits of custom integrations: Carefully review any custom code or modifications to draw.io's client-side code for potential DOM XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Client-side input validation and output encoding: Implement client-side input validation and output encoding where applicable, even within the draw.io integration context, to prevent injection of malicious code.
    *   Regular security testing: Conduct regular security testing, including penetration testing and code reviews, to identify and address potential DOM XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Information Disclosure via Diagram Data Storage](./threats/information_disclosure_via_diagram_data_storage.md)

*   **Threat:** Information Disclosure via Diagram Data Storage
*   **Description:** Draw.io diagrams can contain sensitive information. If the application relies on insecure storage mechanisms for diagram data, such as browser local storage without encryption or unencrypted server-side storage, an attacker who gains access to the user's browser or the application's storage can access and read the sensitive information contained within the diagrams. This is especially relevant if the application uses draw.io's default storage options without implementing additional security measures for sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, exposure of sensitive business or personal information, privacy violation.
*   **Affected Drawio Component:** Draw.io's storage mechanisms (if used directly by the application), application's storage implementation for diagram data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if sensitive data is stored)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure server-side storage: Implement secure server-side storage for diagram data with appropriate access controls and encryption at rest and in transit (HTTPS).
    *   Avoid default local storage for sensitive data: Do not rely solely on draw.io's default local storage if diagrams contain sensitive information.
    *   Encrypted client-side storage (if necessary): If client-side storage is required, use browser APIs for secure storage like IndexedDB with encryption and implement proper key management.
    *   Data minimization:  Minimize the amount of sensitive information stored in diagrams.
    *   User education: Educate users about the risks of storing sensitive information in diagrams and provide guidance on secure practices.
