### 4. Deep Analysis of XXE Attack Surface in Drawio Applications

#### 4.1. Understanding the XXE Vulnerability in Drawio Context

XML External Entity (XXE) injection is a vulnerability that arises when an XML parser processes XML input containing references to external entities. If the parser is not configured to properly restrict external entity resolution, an attacker can inject malicious XML code that forces the parser to:

*   **Access local files:** Read sensitive files from the server's file system.
*   **Make outbound network requests (SSRF):**  Initiate requests to internal or external systems, potentially bypassing firewalls or accessing internal services.
*   **Cause Denial of Service (DoS):**  By referencing extremely large or recursively defined external entities, leading to resource exhaustion.

In the context of drawio, the vulnerability stems from the fact that drawio diagrams are often stored and processed in XML formats (`.drawio`, `.xml`). If a server-side application or component processes these drawio XML files without proper security measures, it becomes susceptible to XXE injection.

**Drawio's Role and XML Processing:**

*   **Diagram Storage:** Drawio diagrams are fundamentally XML-based. The `.drawio` format is essentially a compressed XML file. Even when exporting to `.xml`, the core structure remains XML.
*   **Server-Side Processing Scenarios:**  Applications might use drawio diagrams server-side for various purposes:
    *   **Server-Side Rendering:** Generating images (PNG, SVG, PDF) of diagrams for display or reporting. This often involves parsing the `.drawio` or `.xml` file on the server.
    *   **Diagram Conversion/Manipulation:**  Backend services might process drawio files to extract data, convert formats, or perform automated diagram analysis.
    *   **Diagram Storage and Retrieval:**  Server-side applications might store and retrieve drawio diagrams, potentially parsing them during these operations.
    *   **Collaboration Features:** Real-time collaboration features might involve server-side processing of diagram changes represented in XML.

#### 4.2. Potential Entry Points for XXE Attacks in Drawio Applications

Several entry points can expose drawio applications to XXE vulnerabilities:

1.  **File Upload/Import Functionality:**
    *   **Scenario:** Users upload `.drawio` or `.xml` diagram files to the server.
    *   **Vulnerability:** If the server-side application parses these uploaded files without disabling external entity resolution, a malicious file containing an XXE payload can trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A user uploads a `.drawio` file crafted with an XXE payload designed to read `/etc/passwd` when the server processes the file.

2.  **API Endpoints for Diagram Processing:**
    *   **Scenario:**  APIs that accept diagram data (XML or `.drawio` format) as input for processing, such as rendering or conversion.
    *   **Vulnerability:** If the API backend parses the received XML data without proper XXE protection, it becomes vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint designed to convert a `.drawio` diagram to PNG receives a malicious XML payload in the request body, leading to SSRF when the server attempts to resolve the external entity.

3.  **Server-Side Rendering Libraries/Components:**
    *   **Scenario:**  Applications utilize server-side libraries or components to render drawio diagrams into images or other formats.
    *   **Vulnerability:** If these rendering libraries internally use XML parsers that are not securely configured, they can introduce XXE vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** A server-side rendering library used to generate diagram previews uses a vulnerable XML parser, allowing an attacker to trigger XXE by providing a malicious `.drawio` file for rendering.

4.  **Diagram Storage and Retrieval Mechanisms:**
    *   **Scenario:**  Server-side applications parse diagram files when storing or retrieving them from databases or file systems.
    *   **Vulnerability:** If the parsing process during storage or retrieval is vulnerable to XXE, an attacker could exploit this by uploading a malicious diagram file that is parsed later.
    *   **Example:**  A system stores drawio diagrams in a database. When a diagram is retrieved and parsed for display, an XXE vulnerability in the parsing process allows an attacker to read files from the server.

#### 4.3. Example XXE Payloads in Drawio Diagrams

Here are examples of XXE payloads that could be embedded within a `.drawio` or `.xml` drawio diagram file:

**Example 1: Local File Disclosure (Reading `/etc/passwd`)**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
]>
<mxfile host="app.diagrams.net" modified="2024-01-26T10:00:00.000Z" agent="5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" etag="your_etag" version="22.1.11" type="device">
  <diagram id="your_diagram_id" name="Page-1">
    <mxGraphModel dx="896" dy="558" grid="1" gridSize="10" guides="1" tooltips="1" connect="1" arrows="1" fold="1" page="1" pageScale="1" pageWidth="850" pageHeight="1100" math="0" shadow="0">
      <root>
        <mxCell id="0"/>
        <mxCell id="1" parent="0"/>
        <mxCell id="2" value="XXE Payload: &xxe;" style="rounded=1;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;" vertex="1" parent="1">
          <mxGeometry x="200" y="100" width="120" height="60" as="geometry"/>
        </mxCell>
      </root>
    </mxGraphModel>
  </diagram>
</mxfile>
```

In this example, the `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration defines an external entity named `xxe` that attempts to read the `/etc/passwd` file. When the XML parser processes this file and resolves the entity `&xxe;`, it will attempt to read the file. The content of `/etc/passwd` might then be exposed in error messages, logs, or reflected back to the attacker depending on the application's behavior.

**Example 2: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) - Accessing Internal Service**

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [
  <!ENTITY ssrf SYSTEM "http://internal-service:8080/sensitive-data">
]>
<mxfile host="app.diagrams.net" modified="2024-01-26T10:00:00.000Z" agent="5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/120.0.0.0 Safari/537.36" etag="your_etag" version="22.1.11" type="device">
  <diagram id="your_diagram_id" name="Page-1">
    <mxGraphModel dx="896" dy="558" grid="1" gridSize="10" guides="1" tooltips="1" connect="1" arrows="1" fold="1" page="1" pageScale="1" pageWidth="850" pageHeight="1100" math="0" shadow="0">
      <root>
        <mxCell id="0"/>
        <mxCell id="1" parent="0"/>
        <mxCell id="2" value="SSRF Payload: &ssrf;" style="rounded=1;whiteSpace=wrap;html=1;" vertex="1" parent="1">
          <mxGeometry x="200" y="100" width="120" height="60" as="geometry"/>
        </mxCell>
      </root>
    </mxGraphModel>
  </diagram>
</mxfile>
```

Here, the `ssrf` entity attempts to make an HTTP request to `http://internal-service:8080/sensitive-data`. If the server-side application processes this XML, it will initiate an outbound request to the specified internal service. This can be used to probe internal networks, access internal APIs, or potentially exploit vulnerabilities in internal systems.

#### 4.4. Impact of Successful XXE Exploitation

The impact of successful XXE exploitation in drawio applications can be significant and range from **High** to **Critical** depending on the context and the attacker's objectives:

*   **Confidentiality Breach (High to Critical):**
    *   **Local File Disclosure:** Attackers can read sensitive files from the server's file system, such as configuration files, application code, databases, or user data. This can lead to exposure of credentials, API keys, business logic, and personally identifiable information (PII).
    *   **Data Exfiltration:**  Attackers can potentially exfiltrate large amounts of data by reading multiple files or using out-of-band XXE techniques.

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) (High to Critical):**
    *   **Internal Network Scanning:** Attackers can use the vulnerable server as a proxy to scan internal networks and identify open ports and services.
    *   **Access to Internal Services:** Attackers can access internal APIs, databases, or other services that are not directly accessible from the internet.
    *   **Exploitation of Internal Vulnerabilities:** SSRF can be chained with other vulnerabilities in internal systems to gain further access or control.

*   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium to High):**
    *   **Entity Expansion Attacks:**  Attackers can craft XML payloads with deeply nested or recursively defined external entities, causing the XML parser to consume excessive resources (CPU, memory) and potentially leading to application crashes or slowdowns.
    *   **External Resource Exhaustion:**  Attackers can force the server to make numerous or time-consuming requests to external resources, leading to resource exhaustion and DoS.

*   **Potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical - in specific scenarios):**
    *   In highly specific and less common scenarios, if the application environment and XML processing libraries are configured in a particular way, XXE vulnerabilities *could* potentially be leveraged for Remote Code Execution. This is less direct and less frequent than the other impacts but should not be entirely dismissed in highly sensitive environments.

#### 4.5. Mitigation Strategies for XXE in Drawio Applications

To effectively mitigate XXE vulnerabilities in drawio applications, the following strategies should be implemented:

1.  **Disable External Entity Resolution (Strongest Mitigation):**
    *   **Action:** Configure the XML parser used by the server-side application or rendering library to **completely disable external entity and DTD processing**. This is the most effective and recommended mitigation.
    *   **Implementation:**  The specific method for disabling external entity resolution depends on the XML parser library being used (e.g., in Java, using `SAXParserFactory` or `DocumentBuilderFactory` to disable features like `FEATURE_EXTERNAL_GENERAL_ENTITIES` and `FEATURE_EXTERNAL_PARAMETER_ENTITIES`).
    *   **Example (Conceptual Java):**
        ```java
        SAXParserFactory factory = SAXParserFactory.newInstance();
        factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-general-entities", false);
        factory.setFeature("http://xml.org/sax/features/external-parameter-entities", false);
        factory.setFeature("http://apache.org/xml/features/nonvalidating/load-external-dtd", false);
        // ... use factory to create parser ...
        ```
    *   **Rationale:**  By disabling external entity resolution, the XML parser will ignore any attempts to reference external entities, effectively neutralizing XXE attacks.

2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (Defense in Depth):**
    *   **Action:**  Validate and sanitize diagram data before processing it server-side. This involves inspecting the XML content for potentially malicious structures, including `<!DOCTYPE>` declarations and external entity references.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Schema Validation:**  Validate the XML against a strict schema (XSD) that does not allow external entities or DTDs.
        *   **Content Filtering:**  Parse the XML and remove or neutralize any `<!DOCTYPE>` declarations or external entity references before further processing.
        *   **Regular Expression Filtering (Less Robust):**  Use regular expressions to detect and remove potentially malicious XML structures, but this approach is less reliable and prone to bypasses compared to proper XML parsing and schema validation.
    *   **Rationale:**  Input validation and sanitization act as a defense-in-depth measure. Even if the XML parser is not perfectly configured, sanitizing the input can prevent malicious payloads from reaching the parser. **However, this should not be relied upon as the primary mitigation.** Disabling external entity resolution is still crucial.

3.  **Principle of Least Privilege (Security Best Practice):**
    *   **Action:**  Run server-side components that process drawio files with the minimal necessary privileges.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Dedicated User Accounts:**  Use dedicated user accounts with restricted permissions for server-side processes.
        *   **File System Permissions:**  Limit file system access for these processes to only the directories and files they absolutely need to access.
        *   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate server-side components in network segments with restricted access to internal resources.
    *   **Rationale:**  If an XXE vulnerability is exploited despite other mitigations, limiting the privileges of the affected process can reduce the potential impact. For example, if the process cannot read sensitive files due to file system permissions, local file disclosure attacks will be less effective.

4.  **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    *   **Action:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential XXE vulnerabilities in drawio applications.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   **Code Reviews:**  Review code that processes drawio files for proper XML parsing configurations and input validation.
        *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use automated vulnerability scanners to detect potential XXE vulnerabilities.
        *   **Penetration Testing:**  Engage security professionals to perform manual penetration testing, specifically targeting XXE attack vectors in drawio applications.
    *   **Rationale:**  Regular security assessments help to proactively identify and remediate vulnerabilities before they can be exploited by attackers.

5.  **Keep Libraries and Dependencies Up-to-Date:**
    *   **Action:**  Ensure that all XML parsing libraries and dependencies used in server-side components are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Implementation:**  Regularly update dependencies using package managers and dependency management tools. Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in used libraries.
    *   **Rationale:**  Software vulnerabilities are constantly being discovered and patched. Keeping libraries up-to-date helps to protect against known vulnerabilities, including those related to XML parsing.

#### 4.6. Limitations of Mitigations and Potential Bypasses

While the mitigation strategies outlined above are effective, it's important to be aware of potential limitations and bypasses:

*   **Configuration Errors:**  Incorrectly configuring XML parsers or overlooking certain parsing libraries can lead to incomplete mitigation. Thorough testing and verification are crucial.
*   **Complex XML Structures:**  Sophisticated XXE payloads might attempt to bypass basic input validation or sanitization rules. Robust schema validation and proper XML parsing are essential.
*   **Application Logic Flaws:**  Vulnerabilities in application logic might inadvertently expose data obtained through XXE, even if the XML parsing itself is secure. Secure coding practices are necessary throughout the application.
*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  New XXE vulnerabilities in XML parsing libraries might be discovered that are not yet addressed by patches or mitigations. Defense-in-depth strategies and proactive security monitoring are important to mitigate unknown threats.

### 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

XML External Entity (XXE) Injection poses a significant security risk to applications that process drawio diagrams server-side. The XML-based nature of drawio files makes them a potential carrier for XXE payloads. Successful exploitation can lead to serious consequences, including confidentiality breaches, SSRF, and DoS.

**Recommendations for Development Teams:**

*   **Prioritize Disabling External Entity Resolution:**  This is the most critical mitigation. Ensure that all XML parsers used in server-side drawio processing are configured to disable external entity and DTD processing.
*   **Implement Input Validation and Sanitization:**  As a defense-in-depth measure, validate and sanitize diagram data to remove or neutralize potentially malicious XML structures.
*   **Apply the Principle of Least Privilege:**  Run server-side components with minimal necessary privileges to limit the impact of potential exploits.
*   **Conduct Regular Security Assessments:**  Perform regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address XXE vulnerabilities.
*   **Keep Dependencies Up-to-Date:**  Maintain up-to-date XML parsing libraries and dependencies to benefit from security patches.
*   **Educate Developers:**  Train developers on XXE vulnerabilities and secure XML processing practices.

By implementing these recommendations, development teams can significantly reduce the risk of XXE attacks in drawio applications and ensure the security of their systems and user data. Remember that **prevention is always better than cure**, and proactively addressing XXE vulnerabilities is crucial for building secure and resilient applications.
