### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Insecure Handling of Diagram Data

This section provides a detailed breakdown of the "Insecure Handling of Diagram Data" attack path, examining each attack vector and its implications.

#### 4.1. Attack Vector: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Diagram Content

*   **Description:**  Stored XSS occurs when malicious scripts are injected into diagram data and subsequently executed when the diagram is rendered or processed by other users.  Drawio diagrams are often stored in XML format (mxGraph), which can contain attributes and elements that, if not properly handled, can be exploited to inject JavaScript code.

*   **How it applies to drawio:**
    *   Drawio diagrams are typically saved as XML files. This XML structure can include attributes like `value`, `label`, and custom attributes within shapes and connectors.
    *   If an application directly renders or processes this XML content without proper output encoding, any JavaScript code embedded within these attributes will be executed in the user's browser when the diagram is viewed.
    *   Attackers can craft malicious diagrams, inject JavaScript payloads into diagram elements (e.g., within shape labels or custom properties), and store these diagrams in the application's database or file system.
    *   When other users access or view these diagrams, the malicious script is executed in their browser context.

*   **Example Scenario:**
    1.  An attacker creates a drawio diagram and modifies a shape's label to include a malicious JavaScript payload: `<mxCell value="<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>" style="..." ... />`
    2.  The attacker saves this diagram, and it is stored by the application.
    3.  A legitimate user views the diagram through the application.
    4.  The application renders the diagram, including the malicious label.
    5.  The browser executes the JavaScript code within the `onerror` event of the `<img>` tag, resulting in an XSS attack (in this example, an alert box). More sophisticated payloads could steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Account Takeover:** Stealing session cookies or credentials.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive data visible to the user.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the application for other users.
    *   **Reputation Damage:** Loss of user trust and damage to the application's reputation.

*   **Actionable Insights & Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Output Encoding:**  **[CRITICAL]**  When rendering diagram data, especially text-based elements like labels, descriptions, and custom attributes, **always** use proper output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) to escape potentially malicious characters. This prevents the browser from interpreting injected code as executable JavaScript.
        *   **Specifically:** Encode data before inserting it into HTML contexts (e.g., innerHTML, textContent, attributes). Use server-side templating engines or client-side libraries that provide automatic output encoding.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** **[HIGH]** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.). This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS attacks by preventing the execution of inline scripts or scripts from untrusted origins.
    *   **Input Validation (Less Effective for XSS Prevention, but good practice):** While output encoding is the primary defense against XSS, input validation can help detect and reject some obvious malicious inputs. However, it's difficult to create a perfect blacklist for XSS, so rely primarily on output encoding.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** **[MEDIUM]** Periodically audit the application's diagram rendering and processing logic to identify and address potential XSS vulnerabilities.

#### 4.2. Attack Vector: XML Injection/Manipulation leading to Application Logic Bypass or Data Corruption

*   **Description:** XML Injection occurs when an attacker can inject or manipulate XML structures within diagram data to alter the application's intended behavior or corrupt data. This is relevant if the application parses and processes the diagram XML beyond just rendering, for example, for server-side processing, data extraction, or business logic.

*   **How it applies to drawio:**
    *   Drawio diagrams are stored in XML format. If the application parses this XML server-side for any purpose beyond simply serving it for client-side rendering, it becomes vulnerable to XML injection.
    *   Attackers might inject malicious XML elements or attributes to:
        *   **Bypass Access Controls:** Modify XML elements that control access permissions or user roles if the application relies on XML parsing for authorization.
        *   **Manipulate Business Logic:** Alter XML data that influences application workflows or business rules.
        *   **Corrupt Data:** Inject invalid XML structures that cause parsing errors or data inconsistencies, leading to data corruption or denial of service.
        *   **Exfiltrate Data (in rare cases):**  In specific scenarios, XML injection could be combined with other vulnerabilities to exfiltrate data if the application processes external entities or performs server-side requests based on XML content (though less common in typical drawio usage).

*   **Example Scenario:**
    1.  Assume the application parses the diagram XML server-side to extract metadata or properties for indexing or search functionality.
    2.  An attacker crafts a diagram with malicious XML that exploits a vulnerability in the XML parsing logic. For example, they might inject external entities if the XML parser is not configured to prevent external entity expansion (though this is less likely in typical drawio scenarios).
    3.  More realistically, an attacker might manipulate XML elements that the application uses for business logic. For instance, if the application extracts a "diagram type" from a specific XML attribute, an attacker could modify this attribute to bypass type checks or access restricted functionalities.
    4.  If the application uses XPath queries on the XML, attackers might inject XML structures that alter the XPath query's results, leading to unintended data access or manipulation.

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Business Logic Bypass:** Circumventing intended application workflows or access controls.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Introducing inconsistencies or errors in diagram data or related application data.
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Gaining access to restricted features or data.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Causing parsing errors or resource exhaustion through maliciously crafted XML.

*   **Actionable Insights & Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Validate Diagram XML against a Schema:** **[HIGH]**  Define a strict XML schema (e.g., XSD) that describes the valid structure and content of drawio diagram XML. Validate all uploaded or processed diagram XML against this schema on the server-side. This will prevent injection of unexpected elements or attributes.
    *   **Sanitize XML Content:** **[MEDIUM]**  Beyond schema validation, sanitize XML content by removing or escaping potentially dangerous XML constructs, especially if you are processing XML attributes or elements that are not strictly defined by the schema.
    *   **Secure XML Parsing Configuration:** **[MEDIUM]**  Ensure that the XML parser used server-side is securely configured to prevent XML External Entity (XXE) attacks and other XML-specific vulnerabilities. Disable external entity resolution and DTD processing if not strictly required.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** **[LOW]**  Limit the server-side processing of diagram XML to only what is absolutely necessary. Avoid parsing and processing XML for sensitive operations like authorization or critical business logic if possible. Consider alternative data storage and processing methods for such functionalities.

#### 4.3. Attack Vector: Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if custom formats are used)

*   **Description:** Deserialization vulnerabilities arise when an application deserializes (converts data from a serialized format back into an object) untrusted data without proper validation. If the application uses custom diagram formats beyond standard XML (e.g., binary formats, custom JSON structures), and deserializes these formats, it could be vulnerable.

*   **How it applies to drawio:**
    *   While drawio primarily uses XML (mxGraph), applications might choose to store or process diagrams in custom formats for performance or other reasons.
    *   If the application uses custom serialization formats and deserializes diagram data from untrusted sources (e.g., user uploads, external APIs) without proper validation, attackers can craft malicious serialized data that, when deserialized, leads to:
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By injecting malicious objects into the serialized data that, upon deserialization, execute arbitrary code on the server.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By injecting objects that consume excessive resources during deserialization.
        *   **Data Corruption:**  By manipulating object properties during deserialization to alter application data.

*   **Example Scenario (Hypothetical - depends on custom format usage):**
    1.  Assume the application uses a custom binary format to store diagrams for efficiency.
    2.  The application deserializes diagram data received from user uploads using a library that is vulnerable to deserialization attacks (e.g., if using older versions of certain Java serialization libraries, Python's `pickle` without careful usage, etc.).
    3.  An attacker crafts a malicious diagram in this custom binary format, embedding serialized malicious objects.
    4.  When the application deserializes this malicious diagram data, the malicious objects are instantiated, and their constructors or methods are executed, potentially leading to RCE or other vulnerabilities.

*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Complete control over the server.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Application crash or performance degradation.
    *   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data on the server.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Modification of application data.

*   **Actionable Insights & Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Deserializing Untrusted Data in Custom Formats:** **[CRITICAL]**  The most secure approach is to **avoid deserializing untrusted data in custom formats altogether**, especially if these formats involve complex object serialization. If possible, stick to well-established and safer formats like XML (with proper validation and sanitization as discussed above) or JSON (with careful parsing and validation).
    *   **Implement Robust Validation and Safe Deserialization Practices (If Custom Formats are Necessary):** **[HIGH]** If you must use custom formats and deserialization:
        *   **Input Validation:**  Thoroughly validate the serialized data before deserialization. Define a strict schema or data structure for the serialized format and ensure that incoming data conforms to it.
        *   **Safe Deserialization Libraries:** Use deserialization libraries that are designed to be secure and mitigate deserialization vulnerabilities. Keep these libraries updated to the latest versions.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Deserialization Context):**  Run deserialization processes with minimal privileges to limit the impact of potential RCE vulnerabilities.
        *   **Consider Alternative Data Handling:** Explore alternative approaches to data handling that avoid deserialization of untrusted data, such as using data transformation pipelines or message queues with validated data formats.
