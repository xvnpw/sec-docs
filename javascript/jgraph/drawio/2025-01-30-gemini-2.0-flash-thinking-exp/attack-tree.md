## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Draw.io Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_application_via_draw_io_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root goal of the attacker - to successfully compromise the application by exploiting vulnerabilities related to its integration with draw.io.
*   **Attack Vectors:** This is the overarching goal, and is achieved through the sub-nodes listed below.
*   **Potential Impact:** Full compromise of the application, including data breaches, unauthorized access, and disruption of services.
*   **Actionable Insights:**  All actionable insights from the sub-nodes contribute to mitigating this overall risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Draw.io Vulnerabilities Directly](./attack_tree_paths/2___critical_node___high_risk_path__exploit_draw_io_vulnerabilities_directly.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers attempt to directly exploit vulnerabilities within the draw.io library itself, without necessarily targeting the application's specific integration logic first.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Draw.io
    *   (Less likely but possible) XML External Entity (XXE) Injection in Draw.io (if server-side processing)
    *   (Less likely but possible) Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Draw.io (if server-side rendering)
*   **Potential Impact:** If successful, these vulnerabilities can lead to direct compromise through client-side attacks (XSS) or server-side attacks (XXE, SSRF if applicable).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Regularly update draw.io library to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Conduct security audits and penetration testing specifically focusing on draw.io itself.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate client-side attacks like XSS.
    *   For server-side processing (if used): Disable external entity resolution in XML parsers, restrict outbound requests, and implement network segmentation.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Draw.io](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node___high_risk_path__cross-site_scripting__xss__in_draw_io.md)

*   **Description:** Inject malicious JavaScript code into the draw.io interface that executes in the user's browser when they interact with the application.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Identify unsanitized input fields or functionalities in draw.io.
    *   Craft a malicious diagram or input with a JavaScript payload.
    *   Inject the payload into the application's draw.io instance.
    *   User interacts with the compromised diagram.
    *   Malicious JavaScript executes in the user's browser within the application's context.
*   **Potential Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Thoroughly sanitize all user inputs processed by draw.io.
    *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP).
    *   Keep draw.io updated to patch XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Conduct security audits focusing on draw.io integration points.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Application's Integration with Draw.io](./attack_tree_paths/4___critical_node___high_risk_path__exploit_application's_integration_with_draw_io.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers focus on weaknesses in how the application *integrates* with draw.io, rather than directly targeting draw.io vulnerabilities. This often involves insecure handling of diagram data by the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Insecure Handling of Diagram Data
    *   Insecure Configuration of Draw.io within Application
    *   Clickjacking on Embedded Draw.io
    *   PostMessage Vulnerabilities (if used for communication)
*   **Potential Impact:** Compromise through vulnerabilities arising from the application's specific implementation and handling of draw.io.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Securely handle diagram data, especially during storage and rendering.
    *   Configure draw.io securely, enabling only necessary features.
    *   Implement clickjacking defenses (frame busting, X-Frame-Options, CSP frame-ancestors).
    *   Securely implement `postMessage` communication (origin and data validation).

## Attack Tree Path: [5. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Handling of Diagram Data](./attack_tree_paths/5___critical_node___high_risk_path__insecure_handling_of_diagram_data.md)

*   **Description:** The application processes diagram data (e.g., stores, retrieves, renders) in an insecure manner, leading to vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Diagram Content
    *   XML Injection/Manipulation leading to Application Logic Bypass or Data Corruption
    *   Deserialization Vulnerabilities (if custom formats are used)
*   **Potential Impact:** Data breaches, business logic bypass, data corruption, and client-side attacks (Stored XSS).
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   Implement output encoding when rendering diagram data to prevent Stored XSS.
    *   Validate diagram XML against a schema and sanitize XML content.
    *   Avoid deserializing untrusted diagram data in custom formats, or implement robust validation and safe deserialization practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Diagram Content](./attack_tree_paths/6___critical_node___high_risk_path__stored_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_diagram_content.md)

*   **Description:** The application stores diagram data containing malicious JavaScript without proper sanitization. When this data is retrieved and rendered using draw.io, the JavaScript executes in users' browsers.
*   **Attack Steps:**
    *   Inject malicious JavaScript into diagram elements within draw.io.
    *   Save the diagram using the application's save functionality.
    *   Application stores the diagram data persistently.
    *   Another user loads and views the diagram, triggering JavaScript execution.
*   **Potential Impact:** Session hijacking, defacement, redirection, data theft, execution of arbitrary actions on behalf of other users.
*   **Actionable Insights:**
    *   **Crucially important:** Implement output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) when rendering diagram data retrieved from storage.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) as a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   Regularly audit code that handles diagram loading and rendering for output encoding vulnerabilities.

This focused sub-tree and detailed breakdown highlight the most critical areas to address when securing an application that integrates with draw.io. Prioritizing mitigation efforts on these High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes will significantly improve the application's security posture.
