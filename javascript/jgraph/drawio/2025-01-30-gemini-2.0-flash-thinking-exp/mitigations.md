# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jgraph/drawio

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Security Policy (CSP) Tailored for drawio](./mitigation_strategies/content_security_policy__csp__tailored_for_drawio.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Analyze drawio Resource Loading:** Identify all sources from which drawio and its dependencies (scripts, images, styles, fonts) are loaded. This includes your own domain, CDNs (like jsdelivr, if used), and potentially draw.io domains if diagrams load external resources.
    *   **Step 2: Define CSP Directives for drawio:** Configure CSP headers specifically to allow resources needed by drawio while restricting others.
        *   `script-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://viewer.diagrams.net ...`:  Allow scripts from your origin and trusted CDNs used by drawio.  Use `'nonce-{random-value}'` for inline scripts if drawio uses them and avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'`.
        *   `img-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://viewer.diagrams.net data: ...`: Allow images from your origin, drawio CDNs, and potentially `data:` if needed for embedded images in diagrams.
        *   `style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net ...`: Allow styles from your origin and drawio CDNs. `'unsafe-inline'` might be needed if drawio uses inline styles, but try to minimize its use.
        *   `font-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net ...`: If drawio loads fonts from CDNs, allow them.
        *   `frame-ancestors 'self'`:  Control where drawio can be embedded in iframes, if relevant to your application's usage.
    *   **Step 3: Test and Refine CSP with drawio:** Thoroughly test your application with drawio and the CSP enabled. Monitor CSP violation reports (if configured) and adjust the policy to allow drawio functionality without weakening security.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via drawio vulnerabilities or malicious diagram content - **High Severity**: Prevents execution of unauthorized scripts potentially injected through diagram data processed by drawio or vulnerabilities in drawio itself.
    *   Data Exfiltration via drawio components - **Medium Severity**: Limits the ability of malicious scripts (if any bypass other defenses) within drawio to exfiltrate data by restricting script sources and network access.

*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: **Significantly reduces** risk by controlling script execution context within drawio.
    *   Data Exfiltration: **Significantly reduces** risk by limiting script capabilities and allowed origins for drawio resources.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented with a general CSP, but not specifically tailored to drawio's resource needs.  Basic directives are set, but not optimized for drawio.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   CSP directives specifically allowing drawio's CDN sources (if used).
    *   Refinement of `script-src` and `style-src` to be as strict as possible while allowing drawio to function.
    *   Testing CSP specifically with drawio functionalities to ensure no breakage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update the drawio Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_the_drawio_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Monitor drawio Releases:** Regularly check the official drawio GitHub repository ([https://github.com/jgraph/drawio](https://github.com/jgraph/drawio)) or release channels for new versions and security announcements.
    *   **Step 2: Review drawio Changelog for Security Fixes:** When a new drawio version is released, specifically review the changelog and release notes for mentions of security fixes, vulnerability patches, or security improvements.
    *   **Step 3: Update drawio Library in Application:**  Replace the older version of the drawio library in your application with the latest secure version. Follow drawio's update instructions or your application's dependency management process.
    *   **Step 4: Test drawio Functionality After Update:** After updating, thoroughly test all drawio-related features in your application to ensure the update hasn't introduced regressions or broken existing functionality.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in drawio - **High Severity**: Prevents attackers from exploiting publicly disclosed security vulnerabilities present in older versions of the drawio library.
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Proactive Mitigation) - **Medium Severity**: Reduces the window of opportunity for attackers to exploit newly discovered vulnerabilities in drawio by staying up-to-date with security patches.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities: **Significantly reduces** risk by patching known flaws in drawio.
    *   Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Proactive Mitigation): **Moderately reduces** risk by minimizing exposure time to potential vulnerabilities in drawio.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.  The team is generally aware of updates but lacks a formal, scheduled process for drawio updates. Updates are often reactive.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal, scheduled process for monitoring drawio releases and security advisories.
    *   Proactive and timely updates of the drawio library as part of regular maintenance.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) for drawio CDN Assets](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__for_drawio_cdn_assets.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify drawio CDN URLs:** Determine the exact CDN URLs from which you are loading drawio JavaScript and CSS files (if using a CDN).
    *   **Step 2: Generate SRI Hashes for drawio Files:** For each drawio file loaded from CDN, generate an SRI hash (SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512) using online tools or command-line utilities.
    *   **Step 3: Add `integrity` and `crossorigin` Attributes to drawio Tags:** In your HTML, for each `<script>` and `<link>` tag loading drawio files from CDN, add the `integrity` attribute with the generated hash and `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute.
        *   Example: `<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/drawio@VERSION/..." integrity="sha256-HASH_VALUE" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>`
    *   **Step 4: Verify SRI Implementation:** Test loading your application and ensure drawio files are loaded correctly from the CDN and the browser validates the SRI hashes without errors in the browser console.
    *   **Step 5: Update SRI Hashes on drawio Version Updates:** Whenever you update the drawio library version and the CDN URLs change, regenerate the SRI hashes for the new files and update the `integrity` attributes in your HTML.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   CDN Compromise Serving Malicious drawio - **Medium Severity**: Protects against scenarios where the CDN hosting drawio files is compromised and malicious code is injected into the drawio library files.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on drawio Delivery - **Medium Severity**: Reduces the risk of MITM attacks injecting malicious code by tampering with drawio files during transit from the CDN to the user's browser.

*   **Impact:**
    *   CDN Compromise: **Significantly reduces** risk by ensuring only files matching the expected hash are executed as drawio library.
    *   Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: **Significantly reduces** risk by verifying the integrity of drawio files during delivery.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Not implemented for drawio or other CDN-hosted libraries.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Generation of SRI hashes for drawio CDN files.
    *   Adding `integrity` and `crossorigin="anonymous"` attributes to `<script>` and `<link>` tags loading drawio from CDN.
    *   Process for updating SRI hashes when drawio versions are updated.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Client-Side Validation and Size Limits on drawio Diagram Data](./mitigation_strategies/client-side_validation_and_size_limits_on_drawio_diagram_data.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Define Expected drawio Diagram Structure:** Understand the expected XML or JSON structure of drawio diagram data in your application. Define a schema or rules for valid diagram data.
    *   **Step 2: Implement Client-Side Validation for Diagram Data:** Before loading diagram data into drawio or processing it, implement JavaScript validation to check if the data conforms to the expected structure and rules. This can include checking for allowed elements, attributes, and data types.
    *   **Step 3: Enforce Size and Complexity Limits for Diagrams:** Implement client-side checks to limit the size of diagram data (file size, number of nodes/edges, complexity metrics). Reject diagrams exceeding these limits to prevent client-side DoS.
    *   **Step 4: Handle Invalid Diagram Data Gracefully:** If validation fails or limits are exceeded, display user-friendly error messages and prevent drawio from processing the invalid data.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via overly complex drawio diagrams - **Medium Severity**: Prevents excessively large or complex diagrams from causing browser performance issues or crashes when processed by drawio.
    *   Malicious Diagram Injection (Limited Client-Side Prevention) - **Low Severity**: Client-side validation can catch basic attempts to inject malformed or oversized diagram data, but server-side validation is essential for robust security.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Client-Side DoS: **Moderately reduces** risk by limiting resource consumption from problematic diagrams in drawio.
    *   Malicious Diagram Injection (Client-Side): **Minimally reduces** risk; primarily for data integrity, not strong security against malicious diagrams.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic file size limits might be in place for uploads, but no specific validation of drawio diagram data structure or complexity is implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Defining a schema or rules for valid drawio diagram data in the application context.
    *   Implementing client-side validation against the defined diagram schema.
    *   Setting specific size and complexity limits for drawio diagrams.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Server-Side Validation and Sanitization of drawio Diagram Data (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/server-side_validation_and_sanitization_of_drawio_diagram_data__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Define Server-Side drawio Diagram Schema:** Define a robust schema or rules for valid drawio diagram data on the server-side. This should be stricter than client-side validation.
    *   **Step 2: Implement Server-Side Validation:** When diagram data is received by the server (upload, save, processing), perform server-side validation against the defined schema. Use a suitable validation library in your server-side language.
    *   **Step 3: Sanitize Diagram Data for Server-Side Processing/Storage:** If your application processes or stores diagram data, sanitize it server-side to remove or neutralize potentially harmful content. This might involve escaping, removing dangerous elements, or using a sanitization library specific to the diagram format (if available) or general XML/JSON sanitization.
    *   **Step 4: Reject Invalid or Malicious Diagram Data:** If server-side validation fails, reject the diagram data and return an error. Do not process or store invalid data.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Server-Side Injection Attacks via malicious drawio diagrams (e.g., XSS, XML Injection) - **High Severity**: Prevents malicious code embedded within diagram data from being processed by the server, leading to server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   Data Corruption/Integrity Issues due to malformed drawio data - **Medium Severity**: Ensures only valid and well-formed drawio diagram data is stored and processed, maintaining data integrity.
    *   Server-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via complex/malformed drawio diagrams - **Medium Severity**: Prevents processing of excessively complex or malformed diagrams that could consume excessive server resources.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Server-Side Injection Attacks: **Significantly reduces** risk by preventing processing of malicious diagram data on the server.
    *   Data Corruption/Integrity Issues: **Significantly reduces** risk by ensuring data validity of stored drawio diagrams.
    *   Server-Side DoS: **Moderately reduces** risk by rejecting problematic diagrams before server-side processing.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No server-side validation or sanitization of drawio diagram data is currently implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Defining a server-side schema for drawio diagram data.
    *   Implementing server-side validation against the schema.
    *   Server-side sanitization of drawio diagram data before processing or storage.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Storage for drawio Diagrams](./mitigation_strategies/secure_storage_for_drawio_diagrams.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Implement Access Controls for Diagram Storage:** Define and enforce access control policies for where drawio diagrams are stored. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to diagrams based on user roles and permissions.
    *   **Step 2: Use Secure Storage Mechanisms:** Store drawio diagrams in a secure storage system (database with access controls, encrypted file storage, secure cloud storage).
    *   **Step 3: Encryption at Rest for Diagram Data:** Implement encryption at rest for stored drawio diagram data, especially if diagrams may contain sensitive information.
    *   **Step 4: Regular Audits of Diagram Access and Storage Security:** Periodically audit access controls and security configurations of diagram storage to identify and address any weaknesses.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive drawio Diagrams - **High Severity**: Prevents unauthorized users from viewing, modifying, or deleting confidential diagrams created or edited with drawio.
    *   Data Breaches of drawio Diagram Data - **High Severity**: Reduces the risk of data breaches by securing storage and implementing encryption for diagram data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized Access to Sensitive drawio Diagrams: **Significantly reduces** risk by controlling access to diagram storage.
    *   Data Breaches of drawio Diagram Data: **Significantly reduces** risk through encryption and secure storage of diagrams.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic application-level access controls might be in place, but diagram storage itself might not be specifically secured or encrypted at rest.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Encryption at rest for stored drawio diagram data.
    *   Granular access control policies specifically for drawio diagrams in storage.
    *   Regular security audits of diagram storage and access configurations.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting and Resource Management for Server-Side drawio Diagram Processing (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_and_resource_management_for_server-side_drawio_diagram_processing__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Identify Server-Side drawio Processing Endpoints:** Identify server endpoints that process drawio diagrams (e.g., rendering, conversion, analysis).
    *   **Step 2: Implement Rate Limiting for drawio Processing:** Implement rate limiting on these endpoints to restrict the number of requests from a single user or IP within a time period.
    *   **Step 3: Set Resource Limits for drawio Processing Tasks:** Configure resource limits (CPU, memory, time) for server-side processes handling drawio diagrams to prevent resource exhaustion.
    *   **Step 4: Queueing and Throttling for drawio Processing:** Implement request queueing and throttling to manage concurrent drawio processing requests and prevent server overload.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Server-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via excessive drawio processing requests - **High Severity**: Prevents attackers from overwhelming the server with requests to process diagrams, leading to service disruption.
    *   Resource Exhaustion due to drawio processing - **Medium Severity**: Protects server resources from being exhausted by legitimate but overly demanding diagram processing.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Server-Side DoS: **Significantly reduces** risk by limiting request rates for drawio processing.
    *   Resource Exhaustion: **Significantly reduces** risk by controlling resource usage during drawio processing.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Basic rate limiting might exist for authentication, but likely not specifically for drawio diagram processing endpoints.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Rate limiting specifically for server-side drawio diagram processing endpoints.
    *   Resource limits for server-side drawio processing tasks.
    *   Request queueing and throttling for drawio processing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Server-Side Rendering Environment for drawio Diagrams (If Applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_server-side_rendering_environment_for_drawio_diagrams__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   **Step 1: Isolate drawio Rendering Process:** If rendering diagrams server-side, isolate the rendering process in a secure environment like a container (Docker) or VM.
    *   **Step 2: Principle of Least Privilege for Rendering Environment:** Configure the rendering environment with minimal necessary permissions.
    *   **Step 3: Input Sanitization Before Rendering:** Sanitize diagram data before passing it to the rendering process to remove potentially malicious content.
    *   **Step 4: Output Validation After Rendering:** Validate the output of the rendering process (images, PDFs) to ensure it's in the expected format and doesn't contain unexpected content.
    *   **Step 5: Regular Updates for Rendering Environment:** Keep the OS and software in the rendering environment updated with security patches.
