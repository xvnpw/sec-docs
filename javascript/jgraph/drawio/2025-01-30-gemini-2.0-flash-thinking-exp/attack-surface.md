# Attack Surface Analysis for jgraph/drawio

## Attack Surface: [1. XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](./attack_surfaces/1__xml_external_entity__xxe__injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in XML parsers to include external entities in XML documents. This can lead to reading local files, SSRF, and denial of service.
*   **Drawio Contribution:** Drawio processes diagram data, often in XML format (e.g., `.drawio`, `.xml`). If server-side processing of these files is enabled and the XML parser within drawio or its integration is not properly configured, it becomes vulnerable to XXE.
*   **Example:** A malicious user uploads a `.drawio` file containing an XXE payload that reads `/etc/passwd` from the server when the file is processed server-side by drawio or a related application.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach (reading sensitive files), Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable External Entity Resolution:** Configure XML parsers used by drawio or in server-side integrations to disable external entity and DTD processing.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Validate and sanitize diagram data to remove or neutralize potentially malicious XML structures before processing by drawio server-side components.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run server-side components processing drawio files with minimal necessary privileges.

## Attack Surface: [2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Diagram Data](./attack_surfaces/2__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_diagram_data.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into diagram data that is later rendered in a web browser, allowing them to execute scripts in the context of other users' sessions.
*   **Drawio Contribution:** Drawio allows users to input text, labels, and potentially custom attributes within diagrams. If this user-controlled data is not properly sanitized by drawio when rendered in a web page, it can lead to XSS.
*   **Example:** A user creates a diagram with a shape label containing `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`. When this diagram is displayed on a webpage using drawio's rendering capabilities, the JavaScript `alert('XSS')` executes in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, information theft.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Properly encode or escape user-controlled diagram data by drawio before rendering it in HTML. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding for text content, JavaScript escaping for JavaScript contexts).
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded and restrict inline JavaScript execution in contexts where drawio diagrams are displayed.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Identify and fix potential XSS vulnerabilities in drawio's rendering logic and integration points.

## Attack Surface: [3. Image Processing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/3__image_processing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities in image processing libraries can be exploited by uploading or processing maliciously crafted image files, potentially leading to code execution or denial of service.
*   **Drawio Contribution:** Drawio supports importing and exporting various image formats (PNG, JPEG, SVG, etc.). If vulnerable image processing libraries are used *within drawio itself* or in server-side components interacting with drawio image exports/imports, drawio becomes a vector for exploiting these vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A user uploads a specially crafted PNG file to drawio. A buffer overflow vulnerability in the PNG parsing library *used by drawio* is triggered, leading to remote code execution on the client or server processing the image.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Denial of Service, Information Disclosure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Use Secure and Updated Image Processing Libraries:** Ensure that drawio and any server-side components use secure and up-to-date image processing libraries. Regularly update these libraries within drawio and related systems to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate image file formats and potentially sanitize image data processed by drawio to remove or neutralize malicious payloads.
    *   **Sandboxing/Isolation:**  Process image files in a sandboxed or isolated environment, especially in server-side integrations with drawio, to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [4. Deserialization Vulnerabilities (Server-Side)](./attack_surfaces/4__deserialization_vulnerabilities__server-side_.md)

*   **Description:** If diagram data is processed server-side using deserialization, vulnerabilities in the deserialization process can be exploited to execute arbitrary code.
*   **Drawio Contribution:** If drawio is integrated with server-side components that deserialize diagram data (e.g., for saving, loading, or processing diagrams), and drawio itself or these components use insecure deserialization practices, deserialization vulnerabilities become relevant.
*   **Example:** Diagram data is serialized using Java serialization and sent to a server-side component interacting with drawio. A vulnerability in the Java deserialization process is exploited by a malicious diagram payload processed by drawio's server-side integration, leading to remote code execution on the server.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution, Data Breach, Denial of Service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid Deserialization of Untrusted Data:**  If possible, avoid deserializing diagram data from untrusted sources in server-side integrations with drawio.
    *   **Use Secure Serialization Formats:** If deserialization is necessary in drawio integrations, use secure serialization formats like JSON or Protocol Buffers instead of formats known to be vulnerable (like Java serialization).
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize diagram data before deserialization in server-side drawio components to remove or neutralize potentially malicious payloads.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Specifically test for deserialization vulnerabilities in server-side components that process drawio diagram data.
