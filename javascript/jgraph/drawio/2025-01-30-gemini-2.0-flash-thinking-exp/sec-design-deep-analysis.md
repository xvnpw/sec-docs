### 2. Security Implications of Key Components

Based on the design review, let's analyze the security implications of each key component:

#### 2.1. Web Application Component (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

**Description:** The core diagramming functionality resides in the client-side web application, executed within the user's web browser.

**Security Implications:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities:** As a client-side application heavily reliant on user input for diagram creation and manipulation, drawio is susceptible to XSS vulnerabilities. If user-provided data is not properly sanitized and output encoded, attackers could inject malicious scripts into diagrams. These scripts could then be executed in other users' browsers when they view the diagram, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:** Diagram data itself, including labels, attributes, and custom shapes, can be sources of XSS if not handled carefully.  Importing diagrams from external sources also introduces XSS risks if the imported data is not validated.
*   **Client-Side Input Validation Weaknesses:** Relying solely on client-side input validation can be bypassed. While client-side validation improves user experience and can catch simple errors, it should not be considered a primary security control.  Attackers can manipulate browser requests and bypass client-side checks.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  Diagram data, file uploads (if any), and configuration settings could be manipulated on the client-side to bypass validation.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP) Misconfiguration or Lack of Implementation:** While CSP is mentioned as a security control, misconfiguration or lack of strict CSP can weaken its effectiveness. A permissive CSP might not adequately mitigate XSS risks.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:** If drawio uses inline scripts or styles, or allows loading resources from untrusted origins, a weak CSP will not prevent XSS effectively.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** The web application likely relies on various JavaScript libraries and frameworks. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  Outdated or vulnerable JavaScript libraries used for UI components, diagram rendering, or other functionalities could introduce security flaws.
*   **Subresource Integrity (SRI) Not Fully Implemented:**  If SRI is not implemented for all external resources (CDNs, third-party scripts), the application becomes vulnerable to supply chain attacks where compromised external resources can inject malicious code.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:** If drawio uses CDNs for libraries or assets without SRI, a compromise of the CDN could lead to application compromise.
*   **HTML Injection:** Similar to XSS, improper output encoding can lead to HTML injection vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to manipulate the structure and content of the webpage, potentially leading to phishing attacks or defacement.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:** Diagram labels and descriptions, if not properly encoded, could be used for HTML injection.

**Mitigation Strategies for Web Application Component:**

*   **Robust Input Sanitization and Output Encoding:** Implement server-side style input sanitization and strict output encoding for all user-provided data, especially diagram data, labels, and descriptions. Utilize well-vetted libraries for sanitization and encoding appropriate for the context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Integrate a robust input sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify for client-side, OWASP Java Encoder for server-side if applicable in future server components) and ensure all user inputs are sanitized before being processed or stored. Implement strict output encoding (e.g., HTML entity encoding) when displaying user-generated content in diagrams.
*   **Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP that minimizes the attack surface.  Specifically:
    *   **`default-src 'none';`**: Start with a restrictive default policy.
    *   **`script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval' ...;`**: Carefully define allowed script sources. Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` if possible. If necessary, use nonces or hashes for inline scripts. Only allow `'self'` and trusted CDNs with SRI for external scripts.
    *   **`style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' ...;`**: Similarly, restrict style sources. Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` if possible and use nonces or hashes for inline styles.
    *   **`img-src 'self' data: ...;`**: Define allowed image sources.
    *   **`object-src 'none';`**: Restrict object sources.
    *   **`base-uri 'none';`**: Restrict base URI.
    *   **`form-action 'self';`**: Restrict form actions.
    *   **`frame-ancestors 'none';`**: Restrict framing.
    *   **`upgrade-insecure-requests;`**: Enforce HTTPS.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Configure the web server to send strict CSP headers. Regularly review and refine the CSP to ensure it remains effective and doesn't hinder functionality unnecessarily. Use a CSP reporting mechanism to monitor violations and identify potential issues.
*   **Subresource Integrity (SRI) Implementation:**  Implement SRI for all external resources loaded from CDNs or third-party origins. This ensures that the integrity of these resources is verified, preventing attacks via compromised CDNs.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Generate SRI hashes for all external JavaScript and CSS libraries used in the web application and include them in the `<script>` and `<link>` tags. Automate SRI hash generation and verification in the build pipeline.
*   **Dependency Scanning and Management:** Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in third-party JavaScript libraries. Keep dependencies up-to-date.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Integrate a dependency scanning tool (e.g., Snyk, npm audit, Yarn audit) into the CI/CD pipeline. Regularly scan dependencies and prioritize updates to address identified vulnerabilities. Establish a process for monitoring and responding to new vulnerability disclosures in used libraries.
*   **Client-Side Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically focused on client-side vulnerabilities in the web application.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Include client-side security testing as part of regular security assessments. This should include manual code review for XSS vulnerabilities and automated scanning tools capable of detecting client-side issues. Consider using browser-based security testing tools and techniques.

#### 2.2. Desktop Application Component (Electron/Java)

**Description:** The desktop application wraps the web application to provide a native application experience.

**Security Implications:**

*   **Electron/Java Framework Vulnerabilities:** If using Electron or Java (depending on the actual implementation), vulnerabilities in these frameworks themselves can be exploited to compromise the desktop application.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:** Outdated Electron or Java versions could contain known vulnerabilities that attackers could leverage.
*   **Operating System API Security:** Desktop applications interact with operating system APIs for file system access, network communication, and other functionalities. Improper use of these APIs can introduce security risks.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  Vulnerabilities could arise from how drawio handles file system operations, especially when dealing with user-provided diagram files.
*   **Application Packaging and Distribution Security:**  Compromised build pipelines or insecure distribution channels could lead to the distribution of malicious desktop application versions.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:** If the desktop application build process is not secured, attackers could inject malware into the application package. If distribution channels are not secure (e.g., unofficial download sites), users might download compromised versions.
*   **Local File System Access Risks:** Desktop applications have more direct access to the local file system compared to web applications in browsers. This increased access, if not managed carefully, can lead to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  Vulnerabilities could arise from how drawio handles file reading and writing operations, especially if it doesn't properly validate file paths or content.
*   **Update Mechanism Security:** If the desktop application has an auto-update mechanism, vulnerabilities in this mechanism could be exploited to distribute malicious updates.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:** If the update process is not secure (e.g., using insecure protocols or lacking integrity checks), attackers could perform man-in-the-middle attacks to deliver malicious updates.

**Mitigation Strategies for Desktop Application Component:**

*   **Keep Electron/Java Framework Updated:** Regularly update the Electron or Java framework to the latest stable versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Implement a process for regularly monitoring and updating the Electron or Java framework used in the desktop application. Automate updates where possible and test updates thoroughly before deployment.
*   **Secure Operating System API Usage:** Follow secure coding practices when using operating system APIs. Minimize the use of privileged APIs and carefully validate all inputs and outputs when interacting with OS functionalities.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Conduct code reviews specifically focused on OS API interactions. Use secure coding guidelines for Electron or Java development. Implement input validation and output encoding for data exchanged with OS APIs.
*   **Secure Build Pipeline and Artifact Signing:** Implement a secure build pipeline for desktop applications, including code signing of the application package to ensure integrity and authenticity.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Secure the CI/CD pipeline used to build desktop applications. Implement code signing using a trusted certificate. Distribute desktop applications through official and trusted channels (e.g., official website, app stores).
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for File System Access:**  Minimize the application's required file system permissions. Only request necessary permissions and adhere to the principle of least privilege when accessing files. Implement robust input validation for file paths and file content.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Review the file system access requirements of the desktop application and minimize them. Implement strict input validation for file paths to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities. Sanitize and validate the content of diagram files to prevent malicious file execution or data injection.
*   **Secure Update Mechanism:** Implement a secure auto-update mechanism that uses HTTPS for communication and verifies the integrity of updates using digital signatures.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** If auto-updates are implemented, ensure they use HTTPS for all communication. Digitally sign update packages and verify signatures before applying updates. Consider using a dedicated and secure update framework for Electron or Java.

#### 2.3. Storage Integrations (Google Drive API, OneDrive API, Local File System API)

**Description:** Drawio integrates with Google Drive, OneDrive, and the local file system for diagram storage and retrieval.

**Security Implications:**

*   **OAuth 2.0 Misconfiguration or Implementation Flaws:** Incorrectly implemented OAuth 2.0 flows for Google Drive and OneDrive can lead to authorization bypass or token theft.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  If the OAuth 2.0 redirect URIs are not properly configured or if tokens are not securely stored, attackers could potentially gain unauthorized access to users' cloud storage.
*   **API Access Control Weaknesses:**  If API access control is not properly implemented, drawio might request or be granted excessive permissions to user storage, increasing the potential impact of a compromise.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:** Drawio should only request the minimum necessary permissions to access Google Drive and OneDrive. Overly broad permissions could allow attackers to access more data than necessary if drawio is compromised.
*   **Data-in-Transit Security (HTTPS):**  If HTTPS is not consistently used for communication with storage APIs, diagram data could be intercepted in transit.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  All communication with Google Drive API, OneDrive API, and even local file system operations (if network-based in some configurations) must be over HTTPS to protect data in transit.
*   **Data-at-Rest Security (Cloud Storage Provider Dependency):** For cloud storage, drawio relies on the security of Google Drive and OneDrive for data-at-rest encryption. Vulnerabilities in these providers' security could indirectly impact drawio users.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:** While drawio cannot directly control Google Drive or OneDrive security, users should be aware that the security of their diagrams in cloud storage depends on these providers.
*   **Local File System Storage Security (User Responsibility):** For local file system storage, the security of diagrams is entirely dependent on the user's operating system security and device security.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:** Drawio cannot enforce security for locally stored diagrams. Users need to be educated about the importance of device security and access controls for local files.

**Mitigation Strategies for Storage Integrations:**

*   **Secure OAuth 2.0 Implementation:**  Thoroughly review and test the OAuth 2.0 implementation for Google Drive and OneDrive integrations. Ensure correct configuration of redirect URIs, secure token storage (e.g., using browser's secure storage mechanisms or OS-level secure storage for desktop app), and proper handling of access tokens and refresh tokens.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Conduct security code review of the OAuth 2.0 implementation. Follow OAuth 2.0 best practices and security guidelines. Use established OAuth 2.0 client libraries where possible to minimize implementation errors.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for API Access:** Request only the minimum necessary API permissions from Google Drive and OneDrive. Regularly review and verify the requested permissions.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Review the API permissions requested by drawio for Google Drive and OneDrive. Ensure they are limited to the minimum required for diagram storage and retrieval. Document the rationale for each permission requested.
*   **Enforce HTTPS for All API Communication:** Ensure that all communication with Google Drive API, OneDrive API, and any other external services is conducted over HTTPS.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Configure API clients and libraries to enforce HTTPS. Verify HTTPS usage through network traffic analysis and security testing.
*   **Client-Side Encryption for Sensitive Diagrams (Consideration):** For users storing highly sensitive diagrams, consider offering client-side encryption as an optional feature. This would provide an additional layer of security, even if cloud storage providers are compromised. If implemented, use well-vetted cryptographic libraries and ensure proper key management.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Evaluate the feasibility and user demand for client-side encryption. If implemented, choose robust and audited cryptographic libraries (e.g., WebCrypto API in browsers, libsodium for desktop). Provide clear guidance to users on key management and the limitations of client-side encryption.
*   **User Education on Local Storage Security:**  Educate users about the security risks and responsibilities associated with storing diagrams locally. Provide best practices for securing their devices and local file systems.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Include security tips and warnings in documentation and user guides regarding local file storage. Emphasize the user's responsibility for securing their devices and backups.

#### 2.4. Deployment (Web Deployment - Static Website on CDN)

**Description:** Web deployment as a static website on a CDN.

**Security Implications:**

*   **CDN Security Misconfiguration:**  Misconfigured CDN settings can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as open buckets, insecure access controls, or improper cache settings.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  If the CDN is misconfigured, attackers might be able to access or modify the static files of the drawio web application, potentially leading to defacement or malware injection.
*   **Origin Server Compromise:** If the origin server (where static files are stored) is compromised, attackers could replace legitimate files with malicious ones, which would then be distributed by the CDN.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  Compromise of the origin server could lead to widespread distribution of a malicious version of drawio to all users accessing it through the CDN.
*   **HTTPS Misconfiguration:**  Incorrect HTTPS configuration on the CDN or origin server can lead to man-in-the-middle attacks and data interception.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  If HTTPS is not properly configured, communication between users and the CDN, or between the CDN and the origin server, could be vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.
*   **DDoS Attacks:**  While CDNs often provide DDoS protection, drawio could still be vulnerable to distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that could impact availability.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  DDoS attacks could make drawio unavailable to users, disrupting their workflows.

**Mitigation Strategies for Web Deployment:**

*   **Secure CDN Configuration:**  Follow CDN security best practices when configuring the CDN. This includes:

    *   **Server Hardening:** Apply standard server hardening practices, including patching, firewall configuration, and disabling unnecessary services.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Periodically audit the origin server's security posture.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Harden the origin server according to security best practices. Implement strong access controls and monitoring. Regularly patch and update the server software.
*   **Enforce HTTPS End-to-End:** Ensure HTTPS is used for all communication, from the user's browser to the CDN and from the CDN to the origin server.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Configure CDN and origin server to enforce HTTPS. Use HTTPS-only settings where available. Regularly verify HTTPS configuration and certificate validity.
*   **Leverage CDN DDoS Protection:**  Utilize the DDoS protection features offered by the CDN provider. Configure and monitor DDoS protection settings.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Enable and configure DDoS protection features provided by the CDN. Monitor traffic patterns and DDoS attack alerts. Regularly review and adjust DDoS protection settings as needed.

#### 2.5. Build Process (CI/CD Pipeline)

**Description:** Automated CI/CD pipeline for building, testing, and deploying drawio.

**Security Implications:**

*   **Compromised CI/CD Pipeline:** If the CI/CD pipeline is compromised, attackers could inject malicious code into the build artifacts, leading to the distribution of compromised versions of drawio.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  A compromised CI/CD pipeline could result in widespread distribution of malware to drawio users through web and desktop application deployments.
*   **Insecure Build Environment:**  If the build environment is not secured, it could be vulnerable to attacks that could compromise the build process or inject malicious code.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  Vulnerabilities in the build environment (e.g., unpatched systems, insecure configurations) could be exploited to tamper with the build process.
*   **Lack of Automated Security Scans:**  If the CI/CD pipeline does not include automated security scans (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning), vulnerabilities might be introduced into the codebase and deployed without detection.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  Without automated security scans, vulnerabilities in the code or dependencies might go unnoticed and be deployed to users.
*   **Insufficient Access Controls:**  If access controls to the CI/CD pipeline and source code repository are not properly configured, unauthorized individuals could modify the build process or codebase.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  Weak access controls could allow malicious insiders or external attackers to tamper with the build process or source code.
*   **Dependency Supply Chain Attacks:**  If dependencies are not managed securely, drawio could be vulnerable to supply chain attacks where compromised dependencies are introduced into the application.
    *   **Specific Risk for Drawio:**  Using vulnerable or compromised third-party libraries could introduce security flaws into drawio.

**Mitigation Strategies for Build Process:**

*   **Secure CI/CD Pipeline Infrastructure:**  Harden the CI/CD pipeline infrastructure. This includes:

*   **Artifact Signing:** Digitally sign build artifacts (web application files, desktop application packages) to ensure integrity and authenticity.
    *   **Actionable Mitigation:** Implement artifact signing for both web and desktop application builds. Use trusted code signing certificates. Verify signatures during deployment and update processes.

### 3. Architecture, Components, and Data Flow Inference

Based on the design review and the nature of drawio as a diagramming tool, we can infer the following architecture, components, and data flow:

**Architecture:** Client-Centric Architecture with External Storage Integrations.

**Components:**

1.  **Drawio Web Application (Client-Side):** Core diagramming logic, UI rendering, user interaction handling, implemented in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Runs within a web browser.
2.  **Drawio Desktop Application (Wrapper):**  Provides a native application experience, likely using Electron or Java to wrap the web application. Enables local file system access and potentially other OS integrations.
3.  **Google Drive API Integration:**  Interface for storing and retrieving diagrams from Google Drive using OAuth 2.0 for authorization.
4.  **OneDrive API Integration:** Interface for storing and retrieving diagrams from OneDrive using OAuth 2.0 for authorization.
5.  **Local File System API (Browser/OS):**  Browser APIs (for web app) or OS APIs (for desktop app) for accessing the local file system for saving and opening diagrams locally.
6.  **Content Delivery Network (CDN):**  Used for hosting and distributing the static files of the web application for web deployment.
7.  **Origin Server (Static File Storage):**  Storage for the static files of the web application, serving content to the CDN.
8.  **CI/CD Pipeline:**  Automated system for building, testing, and deploying drawio web and desktop applications.
9.  **Source Code Repository (GitHub):**  Version control system for managing the drawio source code.

**Data Flow:**

1.  **User Interaction:** User interacts with the Drawio Web Application or Desktop Application to create and edit diagrams. Diagram data is primarily processed and manipulated client-side.
2.  **Diagram Storage (Cloud):**
    *   User chooses to save diagram to Google Drive or OneDrive.
    *   Drawio application initiates OAuth 2.0 authorization flow with the chosen cloud provider.
    *   Upon successful authorization, Drawio application uses the respective API (Google Drive API or OneDrive API) over HTTPS to upload diagram data to the user's cloud storage.
    *   Retrieval follows a similar flow, downloading diagram data from cloud storage via APIs.
3.  **Diagram Storage (Local):**
    *   User chooses to save diagram locally.
    *   Drawio application uses Browser File System API (web app) or OS File System API (desktop app) to write diagram data to the user's local file system.
    *   Retrieval involves reading diagram data from the local file system using the same APIs.
4.  **Web Application Delivery:**
    *   User accesses drawio web application via a URL.
    *   User's browser sends HTTPS requests to the CDN.
    *   CDN retrieves static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) from the Origin Server over HTTPS (if not already cached).
    *   CDN delivers static files to the user's browser over HTTPS.
    *   Browser executes the web application code.
5.  **Desktop Application Distribution:**
    *   Desktop application packages are built by the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Packages are distributed through official channels (website, app stores).
    *   Users download and install the desktop application.
    *   Desktop application runs locally on the user's OS.

This inferred architecture and data flow highlight the client-side nature of drawio and its reliance on external storage services and CDN for web deployment. Security considerations should focus on client-side vulnerabilities, API integrations, CDN security, and build pipeline security.

### 4. Tailored Security Considerations and 5. Actionable Mitigation Strategies

Based on the analysis above, here are tailored security considerations and actionable mitigation strategies specific to drawio:

**Security Consideration 1: Client-Side XSS Vulnerabilities in Web Application**

*   **Tailored Consideration:** Given drawio's core functionality revolves around user-generated diagram data, XSS vulnerabilities are a high-priority concern.  Diagram elements, labels, custom shapes, and imported diagrams are potential attack vectors.
*   **Actionable Mitigation:**
    *   **Implement DOMPurify:** Integrate DOMPurify library into the web application to sanitize HTML content before rendering diagrams. Use it consistently for all user-provided HTML inputs within diagrams.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Ensure all dynamic content rendered in the UI is properly encoded based on the context (HTML entity encoding, JavaScript escaping, URL encoding). Use templating engines or libraries that provide automatic output encoding.
    *   **Regular XSS Testing:** Conduct regular manual and automated XSS testing, specifically targeting diagram rendering and user input handling. Include fuzzing techniques to test various input combinations.

**Security Consideration 2: Dependency Vulnerabilities in Web Application**

*   **Tailored Consideration:**  As a JavaScript-heavy application, drawio likely relies on numerous npm packages. Outdated or vulnerable dependencies can introduce significant security risks.
*   **Actionable Mitigation:**
    *   **Snyk Integration:** Integrate Snyk (or similar dependency scanning tool) into the CI/CD pipeline. Configure it to scan npm dependencies in every build and fail builds if high-severity vulnerabilities are detected.
    *   **Automated Dependency Updates:** Implement a process for automated dependency updates. Use tools like Dependabot to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates. Prioritize security updates.
    *   **Vulnerability Monitoring Dashboard:** Set up a vulnerability monitoring dashboard (provided by Snyk or similar tools) to track the status of dependencies and proactively address new vulnerabilities.

**Security Consideration 3: Desktop Application Packaging and Update Security**

*   **Tailored Consideration:**  Ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the desktop application is crucial to prevent malware distribution. Secure updates are also essential to patch vulnerabilities and prevent malicious updates.
*   **Actionable Mitigation:**
    *   **Electron/Java Version Management:**  Establish a process to regularly update Electron or Java framework to the latest stable versions. Automate this process where possible.
    *   **Code Signing for Desktop Apps:** Implement code signing for all desktop application releases using a trusted code signing certificate. Verify signatures during installation and updates.
    *   **Secure Update Framework (Electron):** If using Electron, leverage a secure update framework like Squirrel.Mac and Squirrel.Windows, or consider using a dedicated update service that provides secure update delivery and verification.

**Security Consideration 4: CDN Security Misconfiguration**

*   **Tailored Consideration:**  A misconfigured CDN can expose the web application to various attacks. Secure CDN configuration is essential for web deployment.
*   **Actionable Mitigation:**
    *   **CDN Security Hardening Checklist:** Develop a CDN security hardening checklist based on CDN provider's best practices and industry standards (e.g., OWASP CDN Security Cheat Sheet). Include items like access control, HTTPS enforcement, cache control, origin shielding, and logging.
    *   **Regular CDN Configuration Audits:** Conduct regular audits of CDN configurations against the hardening checklist. Use CDN provider's security scanning tools if available.
    *   **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for CDN:**  Manage CDN configurations using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) tools (e.g., Terraform, AWS CloudFormation) to ensure consistent and auditable configurations.

**Security Consideration 5: Lack of Automated Security Testing in CI/CD Pipeline**

*   **Tailored Consideration:**  Manual security testing alone is insufficient for a continuously evolving application. Automated security testing in the CI/CD pipeline is crucial for early vulnerability detection.
*   **Actionable Mitigation:**
    *   **SAST Integration (SonarQube):** Integrate a Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tool like SonarQube into the CI/CD pipeline. Configure it to analyze JavaScript, HTML, and CSS code for potential vulnerabilities (XSS, injection flaws, etc.) on every code commit.
    *   **DAST Integration (OWASP ZAP):** Integrate a Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tool like OWASP ZAP into the CI/CD pipeline. Configure it to perform automated scans of the deployed web application for vulnerabilities.
    *   **Security Gate in CI/CD:** Implement a security gate in the CI/CD pipeline that fails builds if SAST or DAST tools detect high-severity vulnerabilities. Require manual review and remediation of vulnerabilities before builds can proceed.
