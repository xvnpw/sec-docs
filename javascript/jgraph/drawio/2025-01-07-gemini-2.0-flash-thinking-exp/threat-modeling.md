# Threat Model Analysis for jgraph/drawio

## Threat: [Malicious Script Injection via Diagram Content (XSS)](./threats/malicious_script_injection_via_diagram_content__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a diagram file containing embedded malicious JavaScript code within text elements, shape properties (e.g., tooltips, links), or custom XML data. When a legitimate user views this diagram within the application, the malicious script executes in their browser session. This is a direct vulnerability stemming from how draw.io handles and renders user-provided content.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, stealing sensitive information (including session cookies, local storage data), defacing the application interface, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.

**Affected Component:**
*   draw.io **Diagram Rendering Engine:** Specifically the part responsible for parsing and rendering text, shape properties, and custom XML.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevents inline script execution. This is a primary defense against XSS.
*   **Output Encoding/Escaping:** When rendering diagram content, especially text and attributes that could contain user-provided data, ensure proper output encoding (e.g., HTML escaping) to neutralize any potentially malicious scripts. This needs to be implemented by the application integrating draw.io, understanding how draw.io renders content.
*   **Regularly Update draw.io:** Keep the `jgraph/drawio` library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches within the library itself.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting via draw.io Viewer Vulnerabilities](./threats/cross-site_scripting_via_draw_io_viewer_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist within the draw.io viewer itself (the client-side code responsible for rendering diagrams). An attacker could craft a specific diagram that exploits these vulnerabilities, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution when the diagram is viewed. This is a vulnerability within the draw.io codebase.

**Impact:** Similar to the previous threat, leading to session hijacking, data theft, and other client-side attacks.

**Affected Component:**
*   draw.io **Diagram Viewer/Rendering Engine:** The core JavaScript code of the draw.io library responsible for interpreting and displaying diagrams.

**Risk Severity:** High (depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Regularly Update draw.io:** This is crucial to patch known vulnerabilities in the viewer.
*   **Security Audits of draw.io Integration:** Conduct regular security assessments and penetration testing focusing on how the application integrates and renders draw.io diagrams, specifically looking for vulnerabilities within the draw.io rendering process.
*   **Isolate draw.io in a Secure Context:** If possible, isolate the draw.io viewer within a secure iframe or a separate domain to limit the impact of a potential XSS vulnerability. Ensure proper `sandbox` attributes are used on iframes.

## Threat: [Server-Side Exploitation via Malicious Diagram Data](./threats/server-side_exploitation_via_malicious_diagram_data.md)

**Description:** If the application processes diagram data on the server-side (e.g., for generating previews, indexing content, converting formats) *using draw.io libraries or components on the server*, an attacker could craft a malicious diagram that exploits vulnerabilities in this server-side processing logic within draw.io. This could involve XML External Entity (XXE) injection if draw.io's server-side XML parser is not configured securely, or other injection attacks if diagram data is used in server-side commands or queries facilitated by draw.io server-side components.

**Impact:**  Server-side code execution, access to sensitive files or resources on the server, denial of service, or data breaches.

**Affected Component:**
*   draw.io **Server-Side Diagram Processing Modules (if used):** Any server-side code from the `jgraph/drawio` library that parses, manipulates, or processes draw.io diagram files (e.g., XML parsers, conversion tools).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Server-Side XML Parsing:** If using draw.io's server-side XML parsing capabilities, disable external entity resolution and DTD processing to prevent XXE attacks.
*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize diagram data before processing it on the server-side using draw.io libraries.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run server-side processes using draw.io components with the minimum necessary privileges.
*   **Regular Security Audits of Server-Side Code:** Review server-side code that utilizes draw.io for diagram processing for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Third-Party Integrations within draw.io](./threats/exploiting_third-party_integrations_within_draw_io.md)

**Description:** If the draw.io instance *itself* is configured to integrate with third-party services (e.g., for image storage, collaboration platforms, potentially through plugins or extensions within draw.io), vulnerabilities in these integrations *within the draw.io codebase* could be exploited through malicious diagrams. An attacker could craft a diagram that triggers actions or exposes data within the connected third-party service through draw.io's integration mechanisms.

**Impact:**  Data breaches, unauthorized access to third-party services, or other security incidents related to the integrated services.

**Affected Component:**
*   draw.io **Third-Party Integration Modules:** The parts of the `jgraph/drawio` library responsible for communicating with and interacting with external services.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the sensitivity of the integrated services and the nature of the vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Configuration of Integrations:** Follow security best practices when configuring draw.io's third-party integrations.
*   **Regularly Update draw.io and Integration Components:** Keep both the core `jgraph/drawio` library and any integrated third-party libraries or plugins up to date.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for Integrations:** Grant only the necessary permissions to integrated services within draw.io's configuration.
*   **Security Audits of Integrations:** Review the security of draw.io's integration with third-party services.
