## Deep Dive Analysis: Insecure SVG Export Functionality in drawio

This analysis delves into the security implications of the insecure SVG export functionality within applications utilizing the drawio library (https://github.com/jgraph/drawio). We will dissect the attack surface, explore potential attack vectors, assess the impact, and provide detailed recommendations for the development team.

**Attack Surface: Insecure SVG Export Functionality**

**Core Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the potential for drawio to embed unsanitized, user-controlled content, specifically active content like JavaScript, within exported SVG files. This occurs because the SVG generation process might not adequately filter or neutralize potentially malicious code introduced by users through diagram elements.

**Technical Deep Dive:**

1. **SVG Structure and Active Content:** SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) is an XML-based vector image format. While primarily used for static graphics, it allows for the inclusion of active content through:
    * **`<script>` tags:**  Directly embedding JavaScript code within the SVG.
    * **Event Handler Attributes:**  Attributes like `onload`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`, etc., which can execute JavaScript when triggered by user interaction or the SVG loading.
    * **`javascript:` URLs:**  Used within attributes like `href` to execute JavaScript when the link is clicked.
    * **Data URIs with JavaScript:** While less common in direct SVG export, it's a potential avenue if drawio allows embedding of arbitrary data URIs.

2. **drawio's Role in SVG Generation:** drawio takes the user's diagram data (shapes, text, connections, metadata) and translates it into the SVG markup. This process involves:
    * **Parsing Diagram Data:**  Interpreting the internal representation of the diagram.
    * **Generating SVG Elements:** Creating the corresponding XML elements for shapes, paths, text, etc.
    * **Handling User-Provided Content:**  Including text from labels, custom shapes, and potentially metadata associated with diagram elements.

3. **Injection Points for Malicious Content:**  Attackers can inject malicious JavaScript through various parts of the diagram:
    * **Text Labels:**  Users can directly input `<script>` tags or event handlers within text labels.
    * **Custom Shapes:** If the application allows users to define custom shapes with embedded SVG code, this provides a direct injection point.
    * **Shape Properties/Metadata:**  Some diagram elements might allow adding custom properties or metadata. If drawio includes these in the SVG without sanitization, it can be exploited.
    * **Data URIs in Images:** If users can embed images using data URIs, and the application doesn't restrict the `mime-type`, they could potentially inject JavaScript using a `data:text/html;base64,...` payload.

4. **Lack of Sanitization:** The core issue is the absence or inadequacy of sanitization during the SVG export process. If drawio doesn't actively remove or neutralize potentially harmful code before generating the SVG, the vulnerability persists.

**Threat Modeling:**

* **Attacker Goal:** Execute arbitrary JavaScript on the victim's machine by tricking them into opening a malicious SVG file.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Direct Download:**  A malicious user creates a diagram with embedded scripts and shares the exported SVG file.
    * **Embedding in Websites:**  A malicious actor could embed the SVG on a website they control or compromise, leading to script execution when a user visits the page.
    * **Phishing:**  Attackers could send emails with malicious SVG attachments disguised as legitimate diagrams.
    * **Supply Chain Attacks:** If the application integrates with other services or allows importing diagrams from external sources, malicious SVGs could be introduced through these channels.
* **Attacker Skill Level:**  Relatively low. Embedding basic JavaScript within SVG is not a complex task.
* **Likelihood of Exploitation:** Moderate to High, depending on the user base and the application's security awareness.

**Impact Assessment:**

* **Local Code Execution:** Opening the malicious SVG file allows the embedded JavaScript to execute within the user's browser context.
* **Information Disclosure:** The script can access local files, browser cookies, and potentially other sensitive information depending on the browser's security settings and any vulnerabilities present.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (if embedded online):** If the SVG is hosted on a website, the embedded script can potentially interact with the website's domain, leading to XSS attacks.
* **System Compromise:** In some cases, vulnerabilities in the browser or its plugins could be exploited by the malicious script to gain further access to the user's system.
* **Reputational Damage:** If users are affected by this vulnerability within the application, it can severely damage the application's reputation and user trust.

**Detailed Mitigation Strategies:**

Building upon the initial suggestions, here's a more in-depth look at mitigation strategies:

1. **Robust Server-Side SVG Sanitization (Mandatory):**
    * **Allow-listing Approach:**  Instead of trying to block every possible malicious pattern (which is difficult and prone to bypasses), focus on explicitly allowing only safe SVG elements and attributes.
    * **XML Parsing and Manipulation:**  Parse the generated SVG as XML and programmatically remove potentially dangerous elements like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, and event handler attributes (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`, `onmouseover`).
    * **Attribute Sanitization:**  For allowed attributes, sanitize their values. For example, ensure `href` attributes only contain safe URLs and not `javascript:` URLs.
    * **Consider Libraries:** Utilize well-vetted and maintained server-side SVG sanitization libraries (e.g., in Python: `bleach`, in JavaScript: `DOMPurify` on the server-side if Node.js is used).
    * **Regular Updates:** Keep the sanitization library updated to address newly discovered bypass techniques.

2. **Client-Side Awareness and Warnings:**
    * **Clear Warning Message:** When exporting to SVG, display a prominent warning message to users about the potential risks of opening SVG files from untrusted sources.
    * **Explain the Risk:** Briefly explain that SVG files can contain active content that could harm their system.
    * **Discourage Opening Unknown SVGs:** Advise users to only open SVG files from sources they trust.

3. **Alternative Export Formats (Highly Recommended):**
    * **Prioritize Safer Formats:** Encourage users to utilize safer export formats like PNG, JPEG, or PDF for general sharing and viewing.
    * **Clearly Label Export Options:**  Distinguish between potentially risky formats (like SVG) and safer alternatives.
    * **Default to Safer Formats:** Consider making a safer format the default export option.

4. **drawio Configuration Options (Explore and Implement):**
    * **Documentation Review:** Thoroughly review drawio's configuration documentation to identify any settings related to SVG export and the inclusion of scriptable content.
    * **Disable Scripting (if possible):** If drawio offers options to disable the inclusion of `<script>` tags or event handlers during SVG generation, implement these settings.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP) Headers (if applicable):** If the drawio instance is served through a web application, implement strong CSP headers to restrict the execution of inline scripts and other potentially dangerous content.

5. **Input Validation and Sanitization at Diagram Creation:**
    * **Client-Side Sanitization (with caution):** While server-side sanitization is crucial, implement client-side sanitization on text input fields to prevent users from easily entering obvious malicious code. However, rely primarily on server-side sanitization as client-side measures can be bypassed.
    * **Restrict Allowed Characters:** Limit the characters allowed in text labels and shape properties to prevent the injection of special characters used in scripting.

6. **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**
    * **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the application, specifically focusing on the SVG export functionality.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing to identify potential vulnerabilities and bypasses in the implemented mitigations.

7. **Developer Training and Secure Coding Practices:**
    * **Educate Developers:** Train developers on the risks associated with insecure SVG handling and other common web vulnerabilities.
    * **Secure Coding Guidelines:** Implement secure coding guidelines that emphasize input validation, output encoding, and the principle of least privilege.

**Developer-Focused Recommendations:**

* **Prioritize Server-Side Sanitization:** This is the most critical mitigation. Implement a robust server-side sanitization process using a well-vetted library.
* **Treat User Input as Untrusted:**  Always assume that any data originating from the user can be malicious.
* **Follow the Principle of Least Privilege:** Only include necessary data in the SVG export. Avoid including potentially sensitive or unnecessary information.
* **Implement Automated Testing:** Create automated tests to verify the effectiveness of the sanitization process and to detect regressions if changes are made to the export functionality.
* **Stay Updated:** Keep the drawio library and any sanitization libraries updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
* **Consider a "Strict" SVG Export Mode:** Offer an option for users to export SVG with the strictest security settings, removing all potentially interactive elements.

**Conclusion:**

The insecure SVG export functionality in drawio presents a significant security risk due to the potential for embedding and executing malicious JavaScript. Addressing this vulnerability requires a multi-layered approach, with robust server-side sanitization being the cornerstone. By implementing the recommended mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the attack surface and protect users from potential harm. It is crucial to prioritize this issue and continuously monitor for new attack vectors and vulnerabilities. Ignoring this risk can lead to serious security breaches, reputational damage, and loss of user trust.
