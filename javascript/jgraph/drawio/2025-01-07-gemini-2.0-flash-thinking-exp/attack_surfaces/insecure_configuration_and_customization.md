## Deep Analysis of Attack Surface: Insecure Configuration and Customization in Applications Using drawio

This analysis delves into the "Insecure Configuration and Customization" attack surface for applications leveraging the drawio library (https://github.com/jgraph/drawio). We will expand on the provided information, explore potential vulnerabilities, and offer detailed mitigation strategies from a cybersecurity expert's perspective collaborating with a development team.

**Attack Surface Title:** Insecure Configuration and Customization

**Detailed Description:**

This attack surface arises from the inherent flexibility and extensibility offered by drawio. While these features empower users and developers, they simultaneously introduce potential security risks if not managed carefully. The core issue is that drawio's behavior and functionality can be significantly altered through various configuration options and customization mechanisms. If these alterations are performed without adequate security considerations, they can create pathways for attackers to compromise the application and its underlying systems.

This attack surface isn't limited to just the drawio library itself. It extends to how the *integrating application* utilizes and configures drawio. The application's architecture, user permission model, and overall security posture significantly influence the impact of insecure drawio configurations.

**Drawio's Specific Contribution to the Attack Surface:**

drawio's architecture and features contribute to this attack surface in several key ways:

* **Plugin Architecture:**  drawio allows for the loading of external plugins to extend its functionality. This is a powerful feature, but if the application allows loading plugins from untrusted sources or doesn't properly sanitize or sandbox them, it creates a direct avenue for malicious code execution.
* **Theme Customization:**  While seemingly innocuous, the ability to load custom themes can be exploited. Malicious themes could potentially include embedded scripts or links to external resources that could be used for phishing or other attacks.
* **Configuration Settings:** drawio exposes numerous configuration options that control its behavior. Insecure defaults or misconfigurations in areas like file handling, network access, or script execution can create vulnerabilities.
* **Client-Side Execution:**  Much of drawio's logic executes within the user's browser. This means that insecure configurations can directly impact the client-side environment, potentially exposing user data or allowing for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
* **Integration Complexity:**  Integrating drawio into a larger application introduces complexity. The way the application handles drawio's configuration, data, and events can introduce vulnerabilities if not carefully designed.

**Attack Vectors (Expanding on the Example):**

Beyond the example of malicious plugin loading, here are other potential attack vectors within this surface:

* **Malicious Theme Loading:** An attacker could trick a user into loading a malicious theme that contains JavaScript code designed to steal session cookies, redirect users to phishing sites, or perform other malicious actions within the drawio context.
* **Insecure Default Configurations:** The application might rely on default drawio configurations that are not secure. For example, allowing unrestricted access to local file systems or enabling features that are not necessary for the application's functionality.
* **Configuration Injection:** An attacker might be able to manipulate configuration settings through vulnerabilities in the application's interface. This could involve exploiting input validation flaws or insecure API endpoints to inject malicious configuration parameters.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration:** Insecure configuration options might allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then executed within the drawio context when other users interact with the application.
* **Exploiting Legacy or Unpatched Versions:** Using an outdated version of drawio with known vulnerabilities, even with seemingly secure configurations, can still expose the application to risk.
* **Supply Chain Attacks on Plugins/Themes:** Even if the application restricts plugin sources, a trusted source could be compromised, leading to the distribution of malicious plugins or themes.

**Potential Impacts (Beyond Arbitrary Code Execution):**

While arbitrary code execution is a significant risk, other potential impacts include:

* **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious plugins or scripts could be used to steal sensitive data displayed or stored within drawio diagrams.
* **Session Hijacking:** Attackers could steal user session cookies through malicious scripts executed within the drawio context.
* **Phishing Attacks:** Malicious themes or plugins could be used to display fake login prompts or redirect users to phishing websites.
* **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Insecure configurations could potentially be exploited to overload the drawio instance or the underlying application, leading to a denial of service.
* **Defacement:** Attackers could manipulate diagrams or the drawio interface to deface the application.
* **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA Triad):**  Insecure configurations can impact all three pillars of information security.
* **Reputational Damage:** A successful attack exploiting insecure drawio configurations can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization.
* **Compliance Violations:** Depending on the industry and regulations, insecure configurations could lead to compliance violations and associated penalties.

**Risk Severity Justification:**

The "High" risk severity is justified due to the potential for significant impact, including arbitrary code execution, data breaches, and other malicious activities. The likelihood of exploitation can be high if the application doesn't implement robust security measures around drawio's configuration and customization features. The ease with which malicious plugins or themes can be created and potentially loaded further contributes to the high-risk rating.

**Comprehensive Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Actionable):**

* **Secure Defaults and Hardening:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Disable any drawio features or configuration options that are not strictly necessary for the application's intended functionality.
    * **Disable Unnecessary Features:**  If the application doesn't require plugins or custom themes, disable these features entirely.
    * **Review Default Configurations:** Thoroughly review drawio's default configuration settings and modify them to be more secure. Consult drawio's documentation and security best practices.
    * **Implement Strong Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure a strict CSP to control the resources that drawio can load, significantly mitigating the risk of XSS attacks through malicious themes or configurations.
* **Restrict Customizations and Enforce Controls:**
    * **Whitelisting for Plugins and Themes:** Implement a strict whitelisting mechanism for allowed plugins and themes. Only permit loading from trusted and verified sources.
    * **Code Review for Customizations:** If custom plugins or themes are necessary, implement a rigorous code review process to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities before deployment.
    * **Sandboxing of Plugins:** If possible, implement sandboxing techniques to isolate plugins and limit their access to system resources and the application's data.
    * **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Carefully validate and sanitize any user input that influences drawio's configuration or the loading of external resources.
* **Principle of Least Privilege (Application Level):**
    * **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Implement RBAC within the integrating application to control who can modify drawio configurations and load plugins/themes.
    * **Separate Permissions:**  Distinguish permissions for viewing diagrams from permissions for modifying configurations or loading extensions.
* **Regular Review and Monitoring:**
    * **Periodic Configuration Audits:** Regularly review drawio's configuration settings to ensure they remain secure and aligned with security policies.
    * **Vulnerability Scanning:** Include the drawio component in regular vulnerability scans to identify potential weaknesses in the library itself or its dependencies.
    * **Monitoring for Suspicious Activity:** Implement monitoring mechanisms to detect any unusual activity related to drawio, such as attempts to load unauthorized plugins or modify configurations.
* **Dependency Management:**
    * **Keep drawio Updated:** Regularly update the drawio library to the latest stable version to patch known security vulnerabilities.
    * **Dependency Scanning:**  Scan drawio's dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them as needed.
* **Security Awareness Training:**
    * **Educate Developers:** Ensure developers are aware of the security risks associated with insecure drawio configurations and how to mitigate them.
    * **Educate Users (if applicable):**  If end-users have the ability to customize drawio, provide them with guidance on safe practices and the risks of loading untrusted extensions.
* **Secure Integration Practices:**
    * **Secure Data Handling:** Ensure that the integrating application handles drawio data securely, both in transit and at rest.
    * **Secure API Integration:** If the application interacts with drawio through an API, ensure that the API endpoints are properly secured against unauthorized access and manipulation.
* **Consider Alternatives:**
    * **Evaluate Alternatives:** If the security risks associated with drawio's customization features are too high, consider alternative diagramming libraries or solutions with more restrictive customization options.

**Specific Considerations for drawio:**

* **Examine `config.js` and related configuration files:** Understand how drawio's configuration is managed within the application. Secure these files and restrict access.
* **Analyze the plugin loading mechanism:**  Understand how the application allows plugins to be loaded and implement strict controls around this process.
* **Review the theme loading process:**  Ensure that the application sanitizes or restricts the content of loaded themes to prevent malicious scripts.
* **Understand the client-side execution environment:** Be aware of the potential for client-side attacks and implement appropriate mitigations like CSP.
