## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Diagram Content for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_diagram_content_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Objective**: Inject malicious content into draw.io diagrams to compromise the application or its users.
* **Attack Vector**: Embed Malicious Script (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)
    * **Description**: An attacker crafts a draw.io diagram containing malicious JavaScript code. This code is embedded within diagram elements such as labels, attributes, or custom XML data.
    * **Execution**: When the application renders or processes this diagram, the embedded JavaScript code is executed within the user's web browser.
    * **Impact**: Successful execution of the script can lead to:
        * Session hijacking: Stealing the user's session cookie to impersonate them.
        * Data theft: Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or making API calls on behalf of the user.
        * Defacement: Modifying the appearance or content of the web page.
        * Redirection: Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
        * Keylogging: Capturing the user's keystrokes.
    * **Contributing Factors**:
        * Lack of input sanitization by the application when processing diagram data.
        * Absence of output encoding when rendering diagram content.
        * Missing or misconfigured Content Security Policy (CSP).
    * **Mitigation**:
        * Implement robust input sanitization on all diagram data received from draw.io before storing or processing it.
        * Apply output encoding when rendering diagram content in the application's UI.
        * Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and prevent inline script execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Integration Weaknesses in the Application's Use of draw.io](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_integration_weaknesses_in_the_application's_use_of_draw_io.md)

**Objective**: Exploit vulnerabilities arising from how the application integrates and handles data from draw.io.
* **Attack Vector**: Insufficient Input Validation of Diagram Data
    * **Description**: The application fails to adequately validate diagram data received from the draw.io component before using it. This includes data within the diagram itself (labels, attributes, custom properties) and metadata associated with the diagram.
    * **Exploitation**: An attacker can craft malicious diagram data that exploits this lack of validation. This can lead to various vulnerabilities depending on how the application processes the data.
    * **Impact**:
        * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): As described above, malicious scripts can be injected if diagram content is not properly sanitized.
        * Data Injection: Malicious data within the diagram can be inserted into the application's database or backend systems, potentially leading to data corruption or further exploitation.
        * Server-Side Vulnerabilities: If diagram data is processed server-side, lack of validation can lead to vulnerabilities like SQL injection (if diagram data is used in database queries) or command injection (if diagram data is used in system commands).
    * **Contributing Factors**:
        * Assuming that data from draw.io is inherently safe.
        * Lack of comprehensive validation rules for diagram data.
        * Improper error handling when processing invalid diagram data.
    * **Mitigation**:
        * Implement thorough input validation on all diagram data received from draw.io. This should include checks for data type, format, and potentially malicious patterns.
        * Use a whitelist approach for validation, only allowing known good data.
        * Sanitize diagram data to remove or neutralize potentially harmful content.
        * Implement server-side validation even if client-side validation is present, as client-side checks can be bypassed.
