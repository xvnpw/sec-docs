# Attack Surface Analysis for jgraph/drawio

## Attack Surface: [Malicious XML Payloads in Diagram Data](./attack_surfaces/malicious_xml_payloads_in_diagram_data.md)

*   **Description:** Crafted XML data within a drawio diagram can exploit vulnerabilities in drawio's XML parsing or processing logic.
    *   **How drawio Contributes:** drawio directly parses and renders XML, its native file format. Malicious XML can trigger unintended behavior during this process.
    *   **Example:** A diagram contains XML with embedded JavaScript. When drawio renders this diagram, the script executes in the user's browser (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS). Server-side processing of malicious XML could lead to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or phishing. Server-side XXE can allow access to local files or internal resources.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (Server-side XXE), High (Client-side XSS)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all diagram data before drawio processes it, specifically targeting XML content.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of client-side XSS.
        *   **Secure XML Parsing:** If server-side processing is involved, use secure XML parsers with XXE protection enabled or explicitly disabled.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep drawio updated to patch potential XML processing vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Diagram Content](./attack_surfaces/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_diagram_content.md)

*   **Description:** Users can insert malicious content into diagrams that, when rendered by drawio, executes arbitrary JavaScript in other users' browsers.
    *   **How drawio Contributes:** drawio renders user-provided content within the diagram. If this rendering doesn't properly sanitize or escape potentially malicious input, XSS vulnerabilities arise directly from drawio's rendering engine.
    *   **Example:** A user creates a shape with a label containing `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`. When drawio renders this diagram for another user, the JavaScript executes.
    *   **Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, phishing, or defacement within the context of the application using drawio.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Output Encoding:** Ensure drawio's rendering process properly encodes all user-provided content for the output context (HTML encoding).
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strong CSP can significantly reduce the impact of XSS.
        *   **Input Validation:** While output encoding is key, some input validation can help prevent the introduction of harmful content.
        *   **Feature Restrictions:** Limit or carefully control drawio features allowing arbitrary HTML or JavaScript-like content input.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Export Functionality (Specifically SVG)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_export_functionality__specifically_svg_.md)

*   **Description:** When exporting diagrams to SVG format, drawio might include user-provided content or allow the embedding of active content (like JavaScript) within the SVG file.
    *   **How drawio Contributes:** drawio generates the SVG files based on the diagram data. If this generation process doesn't sanitize or remove potentially malicious scripts, it directly contributes to the vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A diagram contains a custom shape or label that, when exported to SVG by drawio, includes an `<script>` tag or an event handler attribute containing malicious JavaScript. Opening this SVG file executes the script.
    *   **Impact:** Opening a downloaded SVG file can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript on the user's local machine, potentially compromising their system.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **SVG Sanitization:** Implement server-side sanitization of exported SVG files generated by drawio to remove any potentially malicious JavaScript or active content.
        *   **Inform Users:** Warn users about the potential risks of opening SVG files from untrusted sources.
        *   **Consider Alternative Export Formats:** If the risk is significant, offer alternative export formats less prone to embedding active content (e.g., PNG) through the application.
        *   **Configuration Options:** Explore drawio's configuration options to control the inclusion of scriptable content in SVG exports.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Configuration and Customization](./attack_surfaces/insecure_configuration_and_customization.md)

*   **Description:** Improperly configured drawio settings can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   **How drawio Contributes:** drawio offers various configuration options that, if set insecurely, can directly expose the application to risks.
    *   **Example:** A drawio instance is configured to allow loading of arbitrary plugins or themes from untrusted sources, and a malicious plugin is loaded, executing code within the drawio context.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code within the drawio context, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious activities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Defaults:** Use the most secure default configurations for drawio.
        *   **Restrict Customizations:** Carefully control and review any custom plugins, themes, or configurations applied to drawio. Only allow trusted sources for extensions.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only enable necessary drawio features and permissions.
        *   **Regular Review:** Periodically review drawio's configuration settings to ensure they remain secure.
