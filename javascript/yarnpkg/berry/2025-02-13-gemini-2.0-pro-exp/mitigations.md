# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for yarnpkg/berry

## Mitigation Strategy: [Code Review and Integrity Checks for PnP Files](./mitigation_strategies/code_review_and_integrity_checks_for_pnp_files.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a Policy:** Mandate manual review of *any* changes to `.yarn/cache`, `pnp.cjs`, and `.pnp.data.json`. This is *crucial* because these files control package resolution in Berry.
    2.  **Automated Detection (Pre-Commit Hook):** Use a pre-commit hook (e.g., Husky) to flag changes to these files, preventing accidental commits of malicious modifications.
    3.  **Manual Inspection:** Reviewers should:
        *   **Diff Analysis:** Carefully examine the diff of `pnp.cjs` and `.pnp.data.json`. Look for unexpected additions/removals/modifications of package mappings, paying close attention to paths and versions.
        *   **Contextual Understanding:** Understand *why* a mapping was changed. Does it align with intended functionality?
        *   **Cross-Reference:** Compare changes in PnP files with `package.json` and `yarn.lock` for consistency.
    4.  **Documentation:** Changes to PnP files *must* be documented in commit messages and pull requests.
    5. **Regular expression validation**: Add validation of `pnp.cjs` and `.pnp.data.json` content using regular expressions. This validation should be part of pre-commit hook.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Package Redirection (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from silently redirecting package resolution to compromised code *without* altering `package.json` or `yarn.lock`. This is *unique* to Yarn Berry's PnP.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Reduces errors in PnP files that could break builds.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (via Cache Poisoning) (High Severity):** Makes it harder to exploit a compromised package in the cache by manipulating PnP files (though not a complete solution).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Package Redirection:** Significantly reduces risk; manual review makes it much harder for malicious code to go unnoticed.
    *   **Accidental Misconfiguration:** Reduces risk considerably; pre-commit hooks and reviews catch errors early.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (via Cache Poisoning):** Provides a layer of defense, but other mitigations are needed.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Pre-commit hook in `.husky/pre-commit`. Code review policy in `docs/development/code_review.md`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Automated diff analysis tool specifically for `pnp.cjs` is not implemented. Relying on manual diff review. Regular expression validation is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Auditing and Pinning](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_auditing_and_pinning.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Plugin Inventory:** Maintain a list of all Yarn *plugins*, including purpose, source, and version.
    2.  **Vetting Process:** Before installing *any* plugin:
        *   **Source Code Review:** Examine the plugin's source code (if available) for suspicious patterns.
        *   **Maintainer Reputation:** Research the plugin's maintainer. Are they known and trusted?
        *   **Issue Tracker:** Check for reported security issues.
        *   **Alternatives:** Consider if there are more established plugins that do the same thing.
    3.  **Pinning:** Use the `@` syntax in `yarn plugin import` to specify a *precise* version: `yarn plugin import https://example.com/my-plugin@1.2.3`. *Do not* use version ranges. This is *critical* for plugins.
    4.  **Regular Review:** Periodically review installed plugins and versions. Check for updates and advisories.
    5.  **Documentation:** Document the rationale for choosing each plugin and its pinned version.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Plugin Execution (High Severity):** Prevents installation/execution of plugins with malicious code. This is specific to Yarn's plugin architecture.
    *   **Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation (High Severity):** Reduces risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities in outdated plugins.
    *   **Unintentional Functionality Changes (Medium Severity):** Pinning prevents unexpected changes in plugin behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Plugin Execution:** Significantly reduces risk by requiring vetting and preventing untrusted plugins.
    *   **Vulnerable Plugin Exploitation:** Reduces risk by ensuring only specific, known-good versions are used.
    *   **Unintentional Functionality Changes:** Eliminates risk of unexpected behavior changes from updates.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Plugin inventory in `docs/development/yarn_plugins.md`. Plugins pinned in `.yarnrc.yml`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Automated vulnerability scanning for Yarn plugins is not implemented. Relying on manual checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Immutable Infrastructure for CI/CD and Production (Focus on `.yarn/cache`)](./mitigation_strategies/immutable_infrastructure_for_cicd_and_production__focus_on___yarncache__.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Containerization:** Use Docker (or similar).
    2.  **Build Stage:** In the Dockerfile:
        *   Install Yarn Berry.
        *   Run `yarn install` to populate `.yarn/cache` and generate PnP files.  This is the *key* step for Berry.
        *   Build the application.
    3.  **Runtime Stage:**
        *   Copy *only* necessary artifacts (including the built app, `.yarn/cache`, and PnP files) from the build stage.
        *   Run the application. *Do not* run `yarn install` here.
    4.  **Immutable Image:** Treat the Docker image as immutable after building.
    5.  **CI/CD Pipeline:** Integrate this into the CI/CD pipeline. Each deployment uses a fresh, immutable image.
    6.  **Production Environment:** Ensure production only runs these immutable images. Prevent modifications to the running container.  The critical point is that the `.yarn/cache` is fixed at build time.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Runtime Tampering (High Severity):** Prevents modifying the app, dependencies, or PnP files *after* deployment.
    *   **Cache Poisoning (in Production) (High Severity):** Prevents exploiting a compromised package in the cache to inject code into the *running* application. This is directly relevant to Berry's offline cache.
    *   **Inconsistent Environments (Medium Severity):** Ensures production is identical to the tested environment.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Runtime Tampering:** Eliminates the risk of runtime modifications.
    *   **Cache Poisoning (in Production):** Significantly reduces risk by preventing modifications to the cache after the image is built.
    *   **Inconsistent Environments:** Eliminates environment discrepancies.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Dockerfile in `Dockerfile`. CI/CD pipeline in `gitlab-ci.yml` builds/deploys immutable images.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Kubernetes deployment doesn't enforce immutability of running pods (e.g., read-only root filesystems).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Updated Tooling and Yarn-Specific Commands (Focus on Berry Compatibility)](./mitigation_strategies/updated_tooling_and_yarn-specific_commands__focus_on_berry_compatibility_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Analysis:** Use `yarn outdated`, `yarn why`, and `yarn audit`. *Do not* rely on tools that parse the old `yarn.lock` format.  This is *essential* for Berry.
    2.  **Vulnerability Scanning:** Use scanners *specifically designed* for Yarn Berry (e.g., Snyk, Dependabot). Ensure they understand the `yarn.lock` and PnP.
    3.  **License Compliance:** Use tools compatible with Yarn Berry for license checks.
    4.  **Regular Updates:** Keep all tools updated to ensure compatibility with the latest Yarn Berry features and security fixes.
    5. **Training:** Train developers to use Yarn-specific commands.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Missed Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Ensures vulnerability scanners correctly identify vulnerabilities in dependencies managed by Yarn Berry (due to its different lockfile and PnP).
    *   **Incorrect Dependency Information (Medium Severity):** Prevents reliance on outdated information.
    *   **License Violations (Medium Severity):** Ensures accurate license compliance checks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Missed Vulnerabilities:** Significantly reduces risk of deploying apps with known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Incorrect Dependency Information:** Eliminates risk of relying on inaccurate data.
    *   **License Violations:** Reduces risk of legal issues.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Snyk integrated into CI/CD. Developers use `yarn audit` and `yarn outdated`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Automated license compliance checks are not fully integrated into CI/CD.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Workspace Isolation and Management (Yarn Workspaces Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/workspace_isolation_and_management__yarn_workspaces_specific_.md)

* **Description:**
    1. **Independent Audits:** Treat each workspace as a separate entity for security auditing. Conduct independent vulnerability scans and code reviews.
    2. **Dependency Definition:** Explicitly define dependencies between workspaces in `package.json` using the `workspace:` protocol. Avoid implicit or wildcard dependencies. This is *key* to managing workspace relationships in Yarn.
    3. **Circular Dependency Check:** Regularly check for and eliminate circular dependencies between workspaces (e.g., using `madge`).
    4. **Build Isolation (Ideal):** If possible, build each workspace in a separate container/environment to prevent cross-contamination.
    5. **Access Control:** If using a monorepo with multiple teams, restrict write access to specific workspaces based on team responsibilities.
    6. **Documentation:** Document dependencies and relationships between workspaces.

* **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Cross-Workspace Contamination (High Severity):** Prevents a vulnerability in one workspace from affecting others. This is specific to how Yarn Workspaces manage dependencies.
    * **Unintended Dependency Conflicts (Medium Severity):** Reduces conflicts between dependencies in different workspaces.
    * **Unauthorized Code Modification (Medium Severity):** Limits the impact of unauthorized access.

* **Impact:**
    * **Cross-Workspace Contamination:** Significantly reduces risk of cascading failures.
    * **Unintended Dependency Conflicts:** Reduces build failures and runtime errors.
    * **Unauthorized Code Modification:** Limits the scope of potential damage.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * Example: Dependencies between workspaces are explicitly defined. Circular dependency checks are run periodically.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * Example: Build isolation for each workspace is not implemented. Access control based on workspaces is not enforced.
