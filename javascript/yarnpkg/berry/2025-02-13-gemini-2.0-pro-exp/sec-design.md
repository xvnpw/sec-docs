# Project Design Document: Yarn Berry

## BUSINESS POSTURE

Yarn Berry is the latest version of the Yarn package manager, a popular alternative to npm for managing JavaScript project dependencies. It aims to improve upon the original Yarn (classic) and npm in terms of speed, reliability, security, and features.

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a fast and reliable dependency management solution for JavaScript developers.
*   Improve developer experience through features like Plug'n'Play (PnP), Zero-Installs, and workspaces.
*   Enhance security by mitigating risks associated with traditional `node_modules` installations.
*   Offer a modern and extensible architecture for future development and community contributions.
*   Maintain compatibility with the vast majority of existing JavaScript projects and workflows.
*   Reduce disk space usage and improve installation times compared to traditional methods.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Adoption: Failure to gain sufficient adoption by the JavaScript community, hindering its long-term viability.
*   Compatibility: Incompatibility with existing projects or tools, leading to user frustration and migration challenges.
*   Security Vulnerabilities: Introduction of new security vulnerabilities due to its redesigned architecture.
*   Maintenance and Support: Inability to maintain and support the project effectively, leading to bugs and unresolved issues.
*   Performance Regressions: Unexpected performance regressions compared to Yarn Classic or npm.
*   Complexity: Increased complexity for users unfamiliar with its new concepts (PnP, Zero-Installs).

## SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Integrity checking of downloaded packages using checksums (lockfile). Implemented in Yarn's core logic and described in the documentation.
*   security control: Offline cache to prevent network-based attacks during installation. Implemented in Yarn's core logic and described in the documentation.
*   security control: Strict enforcement of package versions specified in the lockfile. Implemented in Yarn's core logic and described in the documentation.
*   security control: Plug'n'Play (PnP) mode, which eliminates the `node_modules` directory, reducing the attack surface. Implemented in Yarn's core logic and described in the documentation.
*   security control: Code signing of releases (though not consistently enforced across all distribution channels). Partially implemented and needs improvement.
*   security control: Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning (details are not fully public). Mentioned in blog posts and community discussions.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party registries (e.g., npm registry) for package downloads.
*   accepted risk: Potential for supply chain attacks if a compromised package is published to a registry.
*   accepted risk: Limited control over the security practices of individual package authors.
*   accepted risk: User error, such as accidentally committing sensitive information to the repository.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement consistent code signing and verification for all release channels.
*   security control: Integrate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation to improve supply chain visibility.
*   security control: Provide clear documentation and tooling for vulnerability reporting and remediation.
*   security control: Implement automated security checks in the CI/CD pipeline (SAST, DAST, SCA).
*   security control: Offer options for stricter security policies, such as requiring two-factor authentication for package publishing.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Users publishing packages to registries should authenticate using strong credentials and preferably multi-factor authentication.
    *   Yarn should securely store and manage authentication tokens for accessing private registries.

*   Authorization:
    *   Yarn should respect registry-specific authorization mechanisms for accessing and publishing packages.
    *   Access control should be enforced to prevent unauthorized modifications to project dependencies.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Yarn should validate all user inputs, including package names, versions, and configuration options.
    *   Yarn should sanitize inputs to prevent injection attacks.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Yarn should use strong cryptographic algorithms for checksumming and integrity verification.
    *   Secure communication channels (HTTPS) should be used for all interactions with registries.
    *   Sensitive data, such as authentication tokens, should be stored securely using appropriate encryption mechanisms.

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer: A developer writes code and commits it to their local machine.
2.  Local Machine: The developer's local environment where code is written and tested.
3.  Git: The local Git repository.
4.  GitHub: The remote GitHub repository where the Yarn Berry source code is hosted.
5.  GitHub Actions: The CI/CD system used to automate the build process.
6.  Tests: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
7.  Linters: Code linters (e.g., ESLint) are used to enforce coding style and identify potential errors.
8.  SAST (Static Analysis): Static analysis tools are used to scan the codebase for security vulnerabilities.  While the specific tools used are not explicitly mentioned in the repository, this is a recommended security control.
9.  Build Artifact (npm package): The final build artifact is a Yarn Berry npm package.
10. npm Registry: The npm registry where the Yarn Berry package is published.

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code review: All code changes are reviewed by other developers before being merged.
*   security control: Automated testing: Extensive test suite to catch bugs and regressions.
*   security control: Linting: Enforces code style and identifies potential errors.
*   security control: Static analysis (SAST): Scans the codebase for security vulnerabilities (recommended, implementation details not fully public).
*   security control: Dependency management: Yarn Berry itself is used to manage its own dependencies, ensuring consistent and secure builds.
*   security control: CI/CD pipeline: Automates the build process, reducing the risk of manual errors.

## RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Dependency Management: The core process of resolving, downloading, and installing project dependencies.
*   Package Publishing: The process of publishing new versions of Yarn Berry to the npm registry.
*   Community Engagement: Maintaining an active and engaged community of users and contributors.

Data to Protect:

*   Source Code: The Yarn Berry codebase itself (sensitivity: medium).
*   Lockfile: Contains precise dependency information (sensitivity: medium).
*   Cache: Contains downloaded packages (sensitivity: medium).
*   User Credentials (for publishing): Authentication tokens for accessing private registries (sensitivity: high).
*   Build Artifacts: The compiled Yarn Berry package (sensitivity: medium).

## QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific SAST tools are used in the Yarn Berry build process?
*   What are the details of the security audits and vulnerability scanning procedures?
*   What is the process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by external researchers?
*   Are there any plans to implement SBOM generation?
*   What are the specific security configurations used in the CI/CD environment?
*   What mechanisms are in place to prevent or detect malicious code being introduced into the Yarn Berry codebase or its dependencies?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE: The Yarn Berry project prioritizes security and aims to provide a secure dependency management solution.
*   SECURITY POSTURE: The project follows secure development practices, but there is room for improvement in areas like code signing and SBOM generation.
*   DESIGN: The design of Yarn Berry, particularly the PnP mode, inherently reduces some security risks associated with traditional `node_modules` installations. The CI/CD pipeline is configured securely. Developers follow secure coding practices.
