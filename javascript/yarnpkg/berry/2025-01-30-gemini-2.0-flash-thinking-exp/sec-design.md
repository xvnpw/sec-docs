# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Yarn Berry project aims to provide a fast, reliable, and secure dependency management solution for JavaScript projects. It focuses on improving upon the original Yarn and npm by offering features like Plug'n'Play installs, constraints, and improved performance.

Business priorities and goals:
- Provide a robust and efficient package management tool for JavaScript developers.
- Ensure compatibility and seamless integration with existing JavaScript ecosystems.
- Enhance performance and reduce installation times compared to other package managers.
- Offer advanced features for managing complex project dependencies.
- Maintain a strong and active community around the project.

Most important business risks:
- Security vulnerabilities within Yarn itself could compromise developer machines and projects.
- Supply chain attacks through malicious packages downloaded and managed by Yarn.
- Data integrity issues if Yarn mishandles package data or configurations.
- Reputational damage if Yarn is perceived as unreliable or insecure, leading to decreased adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Code hosted on GitHub, leveraging GitHub's security features like Dependabot for dependency vulnerability scanning. (Implemented: GitHub repository settings)
- security control: Open source project, allowing for community security reviews and contributions. (Implemented: Project governance model)
- security control: Regular updates and releases to address reported issues and vulnerabilities. (Implemented: Release management process)
- security control: Usage of HTTPS for communication with package registries to ensure data integrity and confidentiality during package downloads. (Implemented: Within Yarn's network communication logic)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: As an open-source project, the codebase is publicly accessible, potentially revealing vulnerabilities to malicious actors.
- accepted risk: Reliance on external package registries introduces inherent supply chain risks.
- accepted risk: Community contributions, while beneficial, require careful review to prevent introduction of vulnerabilities.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- recommended security control: Generate and distribute Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for Yarn releases to enhance transparency and allow users to track dependencies and potential vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Enhance input validation and sanitization throughout Yarn, especially when parsing package manifests, lockfiles, and user inputs from the command line.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to proactively identify and address potential weaknesses.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
  - Not directly applicable to Yarn's core functionality as it does not handle user authentication itself.
  - However, Yarn interacts with package registries (like npmjs.com) which require authentication for publishing and accessing private packages. Yarn should securely handle credentials provided for registry authentication, leveraging registry-specific authentication mechanisms.
- Authorization:
  - Similar to authentication, authorization is primarily relevant in the context of interacting with package registries.
  - Yarn should respect and enforce authorization policies defined by package registries when accessing and managing packages.
- Input validation:
  - Critical for Yarn to prevent various vulnerabilities.
  - Yarn must rigorously validate all inputs, including:
    - Package names and versions from package manifests (package.json, etc.).
    - Configuration parameters from yarnrc files and command-line arguments.
    - Data received from package registries.
  - Input validation should prevent injection attacks, path traversal, and other input-related vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography:
  - Yarn relies on cryptography for:
    - Verifying the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums (e.g., SHA512 hashes in lockfiles).
    - Ensuring secure communication with package registries over HTTPS.
  - Yarn should use well-established and secure cryptographic libraries and algorithms.
  - Key management for any cryptographic operations should be handled securely.

    DEVELOPER("Developer") --> GIT_REPO("Git Repository (GitHub)")
    GIT_REPO --> GITHUB_ACTIONS("GitHub Actions (CI/CD)")
    GITHUB_ACTIONS --> BUILD_ARTIFACTS("Build Artifacts")

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer: Developers write code, make changes, and commit them to a Git repository.
2. Git Repository (GitHub): The source code repository hosted on GitHub. Stores the project's codebase and tracks changes.
3. GitHub Actions (CI/CD): GitHub Actions is used for continuous integration and continuous delivery. When code is pushed to the repository, GitHub Actions workflows are triggered to build, test, and package Yarn.
4. Build Artifacts: The output of the build process, which includes distributable Yarn packages (e.g., binaries, archives). These artifacts are typically stored for distribution and release.

Build Security Controls:

- security control: Source Code Management with Git: Using Git for version control provides traceability and integrity of the codebase. Code reviews on pull requests before merging changes into the main branch. (Implemented: GitHub repository and development workflow)
- security control: Automated Build Process with GitHub Actions: Automates the build process, reducing manual steps and potential errors. Defines a repeatable and consistent build environment. (Implemented: GitHub Actions workflows)
- security control: Static Analysis Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically scan the codebase for potential vulnerabilities during the build process. (Recommended: Integrate SAST tools in CI)
- security control: Dependency Scanning: GitHub Dependabot automatically scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities. (Implemented: GitHub Dependabot)
- security control: Build Environment Security: Ensure the GitHub Actions build environment is secure and isolated. Minimize access to sensitive credentials within the build process. (Implemented: GitHub Actions security best practices)
- security control: Code Signing (Optional): Consider code signing build artifacts to ensure their integrity and authenticity. (Recommended: Code signing for releases)

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Secure and reliable dependency management for JavaScript projects using Yarn.
- Integrity and availability of the Yarn package manager itself.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Yarn codebase: Medium sensitivity. Publicly available but integrity is important.
- Build artifacts (Yarn distributions): Medium sensitivity. Integrity and availability are important for users.
- Package manifests (package.json, yarn.lock): Low sensitivity. Publicly available project configuration files.
- Cached packages: Low sensitivity. Re-downloadable packages.
- Potentially sensitive configuration data (registry credentials): High sensitivity. If users store registry credentials in Yarn configuration, these need to be protected.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific SAST tools are currently used or planned to be used in the Yarn Berry CI/CD pipeline?
- Is there a formal process for security vulnerability reporting and handling for Yarn Berry?
- Are there plans to implement SBOM generation for Yarn Berry releases?
- What mechanisms are in place to ensure the security of the GitHub Actions build environment and prevent supply chain attacks through the build process?
- How are registry credentials handled securely when used with Yarn?

Assumptions:
- Yarn Berry development team follows secure coding practices.
- GitHub is used as the primary platform for code hosting, collaboration, and CI/CD.
- Standard security practices are applied for open-source project development.
- Users are expected to follow best practices for securing their development environments and managing sensitive credentials.
