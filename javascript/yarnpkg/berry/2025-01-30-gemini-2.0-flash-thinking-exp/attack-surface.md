# Attack Surface Analysis for yarnpkg/berry

## Attack Surface: [Compromised `.pnp.cjs` File](./attack_surfaces/compromised___pnp_cjs__file.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploitation of the single `.pnp.cjs` file, central to Yarn Berry's Plug'n'Play (PnP) architecture. Compromise allows arbitrary code execution during dependency resolution, a core Berry mechanism.
*   **Berry Contribution:** PnP architecture *introduces* this single point of failure, unlike traditional `node_modules`.
*   **Example:**  Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into `.pnp.cjs` via CI/CD compromise. Upon application startup, this code executes due to PnP's dependency resolution process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, full system compromise, data breach, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly secure CI/CD pipelines with code signing and access controls.
    *   Implement file integrity monitoring for `.pnp.cjs` in production.
    *   Regular security audits of CI/CD and deployment workflows.
    *   Consider immutable infrastructure to limit file modification opportunities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Yarn Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_yarn_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Installation and exploitation of malicious or vulnerable Yarn Berry plugins. Plugins can execute arbitrary code within the Yarn process, deeply impacting project security.
*   **Berry Contribution:** Berry's plugin system *enables* extensibility via third-party code, expanding the attack surface.
*   **Example:** A developer installs a seemingly benign plugin from an untrusted source. The plugin contains malicious code that steals credentials or injects backdoors during Yarn operations.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, credential theft, arbitrary code execution, supply chain compromise affecting all projects using the plugin.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly limit plugin usage to trusted, reputable sources only.** Verify authors and, if possible, review plugin code.
    *   Implement mandatory plugin review processes within development teams.
    *   Utilize plugin vulnerability scanning tools if available.
    *   Minimize the number of installed plugins to only essential functionalities.

## Attack Surface: [`.yarn/` Directory Tampering](./attack_surfaces/__yarn__directory_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** Unauthorized modification of files within the `.yarn/` directory, which contains core Yarn Berry runtime components and caches. Tampering can lead to malicious code execution or altered Yarn behavior.
*   **Berry Contribution:** Berry *relies* on the `.yarn/` directory for its core operations, making its integrity critical and a direct Berry-specific concern.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to `.yarn/` on a developer machine or server. They replace the Yarn binary with a compromised version that injects malware into projects or steals sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, supply chain attacks, credential theft, persistent backdoors within development environments and potentially deployed applications.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Enforce strict file system permissions and access control for the `.yarn/` directory.
    *   Regularly scan development machines and servers for malware and vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement file integrity monitoring for critical files within `.yarn/`.
    *   Educate developers on the security importance of the `.yarn/` directory and their development environments.
