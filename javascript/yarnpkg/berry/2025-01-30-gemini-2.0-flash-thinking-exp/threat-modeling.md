# Threat Model Analysis for yarnpkg/berry

## Threat: [Compromised PnP Index File](./threats/compromised_pnp_index_file.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised PnP Index File (`.pnp.cjs` or `.pnp.npm.cjs`)
*   **Description:** An attacker could tamper with the `.pnp.cjs` file, either by directly modifying it in the repository or by compromising the build pipeline. This allows redirection of dependency resolution to malicious packages.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, supply chain compromise, denial of service.
*   **Affected Berry Component:** Plug'n'Play (PnP) Resolver, `.pnp.cjs` file, Build Process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strict access controls for `.pnp.cjs`.
    *   Utilize code signing and verification for build artifacts.
    *   Regularly audit build pipeline and CI/CD processes.
    *   Employ file integrity monitoring.

## Threat: [Malicious Packages in Zero-Installs Cache](./threats/malicious_packages_in_zero-installs_cache.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Packages in Zero-Installs Cache (`.yarn/cache`)
*   **Description:** An attacker could introduce malicious packages into `.yarn/cache`, either directly or by compromising a developer's machine. With Zero-Installs, these are distributed to all users.
*   **Impact:** Supply chain compromise, arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service.
*   **Affected Berry Component:** Zero-Installs feature, `.yarn/cache` directory, Dependency Installation Process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement pre-commit hooks to scan `.yarn/cache`.
    *   Regularly audit and update dependencies.
    *   Use robust code review for changes to `.yarn/cache`.
    *   Employ dependency scanning tools for the cache.

## Threat: [Bugs in PnP Resolver Logic](./threats/bugs_in_pnp_resolver_logic.md)

*   **Threat:** Bugs in PnP Resolver Logic
*   **Description:** Undiscovered bugs in PnP's dependency resolution logic could be exploited to manipulate dependency resolution or introduce malicious packages.
*   **Impact:** Dependency confusion, arbitrary code execution, denial of service, application instability.
*   **Affected Berry Component:** Plug'n'Play (PnP) Resolver, Dependency Resolution Algorithm.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with Yarn Berry releases and security advisories.
    *   Thoroughly test applications using PnP.
    *   Report suspected bugs to Yarn maintainers.
    *   Use PnP-compatible static analysis tools.

## Threat: [Workspace Isolation Bypass](./threats/workspace_isolation_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Workspace Isolation Bypass
*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Yarn Workspaces' isolation could allow bypassing workspace boundaries, enabling access to resources of other workspaces.
*   **Impact:** Cross-workspace contamination, privilege escalation, information disclosure.
*   **Affected Berry Component:** Yarn Workspaces, Workspace Isolation Logic, Inter-workspace Communication.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully configure workspace dependencies and scripts.
    *   Regularly audit workspace configurations.
    *   Stay updated with Yarn Berry workspace security advisories.
    *   Implement robust access controls within the monorepo.

## Threat: [Malicious Yarn Plugins](./threats/malicious_yarn_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Yarn Plugins
*   **Description:** Installing malicious Yarn plugins from untrusted sources can lead to arbitrary code execution in the development environment and build process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, supply chain compromise, compromised development environment.
*   **Affected Berry Component:** Yarn Plugin System, Plugin Installation Mechanism, `.yarnrc.yml` configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
    *   Thoroughly review plugin code before installation.
    *   Implement a plugin vetting process.
    *   Utilize plugin signing and verification if available.
    *   Regularly audit installed plugins.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Yarn Plugins](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_yarn_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Yarn Plugins
*   **Description:** Legitimate Yarn plugins might contain vulnerabilities that could be exploited to compromise the development environment or build process.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, compromised development environment.
*   **Affected Berry Component:** Yarn Plugin System, Specific Vulnerable Plugins, Plugin Dependencies.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with plugin releases and security advisories.
    *   Regularly audit and update installed plugins.
    *   Use vulnerability scanning tools for plugins.
    *   Report plugin vulnerabilities to developers and Yarn maintainers.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Yarn Berry Itself](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_yarn_berry_itself.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Yarn Berry Itself
*   **Description:** Compromising Yarn Berry's distribution channels could lead to distribution of malicious Yarn versions, affecting all users.
*   **Impact:** Widespread supply chain compromise, arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service across numerous applications.
*   **Affected Berry Component:** Yarn Distribution Channels, Yarn Package Registry, Yarn Build Infrastructure, Yarn CLI.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use official Yarn distribution channels and verify signatures.
    *   Stay updated with Yarn security advisories and update promptly.
    *   Monitor Yarn's security posture.
    *   Consider dependency pinning and lockfiles for Yarn versions.
