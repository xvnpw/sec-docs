### High and Critical Yarn Berry Threats

This list contains high and critical security threats directly involving Yarn Berry components.

*   **Threat:** Malicious `.pnp.cjs` Tampering
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the `.pnp.cjs` file (either through compromised build systems, supply chain attacks, or local system access) and modifies it to point to malicious dependency versions or inject malicious code that gets executed during module loading.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the application's context, data exfiltration, denial of service, or complete compromise of the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Affected Component:** `.pnp.cjs` file, PnP module resolution logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file integrity monitoring for the `.pnp.cjs` file in production and build environments.
        *   Enforce strong access controls and permissions on the build and deployment pipelines to prevent unauthorized modifications.
        *   Consider using a Content Security Policy (CSP) with `require-trusted-types-for 'script'` and Trusted Types to mitigate some forms of script injection, although this can be complex with PnP.
        *   Regularly scan build and deployment environments for malware and unauthorized access.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service through Corrupted `.pnp.cjs`
    *   **Description:** An attacker intentionally corrupts or modifies the `.pnp.cjs` file, causing errors during module resolution and preventing the application from starting or functioning correctly.
    *   **Impact:** Application downtime, service disruption, and potential financial losses.
    *   **Affected Component:** `.pnp.cjs` file, PnP module resolution logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement validation checks for the `.pnp.cjs` file during application startup.
        *   Maintain backups of the `.pnp.cjs` file to quickly restore functionality.
        *   Implement robust error handling and fallback mechanisms in the application's startup process.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Workspace Dependency Manipulation
    *   **Description:** In a monorepo setup with Yarn Workspaces, an attacker compromises one workspace and manipulates its dependencies in `package.json` or `yarn.lock` to introduce malicious dependencies or alter the dependency graph of other workspaces within the same repository.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of multiple applications or libraries within the monorepo, potentially leading to widespread impact.
    *   **Affected Component:** Workspaces feature, `package.json` files, `yarn.lock` file.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce strict code review processes for changes to `package.json` and `yarn.lock` files in all workspaces.
        *   Implement automated checks and linters to detect suspicious dependency changes.
        *   Utilize tools that provide dependency isolation or sandboxing between workspaces during development and testing.
        *   Apply strong access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications within the monorepo.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker tricks a developer or administrator into installing a malicious Yarn plugin. This plugin could contain code that compromises the local development environment, steals credentials, or modifies project files.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of developer machines, potential supply chain attacks through modified project files, and exposure of sensitive information.
    *   **Affected Component:** Yarn Plugin system, `yarn plugin import` command.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install Yarn plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
        *   Thoroughly vet the code of any custom or third-party plugins before installation.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing and approving plugin installations within the development team.
        *   Utilize Yarn's plugin management commands to list and inspect installed plugins.

*   **Threat:** `yarn.lock` Tampering for Dependency Downgrade/Substitution
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains write access to the `yarn.lock` file and modifies it to force the installation of older, vulnerable versions of dependencies or substitutes legitimate dependencies with malicious ones.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of known vulnerabilities into the application, potentially leading to exploitation and compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `yarn.lock` file, dependency resolution logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Protect the `yarn.lock` file with appropriate access controls in development and deployment environments.
        *   Implement integrity checks for the `yarn.lock` file in CI/CD pipelines.
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the locked dependency versions.
        *   Consider using signed commits for `yarn.lock` to verify its authenticity.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Yarn Itself
    *   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities might exist within the Yarn Berry codebase itself. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code during Yarn operations or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:**  Compromise of the build or deployment environment, potential for supply chain attacks if vulnerabilities are exploited during package installation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Yarn Berry core codebase.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Yarn Berry updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor Yarn's security advisories and release notes for information about known vulnerabilities.

*   **Threat:** Cache Poisoning
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises Yarn's cache directory (either local or remote, if configured) and replaces legitimate packages with malicious ones. Subsequent installations might then pull the poisoned packages.
    *   **Impact:** Supply chain attack, introduction of malware or vulnerabilities into the application.
    *   **Affected Component:** Yarn's cache mechanism, local file system or remote cache storage.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Secure the environment where Yarn's cache is stored with appropriate access controls.
        *   Consider using a read-only cache for production deployments.
        *   Implement integrity checks for cached packages if possible.

*   **Threat:**  Abuse of `yarn run` with Malicious Scripts
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains the ability to modify `package.json` (through compromised dependencies or direct access) and inject malicious scripts that are then executed using `yarn run`.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or in the build/deployment environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** `yarn run` command, `package.json` scripts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review the scripts defined in the `package.json` of all dependencies.
        *   Utilize tools that can analyze and identify potentially malicious scripts.
        *   Implement strong access controls to prevent unauthorized modifications to `package.json`.
