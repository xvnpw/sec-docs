# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a fast, reliable, and feature-rich package manager for JavaScript projects.
  - Improve developer experience by offering innovative features like Plug'n'Play installs, workspaces, and constraints.
  - Become the leading package manager in the JavaScript ecosystem, surpassing npm and pnpm in adoption and user satisfaction.
  - Maintain a strong open-source community and encourage contributions to the project.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in Yarn itself could compromise developer environments and projects relying on it.
  - Supply chain attacks targeting Yarn or its dependencies could lead to widespread security incidents in the JavaScript ecosystem.
  - Data breaches involving user credentials or project configurations could damage user trust and reputation.
  - Unreliable or buggy releases could negatively impact developer productivity and adoption.
  - Competition from other package managers could hinder market share growth and community engagement.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review process for all contributions via GitHub Pull Requests, implemented in GitHub.
  - security control: Public issue tracker on GitHub for reporting bugs and security vulnerabilities, implemented in GitHub.
  - security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning as part of the development process (details not publicly specified but assumed for a project of this scale).
  - security control: Usage of HTTPS for all communication with package registries.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: As an open-source project, the codebase is publicly accessible, potentially allowing malicious actors to identify vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions introduces a risk of unintentionally introducing vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies of Yarn itself could impact Yarn's security.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools in the CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect potential code vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to continuously monitor dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct periodic penetration testing and security audits by external security experts.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
  - security control: Provide security awareness training for maintainers and contributors, focusing on secure coding practices and supply chain security.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Securely handle authentication tokens for package registries (e.g., npm, GitHub Packages).
    - Requirement: Avoid storing authentication tokens in plaintext in configuration files or environment variables.
    - Requirement: Support secure authentication methods provided by package registries (e.g., token-based authentication).
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement role-based access control for repository maintainers and contributors to manage code, releases, and project settings.
    - Requirement: Ensure proper authorization checks are in place for administrative actions within Yarn.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Thoroughly validate all inputs, including package names, versions, configuration options, and command-line arguments, to prevent injection attacks (e.g., command injection, path traversal).
    - Requirement: Sanitize user-provided data before using it in commands or file system operations.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Use strong cryptography for storing sensitive data, such as authentication tokens (if any local storage is used).
    - Requirement: Ensure all network communication, especially with package registries, is encrypted using HTTPS.
    - Requirement: Verify the integrity and authenticity of downloaded packages using cryptographic signatures (if supported by registries and implemented by Yarn).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Dependency Management for JavaScript Projects: Yarn's primary function is to manage dependencies, which is critical for the development and operation of countless JavaScript applications. Failure or compromise of Yarn could disrupt these processes.
  - Package Installation and Updates: Ensuring developers can reliably install and update packages is essential for productivity and security. Issues in this area could lead to developers using outdated or vulnerable dependencies.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Project Configurations (.yarnrc.yml, package.json): Contains project settings, dependencies, and scripts. Sensitivity: Medium. Exposure could reveal project structure and dependencies, potentially aiding attackers in targeting vulnerabilities.
  - Developer Credentials (npm tokens, etc.): Used for publishing packages and accessing private registries. Sensitivity: High. Compromise could allow unauthorized package publishing, access to private code, and supply chain attacks.
  - Downloaded Packages (Package Cache): Cached packages themselves are generally public, but tampering with the cache could lead to supply chain attacks. Sensitivity: Medium. Integrity of the cache is important.
  - Yarn Source Code and Build System: Integrity of the source code and build system is crucial to prevent supply chain attacks and ensure the security of Yarn releases. Sensitivity: High.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What specific SAST and SCA tools are currently used in the CI/CD pipeline (if any)?
  - Is there a formal vulnerability disclosure and response process in place?
  - Are there regular security audits or penetration testing conducted for Yarn Berry?
  - What is the process for managing and rotating registry credentials used in the CI/CD pipeline?
  - Are build artifacts (npm packages) cryptographically signed?
  - Is there a bug bounty program for security vulnerabilities in Yarn Berry?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a secure and reliable package manager for the JavaScript ecosystem. Security is a high priority for the project.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Standard open-source security practices are followed, including code review and public issue tracking. HTTPS is used for all network communication.
  - DESIGN: Yarn Berry is primarily a client-side CLI tool. It relies on external package registries for package hosting and distribution. The build process is automated using GitHub Actions.
