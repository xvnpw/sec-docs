## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Dependency](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_dependency.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Dependency Confusion Attack (CRITICAL NODE):
        * Description: An attacker publishes a malicious package to a public repository (like npm) using the same name as a private dependency used by the target application. When Berry resolves dependencies, it might mistakenly download and install the attacker's malicious package instead of the intended private one.
        * Goal: To inject malicious code into the application's dependencies, leading to code execution during the installation or build process.
        * Exploitation: The attacker needs to identify the names of the target application's private dependencies (often through reconnaissance or leaked information). Publishing a package with the same name is relatively easy.
        * Impact: If successful, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system during package installation or at runtime when the malicious dependency is used.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Postinstall Scripts](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_postinstall_scripts.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Malicious Dependency with Malicious Postinstall (CRITICAL NODE):
        * Description: An attacker introduces a seemingly legitimate dependency that contains a malicious script defined in its `package.json` file's `postinstall` hook. Berry automatically executes these scripts after the package is installed.
        * Goal: To execute arbitrary code on the target system immediately after the malicious dependency is installed.
        * Exploitation: Attackers can create malicious packages that perform harmful actions during the postinstall phase, such as downloading and executing further payloads, modifying system files, or exfiltrating data.
        * Impact: Successful exploitation leads to immediate code execution with the privileges of the user running the installation process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate `.yarnrc.yml` Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate___yarnrc_yml__configuration.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Manipulate `.yarnrc.yml` Configuration (CRITICAL NODE):
        * Description: The `.yarnrc.yml` file is Berry's configuration file. An attacker who can modify this file can alter Berry's behavior in malicious ways.
        * Goal: To gain control over Berry's execution environment and potentially achieve code execution or weaken security measures.
        * Exploitation: Attackers might gain access to the `.yarnrc.yml` file through various means, such as exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's deployment process, compromising developer machines, or exploiting insecure file permissions. They can then inject malicious configuration options.
        * Impact: By manipulating the configuration, attackers could disable security features (like integrity checks), redirect package downloads to malicious sources, or even execute arbitrary commands through specific configuration options or lifecycle hooks.
