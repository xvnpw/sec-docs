# Threat Model Analysis for yarnpkg/berry

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion via PnP Exploitation](./threats/dependency_confusion_via_pnp_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Confusion via PnP Exploitation
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within Yarn Berry's Plug'n'Play dependency resolution logic itself. This could involve crafting malicious packages or manipulating package metadata in a way that tricks Berry into resolving to an attacker-controlled package, even without direct tampering with user files.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution vulnerability, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Dependency resolution logic within Yarn Berry.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Yarn Berry updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor Yarn Berry's issue tracker and security advisories for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement robust verification mechanisms for package authenticity and integrity within Yarn Berry's core if possible (this would likely require contributing to Yarn Berry development).

## Threat: [Cross-Workspace Script Execution Vulnerability](./threats/cross-workspace_script_execution_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Workspace Script Execution Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within Yarn Berry's workspace management that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts within the context of another workspace in the same repository. This could be due to flaws in how Berry isolates or manages script execution within workspaces.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution vulnerability, potentially escalating privileges and compromising other parts of the application or build process.
    *   **Affected Component:** Workspace feature, script execution management within Yarn Berry.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Yarn Berry updated to the latest version.
        *   Carefully review and understand the security implications of using workspaces.
        *   Isolate sensitive operations and data to specific workspaces with strict access controls.
        *   Monitor Yarn Berry's issue tracker for reports of workspace-related vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Arbitrary Code Execution via `yarn dlx` Vulnerability](./threats/arbitrary_code_execution_via__yarn_dlx__vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Arbitrary Code Execution via `yarn dlx` Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** A vulnerability exists within the `yarn dlx` command itself that allows an attacker to bypass intended safeguards and execute arbitrary code on the system running the command. This could be due to flaws in how `yarn dlx` handles package execution or argument parsing.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution vulnerability, system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** `yarn dlx` command execution logic within Yarn Berry.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Yarn Berry updated to the latest version.
        *   Restrict the use of `yarn dlx` in automated processes and development environments.
        *   Educate developers about the potential risks of using `yarn dlx` and emphasize the importance of verifying the source of packages executed via `dlx`.
        *   Monitor Yarn Berry's issue tracker for reported vulnerabilities related to `yarn dlx`.
