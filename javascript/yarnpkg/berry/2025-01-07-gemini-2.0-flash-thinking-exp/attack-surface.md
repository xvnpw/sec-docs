# Attack Surface Analysis for yarnpkg/berry

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Packages Leveraging Plug'n'Play (PnP)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_packages_leveraging_plug'n'play__pnp_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious package or compromises an existing one, exploiting the way Berry's PnP handles dependencies.
*   **How Berry Contributes:** PnP's flat dependency structure and reliance on the `.pnp.cjs` file for module resolution can introduce new avenues for malicious packages to bypass typical `node_modules` isolation or manipulate the resolution process.
*   **Example:** A malicious package could use symlinks within its dependencies that, when resolved by PnP, point to sensitive files outside the project directory, allowing the malicious code to read or modify them.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution with potentially broader access due to PnP's flat structure, data exfiltration, or system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize dependency scanning tools that are aware of Yarn Berry's PnP structure and can identify potential symlink vulnerabilities or malicious package contents.
    *   Regularly review project dependencies and their maintainers.
    *   Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools that integrate with Yarn Berry.
    *   Consider using a private registry for internal packages to reduce reliance on public registries.
    *   Implement strict code review processes for any changes to dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Lockfile Poisoning with `link:` Protocol](./attack_surfaces/lockfile_poisoning_with__link__protocol.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the `yarn.lock` file to introduce a dependency using the `link:` protocol that points to a malicious local directory.
*   **How Berry Contributes:** Berry's `link:` protocol allows specifying local file system paths as dependencies, which, if maliciously crafted in the `yarn.lock`, can introduce arbitrary code into the project.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains write access to the repository (e.g., through a compromised developer account or a vulnerable CI/CD pipeline) and modifies `yarn.lock` to include a dependency like `my-malicious-package: link:../evil_code`. Upon `yarn install`, Berry will link the `evil_code` directory into the project.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution when the linked code is imported or executed, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or supply chain attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement strong access controls on the repository and CI/CD pipelines to prevent unauthorized modifications to `yarn.lock`.
    *   Utilize Git branch protection rules to require code reviews for changes to `yarn.lock`.
    *   Employ file integrity monitoring on the `yarn.lock` file to detect unauthorized changes.
    *   Educate developers about the risks of the `link:` protocol and when it's appropriate to use.
    *   Consider using checksum verification for linked dependencies if feasible.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Yarn Berry Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_yarn_berry_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker creates and distributes a malicious Yarn Berry plugin or compromises an existing one.
*   **How Berry Contributes:** Berry's plugin system allows extending its functionality, but this also introduces the risk of malicious plugins gaining significant access and control over the project and the user's system.
*   **Example:** A malicious plugin could be designed to steal environment variables, exfiltrate project secrets, or execute arbitrary commands during Yarn operations. A compromised plugin update could introduce similar malicious behavior.
*   **Impact:**  Full control over the project environment, access to sensitive data, potential system compromise, and supply chain attacks affecting projects using the malicious plugin.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Only install plugins from trusted sources.
    *   Thoroughly vet the code of any plugin before installation, if possible.
    *   Monitor plugin updates and be cautious of unexpected changes or new permissions.
    *   Implement a plugin review process within the development team.
    *   Consider using a plugin manager with security features if available in the future.
