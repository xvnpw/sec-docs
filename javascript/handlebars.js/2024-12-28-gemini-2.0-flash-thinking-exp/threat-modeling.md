*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unescaped Output
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into data that is then rendered by Handlebars using the unescaped `{{{ }}}` syntax or a helper that is part of the Handlebars library (or a very tightly coupled extension) and doesn't perform proper escaping. This script executes in the victim's browser when the page is viewed. The attacker might steal cookies, redirect the user, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical. Can lead to account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, and website defacement, severely compromising user security and application integrity.
    *   **Affected Handlebars.js Component:**  Rendering Engine, specifically the handling of `{{{ }}`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Default to Escaping:**  Primarily use the `{{ }}` syntax for HTML escaping.
        *   **Careful Use of Unescaped Output:**  Reserve `{{{ }}}` for situations where the output is absolutely trusted and has already been sanitized *outside* of Handlebars.
        *   **Secure Built-in Helpers:** If using built-in helpers that output HTML, understand their escaping behavior.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI)
    *   **Description:** If Handlebars is used on the server-side and user-controlled input is directly embedded into template strings or used to define template logic *processed by Handlebars*, an attacker can inject malicious Handlebars expressions that execute arbitrary code on the server. This allows for complete server compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Critical. Allows for full control of the server, leading to data breaches, system compromise, and potential further attacks on infrastructure.
    *   **Affected Handlebars.js Component:**  Template Compilation and Rendering Engine when used server-side.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid User-Controlled Templates:**  Never allow untrusted user input to directly define or modify server-side Handlebars templates.
        *   **Sandboxing (Limited Effectiveness):** While Handlebars doesn't offer robust sandboxing, explore options to restrict the capabilities of the rendering environment if absolutely necessary (highly complex and prone to bypass).

*   **Threat:** Dependency Vulnerabilities in Handlebars.js
    *   **Description:**  Using an outdated version of Handlebars.js that contains known security vulnerabilities can expose the application to those vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these known flaws *within the Handlebars library itself* to compromise the application.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability. Can range from XSS to remote code execution *within the context of Handlebars processing*.
    *   **Affected Handlebars.js Component:**  The entire library, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be critical depending on the specific vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep Handlebars.js updated to the latest stable version.
        *   **Dependency Management Tools:**  Use dependency management tools to track and manage library versions and identify potential vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Scanning:**  Utilize security scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
