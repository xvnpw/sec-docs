### Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unpinned GitHub Actions Dependencies (Supply Chain Attack)
- **Description:** The project’s GitHub Actions workflows reference external actions using mutable version tags (for example, using “skills/action-check-file@v1” and “skills/action-update-step@v2”) rather than pinning to a specific commit SHA. An external attacker who is able to compromise one of these third‐party action repositories or hijack the tag (by, for instance, compromising the organization or repository hosting the action) can update the tag to include malicious code. When the workflows run on a public commit (which is common in this open repository), the malicious code will be automatically fetched and executed with the permissions granted to the GitHub Actions runner.

  *Step‑by-step triggering scenario:*
  1. The attacker targets the external GitHub Action (e.g., “skills/action-check-file”) and gains the ability to update the tag “v1”.
  2. The attacker publishes an update on that tag that includes malicious code (such as code that exfiltrates secrets or modifies repository files).
  3. When any developer pushes a commit to the main branch, one of the workflows (for example, in “1-copilot-extension.yml”) is triggered.
  4. The workflow downloads the action using its mutable tag and executes the malicious code in the CI/CD environment.
  5. The malicious code, running with the “contents: write” permission provided by the GitHub Actions token, could then compromise the repository.
- **Impact:** Successful exploitation would enable an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the CI/CD pipeline. This could result in unauthorized modifications to repository content, leakage of repository secrets, or full compromise of the project’s codebase.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The workflows make use of explicit permissions (e.g., `contents: write`), but they do not restrict the resolution of external GitHub Actions to a fixed commit.
  - The use of version tags (e.g., “@v1” or “@v2”) is intended to ease updates but does not prevent tag updates from a malicious publisher.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
  - Pin each external GitHub Action dependency to a specific commit SHA (for example, use `actions/checkout@<commit-sha>`) to ensure that the code being executed is immutable.
  - Establish automated dependency scanning/verification for GitHub Actions to detect if a referenced action’s tag has been updated maliciously.
  - Consider using more restrictive permissions so that even if an external action is compromised, the blast radius is minimized.
- **Preconditions:**
  - The repository is public, and its workflows are triggered automatically on a push to the main branch.
  - An attacker must have the ability to compromise or hijack an external GitHub Action repository (or the tag used) so that the mutable tag (e.g., “@v1” or “@v2”) points to malicious code.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In multiple workflow files (such as “1-copilot-extension.yml”, “0-welcome.yml”, “2-skills-javascript.yml”, “3-copilot-hub.yml”, and “4-copilot-comment.yml”), the project uses calls similar to:
    ```
    - name: Check workflow contents, jobs
      uses: skills/action-check-file@v1
    ```
    and
    ```
    - name: Update to step X
      uses: skills/action-update-step@v2
    ```
  - These statements retrieve external GitHub Actions using version tags. Since version tags can be repointed to different commits, an attacker who influences the external repository could update the tag reference to a clone of the malicious code.
  - A simple visualization of the risky pattern in the workflow:
    ```
    Workflow snippet:
      jobs:
        get_current_step:
          ...
          steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - id: get_step
              run: echo "current_step=$(cat ./.github/steps/-step.txt)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        on_add_devcontainer:
          steps:
            - name: Check workflow contents, jobs
              uses: skills/action-check-file@v1   <-- Mutable tag here
            - name: Update to step 2
              uses: skills/action-update-step@v2   <-- Mutable tag here
    ```
  - This recurring pattern across the project’s workflows is the critical issue that leaves the CI/CD pipeline open to supply chain attacks.
- **Security Test Case:**
  1. **Setup:**
     - Create a test repository that mirrors the project’s workflow configuration.
     - For testing purposes, modify one of the GitHub Actions references (for example, replace “skills/action-check-file@v1”) with a controlled action that logs a distinctive message or simulates malicious behavior.
  2. **Trigger Workflow:**
     - Push a commit to the main branch to trigger the workflow.
     - Verify from the GitHub Actions logs that the controlled (simulated malicious) action is executed.
  3. **Observation:**
     - Confirm that the workflow logs display the distinctive message or behavior from the controlled version.
     - Check that the simulated malicious action runs with the permissions defined (e.g., can write to repository contents), illustrating the risk.
  4. **Mitigation Verification:**
     - Modify the workflow to reference the action using a pinned commit SHA rather than a tag.
     - Push another commit and verify that the workflow now uses the fixed (and expected) version of the action and that further changes to the external repository’s tag do not affect the workflow execution.
  5. **Conclusion:**
     - Report that without pinning, an attacker can force execution of arbitrary code via compromised action tags, and that the mitigation of pinning commit SHAs is necessary to prevent this attack vector.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Markdown Injection in README.md via Step Update Workflow
- **Description:** The `skills/action-update-step@v2` GitHub Action, used in workflows to update step numbers in `README.md`, might be vulnerable to markdown injection. If the step update mechanism is flawed, an attacker could potentially inject malicious markdown code into the `README.md` file through a crafted step update. This could lead to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability when the `README.md` is rendered on GitHub.
- **Impact:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). When a user views the repository's `README.md` file on GitHub, the injected malicious JavaScript code could be executed in their browser. This could lead to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions if an attacker manages to inject and execute malicious JavaScript.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** None in the provided project files. Mitigation would need to be implemented within the `skills/action-update-step@v2` action itself.
- **Missing Mitigations:** Input validation and output encoding in `skills/action-update-step@v2` action are necessary to prevent markdown injection when updating the step numbers in `README.md`. Specifically, ensure that step updates are treated as plain text and not interpreted as markdown. The action should properly sanitize or encode any potentially harmful characters before updating the `README.md` content.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Vulnerability exists in `skills/action-update-step@v2` action that allows markdown injection during step update in `README.md`. This could occur if the action uses insecure string manipulation to replace step numbers without proper context-aware escaping or sanitization.
    - An attacker needs to be able to trigger a workflow execution that uses the potentially vulnerable `skills/action-update-step@v2` action. In this project, workflows are triggered by push to the `main` branch on specific file changes. While external attackers cannot directly push to the main branch, a compromised collaborator account or a misconfigured repository allowing external contributions could enable triggering the workflow.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. The workflow files (e.g., `0-welcome.yml`, `1-copilot-extension.yml`) in the `.github/workflows/` directory utilize the `skills/action-update-step@v2` action to update the step number displayed in the `README.md` file. For example, in `0-welcome.yml`:
    ```yaml
       - name: Update to step 1
         uses: skills/action-update-step@v2
         with:
           token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
           from_step: 0
           to_step: 1
    ```
    2. The `skills/action-update-step@v2` action likely reads the content of the `README.md` file. It then identifies the line containing the current step number (e.g., "Step 0, Welcome") and replaces the numerical step indicator ('0' in this case) with the new step number provided in the `to_step` parameter ('1').
    3. A potential vulnerability arises if `skills/action-update-step@v2` employs a simplistic string replacement mechanism (like basic regex replace or `String.replace()`) without properly encoding or sanitizing the `to_step` input before incorporating it into the `README.md` content.
    4. If an attacker could manipulate the `to_step` parameter (which is not directly possible from the workflow definition files as it's hardcoded, but we consider a hypothetical scenario where the action itself might have a vulnerability or misconfiguration), they could inject malicious markdown or HTML. For instance, if `to_step` was maliciously crafted as `1 <img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>`, and the `skills/action-update-step@v2` action naively substitutes the step number in `README.md`, it could inject the HTML `<img>` tag directly into the markdown content.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Set up a test GitHub repository based on the provided template.
    2. **Simulate Vulnerable Action (Conceptual):**  Since we do not have access to modify the `skills/action-update-step@v2` action, this test case is designed to conceptually demonstrate the vulnerability if the action were indeed vulnerable. In a real-world scenario, you would need to analyze or potentially modify the action code itself. For this test, we will simulate the *outcome* of a vulnerable action.
    3. **Modify Workflow (Local Simulation):**  Locally modify one of the workflow files (e.g., `0-welcome.yml`) in your forked repository. Replace the `uses: skills/action-update-step@v2` line with a script that simulates the vulnerable behavior. For example:
    ```yaml
      - name: Simulate Vulnerable Step Update
        run: |
          sed -i 's/Step 0,/Step 1 <img src=x onerror=alert("XSS Vulnerability!")>,/g' README.md
    ```
       This `sed` command simulates a vulnerable replacement by directly injecting HTML into the `README.md` when updating "Step 0" to "Step 1". **Note:** This is a simplification and assumes the step text pattern is consistent. A more robust simulation might be needed for a real test against a live action.
    4. **Commit and Push:** Commit your modified workflow file and push the changes to the `main` branch of your forked repository. This will trigger the `0-welcome.yml` workflow.
    5. **Inspect README.md:** After the workflow execution completes, navigate to the `README.md` file in your repository on GitHub through the web browser.
    6. **Verify XSS:** If the simulated vulnerability is successful, when you view the `README.md` in your browser, you should see an alert dialog box pop up with the message "XSS Vulnerability!". This indicates that the injected HTML ( `<img src=x onerror=alert("XSS Vulnerability!")>` ) was rendered and the JavaScript within it was executed, confirming a potential Stored XSS vulnerability if the actual `skills/action-update-step@v2` action were to perform insecure step updates.
