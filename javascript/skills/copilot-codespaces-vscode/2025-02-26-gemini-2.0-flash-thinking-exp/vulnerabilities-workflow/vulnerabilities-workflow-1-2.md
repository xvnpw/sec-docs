- **Vulnerability Name:**  
  Unpinned GitHub Actions Dependencies (Supply Chain Attack)

- **Description:**  
  The project’s GitHub Actions workflows reference external actions using mutable version tags (for example, using “skills/action-check-file@v1” and “skills/action-update-step@v2”) rather than pinning to a specific commit SHA. An external attacker who is able to compromise one of these third‐party action repositories or hijack the tag (by, for instance, compromising the organization or repository hosting the action) can update the tag to include malicious code. When the workflows run on a public commit (which is common in this open repository), the malicious code will be automatically fetched and executed with the permissions granted to the GitHub Actions runner.

  *Step‑by-step triggering scenario:*  
  1. The attacker targets the external GitHub Action (e.g., “skills/action-check-file”) and gains the ability to update the tag “v1”.  
  2. The attacker publishes an update on that tag that includes malicious code (such as code that exfiltrates secrets or modifies repository files).  
  3. When any developer pushes a commit to the main branch, one of the workflows (for example, in “1-copilot-extension.yml”) is triggered.  
  4. The workflow downloads the action using its mutable tag and executes the malicious code in the CI/CD environment.  
  5. The malicious code, running with the “contents: write” permission provided by the GitHub Actions token, could then compromise the repository.

- **Impact:**  
  Successful exploitation would enable an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the CI/CD pipeline. This could result in unauthorized modifications to repository content, leakage of repository secrets, or full compromise of the project’s codebase.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**  
  High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  - The workflows make use of explicit permissions (e.g., `contents: write`), but they do not restrict the resolution of external GitHub Actions to a fixed commit.  
  - The use of version tags (e.g., “@v1” or “@v2”) is intended to ease updates but does not prevent tag updates from a malicious publisher.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  - Pin each external GitHub Action dependency to a specific commit SHA (for example, use `actions/checkout@<commit-sha>`) to ensure that the code being executed is immutable.  
  - Establish automated dependency scanning/verification for GitHub Actions to detect if a referenced action’s tag has been updated maliciously.  
  - Consider using more restrictive permissions so that even if an external action is compromised, the blast radius is minimized.

- **Preconditions:**  
  - The repository is public, and its workflows are triggered automatically on a push to the main branch.  
  - An attacker must have the ability to compromise or hijack an external GitHub Action repository (or the tag used) so that the mutable tag (e.g., “@v1” or “@v2”) points to malicious code.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  - In multiple workflow files (such as “1-copilot-extension.yml”, “0-welcome.yml”, “2-skills-javascript.yml”, “3-copilot-hub.yml”, and “4-copilot-comment.yml”), the project uses calls similar to:  
    ```
    - name: Check workflow contents, jobs
      uses: skills/action-check-file@v1
    ```
    and  
    ```
    - name: Update to step X
      uses: skills/action-update-step@v2
    ```
  - These statements retrieve external GitHub Actions using version tags. Since version tags can be repointed to different commits, an attacker who influences the external repository could update the tag reference to a clone of the malicious code.
  - A simple visualization of the risky pattern in the workflow:
    ```
    Workflow snippet:
      jobs:
        get_current_step:
          ...
          steps:
            - name: Checkout
              uses: actions/checkout@v4
            - id: get_step
              run: echo "current_step=$(cat ./.github/steps/-step.txt)" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
        on_add_devcontainer:
          steps:
            - name: Check workflow contents, jobs
              uses: skills/action-check-file@v1   <-- Mutable tag here
            - name: Update to step 2
              uses: skills/action-update-step@v2   <-- Mutable tag here
    ```
  - This recurring pattern across the project’s workflows is the critical issue that leaves the CI/CD pipeline open to supply chain attacks.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Setup:**  
     - Create a test repository that mirrors the project’s workflow configuration.  
     - For testing purposes, modify one of the GitHub Actions references (for example, replace “skills/action-check-file@v1”) with a controlled action that logs a distinctive message or simulates malicious behavior.
  2. **Trigger Workflow:**  
     - Push a commit to the main branch to trigger the workflow.  
     - Verify from the GitHub Actions logs that the controlled (simulated malicious) action is executed.
  3. **Observation:**  
     - Confirm that the workflow logs display the distinctive message or behavior from the controlled version.  
     - Check that the simulated malicious action runs with the permissions defined (e.g., can write to repository contents), illustrating the risk.
  4. **Mitigation Verification:**  
     - Modify the workflow to reference the action using a pinned commit SHA rather than a tag.  
     - Push another commit and verify that the workflow now uses the fixed (and expected) version of the action and that further changes to the external repository’s tag do not affect the workflow execution.
  5. **Conclusion:**  
     - Report that without pinning, an attacker can force execution of arbitrary code via compromised action tags, and that the mitigation of pinning commit SHAs is necessary to prevent this attack vector.
