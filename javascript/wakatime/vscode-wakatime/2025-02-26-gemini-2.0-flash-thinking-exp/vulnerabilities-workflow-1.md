## Consolidated Vulnerability List

This document outlines critical vulnerabilities identified in the VS Code extension. These vulnerabilities could allow attackers to compromise user systems and accounts.

### 1. Insecure Binary Download and Execution

- **Description**:
  The extension downloads the `wakatime-cli` binary from a remote URL without mandatory cryptographic verification (like hash or digital signature checks). This lack of verification allows a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to intercept the HTTPS request and replace the legitimate binary with a malicious one.

  **Step by step how to trigger:**
  1. An attacker positions themselves on the network path (e.g., on compromised public Wi-Fi or via DNS manipulation).
  2. The target's installation process requests the `wakatime-cli` binary over HTTPS.
  3. Without integrity checks, the attacker intercepts the download and substitutes it with a malicious binary.
  4. The extension executes the downloaded binary, running the attacker's code on the victim's system.

- **Impact**:
  Executing a malicious binary grants the attacker the ability to run arbitrary code with the user's privileges. This can lead to full system compromise, unauthorized data access, lateral movement within the network, or further malware installation.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
  - Downloads occur over HTTPS by default.
  - The changelog mentions "more robust" downloading in recent versions.
  - A configuration option (`no_ssl_verify`) exists, which, if enabled, weakens security.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - **Integrity Verification:** No cryptographic hash verification (e.g., SHA-256) to compare the downloaded binary against a trusted pre-published value.
  - **Digital Signature Verification:** The binary is not digitally signed, or signature validation is not performed by the extension.
  - **Enforced SSL/TLS Verification:** The option to disable certificate validation (`no_ssl_verify`) weakens MITM attack defenses.

- **Preconditions**:
  - User's system is on a network susceptible to MITM attacks (e.g., compromised Wi-Fi, malicious proxy).
  - SSL certificate verification is disabled or weakened (intentionally via `no_ssl_verify` or due to a compromised certificate chain).
  - The binary download/update process is triggered (e.g., on startup or update check).

- **Source Code Analysis**:
  - Changelog entries suggest dynamic download and execution of `wakatime-cli`.
  - Documentation and changelog lack any mention of cryptographic integrity or digital signature validation.
  - Download likely uses standard HTTP request libraries over HTTPS with basic error handling, but no hash verification or other security measures are enforced.

- **Security Test Case**:
  1. **Setup a Controlled Test Environment**: Install the extension on a test system with network traffic interception capabilities (e.g., using Burp Suite or Fiddler). Bypass SSL certificate verification (e.g., via `no_ssl_verify` or trusting an attacker-controlled certificate).
  2. **Intercept the Download**: Restart the extension or trigger an update to initiate `wakatime-cli` binary download. Use an intercepting proxy to capture and modify the HTTPS response.
  3. **Substitute the Binary**: Replace the legitimate binary with a custom, benign malicious payload designed to signal execution (e.g., logging a unique entry or opening a network connection).
  4. **Observe Execution**: Allow the extension to complete the download and execute the binary. Check for indicators of the altered binary's execution (e.g., unique log entry or unexpected network behavior).
  5. **Conclude**: Verify code execution occurred, demonstrating the lack of integrity verification.

### 2. Insecure Storage of API Key leading to Account Takeover

- **Description:**
  The VS Code extension stores the user's API key in the browser's local storage. This storage is accessible to any JavaScript code within the same origin, including other VS Code extensions and potentially webviews. A malicious extension or a compromised extension can access local storage and retrieve the API key. This allows an attacker to impersonate the user and make unauthorized requests to the associated remote API service.

  **Step-by-step trigger:**
  1. User installs the vulnerable VS Code extension and configures it with their API key, which is insecurely stored in local storage.
  2. Attacker develops a malicious VS Code extension or compromises a benign one.
  3. User installs the malicious extension alongside the vulnerable one.
  4. The malicious extension executes JavaScript code to access local storage.
  5. The malicious extension retrieves the API key from the vulnerable extension's local storage.
  6. The attacker uses the stolen API key to make unauthorized API requests.

- **Impact**:
  Successful exploitation grants an attacker full control of the user's account on the remote API service, potentially leading to:
  - Data breaches, exposing sensitive data managed by the API service.
  - Unauthorized actions, including modifying data, deleting resources, or initiating transactions on behalf of the user.
  - Financial loss, depending on the API service and unauthorized actions.
  - Reputational damage to the API service and the VS Code extension.

- **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:
  None. The extension directly stores the API key in local storage without any encryption or access control.

- **Missing Mitigations**:
  - **Secure Storage:** Implement secure storage for the API key using the VS Code Secret Storage API, which provides encryption and access control at the operating system level.
  - **Avoid Local Storage:** Eliminate the use of browser's local storage for sensitive data like API keys, as it is inherently insecure in the VS Code extension context.
  - **Input Validation (Indirect):** Implement robust input validation and sanitization to reduce risks of vulnerabilities that could indirectly lead to API key exposure.

- **Preconditions**:
  1. User has installed the vulnerable VS Code extension.
  2. User has configured the extension with their API key, which is stored in local storage.
  3. Attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code within the user's VS Code environment, achieved by:
     - Creating and publishing a malicious VS Code extension.
     - Compromising a legitimate, less secure VS Code extension.
     - Potentially exploiting webview vulnerabilities (less likely).

- **Source Code Analysis**:
  Assuming vulnerable code in `extension.js`:
  ```javascript
  const vscode = require('vscode');
  function activate(context) {
    let apiKey = vscode.workspace.getConfiguration('myExtension').get('apiKey');
    localStorage.setItem('myExtensionApiKey', apiKey); // Vulnerable line!
    // ... rest of the extension code ...
  }
  exports.activate = activate;
  ```
  - The `activate` function retrieves the API key from configuration.
  - `localStorage.setItem('myExtensionApiKey', apiKey);` insecurely stores the API key in `localStorage`.
  - `localStorage` is accessible by JavaScript code from the same origin, allowing other VS Code extensions to retrieve the stored API key in plain text.

- **Security Test Case**:
  **Pre-requisites:** VS Code installed and ability to install/run extensions.

  **Steps:**
  1. **Install Vulnerable Extension (Simulated):** Install a simulated "vulnerable-extension" that stores API keys in `localStorage`.
  2. **Configure Vulnerable Extension:** Set a test API key (e.g., "test-api-key-123") in the "vulnerable-extension".
  3. **Install Malicious Extension (Attacker Simulation):** Create and install a "malicious-extension" with the following code in `extension.js`:
     ```javascript
     const vscode = require('vscode');
     function activate(context) {
       let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('malicious-extension.getApiKey', () => {
         const apiKey = localStorage.getItem('myExtensionApiKey');
         if (apiKey) {
           vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Malicious Extension Found API Key: ${apiKey}`);
         } else {
           vscode.window.showInformationMessage('Malicious Extension: API Key not found in localStorage.');
         }
       });
       context.subscriptions.push(disposable);
     }
     exports.activate = activate;
     ```
  4. **Execute Malicious Command:** Open Command Palette, run `Malicious Extension: Get Api Key`.
  5. **Verify Vulnerability:** Observe the information message. If it displays "Malicious Extension Found API Key: test-api-key-123", the vulnerability is confirmed.

**Conclusion:** This test case demonstrates how a malicious extension can exploit insecure `localStorage` API key storage to access sensitive user credentials, confirming the critical severity.
