- **Vulnerability Name**: Insecure Binary Download and Execution
  - **Description**:  
    The extension downloads the wakatime‑cli binary from a remote URL without mandating cryptographic verification (such as hash or digital signature checks). An attacker who is in a position to perform a man‑in‑the‑middle (MITM) attack (or who can otherwise influence network traffic) can intercept the HTTPS request and replace the downloaded binary with a malicious executable.  
    **Step by step how to trigger:**  
    1. The attacker positions themselves on the network path (for example, on compromised public Wi‑Fi or via DNS manipulation).  
    2. The target’s installation process requests the wakatime‑cli binary over HTTPS.  
    3. Because there is no integrity check against a trusted cryptographic hash, the attacker intercepts the download and substitutes it with a malicious binary.  
    4. Once downloaded, the extension executes the binary, which then runs the attacker’s code on the victim’s system.
    
  - **Impact**:  
    If the malicious binary is executed, the attacker gains the ability to run arbitrary code with the privileges of the current user. This may lead to full system compromise, unauthorized data access, lateral movement within the network, or further installation of malware.
    
  - **Vulnerability Rank**: Critical
  
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**:  
    - The changelog shows that the download process has been made “more robust” in recent versions and that downloads occur over HTTPS by default.  
    - The extension also supports a configuration (`no_ssl_verify`) for network requests. However, the very presence of this option (when enabled) and the absence of any mention of cryptographic verification (hash or signature-checking) remain a concern.
    
  - **Missing Mitigations**:  
    - **Integrity Verification:** There is no implementation of cryptographic hash verification (e.g., using SHA‑256) comparing the downloaded binary with a trusted, pre‑published value.  
    - **Digital Signature Verification:** The binary is not digitally signed or—if signed—the signature is not validated by the extension.  
    - **Enforced SSL/TLS Verification:** Although HTTPS is used, the option to disable certificate validation (via `no_ssl_verify`) can weaken defenses against MITM attacks.
    
  - **Preconditions**:  
    - The user’s system is in a network environment where an attacker can perform MITM attacks (using, e.g., compromised Wi‑Fi or a malicious proxy).  
    - The configuration is set to disable (or weakens) SSL certificate verification (either intentionally via `no_ssl_verify` or because the certificate chain has been compromised).  
    - The binary download/update mechanism is triggered (for example, on startup or when checking for an update).
    
  - **Source Code Analysis**:  
    - Although the actual source code for downloading and executing the wakatime‑cli binary is not provided within these project files, several changelog entries (for example, “More robust downloading of wakatime‑cli” in version 24.3.0 and adjustments made in later versions) suggest that the extension dynamically downloads and executes this binary.  
    - There is no reference in the documentation or changelog to any cryptographic integrity check or digital signature validation.  
    - The download is implemented using common libraries (such as HTTP request libraries) that fetch the file over HTTPS, and aside from basic error handling, no additional security measures (like hash verification) are enforced.
    
  - **Security Test Case**:  
    1. **Setup a Controlled Test Environment**:  
       - Install the extension on a test system where network traffic can be intercepted (using tools like Burp Suite or Fiddler).  
       - Ensure that SSL certificate verification can be bypassed (for instance, by enabling the `no_ssl_verify` configuration option or by configuring the testing device to trust an attacker-controlled certificate).
    2. **Intercept the Download**:  
       - Restart the extension or trigger an update so that the wakatime‑cli binary is downloaded.  
       - Use the intercepting proxy to capture and modify the HTTPS response containing the binary.
    3. **Substitute the Binary**:  
       - Replace the legitimate binary with a custom (benign) malicious payload designed to signal successful execution (for example, by writing a unique log entry or opening a network connection).
    4. **Observe Execution**:  
       - Allow the extension to complete the download and execute the binary.  
       - Confirm that the altered binary executes by checking for the expected indicators (such as the unique log entry or unexpected network behavior).
    5. **Conclude**:  
       - Verify that the process leads to code execution, proving that integrity verification was not enforced.

Implementing robust cryptographic verification for the downloaded binary and ensuring that SSL/TLS certificate validation cannot be easily bypassed will remediate this vulnerability.
