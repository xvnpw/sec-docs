## Attack Tree Path: [<<Attacker's Goal>> (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/attacker's_goal__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker, driving all other actions. This could involve disrupting service, stealing data, or spreading misinformation.
*   **Why Critical:** All attack paths converge here; success at any lower level contributes to this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [{1. Manipulate Map Display/Behavior} (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/{1__manipulate_map_displaybehavior}__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to alter the map's appearance or functionality, impacting user experience or trust.
*   **Why High-Risk:** Directly affects user interaction and can lead to misinformation or denial of service.

    *   **{1.2 Abuse Events} (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting Leaflet's event system to execute malicious code or disrupt normal operation.
        *   **Example:** An attacker could attach a malicious handler to the `click` event that redirects the user to a phishing site or steals cookies.  They could also flood the map with `move` events to overload the server.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Avoid dynamically creating event listeners based on unsanitized user input.
            *   Implement rate limiting and debouncing on event handling.
            *   Sanitize any data used within event handlers.

    *   **{1.3 Tamper with Markers/Popups} (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** Modifying the content or position of markers and popups to display false information or inject malicious code.
        *   **Why Critical:** Markers and popups are the primary way users interact with data on the map, making them a high-value target.
        *   **Why High-Risk:**  High potential for XSS and misinformation.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Rigorously sanitize all data used to create markers and popups.
            *   Validate marker coordinates to ensure they are within expected bounds.
            *   Use a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the types of content that can be loaded in popups.

## Attack Tree Path: [{2. Inject Malicious Content} (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/{2__inject_malicious_content}__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker aims to inject malicious code (usually JavaScript) into the map, often through XSS.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Successful injection can lead to a wide range of severe consequences, including session hijacking, data theft, and complete control over the user's interaction with the map.

    *   **<<2.1 XSS via Marker Popups>> (Critical Node & High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** Injecting malicious JavaScript into the content of marker popups. This is a classic Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
        *   **Example:** An attacker could submit a marker with a popup containing `<script>alert('XSS');</script>` or a more sophisticated script that steals cookies or redirects the user.
        *   **Why Critical:** Popups are a direct vector for interacting with user-provided content.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** XSS is a highly prevalent and dangerous vulnerability.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Crucially:** Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove *all* potentially dangerous tags and attributes from popup content *before* it is displayed.  *Never* trust user-supplied HTML.
            *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to prevent the execution of unauthorized scripts.
            *   Encode output appropriately (e.g., using `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` where possible).

    *  **[2.3 Leverage Vulnerable Plugin for Data Exfiltration] -> {Plugin} (High-Risk Path):**
        *   **Description:** Using a malicious or compromised plugin to steal sensitive data displayed on the map.
        *   **Example:** A plugin could be designed to secretly send the coordinates of all markers, or user data displayed in popups, to an attacker-controlled server.
        *   **Why High-Risk:** Leads to direct data breaches and privacy violations.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Thoroughly vet all third-party plugins before using them.
            *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
            *   Monitor network traffic for suspicious activity.
            *   Implement least privilege principles: only grant plugins the permissions they absolutely need.

## Attack Tree Path: [{3.1 Known Plugin Vulnerability} (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/{3_1_known_plugin_vulnerability}__high-risk_path_.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting a publicly known and documented vulnerability in a Leaflet plugin.
* **Example:** A plugin might have a known vulnerability that allows for remote code execution or denial of service. Attackers can search for these vulnerabilities and use publicly available exploit code.
* **Why High-Risk:**  Exploits are often readily available, making the attack easier to execute. The impact depends on the specific vulnerability, but can be severe.
* **Mitigation:**
    *   **Keep plugins updated:** This is the most crucial step. Subscribe to security advisories for the plugins you use.
    *   **Use a dependency management tool:** Tools like npm or yarn can help track dependencies and identify outdated or vulnerable packages.
    *   **Vulnerability scanning:** Regularly scan your project for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
