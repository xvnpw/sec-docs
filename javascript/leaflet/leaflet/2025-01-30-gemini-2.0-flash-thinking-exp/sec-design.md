# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a lightweight, flexible, and user-friendly open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.
  - Enable web developers to easily integrate maps into their web applications and services.
  - Foster a strong and active community around the library for continuous improvement and support.
  - Maintain the library's reputation as a reliable and high-quality mapping solution.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the library could lead to exploitation in applications using Leaflet, damaging the library's reputation and user trust.
  - Lack of consistent maintenance and community support could result in the library becoming outdated or insecure.
  - Performance issues or bugs could negatively impact user experience and adoption.
  - Compatibility issues with new web browsers or technologies could limit the library's usability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code Review - The library is open source, allowing for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented through GitHub repository and public code access.
  - security control: Issue Tracking - GitHub issue tracker is used for reporting and managing bugs and potential security issues. Implemented through GitHub repository issue system.
  - security control: Community Contributions - Security patches and improvements can be contributed by the community. Implemented through GitHub pull request process.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security - Security depends heavily on the active participation of the open-source community for vulnerability discovery and patching.
  - accepted risk: Third-party Integrations - Leaflet often integrates with external data sources and services, the security of which is outside of Leaflet's direct control.
  - accepted risk: Client-Side Execution - As a client-side JavaScript library, Leaflet's security relies on the security of the user's web browser and environment.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) and dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to guide security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
  - security control: Security Focused Code Reviews - Encourage security-focused code reviews for all contributions, especially those related to input handling and data processing.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the Leaflet library itself, as it is a client-side rendering library. Authentication concerns would reside in the applications using Leaflet to secure access to data or features.
  - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is not a core requirement for Leaflet. Applications using Leaflet would need to implement their own authorization mechanisms to control access to data and functionalities displayed on the map.
  - Input Validation: Input validation is crucial for Leaflet to prevent vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Leaflet needs to properly handle and sanitize user-provided data used in map configurations, markers, popups, and other elements. This should be implemented within the Leaflet library code, especially in functions that process user inputs.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a primary requirement for the core Leaflet library. However, if applications using Leaflet handle sensitive location data or require secure communication with data providers, cryptographic measures should be implemented at the application level, potentially utilizing browser-based crypto APIs if needed.

- Build Process Description:
  - Developer commits code changes to the GitHub repository.
  - Code push to the repository triggers a CI/CD pipeline, likely using GitHub Actions.
  - CI/CD pipeline checks out the code into a build environment.
  - Static analysis security testing (SAST) scanners and linters are executed to identify potential code quality and security issues.
  - The Leaflet library is built, typically involving JavaScript bundling and minification.
  - Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) are executed to ensure code functionality and quality.
  - If all checks and tests pass, the build artifacts (JavaScript files) are published to package registries like npm and potentially to a CDN for distribution.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a secure and reliable Leaflet library to web developers.
  - Maintaining the reputation and trust of the Leaflet project.
  - Ensuring the continuous availability and usability of the library.
- Data to Protect:
  - Leaflet library source code: Sensitivity - High (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability). Compromise could lead to malicious modifications or loss of intellectual property.
  - User data in applications using Leaflet: Sensitivity - Varies depending on the application. Could range from low (public map data) to high (sensitive location data). Security of this data is primarily the responsibility of the application developers, but Leaflet should avoid introducing vulnerabilities that could expose this data.
  - Build and release infrastructure: Sensitivity - Medium to High (Integrity, Availability). Compromise could lead to supply chain attacks or disruption of library distribution.
