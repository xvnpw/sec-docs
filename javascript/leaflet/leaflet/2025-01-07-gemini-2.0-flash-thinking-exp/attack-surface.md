# Attack Surface Analysis for leaflet/leaflet

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Tile Servers](./attack_surfaces/malicious_tile_servers.md)

*   **Description:** The application fetches map tiles from external servers. If these servers are compromised or malicious, they can serve harmful content.
    *   **How Leaflet Contributes:** Leaflet's core functionality relies on fetching and displaying tiles from URLs, making it directly dependent on the security of these tile sources.
    *   **Example:** An attacker compromises a tile server and replaces legitimate tiles with images containing malicious JavaScript. When a user views the map, their browser executes the script, potentially leading to session hijacking or redirection to phishing sites.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), redirection to malicious sites, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Use reputable and trusted tile providers:** Carefully vet and select tile providers with strong security practices.
            *   **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** Restrict the sources from which the application can load resources, including tile images.
            *   **Consider using a proxy server:** Route tile requests through a server you control, allowing for inspection and filtering of responses.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting GeoJSON/Vector Data](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_geojsonvector_data.md)

*   **Description:** Leaflet renders vector data (e.g., GeoJSON) provided to it. Maliciously crafted data can exploit vulnerabilities in the rendering process or inject harmful content.
    *   **How Leaflet Contributes:** Leaflet provides methods for displaying and interacting with GeoJSON data, making it a potential vector for injecting malicious payloads through the data itself.
    *   **Example:** An attacker provides a GeoJSON file where feature properties contain malicious HTML. When Leaflet renders a popup or tooltip based on these properties, the HTML is executed in the user's browser, leading to XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potential for Denial of Service (DoS) if processing overly complex geometries.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Sanitize GeoJSON properties:** Before rendering any data from GeoJSON properties in popups, tooltips, or other UI elements, sanitize the input to remove potentially harmful HTML or JavaScript.
            *   **Validate GeoJSON schema:** Ensure that the structure and data types of the GeoJSON conform to expected standards to prevent unexpected parsing issues.

## Attack Surface: [HTML Injection in Popups and Tooltips](./attack_surfaces/html_injection_in_popups_and_tooltips.md)

*   **Description:** Dynamically generated content for popups or tooltips, if not properly sanitized, can allow attackers to inject malicious HTML.
    *   **How Leaflet Contributes:** Leaflet provides the `bindPopup` and `bindTooltip` methods, which can accept HTML content. If this content is derived from user input or external data without sanitization, it becomes an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An application displays information about map markers, including a description fetched from a database. If the database contains a marker description with malicious `<script>` tags, Leaflet will render this script when the popup is opened.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   **Sanitize all dynamic content:** Always sanitize data before using it to populate popups or tooltips. Use appropriate escaping functions provided by your backend framework or a dedicated sanitization library.
            *   **Avoid directly rendering user-provided HTML:** If possible, render content as plain text and use CSS for styling. If HTML is necessary, use a strict sanitization policy.
