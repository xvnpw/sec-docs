# Threat Model Analysis for leaflet/leaflet

## Threat: [Malicious Tile Server Injection](./threats/malicious_tile_server_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises or sets up a malicious tile server. The application, configured to use this server, fetches map tiles containing malicious JavaScript code. This code executes within the user's browser when the tiles are rendered.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. The attacker can steal cookies, session tokens, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected Leaflet Component:** `L.TileLayer` (responsible for fetching and rendering map tiles).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only use reputable and trusted tile providers.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
*   Regularly monitor network requests for unexpected tile server domains.
*   Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) if the tile server supports it (though less common for tiles).

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in GeoJSON Data](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_geojson_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides malicious GeoJSON data that, when parsed and rendered by Leaflet, triggers a vulnerability. This could involve embedding JavaScript within feature properties or crafting overly complex geometries that lead to resource exhaustion or crashes.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if JavaScript is embedded in properties that are displayed in popups or tooltips. Denial of Service (DoS) on the client-side if complex geometries cause excessive rendering or memory usage. Potential application crashes.

**Affected Leaflet Component:** `L.GeoJSON` (responsible for parsing and rendering GeoJSON data). Potentially `L.Popup` or `L.Tooltip` if displaying properties.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and validate all GeoJSON data received from untrusted sources.
*   Implement strict input validation on any user-provided data that influences the displayed GeoJSON.
*   Consider using a secure GeoJSON parsing library on the server-side before sending data to the client.
*   Set limits on the complexity of rendered geometries if performance becomes an issue.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting through User-Generated Content in Map Elements](./threats/cross-site_scripting_through_user-generated_content_in_map_elements.md)

**Description:** If the application allows users to add custom markers, popups, or other elements to the map with user-provided content, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into this content. When other users view the map, these scripts execute in their browsers.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack, allowing the attacker to perform actions on behalf of other users, steal data, or redirect them.

**Affected Leaflet Component:** `L.Marker`, `L.Popup`, `L.Tooltip`, or any custom layers or controls that display user-provided content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly sanitize and escape all user-provided content before displaying it on the map.
*   Use appropriate encoding techniques to prevent the execution of malicious scripts.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further mitigate the impact of any successful XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Leaflet Plugins](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_leaflet_plugins.md)

**Description:** The application uses third-party Leaflet plugins that contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or user sessions.

**Impact:**  Varies depending on the vulnerability in the plugin, potentially leading to XSS, arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service.

**Affected Leaflet Component:**  The specific plugin with the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet and select plugins from trusted sources.
*   Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions, which often include security fixes.
*   Regularly review the code of plugins if possible or use static analysis tools.
*   Consider the principle of least privilege when integrating plugins, limiting their access to sensitive data or functionalities.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in the Leaflet Library Itself](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_the_leaflet_library_itself.md)

**Description:** The Leaflet library itself might contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**  The impact depends on the specific vulnerability. It could range from Cross-Site Scripting to Denial of Service or other unexpected behaviors.

**Affected Leaflet Component:**  Any part of the Leaflet library depending on the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the Leaflet library updated to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor security advisories and patch releases for any reported vulnerabilities.
*   Follow secure coding practices in your application to minimize the impact of potential Leaflet vulnerabilities.
