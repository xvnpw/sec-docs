## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Leaflet Exploitation](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_leaflet_exploitation.md)

- This is the root goal and represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. Its criticality stems from the potential for complete application compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_rendering_vulnerabilities.md)

- This node is critical because it encompasses a range of attacks that exploit how Leaflet renders content in the user's browser. Success here can lead to significant impact, primarily through XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Leaflet Features](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_leaflet_features.md)

- This node is critical as XSS is a highly prevalent and impactful vulnerability. Exploiting Leaflet features to achieve XSS allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Popup Content](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_popup_content.md)

- Attack Vector: Exploit insufficient sanitization of user-provided data displayed in popups.
- Likelihood: High
- Impact: High (Account compromise, data theft, redirection to malicious sites)
- Effort: Low
- Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate
- Detection Difficulty: Medium
- Description: This is a high-risk path because it's a common vulnerability (lack of input sanitization) with a significant impact (full XSS). Attackers can easily inject malicious scripts into popup content if the application doesn't properly sanitize user-provided data before displaying it in Leaflet popups. This can lead to session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, or redirecting users to phishing sites. The low effort and skill level required make this a readily exploitable path.
