# Attack Tree Analysis for leaflet/leaflet

Objective: To compromise application that use given project by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the project itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
**Sub-Tree:**

*   **[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]** Compromise via Malicious or Vulnerable Leaflet Plugin
    *   OR
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Use of Malicious Plugin
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Exploit Vulnerability in a Legitimate Plugin
*   **[HIGH RISK PATH]** Inject Malicious Content via Leaflet Features
    *   OR
        *   **[CRITICAL NODE]** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Leaflet Popups/Tooltips
```


## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise via Malicious or Vulnerable Leaflet Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path___critical_node__compromise_via_malicious_or_vulnerable_leaflet_plugin.md)

**1. [HIGH RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise via Malicious or Vulnerable Leaflet Plugin:**

*   **Attack Vector:** This high-risk path focuses on exploiting the extensibility of Leaflet through plugins. Attackers can either introduce a deliberately malicious plugin or exploit vulnerabilities present in legitimate plugins used by the application.
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **OR:**  The attacker can achieve compromise through either using a malicious plugin OR exploiting a vulnerability in a legitimate one.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Use of Malicious Plugin:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application integrates a Leaflet plugin that is specifically designed with malicious intent. This plugin could be created by the attacker or a compromised third-party.
        *   **Mechanism:** The malicious plugin, once integrated, can execute arbitrary code within the application's context, access sensitive data, manipulate the user interface, or perform other malicious actions.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerability in a Legitimate Plugin:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** A seemingly benign Leaflet plugin contains a security vulnerability that an attacker can exploit.
        *   **Mechanism:** Attackers can leverage known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the plugin's code to gain unauthorized access, execute scripts, or compromise the application's functionality. This often involves exploiting flaws in how the plugin handles input, interacts with the Leaflet API, or manages its own state.

## Attack Tree Path: [[HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Content via Leaflet Features](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__inject_malicious_content_via_leaflet_features.md)

**2. [HIGH RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Content via Leaflet Features:**

*   **Attack Vector:** This high-risk path centers on leveraging Leaflet's features for displaying dynamic content to inject malicious scripts into the application, primarily through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Breakdown:**
    *   **OR:** The primary high-risk vector within this path is XSS via Leaflet Popups/Tooltips.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Leaflet Popups/Tooltips:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** The application allows user-controlled data to be included in the content of Leaflet popups or tooltips, and Leaflet renders this data without proper sanitization.
        *   **Mechanism:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into this user-controlled data. When Leaflet renders the popup or tooltip, the browser executes this injected script within the context of the application's domain. This allows the attacker to perform actions such as stealing cookies, redirecting users to malicious sites, or modifying the page content. The risk is heightened when the application directly uses user input or data from untrusted sources in popup or tooltip content without proper encoding or sanitization.
