# Threat Model Analysis for leaflet/leaflet

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Map Data](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_malicious_map_data.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into map data sources (e.g., GeoJSON properties, marker popups, tooltips). When Leaflet renders this data, the injected script executes in the user's browser. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, deface the application, or perform actions on behalf of the user. This directly leverages Leaflet's rendering capabilities.

**Impact:**  Account compromise, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, unauthorized actions.

**Affected Leaflet Component:**
* `L.GeoJSON`: When rendering properties that are not properly sanitized.
* `L.Marker`: When using the `title` option or custom HTML in popups.
* `L.Popup`: When setting content with unsanitized HTML.
* `L.Tooltip`: When setting content with unsanitized HTML.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Sanitize all map data received from external sources or user input before passing it to Leaflet's rendering functions. Use appropriate escaping techniques for HTML, JavaScript, and URLs.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
* **Use Leaflet's Safe HTML Rendering Options (if available):** Explore if Leaflet provides options to render content safely, escaping potentially harmful characters.
* **Regularly Review and Update Dependencies:** Ensure Leaflet and any related libraries are up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution Exploitation](./threats/prototype_pollution_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities *within Leaflet itself* or its direct dependencies to manipulate the prototypes of built-in JavaScript objects or Leaflet's own objects. This can lead to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or even arbitrary code execution within the application's context by directly affecting Leaflet's internal workings.

**Impact:** Application malfunction, denial of service, potential for further exploitation leading to data breaches or remote code execution.

**Affected Leaflet Component:**  Potentially affects various parts of Leaflet due to the nature of prototype pollution impacting the JavaScript runtime environment and Leaflet's object structure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep Leaflet and Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Leaflet and all its dependencies to patch known prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
* **Carefully Evaluate Third-Party Plugins:** Thoroughly review and audit any Leaflet plugins used, as they can be a source of prototype pollution vulnerabilities that can affect Leaflet.
* **Implement Security Best Practices in Application Code:** Avoid directly manipulating prototypes unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. Use defensive programming techniques.
* **Consider using tools for static analysis:** These tools can help identify potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities in the codebase, including within Leaflet if source code is available.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks on Leaflet Resources](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_leaflet_resources.md)

**Description:** If the core Leaflet library file (`leaflet.js`) or its essential CSS files are loaded over an insecure connection (HTTP), an attacker performing a MitM attack could intercept the traffic and inject malicious code directly into the Leaflet files before they reach the user's browser, compromising the library's integrity.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser *through the compromised Leaflet library*, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious sites.

**Affected Leaflet Component:**  The core Leaflet library file (`leaflet.js`) and potentially any essential CSS files used by Leaflet.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Always Serve the Application over HTTPS:** Encrypt all communication between the user's browser and the server.
* **Use Subresource Integrity (SRI):**  Verify the integrity of the downloaded Leaflet and dependency files by specifying their cryptographic hashes in the `<script>` and `<link>` tags. This directly protects the integrity of the Leaflet library.
