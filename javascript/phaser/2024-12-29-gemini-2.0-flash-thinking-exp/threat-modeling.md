* **Threat:** Malicious Asset Injection
    * **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the application to load malicious game assets (images, audio, scripts, JSON data) by providing crafted URLs or filenames. Phaser's asset loading mechanisms would then fetch and process these malicious assets. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application constructs asset paths or handles user-provided input related to assets.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the game context, leading to potential data theft, modification of game state, or redirection to malicious websites.
    * **Affected Phaser Component:** Phaser's Asset Loading System (specifically functions within the `Loader` plugin like `load.image`, `load.audio`, `load.script`, `load.json`, etc.).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict validation and sanitization of any user-provided input used to construct asset paths.
        * Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which assets can be loaded.
        * Avoid dynamically constructing asset paths based on untrusted input.
        * Consider using asset bundles or pre-loading assets to minimize dynamic loading based on external input.
        * Implement integrity checks (e.g., hashes) for loaded assets.

* **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Phaser's DOM Manipulation
    * **Description:** If the application uses Phaser to dynamically generate and insert HTML content into the DOM based on user input or external data without proper sanitization, it could introduce XSS vulnerabilities. An attacker could inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the user's browser.
    * **Impact:** Allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
    * **Affected Phaser Component:** Phaser's DOM manipulation capabilities (e.g., when using Phaser to create or modify HTML elements).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Always sanitize and encode any user-provided data before using it to dynamically generate HTML content within Phaser.
        * Utilize browser security features like Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
        * Avoid directly manipulating the DOM with untrusted data if possible; prefer Phaser's built-in display objects.
