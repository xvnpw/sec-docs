# Threat Model Analysis for eslint/eslint

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in ESLint Core Leading to Remote Code Execution](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_eslint_core_leading_to_remote_code_execution.md)

**Threat:** Vulnerabilities in ESLint Core Leading to Remote Code Execution

* **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious JavaScript code that, when analyzed by a vulnerable version of ESLint, triggers a bug allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the machine running ESLint. This could happen during local development, in CI/CD pipelines, or any environment where ESLint is used.
* **Impact:** Full compromise of the developer's machine or the CI/CD environment, potentially leading to data breaches, supply chain attacks, or service disruption.
* **Affected Component:** ESLint's core parsing and analysis engine (specifically the parts responsible for interpreting and evaluating JavaScript code).
* **Risk Severity:** Critical
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update ESLint to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
    * Monitor ESLint's security advisories and release notes for reported vulnerabilities.
    * Implement sandboxing or containerization for ESLint execution, especially in CI/CD environments, to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious ESLint Plugins or Custom Rules Injecting Backdoors](./threats/malicious_eslint_plugins_or_custom_rules_injecting_backdoors.md)

**Threat:** Malicious ESLint Plugins or Custom Rules Injecting Backdoors

* **Description:** An attacker could create or compromise an ESLint plugin or custom rule that contains malicious code. When this plugin or rule is used in a project, the malicious code could be executed during the linting process, potentially installing backdoors, exfiltrating data, or modifying code without detection.
* **Impact:** Introduction of persistent backdoors into the codebase, allowing for long-term unauthorized access and control. Potential data breaches or manipulation of the application's functionality.
* **Affected Component:** ESLint's plugin system and the mechanism for executing custom rules.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Carefully vet all third-party ESLint plugins before installation, checking their source code and reputation.
    * Implement a code review process for all custom ESLint rules.
    * Use plugins from reputable sources with active maintenance and a strong community.
    * Employ static analysis tools to scan plugin code for suspicious patterns.
    * Restrict the ability to install or modify ESLint plugins and rules to authorized personnel.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting ESLint Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_eslint_dependencies.md)

**Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks Targeting ESLint Dependencies

* **Description:** An attacker could compromise a dependency of ESLint (an npm package that ESLint relies on). This compromised dependency could contain malicious code that gets executed when ESLint is installed or run.
* **Impact:** Similar to malicious plugins, this could lead to arbitrary code execution on developer machines or CI/CD environments, potentially resulting in data breaches or supply chain contamination.
* **Affected Component:** ESLint's dependency management (using `npm` or `yarn`).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Regularly update ESLint and its dependencies.
    * Use a dependency scanning tool (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk) to identify known vulnerabilities in ESLint's dependencies.
    * Consider using a tool that provides Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) for better visibility into dependencies.
    * Implement a process for reviewing and approving dependency updates.
