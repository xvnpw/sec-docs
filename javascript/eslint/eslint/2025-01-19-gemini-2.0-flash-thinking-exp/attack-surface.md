# Attack Surface Analysis for eslint/eslint

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_files.md)

**Description:** Introduction of a crafted ESLint configuration file (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.yaml`, `.eslintrc.json`) designed to disable security rules or introduce malicious behavior.

**How ESLint Contributes:** ESLint relies on these configuration files to define linting rules and plugin usage. It executes the JavaScript code within `.eslintrc.js` files.

**Example:** An attacker commits an `.eslintrc.js` file that disables rules related to detecting potential XSS vulnerabilities or includes code that exfiltrates environment variables during ESLint execution.

**Impact:**  Security vulnerabilities in the codebase might be missed, or the development environment could be compromised.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly review all changes to ESLint configuration files in code reviews.
*   Restrict write access to the repository and critical configuration files.
*   Use a locked-down base configuration that is centrally managed and difficult to override.
*   Consider using configuration formats like JSON or YAML if dynamic JavaScript execution in the config is not required.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Remote Configurations/Plugins](./attack_surfaces/compromised_remote_configurationsplugins.md)

**Description:**  Using `extends` or installing plugins from external sources (e.g., npm) that have been compromised by attackers.

**How ESLint Contributes:** ESLint fetches and executes code from these external dependencies during its runtime.

**Example:** A popular ESLint plugin is compromised, and its updated version contains malicious code that executes when ESLint is run, potentially stealing credentials or injecting backdoors.

**Impact:**  Development environment compromise, supply chain attack affecting all projects using the compromised dependency.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly audit and update ESLint dependencies, including plugins and extended configurations.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in ESLint dependencies.
*   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) practices to track dependencies.
*   Consider using a private npm registry or repository manager to control and vet dependencies.
*   Employ techniques like dependency pinning and lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Custom Rule Implementations](./attack_surfaces/insecure_custom_rule_implementations.md)

**Description:**  Developing custom ESLint rules that contain vulnerabilities due to insecure coding practices.

**How ESLint Contributes:** ESLint executes the code within custom rule implementations. If these rules are poorly written, they can introduce vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A custom rule uses `eval()` to process code or has a regular expression vulnerability that can be exploited by crafting specific code patterns, leading to arbitrary code execution during linting.

**Impact:**  Potential for arbitrary code execution within the development environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom ESLint rules.
*   Thoroughly test custom rules with various code inputs, including potentially malicious ones.
*   Have custom rules reviewed by security-conscious developers.
*   Avoid using potentially dangerous functions like `eval()` in custom rules.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_plugins.md)

**Description:** Installing and using ESLint plugins that are intentionally malicious.

**How ESLint Contributes:** ESLint executes the code within the installed plugins.

**Example:** A seemingly innocuous plugin is designed to exfiltrate code or credentials from the development environment when ESLint is run.

**Impact:**  Development environment compromise, data theft.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Exercise caution when installing ESLint plugins. Only install plugins from trusted sources.
*   Review the source code of plugins before installing them, especially if they have broad permissions.
*   Use tools that analyze the security of npm packages.
