# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Improve JavaScript and TypeScript code quality and consistency across projects.
  - Reduce software defects and bugs by enforcing coding standards and best practices.
  - Enhance developer productivity by automating code analysis and providing immediate feedback.
  - Facilitate code maintainability and readability for long-term project health.
  - Support a wide range of JavaScript and TypeScript projects and frameworks.
- Business Risks:
  - Adoption Risk: Developers may resist adopting ESLint if it is perceived as too strict or slows down development.
  - False Positive/Negative Risk: Inaccurate linting results can lead to wasted developer time investigating false positives or missed defects due to false negatives.
  - Performance Risk: ESLint's performance could impact development workflow if it is slow or resource-intensive, especially on large projects.
  - Security Risk: Vulnerabilities in ESLint itself could be exploited to compromise developer environments or introduce malicious code into projects.
  - Compatibility Risk: Changes in JavaScript/TypeScript standards or frameworks could break ESLint rules and require ongoing maintenance and updates.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code Review - Implemented through GitHub Pull Requests, ensuring multiple developers review code changes before merging. Described in GitHub repository contribution guidelines.
  - security control: Unit Testing - Implemented through comprehensive test suites to verify the correctness of ESLint rules and core functionality. Described in project's testing documentation.
  - security control: Static Analysis - ESLint uses its own rules to lint its codebase, ensuring code quality and consistency. Implemented as part of the development workflow.
  - security control: Dependency Management - Using npm to manage dependencies, with regular updates and vulnerability checks. Managed through `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
  - security control: GitHub Security Features - Utilizing GitHub's Dependabot for automated dependency vulnerability scanning and updates. Configured within the GitHub repository settings.
  - security control: Community Security Reporting - Open channels for reporting security vulnerabilities through GitHub issues or security-specific communication channels. Described in security policy (if available) or contribution guidelines.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Open Source Vulnerability Disclosure - As an open-source project, vulnerabilities may be publicly disclosed before a patch is available, potentially increasing the window of exploitation.
  - accepted risk: Third-Party Plugin Vulnerabilities - ESLint's extensibility through plugins introduces a risk of vulnerabilities in community-contributed plugins.
  - accepted risk: Complexity of JavaScript/TypeScript Ecosystem - The rapidly evolving nature of JavaScript and TypeScript and their ecosystems can introduce unforeseen security challenges and require continuous adaptation of ESLint.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits, both internal and external, to identify potential vulnerabilities in ESLint's core and plugins.
  - security control: Fuzzing - Implement fuzzing techniques to test ESLint's parsers and rule engines for robustness against malformed or malicious code inputs.
  - security control: Security Focused Code Reviews - Emphasize security considerations during code reviews, specifically looking for potential vulnerabilities and insecure coding practices.
  - security control: Dependency Vulnerability Scanning Automation - Integrate automated dependency vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify and address vulnerable dependencies.
  - security control: Security Training for Core Developers - Provide security training to core developers to enhance their awareness of secure coding practices and common vulnerability types.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to ESLint itself as it is a command-line tool. Authentication is relevant for the infrastructure used for development and distribution (GitHub, npm).
  - Authorization: Access control to the ESLint GitHub repository and npm package publishing process should be strictly managed using role-based access control (RBAC) on GitHub and npm.
  - Input Validation: ESLint must robustly validate and sanitize code inputs to prevent code injection, denial-of-service, or other attacks stemming from maliciously crafted code. This is critical for the parser and rule execution engine.
  - Cryptography: Cryptography is not a core requirement for ESLint's primary functionality. However, if ESLint were to implement features like secure plugin updates or configuration encryption in the future, cryptographic measures would become relevant. For now, secure communication channels (HTTPS) should be used for distribution and updates.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Software Development Process: ESLint directly supports the software development process by improving code quality and reducing defects.
  - Distribution of ESLint: Ensuring secure and reliable distribution of ESLint to developers via npm is critical for its adoption and usability.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - ESLint Source Code: High sensitivity. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the source code are crucial to prevent unauthorized modifications, intellectual property theft, and supply chain attacks.
  - ESLint Build Pipeline: Medium to High sensitivity. Integrity of the build pipeline is essential to ensure that released versions of ESLint are not compromised.
  - Developer Environments (using ESLint): Low to Medium sensitivity (from ESLint project perspective). While ESLint aims to improve the security of projects using it, the data within those projects is outside of ESLint's direct control. However, vulnerabilities in ESLint could indirectly impact these environments.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the current process for handling security vulnerability reports for ESLint?
  - Are there any specific security testing practices (e.g., fuzzing, SAST/DAST) currently employed for ESLint development?
  - What is the policy regarding third-party plugin security audits or reviews?
  - Are there any plans to implement more formal security training for core ESLint developers?
  - What are the current access control policies for the ESLint GitHub repository and npm publishing?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE:
    - The primary business goal of ESLint is to improve JavaScript and TypeScript code quality and developer productivity.
    - Security is a significant non-functional requirement for ESLint, as vulnerabilities could impact a large number of projects.
    - The ESLint project relies on community contributions and open-source principles.
  - SECURITY POSTURE:
    - Code review and testing are existing security controls.
    - Open-source nature and reliance on community plugins are accepted risks.
    - Security audits and enhanced dependency scanning are valuable recommended security controls.
    - Input validation is a critical security requirement for ESLint.
  - DESIGN:
    - ESLint is primarily used as a command-line tool and integrated into IDEs and CI/CD systems.
    - The core architecture consists of CLI, Core engine, Plugin ecosystem, and Configuration files.
    - Deployment is primarily via npm package distribution and local installation by developers.
    - Build process is automated using GitHub Actions and includes linting, testing, and publishing steps.
