                    * **Malware on Developer Machine, Social Engineering [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                        * **How it works:** Attacker compromises a developer's machine with malware or through social engineering, gaining control to modify the local environment and inject malicious ESLint configuration overrides that might propagate to the CI/CD pipeline or be committed to the repository.
                        * **Actionable Insights:** Enforce endpoint security measures, provide security awareness training to developers, and monitor developer machines for suspicious activity.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Vulnerabilities in ESLint Rules or Plugins [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_eslint_rules_or_plugins__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vectors:**
    * **Identify Vulnerable ESLint Rule/Plugin [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Publicly Known Vulnerability (CVE) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **How it works:** Attacker identifies a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) in an ESLint rule or plugin used by the application.
            * **Actionable Insights:** Regularly update ESLint and plugins, use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known CVEs in dependencies.
    * **Trigger Vulnerability During ESLint Execution [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Craft Malicious Code Snippet to Exploit Rule/Plugin [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **How it works:** Attacker crafts a malicious code snippet that, when processed by ESLint using the vulnerable rule/plugin, triggers the vulnerability.
            * **Actionable Insights:**  Regularly update ESLint and plugins, implement code review processes to identify potentially malicious code patterns.
    * **Achieve Code Execution or Data Exfiltration [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        * **Rule/Plugin Vulnerability Allows Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **Leverage ACE to compromise application environment [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                * **Access sensitive files, environment variables, network resources [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
                    * **How it works:** If a rule/plugin vulnerability allows Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE), the attacker leverages this to gain further access to the application environment, potentially accessing sensitive files, environment variables, or network resources.
                    * **Actionable Insights:** Regularly update ESLint and plugins, implement sandboxing for ESLint execution in sensitive environments (advanced).

        * **Typosquatting on npm (create similar-sounding malicious package) [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
            * **How it works:** Attacker creates a malicious npm package with a name similar to the official ESLint package or popular plugins (typosquatting), hoping developers will mistakenly install the malicious package.
            * **Actionable Insights:** Educate developers about typosquatting risks, encourage careful package name verification, use package lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Social Engineering/Developer Manipulation Related to ESLint [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH-RISK PATH]:](./attack_tree_paths/4__social_engineeringdeveloper_manipulation_related_to_eslint__critical_node___high-risk_path_.md)
