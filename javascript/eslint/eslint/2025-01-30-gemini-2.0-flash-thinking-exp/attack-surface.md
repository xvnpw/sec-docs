# Attack Surface Analysis for eslint/eslint

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious configurations into ESLint settings, leading to unintended or harmful behavior during code analysis.
*   **ESLint Contribution:** ESLint's core functionality relies on configuration files (`.eslintrc.*`, `package.json`) to define linting rules and plugins. This design makes ESLint directly vulnerable if these configuration files are sourced from untrusted locations or dynamically generated based on external, potentially malicious, input.
*   **Example:** A CI/CD pipeline dynamically generates `.eslintrc.js` based on environment variables. An attacker gains control over an environment variable and injects malicious JavaScript code into it. When ESLint runs, it loads this compromised configuration, executing the attacker's code within the CI/CD environment, potentially leading to secret exfiltration or build system compromise.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Execution:** Arbitrary code execution on developer machines or CI/CD servers.
    *   **Security Rule Disablement:**  Attackers can disable critical security-focused ESLint rules, allowing vulnerable code to pass unnoticed and be merged into the codebase.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive information like secrets, API keys, or source code from the development environment.
    *   **Development Environment Compromise:** Full or partial compromise of the developer's machine or the CI/CD infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Static Configuration Files:** Store ESLint configuration files directly in the project's version control system and treat them as immutable code. Avoid dynamic generation of configurations based on external or untrusted input.
    *   **Configuration File Validation (If Dynamic):** If dynamic configuration generation is absolutely necessary, rigorously validate and sanitize all external input used to create the configuration files. Implement strict input validation and output encoding to prevent injection.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run ESLint processes with the minimum necessary permissions to limit the potential damage if a configuration injection vulnerability is exploited.
    *   **Secure Configuration Storage and Access Control:** Protect ESLint configuration files from unauthorized modification by implementing appropriate file system permissions and access controls.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Plugin/Custom Rule Execution](./attack_surfaces/malicious_plugincustom_rule_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers introduce malicious ESLint plugins or custom rules that execute arbitrary code during ESLint's runtime, gaining control over the ESLint process and potentially the underlying system.
*   **ESLint Contribution:** ESLint's plugin architecture and support for custom rules are core features designed to extend its functionality. However, this extensibility directly introduces a critical attack surface. Plugins and custom rules are essentially JavaScript code executed within the Node.js environment running ESLint, granting them significant capabilities.
*   **Example:** A developer, seeking to enhance ESLint's capabilities, unknowingly installs a compromised ESLint plugin from a public npm registry. This plugin, disguised as a helpful utility, contains malicious code that, when ESLint is executed, exfiltrates source code to an attacker-controlled server, or installs a backdoor on the developer's machine.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Full and unrestricted code execution on developer machines or CI/CD servers.
    *   **Data Breach:** Exfiltration of highly sensitive data, including source code, intellectual property, secrets, credentials, and developer environment information.
    *   **Supply Chain Attack:** Introduction of backdoors or vulnerabilities into the codebase through malicious code injected via plugins, potentially affecting downstream users of the software.
    *   **System Takeover:** Complete compromise of the developer's machine or CI/CD infrastructure, allowing attackers to perform any action on the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Plugin Vetting and Auditing:**  Thoroughly vet and audit all ESLint plugins before installation and use. Verify the plugin's source code, reputation, maintainer history, download statistics, and community reviews. Prefer plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Plugin Execution):**  If technically feasible, explore running ESLint plugins in a sandboxed environment or with restricted permissions to limit the potential impact of malicious plugin code.
    *   **Code Review for Custom Rules (Mandatory):** Implement mandatory and rigorous code review processes for all custom ESLint rules. Ensure that custom rules are developed securely and do not introduce any unintended or malicious behavior.
    *   **Dependency Scanning for Plugins:**  Regularly scan the dependencies of all installed ESLint plugins for known vulnerabilities using dependency scanning tools. Update plugin dependencies promptly to patch any identified vulnerabilities.
    *   **Trusted Plugin Sources and Registries:**  Prefer using plugins from official or highly trusted sources. If using private npm registries, implement security measures to prevent the introduction of malicious packages.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits of the ESLint configuration, installed plugins, and custom rules to identify and address any potential security vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
