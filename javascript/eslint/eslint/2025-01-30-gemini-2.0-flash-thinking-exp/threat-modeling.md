# Threat Model Analysis for eslint/eslint

## Threat: [Malicious Configuration Injection](./threats/malicious_configuration_injection.md)

- **Description:** An attacker with write access to the project repository or developer's machine modifies the `.eslintrc.js` or `.eslintrc.json` file. They could disable security rules, introduce overly permissive rules, or add malicious custom rules or plugins. This could be done directly or through a compromised dependency.
- **Impact:**  Security vulnerabilities are not detected by ESLint, leading to vulnerable code being deployed. Custom rules or plugins could execute arbitrary code during development or CI/CD, potentially leading to data exfiltration or system compromise.
- **Affected ESLint Component:** Configuration Files (`.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, etc.), Custom Rules, Plugins
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Implement strict access control for repository and development environments.
    - Enforce code review for all changes to ESLint configuration files.
    - Store ESLint configuration in a centralized, version-controlled location managed by security/DevOps.
    - Use configuration presets from trusted sources.
    - Regularly audit ESLint configurations for deviations from security best practices.
    - Implement file integrity monitoring for ESLint configuration files.

## Threat: [Rule/Plugin Vulnerability Exploitation (High Severity)](./threats/ruleplugin_vulnerability_exploitation__high_severity_.md)

- **Description:** An attacker identifies a critical vulnerability in a community plugin or a custom rule. They could craft specific code that, when analyzed by ESLint with the vulnerable plugin/rule, triggers arbitrary code execution during ESLint's execution.
- **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution on developer machines or CI/CD servers during ESLint execution, potentially leading to supply chain compromise, data exfiltration, or system takeover.
- **Affected ESLint Component:** Plugins (Community and Custom), Rule Execution Engine
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Use well-vetted and reputable ESLint plugins.
    - Keep ESLint and all plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
    - Thoroughly review and security test custom ESLint rules and plugins before use.
    - Subscribe to security advisories related to ESLint and its ecosystem.
    - Consider static analysis tools to scan custom rules and plugins for potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Dependency Chain Compromise](./threats/dependency_chain_compromise.md)

- **Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency of ESLint in the npm registry. When developers install or update ESLint, they unknowingly pull in the compromised dependency. This malicious dependency could execute arbitrary code during installation or at runtime when ESLint is used, potentially compromising the developer's machine or CI/CD pipeline.
- **Impact:**  Supply chain attack leading to arbitrary code execution on developer machines or CI/CD servers. Potential for data exfiltration, backdoors in the codebase, or compromised CI/CD pipeline.
- **Affected ESLint Component:** Dependencies (npm packages), Package Manager (npm/yarn)
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Regularly audit ESLint's dependencies using `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    - Use lockfiles (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
    - Implement dependency scanning in CI/CD pipelines to detect vulnerable dependencies.
    - Consider using a private npm registry or dependency proxy to control and vet dependencies.
    - Monitor security advisories for ESLint dependencies.

## Threat: [Compromised Execution Environment Manipulation](./threats/compromised_execution_environment_manipulation.md)

- **Description:** An attacker gains access to the development environment or CI/CD pipeline where ESLint is executed. They could modify the ESLint binary, configuration, or inject malicious code into the environment before ESLint runs. This could allow them to bypass ESLint checks, inject malicious code into the codebase, or exfiltrate sensitive information processed by ESLint.
- **Impact:**  Bypassing security checks, introduction of malicious code into the codebase, data breaches, compromised CI/CD pipeline integrity.
- **Affected ESLint Component:** Execution Environment (Developer Machine, CI/CD Server), ESLint Binary, Configuration
- **Risk Severity:** High
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - Secure development environments and CI/CD pipelines with strong access controls and regular patching.
    - Implement integrity checks for ESLint binaries and configuration files.
    - Run ESLint in isolated environments or containers with limited privileges.
    - Use secure CI/CD pipelines with robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    - Employ intrusion detection and prevention systems in development and CI/CD environments.
