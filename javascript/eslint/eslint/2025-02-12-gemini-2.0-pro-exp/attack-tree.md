## Attack Tree Path: [1. [[1. Malicious ESLint Plugin/Config]]](./attack_tree_paths/1____1__malicious_eslint_pluginconfig__.md)

*   **Description:** This is the overarching category for attacks that involve manipulating ESLint plugins or configurations to inject malicious code. It's a high-risk path because plugins are a common extension point for ESLint, and developers often install them without thorough vetting.

*   **Sub-Paths:**

## Attack Tree Path: [[[1.1 Plugin Supply Chain Attack]] -> [1.1.1 Compromised NPM Account]](./attack_tree_paths/__1_1_plugin_supply_chain_attack___-__1_1_1_compromised_npm_account_.md)

* **Description:** The attacker gains control of a legitimate plugin maintainer's NPM account (e.g., through phishing, password reuse, or session hijacking) and publishes a malicious version of the plugin.
* **Likelihood:** Low
* **Impact:** High
* **Effort:** High
* **Skill Level:** Advanced
* **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [[[1.2 User Installs Malicious Plugin]]](./attack_tree_paths/__1_2_user_installs_malicious_plugin__.md)

*   **Description:** This branch covers scenarios where the user is tricked or inadvertently installs a malicious plugin.
*   **Sub-Paths:**

## Attack Tree Path: [[[1.2.1 Social Engineering]]](./attack_tree_paths/__1_2_1_social_engineering__.md)

* **Description:** The attacker convinces a developer (e.g., through a blog post, forum comment, or direct message) to install a malicious plugin, perhaps by claiming it offers enhanced functionality or fixes a critical bug.
* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High
* **Effort:** Low
* **Skill Level:** Intermediate
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [[[1.2.2 Typosquatting on Plugin Name]]](./attack_tree_paths/__1_2_2_typosquatting_on_plugin_name__.md)

* **Description:** The attacker publishes a malicious plugin with a name very similar to a popular, legitimate plugin (e.g., `esling-plugin-prety` instead of `eslint-plugin-pretty`). Developers might accidentally install the malicious version.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [2. Vulnerability in ESLint Core or Dependencies] -> [[2.2 Known CVE in ESLint/Deps]] -> <<2.2.1 Exploit Published CVE>>](./attack_tree_paths/2___2__vulnerability_in_eslint_core_or_dependencies__-___2_2_known_cve_in_eslintdeps___-_2_2_1_explo_1783adaa.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents the exploitation of a known, publicly disclosed vulnerability in ESLint or one of its dependencies.  It's high-risk because exploits for these vulnerabilities are often readily available.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium
*   **Impact:** High
*   **Effort:** Low
*   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy
