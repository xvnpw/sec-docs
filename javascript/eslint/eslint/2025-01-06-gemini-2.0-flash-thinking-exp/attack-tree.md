## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Malicious ESLint Configuration (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_malicious_eslint_configuration__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers gain write access to the project's codebase or build environment.
*   **Critical Node: 1.1 Inject Malicious Configuration File:**
    *   **1.1.1 Overwrite Existing Configuration File (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker modifies existing ESLint configuration files (`.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.json`, `package.json`).
        *   **Impact:** Disabling critical security rules, introducing linting errors that disrupt development or deployment, subtly altering code style for social engineering attacks, or including malicious rule paths.
    *   **1.1.2 Introduce New Configuration File (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker adds a new ESLint configuration file that applies to specific directories or files, overriding existing configurations.
        *   **Impact:** Similar to overwriting, but allows for more targeted manipulation of linting behavior in specific parts of the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Malicious ESLint Rules or Plugins (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_malicious_eslint_rules_or_plugins__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers aim to introduce and execute malicious code through ESLint's extensibility mechanisms.
*   **Critical Node: 2.1 Introduce Malicious Custom Rule (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   **2.1.1 Directly Add Malicious Code to Custom Rule (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker creates a custom ESLint rule and directly embeds malicious JavaScript code within its implementation.
        *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running ESLint during the linting process, potentially leading to data exfiltration, file modification, or remote code execution.
    *   **2.1.2 Introduce Vulnerability via Malicious Dependency in Custom Rule (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker creates a custom ESLint rule that depends on a known vulnerable or malicious npm package.
        *   **Impact:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities within the dependency during the execution of the custom rule, leading to similar impacts as directly embedding malicious code.
*   **Critical Node: 2.2 Install Malicious ESLint Plugin (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   **2.2.1 Plugin Contains Malicious Code (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker installs an ESLint plugin from a compromised source or a deliberately malicious package on npm.
        *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the system running ESLint during the plugin's execution, similar to malicious custom rules.
    *   **2.2.2 Plugin Has Known Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH):**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker installs an ESLint plugin with publicly known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Impact:** Exploitation of these vulnerabilities during the plugin's execution by ESLint, potentially leading to various security breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Introduce Malicious Custom Rule with Malicious Autofix Implementation (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/3__introduce_malicious_custom_rule_with_malicious_autofix_implementation__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage the autofix feature of custom ESLint rules to inject malicious code.
*   **Mechanism:** Attacker creates a custom ESLint rule where the autofix functionality is designed to introduce vulnerabilities or malicious code when applied.
*   **Impact:** Subtle injection of malicious code into the codebase through automated fixes, potentially introducing XSS vectors, logic flaws, or backdoors that might go unnoticed in standard code reviews.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Vulnerabilities in ESLint's Plugin Dependencies (HIGH-RISK PATH):](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_eslint's_plugin_dependencies__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities present in the dependencies of ESLint plugins.
*   **Mechanism:** An installed ESLint plugin relies on other npm packages that have known security vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities can be triggered during the plugin's execution by ESLint.
*   **Impact:** Depending on the specific vulnerability, this could lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution within the ESLint process.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Supply Chain Attacks Targeting ESLint (Less Directly Related, but worth noting) (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/5__supply_chain_attacks_targeting_eslint__less_directly_related__but_worth_noting___critical_node_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the distribution channels of ESLint or its plugins.
*   **Critical Node: 5.1 Compromise of ESLint Package on npm:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers gain control of the official ESLint package on npm and inject malicious code into it.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications that depend on the infected version of ESLint, potentially affecting a large number of systems.
*   **Critical Node: 5.2 Compromise of ESLint Plugin Package on npm:**
    *   **Mechanism:** Attackers gain control of the npm package for a popular ESLint plugin and inject malicious code.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of applications using the infected plugin, potentially affecting a significant portion of projects utilizing that specific plugin.
