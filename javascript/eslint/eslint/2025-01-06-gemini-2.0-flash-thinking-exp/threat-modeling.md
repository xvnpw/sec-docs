# Threat Model Analysis for eslint/eslint

## Threat: [Malicious ESLint Rule Execution](./threats/malicious_eslint_rule_execution.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious ESLint rule that, when executed by ESLint, runs arbitrary code on the developer's machine or the CI/CD server. This could be achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in ESLint's rule execution engine or by creating a rule that intentionally performs malicious actions. The attacker might distribute this rule through a compromised npm package or convince a developer to add it to their project.

**Impact:** Code execution on developer machines or build servers, potentially leading to data exfiltration, installation of malware, supply chain contamination (if the malicious code modifies build artifacts), or access to sensitive development resources and credentials.

**Affected Component:** ESLint Rule Execution Engine, Custom ESLint Rule Modules

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully vet and review all custom ESLint rules before adoption.
*   Prefer well-established and reputable ESLint rule sets and plugins.
*   Implement code review processes for changes to ESLint configurations and rules.
*   Employ sandboxing or virtualization techniques when developing or testing custom ESLint rules.
*   Monitor the network activity of the ESLint process, especially in CI/CD environments.

## Threat: [Vulnerability in ESLint Core Leading to Code Execution](./threats/vulnerability_in_eslint_core_leading_to_code_execution.md)

**Description:** A security vulnerability exists within the core ESLint codebase that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This could be triggered by processing specially crafted code or configuration files. An attacker might exploit this vulnerability if they can influence the code being linted or the ESLint configuration.

**Impact:** Code execution on developer machines or build servers with the same privileges as the ESLint process, potentially leading to data exfiltration, installation of malware, or access to sensitive development resources.

**Affected Component:** ESLint Core (Parser, Linter, CLI)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep ESLint updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for reports related to ESLint.
*   Subscribe to ESLint's security mailing list or GitHub security advisories.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on the ESLint codebase itself (if contributing or heavily extending ESLint).

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering to Disable Security Rules](./threats/configuration_tampering_to_disable_security_rules.md)

**Description:** An attacker with write access to the ESLint configuration files (e.g., `.eslintrc.js`, `.eslintrc.json`) modifies the configuration to disable important security-related rules or to ignore specific files or directories containing vulnerabilities. This could be done by an insider threat or an attacker who has gained access to the development environment.

**Impact:** Reduced security posture of the codebase, allowing vulnerabilities to be introduced or remain undetected, potentially leading to security breaches in the deployed application.

**Affected Component:** ESLint Configuration Loading and Parsing

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store ESLint configuration files in version control and implement code review processes for changes.
*   Restrict write access to ESLint configuration files to authorized personnel.
*   Implement file integrity monitoring for ESLint configuration files.
*   Consider using a centralized configuration management system if managing multiple projects.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack Targeting ESLint Plugins](./threats/supply_chain_attack_targeting_eslint_plugins.md)

**Description:** Attackers compromise popular ESLint plugins hosted on package registries (e.g., npm) and inject malicious code. When developers install or update these compromised plugins, the malicious code is executed during the linting process.

**Impact:** Code execution on developer machines or build servers, potentially leading to data exfiltration, installation of malware, or supply chain contamination.

**Affected Component:** ESLint Plugin Loading Mechanism

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Exercise caution when adding new ESLint plugins as dependencies.
*   Prefer plugins with a strong community, active maintenance, and a good security track record.
*   Regularly audit and update dependencies, including ESLint plugins.
*   Utilize dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in ESLint plugins.
*   Consider using a private npm registry or repository manager to control the supply chain.
