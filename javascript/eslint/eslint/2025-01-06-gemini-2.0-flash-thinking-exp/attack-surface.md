# Attack Surface Analysis for eslint/eslint

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration Files (.eslintrc.*)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_files___eslintrc__.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can inject malicious configurations into ESLint's configuration files (JSON, YAML, or JavaScript).
*   **How ESLint Contributes:** ESLint parses and applies configurations from these files, including settings that can trigger code execution or other harmful actions.
*   **Example:** An attacker modifies `.eslintrc.js` to include a processor that executes arbitrary code when ESLint is run.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the developer's machine or CI/CD environment, potentially leading to data exfiltration, malware installation, or supply chain compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Strictly control access to project configuration files.
    *   Use version control for configuration files and review changes carefully.
    *   Implement code review processes for changes to ESLint configuration.
    *   Consider using locked-down or centrally managed ESLint configurations where possible.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Shared Configuration Packages (@scope/eslint-config-*)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_shared_configuration_packages__@scopeeslint-config-_.md)

*   **Description:**  Using shared ESLint configuration packages from public or private registries introduces a supply chain risk if these packages are compromised or intentionally malicious.
*   **How ESLint Contributes:** ESLint downloads and applies rules and settings from these external packages.
*   **Example:** A malicious actor gains control of a popular shared configuration package and injects a rule that exfiltrates environment variables during linting.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of malicious rules, arbitrary code execution, information disclosure, or denial of service affecting projects using the compromised configuration.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and audit shared configuration packages before using them.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in configuration package dependencies.
    *   Consider using internal, curated, and audited configuration packages.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to monitor dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Custom Rules](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_custom_rules.md)

*   **Description:** Developers can create custom ESLint rules. Poorly written or intentionally malicious custom rules can introduce vulnerabilities.
*   **How ESLint Contributes:** ESLint executes the code defined within custom rule implementations.
*   **Example:** A custom rule contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to inject code during the linting process by manipulating the code being analyzed.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, introduction of backdoors into the codebase, denial of service during linting.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rigorous code review for all custom ESLint rules.
    *   Follow secure coding practices when developing custom rules.
    *   Thoroughly test custom rules in isolated environments before deployment.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools on custom rule code.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised or Malicious ESLint Plugins (eslint-plugin-*)](./attack_surfaces/compromised_or_malicious_eslint_plugins__eslint-plugin-_.md)

*   **Description:** ESLint plugins extend its functionality. Compromised or malicious plugins can execute arbitrary code or perform other harmful actions.
*   **How ESLint Contributes:** ESLint loads and executes code from plugins specified in the configuration.
*   **Example:** A compromised plugin injects malicious code into the codebase during the linting process or exfiltrates sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, data exfiltration, supply chain compromise affecting projects using the malicious plugin.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and audit ESLint plugins before using them.
    *   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in plugin dependencies.
    *   Consider using plugins from trusted sources with strong community support.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) to monitor plugin dependencies.
