# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rocketchat/rocket.chat

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Validation and Sanitization within Rocket.Chat](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_validation_and_sanitization_within_rocket_chat.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Strict Input Validation and Sanitization within Rocket.Chat
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Leverage Rocket.Chat's built-in sanitization:** Rocket.Chat likely has built-in sanitization for common input fields like messages. Developers should understand and ensure these are active and up-to-date. Consult Rocket.Chat documentation for details on built-in sanitization mechanisms.
    2.  **Extend validation for custom fields and plugins:** If using custom fields or plugins, developers must implement *additional* input validation and sanitization. Plugins, in particular, are a common source of vulnerabilities.
        *   **Plugin Input Validation:** When developing or using plugins, rigorously validate all inputs received by the plugin, both from user interfaces and API calls.
        *   **Custom Field Validation:** If Rocket.Chat allows custom fields, ensure validation rules are defined and enforced for these fields to prevent injection attacks.
    3.  **Configure Rocket.Chat's file upload settings:** Utilize Rocket.Chat's file upload settings to restrict allowed file types and sizes. This is a basic form of input validation for file uploads.
    4.  **Review and update Rocket.Chat regularly:** Keep Rocket.Chat updated to the latest version. Updates often include fixes for input validation vulnerabilities and improvements to sanitization routines.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity
    *   NoSQL Injection (if Rocket.Chat is vulnerable in specific input points) - High Severity
    *   Command Injection (if Rocket.Chat or plugins have command execution vulnerabilities) - High Severity
    *   Path Traversal (related to file uploads within Rocket.Chat) - Medium Severity
    *   Data Integrity Issues - Medium Severity
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: High Reduction - Effective if Rocket.Chat's built-in sanitization is robust and plugins are properly validated.
    *   NoSQL Injection: High Reduction - Depends on the effectiveness of Rocket.Chat's database interaction and validation.
    *   Command Injection: Medium Reduction - Relies on the overall security of Rocket.Chat and its plugins.
    *   Path Traversal: Medium Reduction - File upload settings provide basic protection.
    *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium Reduction - Improves data quality within Rocket.Chat.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented. Rocket.Chat core likely has basic sanitization. File upload settings are configurable.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive validation for custom fields and plugin inputs.
    *   Regular audits of Rocket.Chat's input validation and sanitization routines, especially after updates.
    *   Clear guidelines for plugin developers on input validation within the Rocket.Chat plugin ecosystem.
