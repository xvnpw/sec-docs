## Deep Analysis: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Rocket.Chat

This document provides a deep analysis of the Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack surface within Rocket.Chat, based on the provided information. It outlines the objective, scope, methodology, and a detailed breakdown of potential SSRF vulnerabilities, along with actionable insights for the development team.

### 1. Define Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to:

*   **Thoroughly investigate** the potential for Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities within Rocket.Chat, focusing on features that involve fetching external resources.
*   **Identify specific attack vectors** and scenarios where SSRF could be exploited.
*   **Assess the potential impact** of successful SSRF attacks on Rocket.Chat and its environment.
*   **Provide actionable recommendations** and mitigation strategies for the development team to strengthen Rocket.Chat's defenses against SSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Raise awareness** within the development team regarding secure coding practices related to handling external URLs and resource fetching.

### 2. Scope

This analysis focuses on the following Rocket.Chat features and functionalities as they relate to SSRF:

*   **Link Preview Generation:**  The process by which Rocket.Chat fetches and displays previews for URLs shared in messages. This includes:
    *   URL parsing and extraction from messages.
    *   HTTP requests made to retrieve website content.
    *   Processing of retrieved content (e.g., HTML parsing for metadata).
*   **Custom Avatar URLs:** The functionality allowing users and administrators to set custom avatar images using external URLs. This includes:
    *   User profile settings for avatar URLs.
    *   Administrative settings for default avatar URLs.
    *   Fetching and processing images from provided URLs.
*   **Integrations (Webhooks and Apps):**  Features that enable Rocket.Chat to interact with external systems. This includes:
    *   **Outgoing Webhooks:** Rocket.Chat sending HTTP requests to configured external URLs upon specific events.
    *   **Incoming Webhooks:** Rocket.Chat receiving HTTP requests from external services. (While less directly related to *outgoing* SSRF, the processing of URLs within incoming webhook data could be relevant and should be considered for completeness).
    *   **Rocket.Chat Apps:**  Third-party applications that may interact with external resources, potentially through Rocket.Chat's server-side APIs or functionalities.
*   **Potentially Related Features:**  While not explicitly mentioned, we should also briefly consider other features that *might* involve fetching external resources, such as:
    *   OEmbed functionality (if implemented).
    *   File uploads from URLs (if supported).
    *   Any other integrations or plugins that handle external URLs.

**Out of Scope:**

*   Client-side vulnerabilities related to URL handling within the Rocket.Chat web or mobile clients.
*   Detailed analysis of specific third-party Rocket.Chat Apps (unless directly relevant to demonstrating SSRF vectors within Rocket.Chat core).
*   General network security hardening beyond the context of SSRF mitigation within Rocket.Chat itself.

### 3. Methodology

To conduct this deep analysis, we will employ a combination of techniques:

*   **Code Review (Focused):**  If feasible and with access to the Rocket.Chat codebase, we will perform a focused code review of the modules responsible for:
    *   URL parsing and validation in link preview, avatar handling, and webhook functionalities.
    *   HTTP request construction and execution within these features.
    *   Error handling and logging related to external resource fetching.
    *   Configuration settings related to link previews, avatars, and integrations.
*   **Configuration Analysis:**  We will examine Rocket.Chat's configuration options (both server-side settings and administrative UI settings) related to the features in scope. This includes identifying configurable parameters that might impact SSRF risk (e.g., options to disable link previews, restrict avatar sources, manage webhook permissions).
*   **Feature Testing (Black Box/Grey Box):**  We will perform practical testing of the identified features to simulate potential SSRF attacks. This will involve:
    *   Crafting malicious URLs designed to target internal resources or external services.
    *   Injecting these URLs into Rocket.Chat through messages, avatar settings, and webhook configurations.
    *   Monitoring Rocket.Chat's network traffic and server logs to observe its behavior when processing these malicious URLs.
    *   Using tools like `curl`, `Burp Suite`, or custom scripts to simulate attacker requests and analyze responses.
*   **Documentation Review:** We will review Rocket.Chat's official documentation, security advisories, and community forums to identify any publicly known SSRF vulnerabilities, best practices, or security recommendations related to external resource handling.
*   **Threat Modeling (Feature-Specific):** For each feature in scope, we will develop specific threat models outlining potential SSRF attack scenarios, attacker motivations, and potential impacts.

### 4. Deep Analysis of SSRF Attack Surface

Let's delve into a feature-by-feature analysis of the SSRF attack surface in Rocket.Chat:

#### 4.1. Link Preview Generation

*   **Functionality Breakdown:** When a user posts a message containing a URL, Rocket.Chat attempts to generate a preview. This typically involves:
    1.  **URL Extraction:** Identifying URLs within the message text using regular expressions or URL parsing libraries.
    2.  **Request Construction:** Creating an HTTP GET request to the extracted URL.
    3.  **Request Execution:** Sending the HTTP request from the Rocket.Chat server.
    4.  **Response Processing:** Receiving the HTTP response, parsing the HTML content (or other content types), and extracting relevant metadata (e.g., title, description, images) for the preview.
    5.  **Preview Display:** Rendering the generated preview within the chat message.

*   **SSRF Vulnerability Points:**
    *   **Weak URL Validation:** Insufficient or absent validation of the extracted URL before making the HTTP request. This is the most critical point. If Rocket.Chat doesn't properly validate the URL scheme, hostname, or path, attackers can inject URLs pointing to internal resources (e.g., `http://localhost:8080/admin`, `http://192.168.1.100/sensitive-data`).
    *   **Bypassable URL Filters (Blacklists):** If URL validation relies on blacklists (e.g., blocking specific IP ranges or hostnames), attackers might be able to bypass these filters using techniques like:
        *   **IP Address Encoding:** Using different IP address encodings (e.g., octal, hexadecimal) or alternative representations.
        *   **DNS Rebinding:** Manipulating DNS records to initially resolve to a safe IP and then rebind to an internal IP after validation.
        *   **Open Redirects:** Using open redirect URLs on trusted domains to redirect the request to an internal target.
    *   **Lack of Protocol Restriction:** If Rocket.Chat allows protocols beyond `http` and `https` (e.g., `file://`, `gopher://`, `ftp://`), it could open up more severe SSRF vulnerabilities, potentially allowing access to local files or interaction with other services.
    *   **Insecure HTTP Client Configuration:**  If the HTTP client used by Rocket.Chat is not configured securely, it might be vulnerable to:
        *   **Following Redirects to Unintended Locations:**  Unrestricted redirect following could lead to SSRF if redirects are not properly validated.
        *   **Exposure of Credentials in Requests:**  If the HTTP client inadvertently includes sensitive credentials (e.g., cookies, authentication headers) in requests to external URLs, it could lead to information disclosure.
    *   **Error Handling and Information Disclosure:**  Verbose error messages or responses from the link preview functionality could inadvertently reveal information about internal network infrastructure or services.

*   **Example Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Internal Port Scanning:** An attacker sends a message with a URL like `http://localhost:6379`. If Rocket.Chat attempts to fetch this URL, it could reveal if a Redis server is running on the same host.
    *   **Accessing Internal APIs:**  A malicious URL like `http://internal.api.server/admin/users` could be used to attempt to access internal APIs if the Rocket.Chat server has network access to them.
    *   **Information Disclosure from Internal Services:**  Fetching URLs like `http://internal.monitoring.server/status` could expose sensitive operational data.

#### 4.2. Custom Avatar URLs

*   **Functionality Breakdown:** Users and administrators can set custom avatar images by providing a URL. Rocket.Chat then fetches and stores this image.

*   **SSRF Vulnerability Points:**  Similar to link preview generation, custom avatar URLs are vulnerable to SSRF due to:
    *   **Weak URL Validation:**  Insufficient validation of the provided avatar URL.
    *   **Bypassable URL Filters:**  If blacklists are used, they might be bypassed using the same techniques as in link preview.
    *   **Lack of Protocol Restriction:** Allowing protocols beyond `http` and `https` could lead to more severe SSRF.
    *   **File Type Validation Issues:**  While primarily an SSRF issue, if Rocket.Chat doesn't properly validate the *content* of the fetched resource as an image, it could be tricked into fetching and storing arbitrary files, potentially leading to other vulnerabilities (e.g., denial of service, local file inclusion if the stored file is later processed insecurely).

*   **Example Attack Scenarios:**
    *   **Internal Resource Access:**  Setting an avatar URL to `http://internal.database.server:5432` could be used to test connectivity to an internal database server.
    *   **Exfiltration of Internal Data (Indirect):**  While less direct, if an attacker can control an external server, they could potentially use SSRF via avatar URLs to trigger requests to internal resources and log information about those requests on their external server (e.g., timing information, response headers).

#### 4.3. Integrations (Webhooks and Apps)

*   **Outgoing Webhooks:**
    *   **Functionality Breakdown:**  Administrators configure outgoing webhooks to send HTTP POST requests to external URLs when specific events occur in Rocket.Chat (e.g., new messages in a channel).
    *   **SSRF Vulnerability Points:**
        *   **Webhook URL Validation:**  The validation of the webhook URL configured by administrators is crucial. If administrators can specify arbitrary URLs, they could configure webhooks to send requests to internal resources.
        *   **Lack of Access Control:**  If webhook configuration is not properly restricted to authorized administrators, less privileged users might be able to create or modify webhooks to exploit SSRF.

*   **Incoming Webhooks:**
    *   **Functionality Breakdown:** External services can send HTTP POST requests to Rocket.Chat's incoming webhook endpoints to post messages into Rocket.Chat.
    *   **SSRF Vulnerability Points (Indirect):** While incoming webhooks are primarily about *receiving* requests, SSRF could become relevant if:
        *   **URL Processing in Incoming Webhook Data:** If the data received in incoming webhook requests (e.g., message content, attachments) is processed by Rocket.Chat in a way that triggers *outgoing* requests (e.g., link preview generation on URLs within webhook messages), then SSRF vulnerabilities in those features could be indirectly exploitable through incoming webhooks.

*   **Rocket.Chat Apps:**
    *   **Functionality Breakdown:** Rocket.Chat Apps are extensions that can add new features and integrations. Apps can potentially make HTTP requests through Rocket.Chat's server-side APIs or utilize Rocket.Chat's functionalities.
    *   **SSRF Vulnerability Points:**
        *   **App Permissions and Capabilities:**  The permission model for Rocket.Chat Apps is critical. If apps are granted excessive permissions to make network requests or access Rocket.Chat's core functionalities without proper security controls, they could be exploited to perform SSRF attacks.
        *   **Vulnerabilities in App Code:**  If third-party apps contain vulnerabilities, including SSRF vulnerabilities in their own code, these could indirectly expose Rocket.Chat to SSRF risks.
        *   **App Installation and Review Process:**  The process for installing and reviewing Rocket.Chat Apps should include security checks to minimize the risk of malicious or vulnerable apps being deployed.

#### 4.4. General Considerations

*   **Underlying Libraries:**  The security of URL parsing and HTTP request libraries used by Rocket.Chat (e.g., Node.js `url` module, `node-fetch`, `axios`, etc.) is important.  Known vulnerabilities in these libraries could impact Rocket.Chat's SSRF defenses.
*   **Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention:**  Implementing rate limiting and other abuse prevention mechanisms for features that fetch external resources can help mitigate the impact of SSRF attacks and prevent them from being used for large-scale scanning or denial-of-service attacks.
*   **Logging and Monitoring:**  Comprehensive logging of external resource requests, including URLs, request origins, and responses, is essential for detecting and responding to potential SSRF attacks.

### 5. Mitigation Strategies (Reiteration and Expansion)

Based on the deep analysis, the following mitigation strategies are crucial for the development team:

*   **Strict URL Validation and Sanitization (Priority 1):**
    *   **Implement robust URL parsing and validation** for all features that handle external URLs.
    *   **Use a whitelist approach for allowed URL schemes:**  Strictly allow only `http://` and `https://` schemes.  Explicitly deny other schemes like `file://`, `gopher://`, `ftp://`, etc.
    *   **Validate hostnames:**  Implement checks to ensure hostnames resolve to public IP addresses and are not internal or reserved IP ranges (e.g., `127.0.0.0/8`, `10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`). Consider using libraries specifically designed for IP address and hostname validation.
    *   **Sanitize URLs:**  Encode or remove potentially dangerous characters from URLs before making requests.
    *   **Regularly review and update URL validation logic** to address new bypass techniques and vulnerabilities.

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement and enforce a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the origins from which the Rocket.Chat client can load resources. While CSP primarily protects the client-side, it can indirectly reduce the impact of SSRF by limiting the attacker's ability to exfiltrate data or execute client-side attacks if SSRF is used to inject malicious content.

*   **Disable or Restrict Link Previews (Configurable):**
    *   Provide administrators with the option to **disable link previews entirely** for environments where SSRF risk is a major concern.
    *   Offer granular controls to **restrict link previews based on user roles or message sources** (e.g., disable for untrusted users or external integrations).

*   **Isolate Rocket.Chat Server (Network Segmentation):**
    *   **Isolate the Rocket.Chat server** from direct access to sensitive internal networks and resources.
    *   **Implement network firewalls and access control lists (ACLs)** to restrict outbound traffic from the Rocket.Chat server to only necessary external services.
    *   **Consider using a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone)** to further isolate the Rocket.Chat server from the internal network.

*   **Secure HTTP Client Configuration:**
    *   **Disable or strictly control redirect following** in the HTTP client used for fetching external resources. If redirects are necessary, implement strict validation of redirect URLs.
    *   **Ensure sensitive credentials (cookies, authentication headers) are not inadvertently sent** in requests to external URLs.
    *   **Use a modern and well-maintained HTTP client library** and keep it updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

*   **Webhook Security:**
    *   **Restrict webhook configuration to authorized administrators only.**
    *   **Implement strict validation of webhook URLs** to prevent SSRF.
    *   **Consider using allowlists for webhook destination domains** if possible.
    *   **Regularly review and audit webhook configurations.**

*   **Rocket.Chat App Security:**
    *   **Implement a robust permission model for Rocket.Chat Apps** to control their access to network resources and Rocket.Chat functionalities.
    *   **Establish a thorough app review process** to identify and prevent the installation of malicious or vulnerable apps.
    *   **Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for app developers.**

*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, specifically focusing on SSRF vulnerabilities in the features outlined in this analysis.

*   **Security Awareness Training:**  Provide security awareness training to the development team on SSRF vulnerabilities, secure coding practices for handling external URLs, and the importance of input validation and output encoding.
