3.  **Security Control Mapping:** Map existing and recommended security controls from the design review to the identified threats and vulnerabilities.
4.  **Gap Analysis:** Identify gaps in existing security controls and areas where recommended controls are not yet implemented or may be insufficient.
5.  **Tailored Mitigation Strategies:** Develop specific, actionable, and tailored mitigation strategies for each identified threat, focusing on Rocket.Chat's architecture and functionalities. These strategies will be aligned with the recommended security controls and aim to enhance the overall security posture of the platform.
6.  **Prioritization:**  Implicitly prioritize recommendations based on the severity of the potential risks and the sensitivity of the data being protected, as outlined in the Risk Assessment section of the design review.

### 2. Security Implications of Key Components

This section breaks down the security implications of each key component of Rocket.Chat, based on the provided design review.

#### 2.1. User Types (Internal User, External User, Administrator)

**Security Implications:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:**  If access control is not properly implemented, internal or external users could potentially gain administrator privileges, leading to unauthorized access and system compromise.
*   **Data Leakage:** External users with overly permissive access could potentially access sensitive internal communication data.
*   **Account Compromise:** Compromised user accounts (especially administrator accounts) can lead to significant data breaches, service disruption, and reputational damage.
