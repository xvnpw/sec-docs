# Threat Model Analysis for rocketchat/rocket.chat

## Threat: [Weak Default Administrator Credentials](./threats/weak_default_administrator_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** If the Rocket.Chat administrator does not change the default credentials during initial setup, an attacker could guess or find these default credentials online. They could then log in as administrator.
*   **Impact:** Full administrative access to the Rocket.Chat instance. Attackers can create accounts, read all messages, modify settings, shut down the server, and potentially gain access to the underlying server operating system depending on the deployment environment.
*   **Affected Component:** Installation and Initial Setup Process
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Password Policy:** Enforce a strong password policy during initial setup and for all administrator accounts.
    *   **Mandatory Password Change:** Force administrators to change default passwords immediately upon first login.

## Threat: [Message Injection (XSS in Messages)](./threats/message_injection__xss_in_messages_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious message containing JavaScript code and sends it to other users in Rocket.Chat. If Rocket.Chat does not properly sanitize user input, this script will be executed in the browsers of users who view the message.
*   **Impact:**  Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. Attackers can steal user session cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, deface the Rocket.Chat interface, or perform actions on behalf of the victim user, such as sending messages or modifying user profiles.
*   **Affected Component:** Message Rendering and Display Module, Client-Side Application (Browser/Desktop Client)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content, especially messages, on the server-side before storing and displaying them.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.

## Threat: [NoSQL Injection (MongoDB Specific)](./threats/nosql_injection__mongodb_specific_.md)

*   **Description:** If Rocket.Chat's backend code does not properly sanitize user inputs when constructing MongoDB queries, an attacker could inject malicious NoSQL queries. This could allow them to bypass authentication, access unauthorized data, modify data, or even potentially execute commands on the MongoDB server.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to sensitive information (messages, user data, settings), data manipulation, and potentially server compromise if the attacker can execute commands on the database server.
*   **Affected Component:**  Data Access Layer, MongoDB Query Construction
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:** Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for all database interactions to prevent injection.
    *   **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in database queries.

## Threat: [Malicious Third-Party Apps/Integrations](./threats/malicious_third-party_appsintegrations.md)

*   **Description:** A user installs a malicious or vulnerable third-party app or integration from the Rocket.Chat marketplace or an external source. This app could contain malicious code or vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise the Rocket.Chat instance or user data.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, malware distribution through Rocket.Chat, denial of service, unauthorized access to Rocket.Chat functionality, and potentially compromise of the server or user devices depending on the app's permissions and vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected Component:** Apps/Integrations Framework, Rocket.Chat Marketplace
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **App Vetting and Security Reviews:** Implement a rigorous vetting and security review process for all apps in the official Rocket.Chat marketplace.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Apps:**  Implement a granular permission system for apps, allowing users to grant only necessary permissions and review requested permissions before installation.

## Threat: [Command Injection through Integrations/Bots](./threats/command_injection_through_integrationsbots.md)

*   **Description:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in a custom integration or bot connected to Rocket.Chat. This vulnerability allows them to inject operating system commands that are then executed by the Rocket.Chat server or the bot's execution environment.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, and potentially lateral movement to other systems on the network. The attacker could gain full control of the server or the bot's environment.
*   **Affected Component:** Integrations/Bots API, Custom Script Execution Environment
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Sanitization for Integrations/Bots:**  Thoroughly sanitize all input received from integrations and bots before processing or executing commands.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Integrations/Bots:** Run integrations and bots with the minimum necessary privileges.

## Threat: [Insecure Storage of Sensitive Data](./threats/insecure_storage_of_sensitive_data.md)

*   **Description:** Rocket.Chat stores sensitive data, such as user credentials, API keys, or message content, in an insecure manner, for example, in plaintext or with weak encryption in the database or logs.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches and exposure of sensitive information if the database or storage is compromised. Attackers could gain access to user accounts, private conversations, and potentially other systems if API keys are exposed.
*   **Affected Component:** Data Storage (Database, Logs), User Management Module
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Encryption at Rest:** Encrypt sensitive data at rest in the database and backups using strong encryption algorithms.
    *   **Secure Key Management:** Implement secure key management practices for encryption keys.

## Threat: [Lack of Security Updates and Patching](./threats/lack_of_security_updates_and_patching.md)

*   **Description:** The Rocket.Chat administrator fails to regularly apply security updates and patches released by the Rocket.Chat development team. This leaves known vulnerabilities in the Rocket.Chat instance exposed to attackers.
*   **Impact:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities, potentially leading to various security breaches, including remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:**  Entire Rocket.Chat Application and Underlying System
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Establish a Patch Management Process:** Implement a formal patch management process to regularly monitor for and apply security updates and patches for Rocket.Chat and its dependencies.
    *   **Security Monitoring and Vulnerability Scanning:** Regularly monitor security advisories and use vulnerability scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the Rocket.Chat instance.
