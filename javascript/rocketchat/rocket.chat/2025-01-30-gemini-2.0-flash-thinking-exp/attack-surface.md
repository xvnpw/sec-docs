# Attack Surface Analysis for rocketchat/rocket.chat

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Injection of malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
*   **Rocket.Chat Contribution:** Rocket.Chat's features for rich content in messages, usernames, channel names, and custom fields, along with Markdown rendering and custom integrations, can introduce XSS vulnerabilities if input sanitization is insufficient.
*   **Example:** A user crafts a message containing malicious JavaScript code disguised within a link. When another user views this message in Rocket.Chat, the script executes in their browser, potentially stealing session cookies and compromising their account.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of Rocket.Chat interface, redirection to phishing sites, potential for further attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement rigorous input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content within Rocket.Chat.
        *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the sources from which browsers can load resources, reducing XSS impact.
        *   Keep Rocket.Chat updated to the latest version to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Employ a secure and regularly updated Markdown parser.
        *   Conduct frequent security audits and penetration testing, specifically targeting XSS vulnerabilities in Rocket.Chat.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **Description:** Inducing the Rocket.Chat server to make requests to unintended locations, potentially internal resources or external services.
*   **Rocket.Chat Contribution:** Rocket.Chat's link preview functionality, custom avatar URLs, and integrations (webhooks, apps) involve fetching external resources. Weak URL validation in these features can lead to SSRF vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** An attacker sends a message with a malicious link. When Rocket.Chat attempts to generate a link preview, it is tricked into making a request to an internal server hosting sensitive data, potentially exposing that data to the attacker.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal network resources, information disclosure of sensitive internal data, potential for further attacks on internal systems through the Rocket.Chat server.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strict URL validation and sanitization for all Rocket.Chat features that fetch external resources.
        *   Use a whitelist of allowed domains or protocols for external requests initiated by Rocket.Chat.
        *   Consider disabling or restricting link previews for untrusted sources within Rocket.Chat configurations.
        *   Isolate the Rocket.Chat server from direct access to sensitive internal networks where feasible.
        *   Regularly review and secure configurations of Rocket.Chat integrations to prevent SSRF.

## Attack Surface: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_surfaces/authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Circumventing Rocket.Chat's intended authentication mechanisms to gain unauthorized access.
*   **Rocket.Chat Contribution:** Rocket.Chat offers various authentication methods (local, OAuth, LDAP, SAML). Vulnerabilities in Rocket.Chat's implementation of these methods, session management, or password reset flows can lead to authentication bypass.
*   **Example:** A flaw in Rocket.Chat's OAuth integration allows an attacker to manipulate the authentication flow and gain administrative access to Rocket.Chat without valid administrator credentials.
*   **Impact:** Full account compromise, unauthorized access to sensitive Rocket.Chat data and administrative functions, ability to perform actions as any user, complete system compromise in severe cases.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust and secure authentication mechanisms within Rocket.Chat, adhering to security best practices.
        *   Thoroughly test all authentication flows in Rocket.Chat, including password reset, OAuth, and SSO configurations.
        *   Regularly update Rocket.Chat's authentication libraries and dependencies.
        *   Enforce strong password policies and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Rocket.Chat users.
        *   Implement secure session management practices within Rocket.Chat to prevent session fixation or hijacking.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in API](./attack_surfaces/insecure_direct_object_reference__idor__in_api.md)

*   **Description:** Accessing Rocket.Chat objects (data, files, functionalities) directly by manipulating their identifiers in API requests without proper authorization checks within Rocket.Chat's API.
*   **Rocket.Chat Contribution:** Rocket.Chat's API exposes various functionalities and data. Insufficient authorization checks in Rocket.Chat API endpoints can lead to IDOR vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** Rocket.Chat's API allows downloading files using a file ID. If the API lacks proper authorization checks to verify if the requesting user is permitted to access that specific file ID, an attacker could potentially access and download private files from Rocket.Chat by guessing or iterating through file IDs.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within Rocket.Chat, privilege escalation within Rocket.Chat, potential data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong authorization checks in all Rocket.Chat API endpoints, verifying user permissions for each object accessed.
        *   Avoid exposing internal object IDs directly in Rocket.Chat API requests. Use indirect references or Access Control Lists (ACLs) within the API.
        *   Conduct comprehensive authorization testing for all Rocket.Chat API endpoints.
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when designing API access controls in Rocket.Chat.
