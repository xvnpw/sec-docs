    ArtifactRepo --> DeploymentEnv("Deployment Environment")
```

Build Process Description:

The build process for Rocket.Chat typically involves the following stages, often automated using a CI/CD pipeline:

1. Developer commits code changes to a Version Control System (VCS) like GitHub.
2. The CI/CD pipeline is triggered automatically upon code commits or pull requests.
3. Build Stage:
    - Source code is retrieved from the VCS.
    - Dependencies are downloaded and managed.
    - Application code is compiled and packaged into build artifacts (e.g., Docker images, JavaScript bundles).
4. Test Stage:
    - Automated unit tests, integration tests, and functional tests are executed to ensure code quality and functionality.
5. Security Scan Stage:
    - Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are used to analyze the source code for potential vulnerabilities.
    - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools are used to scan the running application for vulnerabilities.
    - Dependency vulnerability scanning is performed to identify vulnerable dependencies.
    - Linters and code quality checks are executed.
6. Publish Stage:
    - Build artifacts that pass all tests and security checks are published to an Artifact Repository (e.g., Docker Registry, npm registry).
    - Release notes and changelogs are generated.
7. Deployment Environment:
    - The deployment process retrieves the build artifacts from the Artifact Repository and deploys them to the target environment (e.g., cloud infrastructure, on-premises servers).

- What is the specific deployment environment (cloud provider, on-premises)?
- What are the specific compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)?
- What is the organization's risk appetite?
- Are there any existing security policies or standards that need to be followed?
- What are the specific integrations with other systems beyond LDAP/AD, Email, and Push Notifications?
- What is the expected user base size and growth?

Assumptions:
- The project is intended for organizational use, requiring a focus on security and compliance.
- The deployment will be in a cloud environment for scalability and availability.
- Security is a high priority for the project, given the nature of communication data.
- Standard security best practices for web applications and cloud deployments are applicable.
