# Threat Model Analysis for rocketchat/rocket.chat

## Threat: [Unauthorized Access to Direct Messages (E2EE Bypass)](./threats/unauthorized_access_to_direct_messages__e2ee_bypass_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Rocket.Chat's End-to-End Encryption (E2EE) implementation or key management to gain access to the plaintext content of direct messages. This could involve compromising the server, intercepting key exchange, or exploiting client-side vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach; sensitive information exchanged in direct messages is exposed to the attacker.
*   **Affected Component:** E2EE module (`rocketchat-e2e`), key management functions, client-side encryption/decryption logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct independent security audits of the E2EE implementation.
    *   **Keep Rocket.Chat Updated:** Apply security patches promptly to address any discovered vulnerabilities in the E2EE module.
    *   **Secure Key Management:** Implement robust key management practices, including secure storage and distribution of keys.
    *   **Client-Side Security:** Educate users on best practices for securing their devices and browsers.
    *   **Consider Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):** For extremely sensitive deployments, consider using HSMs to protect encryption keys.

## Threat: [Integration Abuse (Malicious Webhook)](./threats/integration_abuse__malicious_webhook_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious payload and sends it to a misconfigured or vulnerable Rocket.Chat webhook endpoint.  The attacker might exploit a lack of input validation or authentication to trigger unintended actions, such as creating users, deleting channels, or exfiltrating data.
*   **Impact:** Data modification, data exfiltration, denial of service, potential server compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Webhook integration module (`rocketchat-integrations`), specific webhook configurations, potentially custom scripts associated with the webhook.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all data received from webhooks.  Use a whitelist approach whenever possible.
    *   **Authentication:**  Require authentication for all webhook endpoints (e.g., using API keys or shared secrets).  Verify webhook signatures if supported by the sending service.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Grant webhooks only the minimum necessary permissions.  Avoid granting administrative privileges.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting to prevent an attacker from flooding the webhook endpoint.
    *   **Regular Review:**  Periodically review and disable unused or unnecessary webhooks.

## Threat: [Bot Account Takeover](./threats/bot_account_takeover.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains control of a Rocket.Chat bot account, either by compromising the bot's credentials or by exploiting a vulnerability in the bot's code. The attacker then uses the bot to send spam, phish users, exfiltrate data, or disrupt service.
*   **Impact:** Reputational damage, data leakage, phishing attacks, denial of service.
*   **Affected Component:** Bot integration module (`rocketchat-bots`), specific bot configurations, bot authentication mechanisms.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Credentials:**  Use strong, unique passwords or API keys for bot accounts.
    *   **Secure Storage:**  Store bot credentials securely (e.g., using environment variables or a secrets management system).  Never hardcode credentials in the bot's code.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Grant bots only the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly review bot activity and permissions.
    *   **Code Review:**  Thoroughly review the code of any custom bots before deploying them.
    *   **Monitor for Anomalous Behavior:** Implement monitoring to detect unusual bot activity, such as sending a large number of messages or accessing sensitive channels.

## Threat: [Livechat Agent Impersonation](./threats/livechat_agent_impersonation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a Livechat agent's account (e.g., through phishing or password reuse) and impersonates the agent to interact with customers.  The attacker could gather sensitive information from customers, provide false information, or damage the organization's reputation.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach, reputational damage, potential legal liability.
*   **Affected Component:** Livechat module (`rocketchat-livechat`), agent authentication mechanisms, session management.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication:**  Enforce strong passwords and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for Livechat agents.
    *   **Session Management:**  Implement short session timeouts and monitor for suspicious login activity.
    *   **User Education:**  Train agents on phishing awareness and secure password practices.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly review agent activity and permissions.
    *   **IP Whitelisting:** If feasible, restrict agent logins to specific IP addresses.

## Threat: [Malicious App Installation (Apps Engine)](./threats/malicious_app_installation__apps_engine_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious app to the Rocket.Chat Marketplace or convinces an administrator to install a malicious app from an untrusted source. The app contains code that exfiltrates data, modifies system settings, or performs other harmful actions.
*   **Impact:** Data exfiltration, system compromise, denial of service, reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Apps Engine (`rocketchat-apps-engine`), app installation process, app sandboxing mechanisms (if any).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **App Vetting:**  Thoroughly vet apps before installation, reviewing their code, permissions, and developer reputation.
    *   **Permission Review:**  Carefully review the permissions requested by apps before granting them.
    *   **Sandboxing:**  If possible, run apps in a sandboxed environment to limit their access to the Rocket.Chat server.
    *   **Private App Repository:**  Consider using a private app repository to control which apps can be installed.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Apps Engine and installed apps up to date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Disable Unused Apps:** Disable or uninstall any apps that are not actively used.

## Threat: [LDAP Injection in Authentication](./threats/ldap_injection_in_authentication.md)

*   **Description:** If Rocket.Chat is configured to use LDAP for authentication, an attacker might attempt to inject malicious LDAP queries to bypass authentication, enumerate users, or potentially gain unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Authentication bypass, unauthorized access, information disclosure.
*   **Affected Component:** LDAP authentication module (`rocketchat-ldap`), LDAP configuration settings.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all user input used in LDAP queries.  Use parameterized queries or LDAP escaping functions.
    *   **Least Privilege:**  Configure the LDAP service account used by Rocket.Chat with the minimum necessary permissions.
    *   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly review LDAP configuration and logs.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Conduct penetration testing to specifically target the LDAP integration.
