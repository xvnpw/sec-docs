## Attack Tree Path: [Goal: Gain Unauthorized Access/Control of Rocket.Chat {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/goal_gain_unauthorized_accesscontrol_of_rocket_chat_{critical}.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker is to gain illegitimate access to the Rocket.Chat system and/or control over its functionality. This could involve accessing private messages, user data, files, or even taking control of the server itself.
*   **Criticality:** This is the central point of the entire threat model. All attack paths converge here.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Successful achievement of this goal leads to a complete compromise of the Rocket.Chat instance and potentially the application using it.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_exploit_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves the attacker leveraging security weaknesses in the Rocket.Chat software or its dependencies.
*   **Why High Risk:** Vulnerabilities are a common and effective attack vector, especially when exploit code is publicly available.

    *   **Attack Vector: Known CVEs [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities with assigned Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) identifiers.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium. CVEs are publicly known, and exploit code is often available.
        *   **Impact:** High. Can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, or other severe consequences.
        *   **Effort:** Low. Exploit code is often readily available, reducing the effort required.
        *   **Skill Level:** Low. Pre-built exploits lower the skill barrier.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Vulnerability scanners can detect known CVEs, but timely patching is essential.

    *   **Attack Vector: Unpatched Server/Client [HIGH RISK]**
        *   **Description:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in outdated versions of the Rocket.Chat server software, client applications, or underlying dependencies (even if a formal CVE hasn't been assigned).
        *   **Likelihood:** High. Many systems are not updated promptly, leaving them vulnerable.
        *   **Impact:** High. Similar to known CVEs, unpatched software can lead to complete compromise.
        *   **Effort:** Low. Attackers can often find vulnerable systems through scanning or by identifying outdated software versions.
        *   **Skill Level:** Low. The required skill level depends on the specific vulnerability, but many are easily exploitable.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (if actively looking). Outdated software can be detected through version checks and vulnerability scanning.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path: Abuse Misconfiguration [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_abuse_misconfiguration__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This path involves the attacker taking advantage of incorrect or insecure configurations of the Rocket.Chat system.
*   **Why High Risk:** Misconfigurations are common and often provide easy entry points for attackers.

    *   **Attack Vector: Weak/Default Credentials [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}**
        *   **Description:** Using default administrator passwords, easily guessable passwords, or weak passwords for any Rocket.Chat account (admin, users, database connections).
        *   **Likelihood:** High. Default credentials are often unchanged, and weak passwords are a prevalent issue.
        *   **Impact:** Very High. Provides direct access to the system, often with administrative privileges.
        *   **Effort:** Very Low. Requires minimal effort to try default credentials or common passwords.
        *   **Skill Level:** Very Low. No specialized skills are needed.
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (if auditing). Credential stuffing attacks might be detected through failed login attempts, but successful logins with default credentials are harder to spot without specific auditing.
        *   **Criticality:** This is a critical node because it's a frequent point of failure and a gateway to further attacks. Weak credentials can be leveraged to exploit other vulnerabilities or gain access to sensitive data.
