Okay, here's a deep analysis of the LDAP Injection threat for Rocket.Chat, structured as requested:

## Deep Analysis: LDAP Injection in Rocket.Chat Authentication

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**1.1 Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the LDAP Injection vulnerability within the context of Rocket.Chat, identify specific attack vectors, assess the effectiveness of proposed mitigations, and provide actionable recommendations to minimize the risk.  We aim to go beyond a superficial understanding and delve into the technical details of how such an attack could be executed and how to prevent it.

**1.2 Scope:**

This analysis focuses specifically on the LDAP Injection vulnerability as it pertains to Rocket.Chat's authentication mechanism.  The scope includes:

*   The `rocketchat-ldap` package and its interaction with the core Rocket.Chat application.
*   LDAP configuration settings within Rocket.Chat.
*   User input points that are used in constructing LDAP queries.
*   The interaction between Rocket.Chat and the configured LDAP server (e.g., Active Directory, OpenLDAP).
*   The effectiveness of input validation, sanitization, and least privilege principles in mitigating the threat.
*   Review of relevant source code snippets (where accessible and permissible).

This analysis *excludes* vulnerabilities in the LDAP server itself (e.g., misconfigurations or exploits targeting the LDAP service directly), except insofar as Rocket.Chat's configuration might exacerbate those vulnerabilities.  It also excludes other authentication methods (e.g., OAuth, SAML) unless they interact with the LDAP authentication flow.

**1.3 Methodology:**

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

*   **Threat Modeling Review:**  Re-examine the existing threat model entry for LDAP Injection, expanding upon it with more technical detail.
*   **Code Review (Static Analysis):**  Analyze the relevant source code of the `rocketchat-ldap` package (available on GitHub) to identify potential vulnerabilities and assess the implementation of security controls.  This will involve searching for:
    *   Direct concatenation of user input into LDAP queries.
    *   Use of insecure LDAP library functions.
    *   Lack of input validation or sanitization.
    *   Improper error handling that might leak information.
*   **Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**  Describe how dynamic analysis (e.g., penetration testing) could be performed to identify and exploit LDAP Injection vulnerabilities.  This will include specific attack payloads and expected results.  We will *not* perform actual dynamic testing against a live system without explicit authorization.
*   **Mitigation Verification:**  Evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies (input validation, least privilege, audits, penetration testing) by analyzing how they address the identified attack vectors.
*   **Best Practices Research:**  Consult industry best practices and security guidelines for secure LDAP integration (e.g., OWASP, NIST) to ensure that the recommendations align with current standards.

### 2. Deep Analysis of the Threat: LDAP Injection

**2.1 Attack Vectors and Scenarios:**

LDAP Injection attacks exploit vulnerabilities in how an application constructs LDAP queries based on user-supplied input.  Here are some specific attack vectors relevant to Rocket.Chat:

*   **Authentication Bypass:**
    *   **Scenario:**  An attacker crafts a malicious username or password that, when incorporated into the LDAP search filter, always evaluates to true.
    *   **Example Payload (Username):**  `*)(|(objectClass=*))`
        *   **Explanation:** This payload attempts to inject an "OR" condition that always matches any object.  If the application directly inserts this into a filter like `(&(uid=<username>)(userPassword=<password>))`, the resulting filter becomes `(&(uid=*)(|(objectClass=*)))(userPassword=<password>))`, effectively bypassing the username check.
    *   **Example Payload (Password):**  `*` (or a more complex filter)
        *   **Explanation:**  A simple `*` might bypass password checks if the application doesn't properly handle wildcards in the password field.  More complex filters could be injected here as well.
*   **User Enumeration:**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker uses specially crafted input to determine valid usernames within the LDAP directory.
    *   **Example Payload (Username):** `admin)(&(objectClass=*)(uid=*`
        *   **Explanation:** This attempts to "guess" the username "admin".  By observing the application's response (e.g., error message, timing difference), the attacker can infer whether the username exists.  The attacker can then iterate through different usernames.
*   **Information Disclosure:**
    *   **Scenario:** An attacker injects LDAP queries to retrieve attributes of other users or sensitive information from the LDAP directory.
    *   **Example Payload (Username):** `*)(objectClass=user)(|(sn=*)(givenName=*))`
        *   **Explanation:** This attempts to retrieve all user objects and their `sn` (surname) and `givenName` attributes.  The specific attributes that can be retrieved depend on the LDAP schema and the permissions of the Rocket.Chat service account.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**
    *   **Scenario:**  While less likely to be the primary goal, an attacker *could* potentially craft a very complex LDAP query that consumes excessive resources on the LDAP server, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **Example Payload:**  A deeply nested and recursive LDAP filter.

**2.2 Code Review (Conceptual - based on common vulnerabilities):**

Without direct access to the *exact* current codebase, we'll illustrate potential vulnerabilities based on common mistakes:

**Vulnerable Code Example (Hypothetical):**

```javascript
// rocketchat-ldap/server/auth.js (HYPOTHETICAL)

function authenticate(username, password) {
  const ldapClient = getLdapClient(); // Assume this gets a configured client
  const baseDN = 'ou=users,dc=example,dc=com';
  const filter = `(&(uid=${username})(userPassword=${password}))`; // DANGEROUS!

  ldapClient.search(baseDN, { filter: filter }, (err, res) => {
    // ... handle results ...
  });
}
```

**Explanation of Vulnerability:**

The `filter` variable is constructed by directly concatenating the `username` and `password` variables into the LDAP query string.  This is the classic LDAP Injection vulnerability.  An attacker can inject arbitrary LDAP syntax into these variables, as demonstrated in the attack vectors above.

**Secure Code Example (Hypothetical):**

```javascript
// rocketchat-ldap/server/auth.js (HYPOTHETICAL - IMPROVED)

const { escape } = require('ldap-escape'); // Or a similar library

function authenticate(username, password) {
  const ldapClient = getLdapClient();
  const baseDN = 'ou=users,dc=example,dc=com';
  const escapedUsername = escape.filter(username);
  const escapedPassword = escape.filter(password); // Even passwords should be escaped!
  const filter = `(&(uid=${escapedUsername})(userPassword=${escapedPassword}))`;

  ldapClient.search(baseDN, { filter: filter }, (err, res) => {
    // ... handle results ...
  });
}
```

**Explanation of Improvement:**

This improved example uses an `ldap-escape` library (or a similar library providing LDAP escaping functions) to sanitize the `username` and `password` inputs.  The `escape.filter()` function properly escapes special characters in the input, preventing them from being interpreted as LDAP syntax.  This effectively neutralizes the injection attacks.  Alternatively, parameterized queries (if supported by the LDAP client library) would be even better.

**2.3 Dynamic Analysis (Conceptual):**

Dynamic analysis would involve sending crafted LDAP payloads to a Rocket.Chat instance configured with LDAP authentication.  Here's how it would be approached:

1.  **Setup:**  Configure a test Rocket.Chat instance with a test LDAP server (e.g., OpenLDAP or a mock LDAP server).  Ensure the LDAP service account has limited permissions.
2.  **Tools:**  Use tools like:
    *   **Burp Suite:**  To intercept and modify HTTP requests between the browser and Rocket.Chat.
    *   **Custom Scripts:**  (Python, etc.) to automate the sending of various payloads.
    *   **LDAP Browser:**  (e.g., Apache Directory Studio) to directly interact with the LDAP server and observe the effects of the queries.
3.  **Testing:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:**  Attempt to log in with payloads like `*)(|(objectClass=*))` as the username and various passwords.  Success would be indicated by successful authentication despite an invalid username.
    *   **User Enumeration:**  Send payloads designed to elicit different responses based on whether a username exists.  Look for variations in error messages, response times, or HTTP status codes.
    *   **Information Disclosure:**  Attempt to retrieve user attributes by injecting queries that request specific attributes.  Success would be indicated by the retrieval of user data.
    *   **Monitor LDAP Server Logs:**  Observe the LDAP server logs to see the actual queries being executed.  This can help identify the exact point of injection and the effectiveness of mitigations.

**2.4 Mitigation Verification:**

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  The most critical mitigation.  As demonstrated in the secure code example, using LDAP escaping functions (or parameterized queries) is essential to prevent the injection of malicious LDAP syntax.  This should be applied to *all* user inputs used in LDAP queries, including usernames, passwords, and any other search fields.
*   **Least Privilege:**  The LDAP service account used by Rocket.Chat should have only the minimum necessary permissions.  It should *not* have write access to the directory, and its read access should be restricted to only the attributes required for authentication and user synchronization.  This limits the impact of a successful injection attack.
*   **Regular Audits:**  Regularly review the LDAP configuration within Rocket.Chat and the permissions of the service account.  Examine LDAP server logs for suspicious queries.
*   **Penetration Testing:**  As described in the dynamic analysis section, penetration testing is crucial to identify any remaining vulnerabilities that might have been missed during code review.

**2.5 Best Practices:**

*   **OWASP LDAP Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet:**  Follow the recommendations in the OWASP cheat sheet for preventing LDAP injection.
*   **Use a Robust LDAP Library:**  Choose a well-maintained and secure LDAP client library for Node.js.
*   **Implement Strong Password Policies:**  Enforce strong password policies on the LDAP server to make brute-force attacks more difficult.
*   **Monitor for Security Updates:**  Keep Rocket.Chat and the `rocketchat-ldap` package up to date to ensure that any security patches are applied promptly.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Consider using a WAF to help detect and block LDAP injection attempts at the network level.  However, a WAF should be considered a secondary layer of defense, not a replacement for secure coding practices.

### 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

LDAP Injection is a serious vulnerability that can lead to authentication bypass, unauthorized access, and information disclosure.  The primary recommendation is to **implement robust input validation and sanitization using LDAP escaping functions or parameterized queries** in the `rocketchat-ldap` package.  This, combined with the principle of least privilege for the LDAP service account, will significantly reduce the risk.  Regular audits and penetration testing are also essential to ensure the ongoing security of the LDAP integration.  The development team should prioritize addressing this vulnerability with the highest urgency.
