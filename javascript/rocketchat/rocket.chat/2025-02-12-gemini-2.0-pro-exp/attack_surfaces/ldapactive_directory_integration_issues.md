# Deep Analysis: LDAP/Active Directory Integration Issues in Rocket.Chat

## 1. Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, assess, and propose mitigations for vulnerabilities related to Rocket.Chat's integration with LDAP and Active Directory (AD) services.  This analysis focuses specifically on the security of Rocket.Chat's *implementation* of the integration, not the security of the LDAP/AD server itself (although secure configuration of the server is a prerequisite for overall security).  We aim to prevent authentication bypass, privilege escalation, and unauthorized data access stemming from flaws in Rocket.Chat's LDAP handling.

## 2. Scope

This analysis covers the following aspects of Rocket.Chat's LDAP/AD integration:

*   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  How Rocket.Chat handles user-supplied data that is incorporated into LDAP queries. This includes data from login forms, user profile updates, and any other feature that interacts with the LDAP integration.
*   **LDAP Query Construction:**  The specific methods used by Rocket.Chat to build LDAP queries.  This includes examining the use of string concatenation, parameterized queries (or their absence), and the use of LDAP libraries.
*   **Error Handling:** How Rocket.Chat handles errors returned by the LDAP server, ensuring that error messages do not leak sensitive information or create opportunities for exploitation.
*   **Configuration Options:**  The security-relevant configuration options provided by Rocket.Chat for LDAP integration, such as LDAPS support, certificate validation, and authentication mechanisms.
*   **Authentication and Authorization Logic:**  How Rocket.Chat uses the results of LDAP queries to authenticate users and determine their authorization levels within the application.  This includes checking for proper group membership validation and handling of edge cases.
*   **Session Management:** How sessions are managed after successful LDAP authentication, ensuring that session tokens are securely generated, stored, and validated.
* **Code Review:** Review of relevant sections of the Rocket.Chat codebase (https://github.com/rocketchat/rocket.chat) responsible for LDAP integration.

This analysis *excludes* the following:

*   Security of the LDAP/AD server itself (e.g., password policies, network segmentation).
*   General Rocket.Chat vulnerabilities unrelated to LDAP integration.
*   Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks against the LDAP server (although Rocket.Chat should have safeguards against excessive LDAP requests).

## 3. Methodology

The following methodologies will be employed:

1.  **Code Review:**  A manual review of the Rocket.Chat source code (specifically, files related to LDAP authentication and user management) will be conducted to identify potential vulnerabilities.  We will search for:
    *   Direct string concatenation in LDAP query construction.
    *   Lack of input validation or sanitization before using data in LDAP queries.
    *   Improper use of LDAP libraries.
    *   Insecure configuration defaults.
    *   Insufficient error handling.
    *   Logic flaws in authentication and authorization.

2.  **Static Analysis:** Automated static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube, Semgrep, ESLint with security plugins) will be used to scan the codebase for potential security issues related to LDAP integration.  These tools can identify common coding patterns that lead to vulnerabilities.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Fuzzing techniques will be used to test the Rocket.Chat LDAP integration with a variety of malformed and unexpected inputs.  This will help identify vulnerabilities that might be missed by static analysis and code review.  A fuzzer will generate a large number of inputs, including:
    *   Special characters commonly used in LDAP injection attacks (e.g., `*`, `(`, `)`, `&`, `|`, `!`, `=`, `<`, `>`).
    *   Long strings.
    *   Unicode characters.
    *   Empty strings.
    *   Invalid LDAP attribute names and values.

4.  **Penetration Testing (Simulated Attacks):**  Manual penetration testing will be performed to simulate real-world attacks against the LDAP integration.  This will include attempts to:
    *   Bypass authentication using LDAP injection.
    *   Escalate privileges by manipulating LDAP group memberships.
    *   Retrieve sensitive user information from the LDAP directory.
    *   Cause denial of service by sending malformed requests.

5.  **Configuration Review:**  The available configuration options for LDAP integration within Rocket.Chat will be reviewed to ensure that secure defaults are used and that administrators have the ability to configure the integration securely.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the Attack Surface

This section details the specific attack vectors and vulnerabilities related to Rocket.Chat's LDAP/AD integration.

### 4.1. LDAP Injection

**Description:**  LDAP injection is the primary concern.  If Rocket.Chat constructs LDAP queries by directly concatenating user-supplied input without proper sanitization or escaping, an attacker can inject malicious LDAP filters to alter the query's logic.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Login Form:**  The username and password fields are the most obvious targets.  An attacker could enter a crafted username like `*)(|(objectClass=*))` to bypass authentication.
*   **User Search:**  If Rocket.Chat allows users to search the LDAP directory, the search input field is vulnerable.
*   **Group Management:**  If Rocket.Chat allows administrators to manage group memberships via LDAP, the group name and user ID fields are potential targets.
*   **Any User Input Used in LDAP Queries:**  Any feature that takes user input and uses it, even indirectly, in an LDAP query is a potential attack vector.

**Code Review Focus:**

*   Identify all instances where `ldap.search()`, `ldap.bind()`, or similar functions are called.
*   Examine how the filter string is constructed.  Look for string concatenation using `+` or template literals without proper escaping.
*   Check for the use of parameterized queries or LDAP library functions that automatically handle escaping.  Examples (depending on the library used):
    *   `ldap.filter.escape()` (node-ldap)
    *   Prepared statements (if using a lower-level LDAP library)

**Example (Vulnerable Code - Hypothetical):**

```javascript
// VULNERABLE CODE - DO NOT USE
const username = req.body.username; // User input
const filter = `(uid=${username})`; // Direct concatenation - VULNERABLE
ldapClient.search('ou=users,dc=example,dc=com', { filter: filter }, (err, res) => {
  // ...
});
```

**Example (Secure Code - Using Parameterization):**

```javascript
// SECURE CODE - Using node-ldap's escape function
const { escape } = require('ldapjs').filter;
const username = req.body.username; // User input
const filter = `(uid=${escape(username)})`; // Escaped input - SECURE
ldapClient.search('ou=users,dc=example,dc=com', { filter: filter }, (err, res) => {
  // ...
});
```
Or, using a placeholder:
```javascript
const username = req.body.username;
const filter = `(uid=$1)`;
ldapClient.search('ou=users,dc=example,dc=com', { filter: filter, attributes: [], values: [username]}, (err, res) => {
  // ...
});
```

**Mitigation:**

*   **Use Parameterized Queries:**  This is the most robust solution.  LDAP libraries often provide mechanisms for parameterized queries, similar to SQL prepared statements.
*   **Escape User Input:**  If parameterized queries are not available, use a dedicated LDAP escaping function provided by the LDAP library to sanitize user input *before* incorporating it into the filter string.  *Never* rely on general-purpose string escaping functions (e.g., for HTML or SQL).
*   **Input Validation:**  Implement strict input validation to restrict the characters allowed in usernames and other fields used in LDAP queries.  This can reduce the attack surface, but it should *not* be the sole defense.

### 4.2. Insufficient Authentication and Authorization

**Description:**  Even if LDAP injection is prevented, flaws in how Rocket.Chat uses the LDAP query results can lead to vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Incorrect Group Membership Checks:**  If Rocket.Chat relies on LDAP group membership for authorization, it must correctly verify that the authenticated user belongs to the required groups.  An attacker might try to manipulate group names or exploit flaws in the group membership check logic.
*   **Empty Password Binding:** Some LDAP servers allow binding with an empty password for certain accounts. Rocket.Chat must explicitly disallow this.
*   **Trusting Unverified Attributes:** Rocket.Chat should not blindly trust attributes returned by the LDAP server without proper validation. For example, an attacker might try to modify their `isAdmin` attribute (if such an attribute exists) to gain administrative privileges.
* **Referral Handling:** If referrals are enabled, Rocket.Chat must handle them securely, avoiding loops or connections to untrusted LDAP servers.

**Code Review Focus:**

*   Examine the code that processes the results of `ldap.bind()` and `ldap.search()`.
*   Check how group membership is verified.  Look for hardcoded group names or insecure comparisons.
*   Verify that empty passwords are not allowed.
*   Ensure that attributes used for authorization are validated.
*   Review referral handling logic.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Robust Group Membership Checks:**  Use secure methods to verify group membership, such as comparing distinguished names (DNs) or using LDAP search filters that specifically check for membership.
*   **Disallow Empty Passwords:**  Explicitly reject authentication attempts with empty passwords.
*   **Attribute Validation:**  Validate any attributes used for authorization, ensuring they conform to expected formats and values.
*   **Secure Referral Handling:**  Disable referrals if not needed. If needed, configure them securely, limiting the scope of referrals and validating the target servers.

### 4.3. Insecure Configuration

**Description:**  Misconfiguration of Rocket.Chat's LDAP settings can expose the application to attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unencrypted Connections (LDAP instead of LDAPS):**  Using unencrypted LDAP connections allows attackers to eavesdrop on communication between Rocket.Chat and the LDAP server, capturing usernames, passwords, and other sensitive data.
*   **Invalid Certificate Validation:**  If LDAPS is used, but Rocket.Chat is configured to skip certificate validation, an attacker can perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
*   **Weak Authentication Mechanisms:**  Using weak authentication mechanisms (e.g., simple bind without a password) can expose the LDAP server to attacks.
*   **Overly Permissive Search Base:**  Using a broad search base (e.g., the root of the directory) can expose more information than necessary.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:**  The absence of rate limiting on LDAP authentication attempts can allow attackers to perform brute-force attacks against user accounts.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Enforce LDAPS:**  Always use LDAPS (LDAP over TLS/SSL) to encrypt communication.
*   **Validate Certificates:**  Configure Rocket.Chat to properly validate the LDAP server's certificate.
*   **Use Strong Authentication:**  Use strong authentication mechanisms, such as SASL (Simple Authentication and Security Layer) with appropriate mechanisms (e.g., GSSAPI, DIGEST-MD5).
*   **Restrict Search Base:**  Use the most specific search base possible to limit the scope of LDAP queries.
*   **Implement Rate Limiting:**  Implement rate limiting on LDAP authentication attempts to prevent brute-force attacks.  This should be done both within Rocket.Chat and, ideally, on the LDAP server itself.

### 4.4. Error Handling

**Description:**  Improper error handling can leak sensitive information about the LDAP server or the directory structure.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Detailed Error Messages:**  Returning detailed LDAP error messages to the user can reveal information about the LDAP server's configuration, attribute names, and object classes.
*   **Distinguishable Error Responses:**  Different error responses for valid vs. invalid usernames can allow attackers to enumerate valid usernames.

**Mitigation:**

*   **Generic Error Messages:**  Return generic error messages to the user, such as "Invalid username or password."  Do not expose internal LDAP error codes or messages.
*   **Consistent Error Responses:**  Ensure that error responses for valid and invalid usernames are indistinguishable to prevent username enumeration.  This may involve introducing slight delays to make timing attacks more difficult.

### 4.5 Session Management

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in session management after successful LDAP authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Weak Session IDs:** Predictable or easily guessable session identifiers.
* **Session Fixation:** Accepting session IDs provided by the attacker.
* **Lack of Session Expiration:** Sessions that never expire or have excessively long lifetimes.
* **Improper Session Invalidation:** Sessions not properly invalidated on logout or password change.

**Mitigation:**
* **Strong Session IDs:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator to create session IDs.
* **Prevent Session Fixation:** Generate new session IDs after successful authentication.
* **Implement Session Expiration:** Set reasonable session timeouts and implement both idle and absolute timeouts.
* **Proper Session Invalidation:** Invalidate sessions on logout, password change, and other relevant events.

## 5. Conclusion and Recommendations

Rocket.Chat's LDAP/AD integration presents a significant attack surface.
