Okay, let's create a design document for Rocket.Chat based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Rocket.Chat is an open-source team communication platform, positioning itself as a competitor to Slack.  Its business priorities revolve around:

*   Providing a secure and reliable communication platform.
*   Offering a customizable and extensible solution for diverse organizational needs.
*   Maintaining a vibrant open-source community and ecosystem.
*   Offering both self-hosted and cloud-hosted deployment options.
*   Attracting and retaining users through a feature-rich experience.
*   Monetizing through enterprise features, support, and cloud hosting.

Key business risks that need to be addressed:

*   Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive communications.
*   Service disruptions and downtime impacting user productivity.
*   Reputational damage due to security vulnerabilities or privacy concerns.
*   Loss of user trust due to inadequate data protection measures.
*   Competition from established players in the communication platform market.
*   Supply chain attacks that can compromise Rocket.Chat instances.
*   Compliance violations related to data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

# SECURITY POSTURE

Based on the repository and general knowledge of similar applications, here's an assessment of Rocket.Chat's likely security posture:

*   security control: Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage user permissions. (Implemented in the core application logic).
*   security control: End-to-end encryption (E2EE) for private conversations (optional feature, implemented using client-side and server-side cryptography).
*   security control: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) to enhance account security. (Implemented as an option for users).
*   security control: Integration with external authentication providers (e.g., LDAP, SAML). (Implemented through plugins and configuration).
*   security control: Audit logging to track user activity and system events. (Implemented in the server-side logging mechanisms).
*   security control: Regular security updates and vulnerability patching. (Evidenced by the release cycle and security advisories in the repository).
*   security control: Input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF). (Implemented in the server-side and client-side code).
*   security control: Use of HTTPS for secure communication between clients and servers. (Enforced through server configuration and client-side code).
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks. (Implemented through HTTP headers).
*   security control: Rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks and denial-of-service. (Implemented in the server-side API layer).
*   accepted risk: Reliance on third-party libraries and dependencies, which may introduce vulnerabilities.
*   accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration by administrators, leading to security weaknesses.
*   accepted risk: The inherent complexity of a large codebase, increasing the likelihood of undiscovered vulnerabilities.

Recommended security controls (high priority):

*   Implement a comprehensive Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) management system to track and manage dependencies.
*   Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   Conduct regular penetration testing and vulnerability assessments by independent security experts.
*   Implement a robust secrets management solution to protect API keys, passwords, and other sensitive credentials.
*   Enhance data loss prevention (DLP) capabilities to prevent sensitive data from leaving the platform.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support for strong passwords and password complexity rules.
    *   Secure storage of passwords using industry-standard hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt).
    *   Protection against brute-force attacks and account lockout mechanisms.
    *   Secure session management with appropriate timeouts and token invalidation.
    *   Support for multi-factor authentication (MFA).
*   Authorization:
    *   Fine-grained access control based on roles and permissions.
    *   Ability to define custom roles and permissions.
    *   Enforcement of least privilege principle.
    *   Regular review and auditing of user permissions.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Strict validation of all user inputs on both the client-side and server-side.
    *   Use of whitelisting and input sanitization techniques.
    *   Protection against common web vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, SQL injection, CSRF).
    *   Secure handling of file uploads.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use of strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols.
    *   Secure key management practices.
    *   Protection of data in transit using TLS/SSL.
    *   Optional end-to-end encryption for sensitive conversations.
    *   Regular review and updates of cryptographic libraries.

## BUILD

Rocket.Chat's build process involves several steps, from development to creating deployable artifacts.  While the specifics vary depending on the development environment and CI/CD setup, a typical process looks like this:

1.  **Development:** Developers write code and commit changes to the Git repository (GitHub).
2.  **Continuous Integration (CI):**  A CI system (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins) automatically triggers builds on code commits.
3.  **Dependency Management:** Dependencies are managed using `npm` (Node Package Manager). `package.json` and `package-lock.json` define the project's dependencies.
4.  **Linting:** Code linters (e.g., ESLint) check for code style and potential errors.
5.  **Static Analysis:** Static analysis tools (e.g., SonarQube) can be integrated to identify potential security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.
6.  **Testing:** Automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) are executed.
7.  **Building:** The application is built, which typically involves compiling code, bundling assets, and creating a production-ready distribution.
8.  **Docker Image Creation:** A Docker image is created, packaging the application and its dependencies into a deployable unit.
9.  **Image Scanning:** The Docker image is scanned for known vulnerabilities using container security tools (e.g., Trivy, Clair).
10. **Artifact Storage:** The built artifacts (e.g., Docker image) are stored in a registry (e.g., Docker Hub, private registry).

```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   security control: Dependency vulnerability scanning (using tools like `npm audit` or Snyk).
*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST).
*   security control: Container image vulnerability scanning.
*   security control: Code signing (for desktop applications).
*   security control: Secure build environment (e.g., isolated CI runners).
*   security control: Least privilege access to build tools and resources.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Real-time communication and collaboration between users.
    *   Secure storage and retrieval of messages and files.
    *   User authentication and authorization.
    *   Integration with external systems (e.g., LDAP, SAML).
    *   Maintaining service availability and reliability.

*   Data Sensitivity:
    *   **Messages:**  Can range from low sensitivity (public channels) to high sensitivity (private conversations, direct messages).  May contain personally identifiable information (PII), confidential business information, or intellectual property.
    *   **Files:**  Similar to messages, files can vary in sensitivity.  May contain PII, confidential documents, or sensitive data.
    *   **User Data:**  Includes usernames, email addresses, profile information, and potentially authentication credentials (if not using external authentication).  This data is considered PII and requires protection.
    *   **Configuration Data:**  Includes server settings, API keys, and other configuration information.  This data is highly sensitive and must be protected from unauthorized access.
    *   **Logs:** Contain information about system activity, user actions, and potential security events. Log data can be sensitive and should be protected and monitored.

    *   DESIGN: The design diagrams represent a typical deployment, but specific configurations may vary. The build process is automated to some extent, but may not include all the recommended security checks.
    *   The organization has a basic incident response plan.
    *   Administrators are responsible for configuring and maintaining the security of their Rocket.Chat instances.
    *   Users are aware of basic security best practices (e.g., strong passwords, phishing awareness).
    *   Third-party dependencies are regularly updated, but there may be a delay in patching vulnerabilities.
