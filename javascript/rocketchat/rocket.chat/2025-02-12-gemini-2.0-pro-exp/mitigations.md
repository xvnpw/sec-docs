# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for rocketchat/rocket.chat

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Permission Audits and Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP) within Rocket.Chat](./mitigation_strategies/regular_permission_audits_and_principle_of_least_privilege__polp__within_rocket_chat.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Schedule:** Establish a recurring schedule (e.g., monthly, quarterly) for Rocket.Chat permission audits.
    2.  **Identify Roles:** List all Rocket.Chat user roles (default and custom).
    3.  **Document Permissions:** For *each* Rocket.Chat role, document the specific permissions granted within the Rocket.Chat interface (e.g., read messages, send messages, create channels, manage users, access specific APIs, use specific integrations).
    4.  **Review Assignments:** Review which users are assigned to each Rocket.Chat role. Identify users with roles broader than their responsibilities *within Rocket.Chat*.
    5.  **Adjust Permissions:** Adjust each user's Rocket.Chat role or permissions to the *absolute minimum* required. Use Rocket.Chat's built-in permission management system. Focus on granular control within Rocket.Chat's features.
    6.  **Automate (Rocket.Chat API):** Develop scripts using the *Rocket.Chat API* to automate parts of the audit:
        *   List users and their Rocket.Chat roles.
        *   Check for users with specific high-privilege Rocket.Chat permissions.
        *   Generate reports of Rocket.Chat permission assignments.
    7.  **Document Changes:** Document all changes to Rocket.Chat roles and permissions, including the rationale.
    8.  **Repeat:** Conduct the audit on the defined schedule.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Rocket.Chat Channels/Messages (High Severity):** Prevents users from accessing channels or messages they shouldn't *within Rocket.Chat*.
    *   **Unauthorized Rocket.Chat Administrative Actions (Critical Severity):** Limits the ability to perform administrative actions *within Rocket.Chat* (e.g., deleting users, changing Rocket.Chat settings, installing apps).
    *   **Privilege Escalation (within Rocket.Chat) (High Severity):** Reduces the likelihood of exploiting Rocket.Chat vulnerabilities to gain higher Rocket.Chat privileges.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion (within Rocket.Chat) (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized modification/deletion of messages, files, or data *within Rocket.Chat*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Rocket.Chat):** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Unauthorized Administrative Actions (Rocket.Chat):** Significantly reduces the risk.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Rocket.Chat):** Moderately reduces the risk.
    *   **Data Modification/Deletion (Rocket.Chat):** Significantly reduces the risk.

*   **Currently Implemented:** *(Example: Partially implemented. Manual audits are performed quarterly. Basic Rocket.Chat role assignments are reviewed, but custom role permissions within Rocket.Chat are not thoroughly audited.)*

*   **Missing Implementation:** *(Example: Automation using the Rocket.Chat API is missing. Detailed review of custom Rocket.Chat role permissions is inconsistent. No scripting to identify overly permissive Rocket.Chat roles.)*
