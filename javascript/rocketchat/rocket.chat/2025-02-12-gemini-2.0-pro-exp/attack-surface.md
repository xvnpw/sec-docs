## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Authorization Bypass](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_authorization_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** Insufficient authorization checks *within Rocket.Chat's API code* on specific API endpoints, allowing unauthorized access to data or functionality.
    *   **Rocket.Chat Contribution:** Rocket.Chat exposes a comprehensive REST API for various functionalities, and *its code is responsible for enforcing authorization*.
    *   **Example:** An unauthenticated user discovers a Rocket.Chat API endpoint that allows retrieving user details without proper authorization checks *implemented in the Rocket.Chat codebase*, leading to a data leak.
    *   **Impact:** Data leakage, unauthorized actions, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement consistent and robust authorization checks *within the code for every Rocket.Chat API endpoint*.
            *   Follow the principle of least privilege – only grant the minimum necessary permissions to each API endpoint *in the Rocket.Chat code*.
            *   Use a centralized authorization mechanism *within Rocket.Chat* to avoid inconsistencies.
            *   Regularly audit *Rocket.Chat's API endpoint code* for authorization vulnerabilities.
            *   Implement comprehensive API testing, including security-focused tests, *specifically targeting Rocket.Chat's API implementation*.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Improper handling of file uploads *within Rocket.Chat's code*, allowing attackers to upload malicious files or access unauthorized files.
    *   **Rocket.Chat Contribution:** Rocket.Chat allows users to upload files, and *its code handles the upload, validation, and storage process*.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as a JPG image, bypassing file type validation *implemented in Rocket.Chat* and gaining remote code execution on the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**
            *   Implement strict file type validation *within Rocket.Chat's code*, using a whitelist approach (allow only specific, safe file types).  Do *not* rely solely on file extensions.
            *   Validate file content using magic numbers or file signature analysis *as part of Rocket.Chat's upload handling*.
            *   Store uploaded files outside the web root, preventing direct execution *– a configuration managed by Rocket.Chat*.
            *   Use a secure random filename generator *within Rocket.Chat* to prevent predictable filenames.
