# Attack Surface Analysis for rocketchat/rocket.chat

## Attack Surface: [I. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/i__cross-site_scripting__xss__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These scripts can steal cookies, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf.

**How Rocket.Chat Contributes:**  Rocket.Chat handles and displays user-generated content extensively (messages, usernames, custom emojis, user profiles, etc.). If this content isn't properly sanitized and escaped, it can become a vector for XSS.

**Example:** A user sends a message containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When other users view this message, the script executes in their browser.

**Impact:**  Account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application, spreading malware.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding/escaping for all user-generated content rendered in the web interface.
    *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
    *   Regularly update Rocket.Chat to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [II. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)](./attack_surfaces/ii__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

**Description:** An attacker can induce the server to make requests to unintended locations, potentially accessing internal resources or interacting with external systems on the attacker's behalf.

**How Rocket.Chat Contributes:** Features like URL previews, link unfurling, and integrations (webhooks, bots) might involve the server making requests to URLs provided by users or external sources. If not handled carefully, attackers can manipulate these requests.

**Example:** An attacker sends a message containing a link to an internal server (`http://internal-server/admin`) which the Rocket.Chat server attempts to access for a preview.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, information disclosure, potential for further attacks on internal systems.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization for URLs.
    *   Use a whitelist of allowed protocols and domains for outbound requests.
    *   Where possible, avoid directly making requests based on user-provided URLs. Consider using intermediary services or sandboxed environments.

## Attack Surface: [III. Insecure Handling of Integrations (Webhooks, Bots, Marketplace Apps)](./attack_surfaces/iii__insecure_handling_of_integrations__webhooks__bots__marketplace_apps_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities arise from how Rocket.Chat interacts with external services through integrations. This can involve insecure webhook configurations, malicious bots, or vulnerabilities in marketplace apps.

**How Rocket.Chat Contributes:** Rocket.Chat's extensibility through webhooks, bots, and a marketplace introduces potential attack vectors if these integrations are not developed and managed securely.

**Example:** A malicious bot installed from the marketplace gains excessive permissions and exfiltrates sensitive data. Or, an improperly configured webhook sends sensitive information to an attacker's server.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to Rocket.Chat or integrated systems, compromise of user accounts.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement robust authorization and permission controls for integrations.
    *   Carefully review and audit the code of marketplace apps before installation.
    *   Provide clear guidelines and best practices for developing secure integrations.

## Attack Surface: [IV. Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/iv__authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Description:** Weaknesses in how Rocket.Chat verifies user identities and controls access to resources. This can lead to unauthorized access or privilege escalation.

**How Rocket.Chat Contributes:** The implementation of authentication mechanisms (local passwords, OAuth, SSO) and the authorization model (roles, permissions) are critical. Flaws in these areas can be directly exploited.

**Example:**  A vulnerability in the password reset process allows an attacker to reset another user's password. Or, a user with limited permissions is able to access administrative functionalities due to an authorization bypass.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data breaches, unauthorized modification of data, disruption of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Enforce strong password policies and implement secure password hashing algorithms.
    *   Thoroughly test authentication and authorization logic for vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
    *   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.
    *   Securely implement and configure SSO integrations.

## Attack Surface: [V. File Upload Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/v__file_upload_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Attackers exploit weaknesses in the file upload functionality to upload malicious files that can be executed on the server or used for other malicious purposes.

**How Rocket.Chat Contributes:** Rocket.Chat allows users to upload files. If proper validation and security measures are not in place, this can be a significant attack vector.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP script disguised as an image, which is then executed on the server, granting them remote code execution.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, denial-of-service, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement strict file type validation based on content rather than just the file extension.
    *   Store uploaded files outside of the webroot to prevent direct execution.
    *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   Consider using a dedicated storage service for uploaded files.

## Attack Surface: [VI. API Vulnerabilities (REST and Real-time)](./attack_surfaces/vi__api_vulnerabilities__rest_and_real-time_.md)

**Description:**  Weaknesses in the application programming interfaces (APIs) used by Rocket.Chat clients and integrations. This can include authentication bypasses or injection flaws.

**How Rocket.Chat Contributes:** Rocket.Chat exposes both REST and real-time APIs for various functionalities. Vulnerabilities in these APIs can be exploited to bypass security controls or access sensitive data.

**Example:** An attacker exploits an SQL injection vulnerability in an API endpoint to gain access to the database. Or, an attacker bypasses authentication on an API endpoint to perform actions without logging in.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, manipulation of data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Developers:**
    *   Implement robust authentication and authorization for all API endpoints.
    *   Perform thorough input validation on all API parameters to prevent injection attacks.
    *   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection.
    *   Securely handle API keys and secrets.
