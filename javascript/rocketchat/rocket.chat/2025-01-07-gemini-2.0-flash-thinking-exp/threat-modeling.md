# Threat Model Analysis for rocketchat/rocket.chat

## Threat: [Authorization Bypass in Rocket.Chat](./threats/authorization_bypass_in_rocket_chat.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within Rocket.Chat's authorization mechanisms to access resources or perform actions they are not authorized to. This could involve manipulating API requests or exploiting flaws in permission checks within Rocket.Chat itself.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to channels, direct messages, administrative functions, or other restricted features within Rocket.Chat. This can lead to data breaches, unauthorized modifications, and disruption of service.

**Affected Component:** Authorization module, permission management system, API endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Rocket.Chat updated to the latest version with security patches.
*   Review and configure Rocket.Chat's permission settings according to the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Rocket.Chat](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_rocket_chat.md)

**Description:** An attacker with limited privileges within Rocket.Chat exploits a vulnerability *within Rocket.Chat* to gain higher-level access or permissions. This could involve exploiting flaws in role-based access control or insecure handling of user roles *within Rocket.Chat*.

**Impact:** An attacker could gain administrative control over the Rocket.Chat instance, potentially allowing them to access all data, modify configurations, and compromise other users.

**Affected Component:** User management module, role-based access control (RBAC) system, administrative functions.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Rocket.Chat to patch known privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce strong password policies for all users, especially administrators within Rocket.Chat.
*   Limit the number of users with administrative privileges within Rocket.Chat.
*   Monitor user activity for suspicious privilege escalation attempts within Rocket.Chat.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) within Rocket.Chat](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__within_rocket_chat.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into messages, channel names, user profiles, or other user-controlled content *within Rocket.Chat*. When other users view this content *within Rocket.Chat*, the malicious script executes in their browsers.

**Impact:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser while they are using Rocket.Chat, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft related to the Rocket.Chat domain, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement of the Rocket.Chat interface.

**Affected Component:** Message rendering engine, input processing, user profile handling.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and output encoding (escaping) on the Rocket.Chat server-side.
*   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources within the context of Rocket.Chat.

## Threat: [Message Data Leakage](./threats/message_data_leakage.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains unauthorized access to stored message data within the Rocket.Chat database or during transmission *within the Rocket.Chat infrastructure*. This could be due to vulnerabilities in data storage encryption, insecure access controls *within Rocket.Chat*, or network sniffing *within the Rocket.Chat environment*.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information contained in private or public messages stored or transmitted by Rocket.Chat, potentially leading to privacy breaches, reputational damage, and legal liabilities.

**Affected Component:** Database storage, message retrieval mechanisms, network communication protocols.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Enable and properly configure end-to-end encryption for messages within Rocket.Chat.
*   Ensure strong encryption of the Rocket.Chat database at rest.
*   Use HTTPS for all communication to protect data in transit within the Rocket.Chat environment.
*   Implement strict access controls to the Rocket.Chat database.

## Threat: [Attachment Security Issues](./threats/attachment_security_issues.md)

**Description:** An attacker uploads malicious files to Rocket.Chat or gains unauthorized access to stored attachments *within Rocket.Chat*. This could involve exploiting vulnerabilities in file upload handling, storage permissions, or file processing *within Rocket.Chat*.

**Impact:**  Uploading malware could compromise the Rocket.Chat server or the devices of users who download the files from Rocket.Chat. Unauthorized access to attachments could lead to data breaches.

**Affected Component:** File upload module, file storage system, attachment retrieval mechanisms.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong file upload validation within Rocket.Chat to prevent malicious file types.
*   Scan uploaded files for malware using antivirus software integrated with Rocket.Chat.
*   Store attachments securely with appropriate access controls within Rocket.Chat.
*   Consider using a separate, isolated storage service for attachments managed by Rocket.Chat.

## Threat: [Insecure Rocket.Chat API Endpoints](./threats/insecure_rocket_chat_api_endpoints.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Rocket.Chat's API endpoints to perform unauthorized actions, access data, or disrupt service *on the Rocket.Chat instance*. This could involve injection attacks, authentication bypasses, or insufficient rate limiting *on the Rocket.Chat API*.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized data access, modification of data, denial of service affecting Rocket.Chat, or the ability to execute administrative functions on the Rocket.Chat server.

**Affected Component:** Rocket.Chat API, specific API endpoints.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability and affected endpoint).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Rocket.Chat updated to patch API vulnerabilities.
*   Implement proper input validation and sanitization on the Rocket.Chat API endpoints.
*   Enforce strong authentication and authorization for Rocket.Chat API access.
*   Implement rate limiting on the Rocket.Chat API to prevent abuse.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Rocket.Chat Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_rocket_chat_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries and components used by Rocket.Chat.

**Impact:**  Compromise of the Rocket.Chat instance, potentially leading to data breaches, remote code execution on the Rocket.Chat server, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Third-party libraries and dependencies.

**Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the severity of the dependency vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Rocket.Chat and its dependencies to the latest versions.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify and address known vulnerabilities in Rocket.Chat's dependencies.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration of Rocket.Chat](./threats/insecure_default_configuration_of_rocket_chat.md)

**Description:** The default configuration of Rocket.Chat might have insecure settings that could be exploited by attackers if not properly hardened after installation. This could include default administrative credentials or overly permissive access controls *within Rocket.Chat*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Rocket.Chat instance, potentially leading to data breaches, administrative takeover of the Rocket.Chat server, and service disruption.

**Affected Component:** Configuration settings, default user accounts.

**Risk Severity:** Medium

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Change default administrative credentials immediately after installation of Rocket.Chat.
*   Review and configure all security-related settings within Rocket.Chat according to best practices.
*   Disable or remove any unnecessary default features or accounts within Rocket.Chat.
