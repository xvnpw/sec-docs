## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rocket.Chat Authentication/Authorization Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rocket_chat_authenticationauthorization_weaknesses.md)

**Bypass Authentication Mechanisms:**
    * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Rocket.Chat's Authentication System:** Attackers target flaws in the login process, password reset mechanisms, or cryptographic implementations to gain unauthorized access. This could involve exploiting known vulnerabilities in specific Rocket.Chat versions.
    * **Leverage Default Credentials:** If administrators fail to change default usernames and passwords, attackers can easily gain administrative access to the Rocket.Chat instance.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rocket.Chat Messaging Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rocket_chat_messaging_functionality.md)

**Inject Malicious Content via Messages:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Message Content:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into messages that, when rendered by the application, execute in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions within the application's context.
    * **Command Injection via Message Content:** If the application unsafely processes message content, attackers can inject commands that are executed on the application server, potentially leading to full system compromise.
**Exploit Webhook Integrations:**
    * **Exploit Insecurely Configured Incoming Webhooks to Inject Malicious Data or Commands:** Attackers can send crafted requests to incoming webhook endpoints, potentially injecting malicious data into the application's systems or triggering unintended actions. This is especially dangerous if the application doesn't properly validate webhook requests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rocket.Chat API Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rocket_chat_api_vulnerabilities.md)

**Abuse REST API Endpoints:**
    * **Exploit Unauthenticated or Weakly Authenticated API Endpoints:** Attackers can directly access or modify data through API endpoints that lack proper authentication or use weak authentication methods. This can lead to data breaches or manipulation of application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rocket.Chat File Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rocket_chat_file_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Upload Malicious Files:**
    * **Uploading Web Shells or Executable Files:** Attackers upload malicious scripts or executables to the Rocket.Chat server. If these files are not properly restricted and are accessible, attackers can execute them, gaining remote control of the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rocket.Chat Plugin/App Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rocket_chat_pluginapp_vulnerabilities.md)

**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Rocket.Chat Apps:**
    * **Code Injection or Remote Code Execution (RCE) in a vulnerable app:** Attackers exploit security flaws within third-party Rocket.Chat apps to inject malicious code or execute arbitrary commands on the Rocket.Chat server, potentially compromising the entire instance and the application server.
**Supply Chain Attacks via Malicious Plugins:**
    * **Installing a Maliciously Crafted Plugin Designed to Compromise the System:** Attackers create or compromise a Rocket.Chat plugin and trick administrators into installing it. The malicious plugin can then execute arbitrary code and compromise the system from within.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Rocket.Chat Server Configuration Issues](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_rocket_chat_server_configuration_issues.md)

**Leverage Insecure Server Settings:**
    * **Exploiting Default or Weak Configurations:** Attackers exploit default or poorly configured settings on the Rocket.Chat server, such as open database ports with default credentials, to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or the server itself.
**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Dependencies:**
    * **Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Rocket.Chat's Underlying Libraries or Frameworks:** Attackers target known security flaws in the third-party libraries and frameworks that Rocket.Chat relies on. Successful exploitation can lead to remote code execution or other critical vulnerabilities affecting the Rocket.Chat instance and potentially the application server.
