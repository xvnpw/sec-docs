# Attack Surface Analysis for rocketchat/rocket.chat

## Attack Surface: [I. Message Content Injection (Stored XSS)](./attack_surfaces/i__message_content_injection__stored_xss_.md)

**Description:**  Malicious code is injected into messages and stored in the database. When other users view these messages, the code is executed in their browsers.
*   **How Rocket.Chat Contributes:** Rocket.Chat's rendering of Markdown and potentially HTML (if enabled) in messages can be exploited if not properly sanitized. Custom emoji functionality can also be a vector.
*   **Example:** A user crafts a message containing `<script>/* malicious code */</script>` or a malicious link disguised within Markdown. When another user views this message, the script executes.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement of the Rocket.Chat interface for other users, and potentially access to sensitive information within the Rocket.Chat instance.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-provided content, especially within message rendering.
        *   Utilize a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of XSS.
        *   Regularly update Rocket.Chat and its dependencies to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   Carefully review and sanitize any custom emoji implementations.

## Attack Surface: [II. Malicious File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/ii__malicious_file_uploads.md)

**Description:** Users upload malicious files that can compromise the server or client systems.
*   **How Rocket.Chat Contributes:** Rocket.Chat allows users to upload various file types. If these files are not properly validated, scanned, or handled, they can pose a threat. Vulnerabilities in file preview generation can also be exploited.
*   **Example:** A user uploads an executable file disguised as an image or a file containing a web shell. If accessed directly or through a vulnerability, this file can execute malicious code on the server or the user's machine.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breach, malware distribution to other users, denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation based on content rather than just the file extension.
        *   Integrate with antivirus and malware scanning solutions to scan uploaded files.
        *   Store uploaded files outside the webroot and serve them through a separate, secure mechanism that prevents direct execution.
        *   Sanitize filenames to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement secure file preview generation mechanisms or disable previews for potentially dangerous file types.

## Attack Surface: [III. API Vulnerabilities (Authentication & Authorization)](./attack_surfaces/iii__api_vulnerabilities__authentication_&_authorization_.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the Rocket.Chat REST API allow unauthorized access or manipulation of data.
*   **How Rocket.Chat Contributes:** Rocket.Chat exposes a comprehensive REST API for various functionalities. Weak authentication or authorization mechanisms in these endpoints can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An API endpoint intended for administrators to delete users lacks proper authentication, allowing any authenticated user to delete accounts. Or, an API endpoint leaks sensitive user data without proper authorization checks.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized modification or deletion of data, privilege escalation, account takeover.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when granting API access.
        *   Thoroughly test API endpoints for common vulnerabilities like broken authentication, authorization flaws, and injection attacks.
        *   Use secure coding practices to prevent vulnerabilities like mass assignment.

## Attack Surface: [IV. WebSocket Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/iv__websocket_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws in the WebSocket implementation allow for unauthorized actions or denial of service.
*   **How Rocket.Chat Contributes:** Rocket.Chat relies heavily on WebSockets for real-time communication. Vulnerabilities in the WebSocket handling can be exploited.
*   **Example:** An attacker could send specially crafted WebSocket messages to crash the server or inject malicious messages into channels they shouldn't have access to. Lack of proper input validation on WebSocket messages could lead to vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service, unauthorized access to messages, message injection, potential for server-side vulnerabilities if WebSocket messages are not handled securely.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all data received through WebSockets.
        *   Ensure proper authentication and authorization for WebSocket connections and messages.
        *   Implement rate limiting and connection limits to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
        *   Regularly update the WebSocket library and Rocket.Chat itself to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [V. Marketplace App Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/v__marketplace_app_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws within third-party applications installed from the Rocket.Chat Marketplace can compromise the Rocket.Chat instance.
*   **How Rocket.Chat Contributes:** Rocket.Chat's marketplace allows for the installation of extensions, increasing functionality but also introducing potential security risks if these apps are not secure.
*   **Example:** A malicious or poorly coded marketplace app could have vulnerabilities that allow it to access sensitive data within Rocket.Chat, execute arbitrary code on the server, or perform actions on behalf of users.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, server compromise, unauthorized access, privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers (Marketplace App Developers):**
        *   Follow secure coding practices when developing marketplace apps.
        *   Thoroughly test apps for vulnerabilities before publishing.
        *   Keep dependencies up to date.
    *   **Administrators:**
        *   Carefully vet marketplace apps before installation, considering the developer's reputation and the app's permissions.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing and approving marketplace app installations.
        *   Regularly review the permissions granted to installed marketplace apps.
        *   Consider using only trusted and well-maintained apps.
