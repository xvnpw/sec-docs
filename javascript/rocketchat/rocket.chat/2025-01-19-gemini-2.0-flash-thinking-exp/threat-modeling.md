# Threat Model Analysis for rocketchat/rocket.chat

## Threat: [Compromised Rocket.Chat API Key](./threats/compromised_rocket_chat_api_key.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the application's Rocket.Chat API key. They can then use this key to make unauthorized API calls *to Rocket.Chat*, potentially impersonating the application. This could involve reading messages, sending messages, modifying channels, or managing users depending on the key's permissions *within Rocket.Chat*.

**Impact:** Data breaches (reading private communications *within Rocket.Chat*), unauthorized actions *within Rocket.Chat* on behalf of the application, potential disruption of communication flows *within Rocket.Chat*, and reputational damage.

**Affected Component:** `server/sdk/api` (Rocket.Chat's API handling), `server/services/rest` (REST API endpoints).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Securely store the API key using environment variables or a secrets management system.
*   Implement strict access controls for the API key.
*   Regularly rotate API keys.
*   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity *on the Rocket.Chat instance*.
*   Minimize the permissions granted to the API key to the least privilege necessary *within Rocket.Chat*.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Rocket.Chat Messages](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_rocket_chat_messages.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into a Rocket.Chat message. When other users view this message within the application's interface (e.g., embedded chat), the script executes in their browser. This vulnerability originates *within Rocket.Chat's message handling*.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, stealing user credentials, redirecting users to malicious sites, or defacing the application's interface.

**Affected Component:** `app/ui` (Rocket.Chat's user interface rendering), `packages/rocketchat-message-parser` (message parsing and rendering).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure the application properly sanitizes and encodes data received *from Rocket.Chat* before rendering it in the application's context.
*   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
*   Stay updated with Rocket.Chat releases that address known XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Educate users about the risks of clicking on suspicious links within Rocket.Chat messages.

## Threat: [Account Takeover via Rocket.Chat Vulnerabilities](./threats/account_takeover_via_rocket_chat_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities within Rocket.Chat's authentication or session management *to gain unauthorized access to Rocket.Chat user accounts*. This could then be leveraged to access the application if it relies on Rocket.Chat for authentication context.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to user accounts *within Rocket.Chat*, potential for data breaches *within Rocket.Chat*, and malicious actions performed as the compromised user *within Rocket.Chat*. This can extend to the application if there's a trust relationship.

**Affected Component:** `app/authentication` (Rocket.Chat's authentication mechanisms), `packages/rocketchat-session` (session management).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure Rocket.Chat is running the latest secure version with all security patches applied.
*   Encourage users to use strong and unique passwords and enable multi-factor authentication if available in Rocket.Chat and the application.
*   Monitor for suspicious login activity *on the Rocket.Chat instance*.
