### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Uploading Web Shells or Executable Files

This section delves into the specifics of the "Uploading Web Shells or Executable Files" attack path.

**4.1. Attack Scenario:**

An attacker attempts to upload a malicious file, such as a PHP web shell (`.php`), a Python script (`.py`), or a compiled executable (`.exe`), to the Rocket.Chat server through a file upload functionality. The goal is to execute this file on the server to gain unauthorized access and control.

**4.2. Potential Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses:**

Several vulnerabilities and weaknesses in Rocket.Chat's file handling could enable this attack:

* **Insufficient File Type Restrictions:**
    * **Lack of Whitelisting:** The application might rely on blacklisting file extensions, which is easily bypassed by using less common or obfuscated extensions.
    * **Client-Side Validation Only:**  If file type validation is performed solely on the client-side (e.g., using JavaScript), attackers can easily bypass it by manipulating the request.
    * **MIME Type Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the `Content-Type` header in the HTTP request to trick the server into accepting malicious files as legitimate ones.
* **Inadequate Input Sanitization:**
    * **Filename Injection:**  The application might not properly sanitize filenames, allowing attackers to inject malicious code or characters that could be exploited during file processing or storage.
    * **Content Injection:** While less direct for execution, vulnerabilities in how file content is processed (e.g., during preview generation) could be exploited.
* **Accessible Upload Directory:**
    * **Direct Web Access:** If the directory where uploaded files are stored is directly accessible via the web server, attackers can directly request and execute the uploaded malicious files.
    * **Predictable File Paths:** If file paths are predictable, attackers can guess the location of their uploaded files.
* **Lack of Execution Prevention Mechanisms:**
    * **No `.htaccess` or similar restrictions:** The web server might not be configured to prevent the execution of scripts in the upload directory (e.g., using `.htaccess` in Apache or similar configurations in other web servers).
    * **Inadequate Operating System Permissions:**  The web server process might have sufficient permissions to execute uploaded files.
* **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries:**  If Rocket.Chat relies on third-party libraries for file handling, vulnerabilities in those libraries could be exploited.

**4.3. Attack Execution Steps:**

1. **Identify Upload Functionality:** The attacker identifies a file upload feature within Rocket.Chat (e.g., in chat messages, user profile settings, or other areas).
2. **Craft Malicious File:** The attacker creates a malicious file (e.g., a PHP web shell) designed to execute commands on the server.
3. **Bypass Client-Side Checks (if present):** If client-side validation exists, the attacker manipulates the HTTP request to bypass it.
4. **Upload Malicious File:** The attacker uploads the malicious file through the identified upload functionality.
5. **Locate Uploaded File:** The attacker attempts to determine the location of the uploaded file on the server. This might involve:
    * **Predicting the file path:** Based on common patterns or observed behavior.
    * **Exploiting other vulnerabilities:** Such as path traversal to list directories.
    * **Information leakage:**  If the application reveals the file path in error messages or responses.
6. **Execute Malicious File:** Once the file location is known, the attacker attempts to execute it by directly accessing its URL through a web browser or using other tools.

**4.4. Potential Impact:**

Successful execution of a malicious file can have severe consequences:

* **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the Rocket.Chat server with the privileges of the web server process.
* **Server Compromise:** The attacker can gain full control of the server, potentially leading to:
    * **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive data stored on the server, including user credentials, chat logs, and other confidential information.
    * **Malware Deployment:** Installing further malware, such as backdoors or botnet clients.
    * **Service Disruption:**  Taking the Rocket.Chat service offline or causing instability.
    * **Lateral Movement:** Using the compromised server as a stepping stone to attack other systems on the network.
* **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization using Rocket.Chat.

**4.5. Likelihood:**

The likelihood of this attack succeeding depends on the security measures implemented by the Rocket.Chat development team and the system administrators deploying the application. If proper file handling security controls are lacking, the likelihood is moderate to high.

**4.6. Mitigation Strategies:**

To mitigate the risk of this attack, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Robust Server-Side File Type Validation:**
    * **Whitelist Allowed Extensions:** Only allow specific, safe file extensions based on the application's needs.
    * **MIME Type Verification:** Verify the file's MIME type on the server-side, but be aware that this can be spoofed. Combine with other methods.
    * **Magic Number Verification:**  Inspect the file's header (magic number) to accurately identify its type, regardless of the extension or MIME type.
* **Thorough Input Sanitization:**
    * **Sanitize Filenames:** Remove or encode potentially harmful characters from filenames.
    * **Prevent Path Traversal:** Ensure filenames do not contain ".." or other path traversal sequences.
* **Secure File Storage and Access:**
    * **Store Uploaded Files Outside the Web Root:**  Prevent direct access to uploaded files via the web server.
    * **Use Unique and Non-Predictable Filenames:**  Generate random or hashed filenames to make it difficult for attackers to guess file locations.
    * **Implement Access Controls:**  Restrict access to uploaded files based on user roles and permissions.
* **Execution Prevention Mechanisms:**
    * **Configure Web Server to Prevent Script Execution:** Use directives like `.htaccess` (for Apache) or similar configurations in other web servers to disable script execution in the upload directory.
    * **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Configure CSP headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of executed scripts.
    * **Run Web Server with Least Privilege:** Ensure the web server process runs with minimal necessary permissions.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Conduct regular security assessments to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
* **Keep Rocket.Chat and Dependencies Up-to-Date:**  Apply security patches promptly to address known vulnerabilities in Rocket.Chat and its dependencies.
* **Consider Using a Dedicated File Storage Service:**  Offload file storage to a dedicated service with robust security features.

**4.7. Detection Strategies:**

Implementing detection mechanisms is crucial for identifying and responding to attempted or successful attacks:

* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to inspect HTTP traffic and block malicious requests, including those attempting to upload suspicious files.
* **Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS):**  Use network-based or host-based IDS/IPS to detect anomalous activity, such as attempts to access or execute files in unusual locations.
* **Log Monitoring and Analysis:**  Monitor web server logs, application logs, and security logs for suspicious events, such as failed upload attempts, access to unusual file paths, or execution of unexpected processes.
* **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**  Monitor the integrity of critical files and directories to detect unauthorized modifications or additions.
* **Anomaly Detection:**  Establish baselines for normal file upload activity and alert on deviations from these baselines.
* **Honeypots:**  Deploy decoy files or directories to attract attackers and detect their presence.

### 5. Conclusion

The "Uploading Web Shells or Executable Files" attack path poses a significant risk to Rocket.Chat installations if proper security measures are not in place. By understanding the potential vulnerabilities, attack vectors, and impact, the development team can prioritize the implementation of robust mitigation strategies. Furthermore, establishing effective detection mechanisms is crucial for timely response and containment of any successful attacks.
