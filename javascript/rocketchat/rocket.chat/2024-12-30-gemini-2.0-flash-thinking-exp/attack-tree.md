Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

* **Compromise Application Using Rocket.Chat [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to application data, functionality, or infrastructure.

* **Exploit Direct Rocket.Chat Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * This path involves directly targeting weaknesses within the Rocket.Chat application itself.

* **Exploit Authentication/Authorization Flaws [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Bypass Authentication Mechanisms [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Login Logic [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **SQL Injection in Login Form [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * Attackers inject malicious SQL code into login form fields to bypass authentication by manipulating database queries. Successful exploitation grants access without valid credentials.
            * **Brute-force Weak Default Credentials (if applicable) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * Attackers attempt to log in using common default usernames and passwords that may not have been changed after installation.

* **Exploit Input Validation Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Inject Malicious Code [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Stored XSS via Message Content [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into messages that are stored in the database and executed when other users view the message, potentially stealing session cookies or performing other actions on their behalf.
            * **Reflected XSS via URL Parameters [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * Attackers craft malicious URLs containing JavaScript code that is reflected back to the user's browser and executed, often used in phishing attacks.

* **Exploit Data Handling Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Leak Sensitive Information:**
        * **Abuse API Endpoints with Excessive Data Exposure:**
            * **Retrieve User Credentials or API Keys [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                * Attackers exploit API endpoints that return more data than necessary, potentially exposing sensitive information like user credentials or API keys due to insufficient authorization checks or flawed API design.

* **Exploit Indirect Vulnerabilities via Application Interaction with Rocket.Chat [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
    * **Exploit Trust in Rocket.Chat Data [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Inject Malicious Content via Rocket.Chat [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Send Phishing Links via Messages [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * Attackers send messages containing links to fake login pages or other malicious websites to steal user credentials or sensitive information.
            * **Distribute Malware via File Uploads [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * Attackers upload malicious files disguised as legitimate documents or media, which can compromise user devices if downloaded and executed.

    * **Exploit Misconfigurations in Rocket.Chat Integration [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        * **Abuse Insecure API Key Management [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Expose or Steal Rocket.Chat API Keys [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * Attackers find ways to access or steal Rocket.Chat API keys that are not securely stored or managed, potentially through misconfigurations, code vulnerabilities, or insider threats.
            * **Use Stolen Keys to Access or Modify Rocket.Chat Data [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * Once API keys are compromised, attackers can use them to bypass authentication and authorization, allowing them to read, modify, or delete data within Rocket.Chat.
        * **Exploit Insufficient Input Sanitization by the Application [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
            * **Application Vulnerable to XSS/Injection based on Rocket.Chat Data [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
                * The application fails to properly sanitize data received from Rocket.Chat (e.g., usernames, messages), making it vulnerable to injection attacks like XSS when this data is displayed or processed.
