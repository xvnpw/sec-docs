## 5. Architectural Overview

Rocket.Chat is a real-time communication platform designed for team collaboration. It employs a modular architecture, with the central Rocket.Chat server orchestrating various services. It facilitates communication through features like channels, direct messages, audio/video conferencing, and file sharing. The Rocket.Chat server is the central hub, responsible for routing messages, managing users and permissions, and coordinating interactions between different parts of the system.

## 6. Key Components

*   **Client Applications:**
    *   **Web Browser Client:** A JavaScript-based application providing the primary user interface, handling message rendering, user interaction, and real-time updates via WebSockets.
    *   **Desktop Applications (Electron-based):**  Native applications built using Electron, wrapping the web client for a desktop experience, potentially offering OS-level integrations like notifications.
    *   **Mobile Applications (Native iOS and Android):**  Platform-specific applications providing mobile access, leveraging native UI components and push notification capabilities.
    *   **Command Line Interface (CLI):**  A tool for administrators and developers to interact with the server programmatically, performing tasks like user management or data migration.

*   **Rocket.Chat Server:**
    *   **API Gateway:** The single entry point for all client requests. It handles routing requests to the appropriate internal services, performs initial authentication and authorization checks, and may handle rate limiting.
    *   **Realtime Engine (Meteor):**  Manages real-time communication using WebSockets (or potentially other protocols). It's responsible for broadcasting new messages, presence updates, and other real-time events to connected clients.
    *   **Message Handling Service:**  Processes incoming messages, stores them in the database, handles message editing and deletion requests, and manages message history retrieval.
    *   **User Management Service:**  Manages user accounts, including registration, login, password management, profile updates, and role-based access control.
    *   **Channel Management Service:**  Handles the creation, management, and access control of channels (public and private) and direct message conversations. This includes managing channel membership and permissions.
    *   **File Upload Service:**  Manages the process of uploading files, interacting with object storage for persistent storage, and storing file metadata in the database. It may also handle file previews and transformations.
    *   **Integration Service:**  Facilitates integrations with external applications and services through mechanisms like webhooks (for outbound events) and REST APIs (for inbound commands). It also manages OAuth authentication for third-party applications.
    *   **Administration Service:**  Provides administrative interfaces and APIs for server configuration, user and channel management, monitoring server health, and managing integrations.
    *   **Push Notification Service:**  Manages the delivery of push notifications to mobile clients via platform-specific gateways (APNs for iOS, FCM for Android). It handles device token registration and notification payload creation.

*   **Database:**
    *   **MongoDB:**  A NoSQL document database serving as the primary data store for messages, user profiles, channel information, settings, and other persistent data.

*   **Object Storage:**
    *   Typically a cloud-based object storage service (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage) or a local file system used for storing uploaded files, offloading file storage from the main database.

*   **Push Notification Gateway:**
    *   Platform-specific services like **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** for Android devices and **Apple Push Notification service (APNs)** for iOS devices, responsible for delivering push notifications to the respective mobile operating systems.

## 7. Data Flow Diagrams

### 7.1 User Login

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Client Application"
        A["User"] --> B("Login Form");
    end
    subgraph "Rocket.Chat Server"
        C("API Gateway") --> D("User Management Service");
        D --> E("Authentication Provider");
        E -- "User Credentials" --> F("MongoDB");
        F -- "User Data" --> E;
        E -- "Authentication Result" --> D;
        D -- "Session Token" --> C;
        C --> B;
    end
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

*   The "User" interacts with the "Login Form" within the "Client Application", providing their credentials.
*   The "Login Form" sends the user's credentials to the "API Gateway" on the "Rocket.Chat Server" via an HTTPS request.
*   The "API Gateway" routes the authentication request to the "User Management Service".
*   The "User Management Service" delegates the authentication process to the "Authentication Provider".
*   The "Authentication Provider" retrieves the stored "User Data" (e.g., hashed password) from "MongoDB" using the provided username.
*   The "Authentication Provider" compares the provided credentials with the stored "User Data".
*   The "Authentication Provider" returns the "Authentication Result" (success or failure) to the "User Management Service".
*   Upon successful authentication, the "User Management Service" generates a "Session Token" (e.g., a JWT) and sends it back to the "API Gateway".
*   The "API Gateway" returns the "Session Token" to the "Client Application", which will use it for subsequent requests.

### 7.2 Sending a Message

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Client Application"
        A["User"] --> B("Message Input");
        B --> C("Send Message Request");
    end
    subgraph "Rocket.Chat Server"
        D("API Gateway") --> E("Message Handling Service");
        E --> F("Realtime Engine (Meteor)");
        F --> G("Message Distribution");
        E --> H("MongoDB");
    end
    subgraph "Other Clients"
        I("Recipient Client 1");
        J("Recipient Client 2");
    end
    G --> I;
    G --> J;
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style H fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style I fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style J fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

*   The "User" composes a message in the "Message Input" area of the "Client Application".
*   The "Client Application" sends a "Send Message Request" (containing the message content, recipient information, etc.) to the "API Gateway" on the "Rocket.Chat Server".
*   The "API Gateway" routes the request to the "Message Handling Service".
*   The "Message Handling Service" performs actions like sanitizing the message content and storing the message persistently in "MongoDB".
*   The "Message Handling Service" then pushes the new message to the "Realtime Engine (Meteor)".
*   The "Realtime Engine (Meteor)"'s "Message Distribution" component identifies the recipients of the message.
*   The "Realtime Engine (Meteor)" sends the message in real-time to the connected "Recipient Client 1" and "Recipient Client 2" (and any other recipients) via their established WebSocket connections.

### 7.3 File Upload

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Client Application"
        A["User"] --> B("File Selection");
        B --> C("Upload Request");
    end
    subgraph "Rocket.Chat Server"
        D("API Gateway") --> E("File Upload Service");
        E --> F("Object Storage (e.g., S3)");
        E --> G("MongoDB");
    end
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style G fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

*   The "User" selects a file for upload using the "File Selection" interface in the "Client Application".
*   The "Client Application" initiates an "Upload Request" to the "API Gateway" on the "Rocket.Chat Server", typically using a multipart form data request.
*   The "API Gateway" routes the file upload request to the "File Upload Service".
*   The "File Upload Service" handles the transfer of the file to the designated "Object Storage (e.g., S3)". This might involve pre-signed URLs for direct uploads.
*   Once the file is successfully stored, the "File Upload Service" stores metadata about the uploaded file (e.g., filename, size, storage location) in "MongoDB".

### 7.4 Push Notification

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "Rocket.Chat Server"
        A["Event Trigger (e.g., New Message)"] --> B("Push Notification Service");
    end
    subgraph "Push Notification Gateway"
        C("APNs (iOS)");
        D("FCM (Android)");
    end
    subgraph "Mobile Client"
        E("iOS Device");
        F("Android Device");
    end
    B --> C;
    B --> D;
    C --> E;
    D --> F;
    style A fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style C fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style D fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style E fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style F fill:#ccf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

*   An "Event Trigger (e.g., New Message received by a user who is offline)" occurs on the "Rocket.Chat Server".
*   The "Push Notification Service" identifies the target mobile devices based on user preferences and device registrations.
*   The "Push Notification Service" constructs the appropriate notification payload for each platform (APNs for iOS, FCM for Android).
*   The "Push Notification Service" sends the notifications to the respective "APNs (iOS)" and "FCM (Android)" gateways.
*   The push notification gateways then deliver the notifications to the corresponding "iOS Device" and "Android Device".
