# Attack Surface Analysis for bigskysoftware/htmx

## Attack Surface: [Open Redirect via Manipulated `hx-get` or `hx-post`](./attack_surfaces/open_redirect_via_manipulated__hx-get__or__hx-post_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the value of the `hx-get` or `hx-post` attribute to redirect users to a malicious external site after an interaction.
*   **How HTMX Contributes:** HTMX uses these attributes to define the target URL for requests. If this value is directly derived from user input or a vulnerable source without proper sanitization, it can be manipulated.
*   **Example:** An application displays user-generated content with links. An attacker injects a malicious URL into a link's `hx-get` attribute: `<a hx-get="https://evil.com" hx-trigger="click">Click Me</a>`. When a user clicks, they are redirected to `evil.com`.
*   **Impact:** User compromise, phishing attacks, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-provided input before embedding it into HTMX attributes. Use allow-lists for allowed domains if possible.
    *   **Avoid Dynamic Attribute Generation:**  Minimize the use of dynamically generated HTMX attributes based on user input. If necessary, use a secure templating engine with auto-escaping.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a CSP with `default-src 'self'` and other directives to limit the domains the browser can connect to.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Manipulated `hx-target` and `hx-swap`](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_manipulated__hx-target__and__hx-swap_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTML or JavaScript code into the page by manipulating the `hx-target` and `hx-swap` attributes. The server responds with malicious content, and HTMX inserts it into the specified target.
*   **How HTMX Contributes:** HTMX directly manipulates the DOM based on the server's response and the instructions in `hx-target` and `hx-swap`. If the server returns unsanitized user input or malicious code, HTMX will inject it.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a comment containing malicious HTML: `<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>`. The server echoes this back, and an HTMX element is configured as `<div id="comment-area" hx-get="/get-latest-comment" hx-trigger="load" hx-swap="innerHTML"></div>`. HTMX fetches the comment and injects the malicious script into the `comment-area`.
*   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Output Encoding:**  Always encode output before sending it to the client, especially when dealing with user-generated content. Use context-aware encoding.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to prevent the execution of inline scripts and restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.
    *   **Avoid `hx-swap="outerHTML"` with User Content:** Be extremely cautious when using `hx-swap="outerHTML"` with content that might contain user input, as it replaces the entire target element.
    *   **Sanitize on the Server:** Sanitize user input on the server-side before storing it in the database to prevent persistent XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Manipulated `hx-get` or `hx-post`](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_manipulated__hx-get__or__hx-post_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the `hx-get` or `hx-post` attribute to make the server send requests to internal or restricted resources.
*   **How HTMX Contributes:** HTMX allows triggering server-side requests based on attribute values. If these values are influenced by untrusted input, an attacker can force the server to make unintended requests.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to specify a URL for fetching external data (vulnerably used in an HTMX attribute): `<button hx-get="http://internal-service" hx-trigger="click">Fetch Data</button>`. An attacker could change this to target internal services.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, denial of service of internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Validation of URLs:**  Strictly validate and sanitize URLs used in HTMX requests on the server-side. Use allow-lists for permitted domains and protocols.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate internal services from the public internet.
    *   **Disable Unnecessary Protocols:** Disable unnecessary URL schemes (like `file://`) to prevent access to local files.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application server only has the necessary permissions to access required external resources.

## Attack Surface: [HTTP Header Injection via Manipulated `hx-headers`](./attack_surfaces/http_header_injection_via_manipulated__hx-headers_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects arbitrary HTTP headers by manipulating the value of the `hx-headers` attribute.
*   **How HTMX Contributes:** HTMX allows setting custom headers for requests via the `hx-headers` attribute. If the values for these headers are derived from unsanitized user input, it can lead to header injection.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to set a custom header name and value (vulnerably used in HTMX): `<button hx-post="/submit" hx-headers='{"Custom-Header": "malicious\r\nX-Evil: yes"}' hx-trigger="click">Submit</button>`. This could inject the `X-Evil` header.
*   **Impact:** Session hijacking, bypassing security measures, cache poisoning, exploiting vulnerabilities in backend systems.
*   **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the injected header)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Sanitization of Header Values:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate any user-provided input used in `hx-headers`. Blacklist control characters like `\r` and `\n`.
    *   **Avoid User-Controlled Headers:**  Minimize or eliminate the ability for users to directly control HTTP headers.
    *   **Use Server-Side Logic for Headers:**  Set necessary headers on the server-side instead of relying on client-side input.
