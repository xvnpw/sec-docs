# Threat Model Analysis for bigskysoftware/htmx

## Threat: [Malicious HTMX Attribute Injection](./threats/malicious_htmx_attribute_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects or modifies HTMX attributes (e.g., `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-target`, `hx-vals`) within the HTML structure. This could be achieved through stored XSS vulnerabilities or other means of injecting arbitrary HTML. The injected attributes cause the browser to initiate unintended HTMX requests with attacker-controlled parameters or target elements.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary requests on behalf of the user, potentially leading to data modification, privilege escalation, or information disclosure. Redirection to malicious sites or injection of malicious content into unexpected parts of the DOM.

**Affected HTMX Component:**  HTML parsing and attribute processing logic within HTMX. Specifically, the handlers for `hx-*` attributes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly sanitize and validate all user-provided content before rendering it in HTML.
*   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded and the actions that can be performed.
*   Avoid dynamically generating HTMX attributes based on unsanitized user input.

## Threat: [HX-Target Redirection and UI Manipulation](./threats/hx-target_redirection_and_ui_manipulation.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the `hx-target` attribute, either through direct injection or by exploiting a vulnerability that allows modification of existing attributes. This causes HTMX responses to be loaded into unexpected parts of the DOM, potentially overwriting legitimate content with malicious content or hiding critical UI elements.

**Impact:**  Phishing attacks by displaying fake UI elements, denial of service by overwriting essential functionality, confusion and manipulation of users.

**Affected HTMX Component:** The `hx-target` attribute and the DOM update logic that uses this attribute to determine the target element.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully control and validate the source of `hx-target` values.
*   Avoid dynamically generating `hx-target` based on user input without thorough sanitization.
*   Implement server-side checks to ensure the target element is valid and expected.

## Threat: [HX-Swap Manipulation leading to Data Corruption or XSS](./threats/hx-swap_manipulation_leading_to_data_corruption_or_xss.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates the `hx-swap` attribute to change how HTMX updates the DOM. For example, forcing an `outerHTML` swap when an `innerHTML` swap was expected could lead to the replacement of the target element itself, potentially breaking event listeners or injecting malicious scripts if the server response is not carefully controlled.

**Impact:** Data loss or corruption if critical elements are unexpectedly replaced. Introduction of client-side XSS vulnerabilities if malicious content is injected via the swap.

**Affected HTMX Component:** The `hx-swap` attribute and the different swapping strategies implemented by HTMX.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Limit the ability to dynamically set `hx-swap` based on user input.
*   If dynamic setting is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize the input.
*   Ensure server-side responses are properly sanitized to prevent XSS, regardless of the swap method.

## Threat: [Mass Assignment via HX-Include/HX-Vals](./threats/mass_assignment_via_hx-includehx-vals.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages the `hx-include` or `hx-vals` attributes to send additional, unexpected data to the server with an HTMX request. If the server-side application blindly accepts and processes these parameters without proper validation and whitelisting, it could be vulnerable to mass assignment attacks, allowing the attacker to modify data they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact:**  Unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation, unintended changes to application state.

**Affected HTMX Component:** The `hx-include` and `hx-vals` attributes, which facilitate sending additional data with requests.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strict input validation and whitelisting on the server-side.
*   Only process expected parameters.
*   Avoid directly mapping request parameters to internal data structures without validation.

## Threat: [Server-Sent Events (SSE) and WebSockets Injection (via HTMX)](./threats/server-sent_events__sse__and_websockets_injection__via_htmx_.md)

**Description:** If HTMX is used to establish SSE or WebSocket connections, vulnerabilities in the server-side implementation of these protocols could be exploited. Additionally, if the client-side handling of messages received via SSE or WebSockets is not properly sanitized, it could lead to client-side injection when HTMX updates the DOM with this data.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, UI manipulation, information disclosure.

**Affected HTMX Component:** The mechanisms HTMX provides for integrating with SSE and WebSockets (e.g., extensions or custom event handling).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust server-side validation and sanitization for SSE and WebSocket messages.
*   Properly sanitize any data received via these channels before rendering it in the DOM using HTMX.
*   Follow security best practices for implementing SSE and WebSocket connections.
