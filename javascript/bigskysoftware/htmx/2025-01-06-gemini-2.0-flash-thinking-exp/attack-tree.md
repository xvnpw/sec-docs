## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using HTMX (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using_htmx__critical_node_.md)

* This is the root goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, manipulating data, disrupting service, or otherwise harming the application and its users through HTMX vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Client-Side HTMX Processing (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_client-side_htmx_processing__critical_node_.md)

* This high-risk path focuses on manipulating the client-side behavior of HTMX to achieve malicious goals. Since HTMX logic resides in the browser, attackers can try to influence how requests are made and how the DOM is updated.

    * **2.1. Inject Malicious HTMX Attributes (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious HTML attributes (e.g., `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-target`, `hx-on`) into the application's HTML. These attributes, when processed by HTMX, can trigger unintended actions.
        * **2.1.1. Stored Attribute Injection (e.g., in database, user profile) (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * **Attack Vector:** Malicious HTMX attributes are stored persistently (e.g., in a database field, user profile information) and rendered on subsequent page loads. This allows the attacker to potentially compromise other users who view the affected content.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium
            * **Impact:** High (Can affect multiple users)
            * **Effort:** Medium
            * **Skill Level:** Medium
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Manipulate HTMX Request Parameters:](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__manipulate_htmx_request_parameters.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers intercept or modify the parameters of HTMX requests before they are sent to the server. This can be done through browser developer tools, proxy servers, or by manipulating client-side JavaScript.
        * **2.2.1. Tamper with Request Parameters Before Sending:**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers directly modify the request parameters (e.g., in the URL or request body) before the HTMX request is sent. This can lead to the server performing actions with modified data or accessing unauthorized resources.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium
            * **Impact:** High (Can lead to data modification or unauthorized access)
            * **Effort:** Low
            * **Skill Level:** Low
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Server-Side Handling of HTMX Requests (CRITICAL NODE):](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_server-side_handling_of_htmx_requests__critical_node_.md)

* This high-risk path targets vulnerabilities in how the server-side application processes requests originating from HTMX. If the server doesn't properly validate and sanitize input, it can be susceptible to various injection attacks.

    * **3.1. Server-Side Injection Attacks via HTMX Parameters (CRITICAL NODE):**
        * **Attack Vector:** Malicious data is injected into HTMX request parameters, and the server-side application fails to sanitize this input before using it in database queries, system commands, or when generating responses.
        * **3.1.1. SQL Injection (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious SQL code into HTMX request parameters. If the server-side application uses this unsanitized input in SQL queries, it can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium
            * **Impact:** Critical (Full database compromise possible)
            * **Effort:** Low
            * **Skill Level:** Medium
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Low
        * **3.1.2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTMX Responses (CRITICAL NODE):**
            * **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into HTMX request parameters. The server-side application includes this unsanitized script in the HTMX response. When the browser processes this response, the malicious script is executed, potentially compromising the user's session or performing actions on their behalf.
            * **Likelihood:** Medium
            * **Impact:** High (Can lead to session hijacking, data theft)
            * **Effort:** Low
            * **Skill Level:** Low
            * **Detection Difficulty:** Low

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Abuse HTMX Features for Malicious Purposes:](./attack_tree_paths/4__abuse_htmx_features_for_malicious_purposes.md)

* This high-risk path involves misusing the intended functionality of HTMX to perform malicious actions.

    * **4.1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) via HTMX:**
        * **Attack Vector:** An attacker tricks a logged-in user into making unintended HTMX requests to the application. Since HTMX simplifies making AJAX-like requests, it can be easier for attackers to craft malicious links or embed them in other websites that trigger these requests when a victim visits. If proper anti-CSRF tokens are not implemented, these requests will be processed by the server as if they were legitimate actions by the user.
        * **Likelihood:** Medium
        * **Impact:** Medium (Can lead to unauthorized actions on behalf of the user)
        * **Effort:** Low
        * **Skill Level:** Low
        * **Detection Difficulty:** Low
