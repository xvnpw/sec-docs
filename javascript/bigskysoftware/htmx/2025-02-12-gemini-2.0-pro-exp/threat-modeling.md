# Threat Model Analysis for bigskysoftware/htmx

## Threat: [DOM Manipulation via `hx-target` and `hx-swap`](./threats/dom_manipulation_via__hx-target__and__hx-swap_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Unauthorized DOM Modification
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious server response or exploits a client-side vulnerability to modify the `hx-target` or `hx-swap` attributes.  They could then inject arbitrary HTML, potentially including malicious scripts or alter existing content, into unintended parts of the page.  For example, they might change `hx-target` to point to a sensitive area displaying user data or containing hidden form fields. They might change `hx-swap` from `innerHTML` to `outerHTML` to replace a larger portion of the DOM. This directly leverages htmx's core functionality for malicious purposes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript (XSS).
    *   Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data from the manipulated DOM).
    *   Defacement of the application.
    *   Phishing attacks (by injecting deceptive content).
    *   Bypass of security controls (e.g., manipulating form fields or hidden tokens).
*   **Affected htmx Component:** `hx-target` and `hx-swap` attributes.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side Validation:**  Never directly reflect user input into `hx-target` or `hx-swap`. Use a whitelist of allowed, pre-defined targets and swap methods.
    *   **Prefer Static Targets:** Use static `hx-target` values whenever possible.
    *   **Use `hx-select`:**  Extract only the necessary portion of the server response using `hx-select`, limiting the impact of a compromised response.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit the execution of injected scripts.

## Threat: [Unintended Script Execution via `hx-trigger`](./threats/unintended_script_execution_via__hx-trigger_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Client-Side Code Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the `hx-trigger` attribute, potentially combined with a crafted server response containing inline event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onclick`).  If the server reflects user input into `hx-trigger` or the response includes unexpected inline handlers, the attacker could trigger immediate execution of JavaScript upon the response being loaded.  This bypasses htmx's built-in protection against `<script>` tag execution and directly exploits htmx's event handling mechanism.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript (XSS).
    *   Data theft.
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Malware distribution.
*   **Affected htmx Component:** `hx-trigger` attribute, and the processing of server responses containing inline event handlers.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sanitize Server Responses:**  Thoroughly sanitize server responses to remove any unintended inline event handlers or JavaScript.
    *   **Controlled `hx-trigger`:**  Avoid reflecting user input into `hx-trigger`. Use a whitelist of allowed trigger events.
    *   **Avoid Inline Handlers:**  Use `htmx.on` or event delegation instead of inline event handlers in server responses.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strong CSP can mitigate the impact of injected scripts.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage via `hx-vals`](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_via__hx-vals_.md)

*   **Threat:**  Data Exposure
*   **Description:** An attacker observes network traffic or server logs to obtain sensitive data inadvertently included in htmx requests via `hx-vals`. This could happen if `hx-vals` is dynamically populated with sensitive information (e.g., session tokens, user IDs) or if it includes unnecessary data from the DOM. This is a direct consequence of how `hx-vals` is used to transmit data.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive user data.
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Account compromise.
*   **Affected htmx Component:** `hx-vals` attribute.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Explicit `hx-vals`:**  Carefully define the values included in `hx-vals`. Avoid wildcards or automatic inclusion of all form data.
    *   **Prefer POST Requests:** Use POST requests for htmx interactions involving sensitive data.
    *   **Don't Store Secrets in DOM:** Avoid storing sensitive data in the DOM.
    *   **Secure Server-Side Logging:**  Configure server logs to avoid recording sensitive request data.

## Threat: [Client-Side Validation Bypass](./threats/client-side_validation_bypass.md)

*   **Threat:** Bypass of Security Checks
*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates htmx attributes or server responses to disable or circumvent client-side validation implemented using htmx extensions or custom JavaScript that *directly interacts with htmx attributes*. For example, they might remove `hx-trigger` modifiers that enforce validation or craft a response that bypasses the validation logic *that depends on htmx*.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Submission of invalid or malicious data.
    *   Bypass of security controls.
    *   Potential for other vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS) if server-side validation is weak.
*   **Affected htmx Component:** Any htmx attribute or extension used for client-side validation *that relies on htmx functionality*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Validation is Essential:** Never rely solely on client-side validation. Always perform thorough validation on the server.
    *   **Defense in Depth:** Consider techniques to make it harder to tamper with htmx attributes, but don't rely on them as the primary defense.
