## Mitigation Strategy: [Strategic Use of `hx-swap`](./mitigation_strategies/strategic_use_of__hx-swap_.md)

**1.  Strategic Use of `hx-swap`**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze HTML injection points:** For each htmx interaction, carefully consider where the received HTML fragment will be inserted into the DOM.
    2.  **Choose the safest `hx-swap` value:** Select the `hx-swap` value that provides the necessary functionality with the *least* risk of script execution.
        *   **Prefer:** `innerHTML`, `outerHTML`, `beforebegin`, `afterbegin`, `beforeend`, `afterend`, `delete`.
        *   **Use with extreme caution:** `morph` (if you don't fully control the content), `none` (if you're not carefully managing the response).
    3.  **Avoid unnecessary script execution:** If you don't need to execute scripts within the swapped content, choose a `hx-swap` value that prevents it.
    4.  **Combine with server-side sanitization:** Even with careful `hx-swap` selection, always sanitize and encode server-side output.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: Critical) - By limiting the ways HTML can be injected, you reduce the attack surface for XSS.  Certain `hx-swap` values are inherently safer than others.
    *   **HTML Injection:** (Severity: High) - Similar to XSS, controlling the injection method limits the potential for disruptive HTML manipulation.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduced from Critical to Medium (must be combined with server-side encoding for Low risk).
    *   **HTML Injection:** Risk reduced from High to Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `hx-swap="innerHTML"` is used in most places.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `hx-swap="outerHTML"` is used in one instance (`/product/update`) where `innerHTML` would be sufficient and safer.  This should be reviewed.
    *   No consistent review process for `hx-swap` choices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [htmx-Specific CSRF Protection with `hx-headers`](./mitigation_strategies/htmx-specific_csrf_protection_with__hx-headers_.md)

**2.  htmx-Specific CSRF Protection with `hx-headers`**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate CSRF tokens (server-side):** Ensure your server-side framework generates unique, unpredictable CSRF tokens for each user session.
    2.  **Include token in `hx-headers`:**  For *every* htmx request that modifies data (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH), use the `hx-headers` attribute to include the CSRF token.
        *   **Example:** `<button hx-post="/delete-item" hx-headers='{"X-CSRF-Token": "{{ csrf_token }}"}'>Delete</button>`
        *   **JavaScript alternative:** If you're using JavaScript to trigger htmx requests, you can add the headers dynamically: `htmx.ajax('POST', '/delete-item', {headers: {'X-CSRF-Token': getCsrfToken()}});`
    3.  **Server-side validation:**  Your server *must* validate the CSRF token on every corresponding request.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from forging requests that appear to come from legitimate users.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **CSRF:** Risk reduced from High to Low (when combined with server-side validation).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No `hx-headers` usage for CSRF tokens.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   This is a critical missing implementation across *all* htmx requests that modify data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Redirects with `hx-redirect` (and Server-Side Validation)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_redirects_with__hx-redirect___and_server-side_validation_.md)

**3.  Safe Redirects with `hx-redirect` (and Server-Side Validation)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid user input directly in `hx-redirect`:**  The *ideal* scenario is to avoid using any user-supplied data to determine the redirect URL.  Use server-side logic.
    2.  **If user input is unavoidable:**
        *   **Whitelist:** Maintain a server-side whitelist of allowed redirect URLs or URL patterns.
        *   **Strict validation:**  Before setting the `hx-redirect` header on the server, *rigorously* validate the target URL against the whitelist and/or a strict, predefined pattern.
        *   **No open redirects:**  Never allow a completely arbitrary URL provided by the user.
    3.  **Server-side control:** The `hx-redirect` attribute itself is just an instruction; the *server* sets the actual `Location` header.  The security responsibility lies entirely on the server.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirects:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from using your application to redirect users to malicious websites.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirects:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low (with proper server-side validation).

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `hx-redirect` is used, but without any server-side validation of the redirect target.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   The crucial server-side validation and whitelisting are completely missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Error Handling with `hx-swap-oob`](./mitigation_strategies/error_handling_with__hx-swap-oob_.md)

**4.  Error Handling with `hx-swap-oob`**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dedicated error element:** Create a designated HTML element (e.g., a `<div>`) in your layout specifically for displaying error messages.  Give it a unique ID.
    2.  **`hx-swap-oob="true"`:**  On this error element, add the attribute `hx-swap-oob="true"`.
    3.  **Server-side error handling:**  When an htmx request fails on the server:
        *   **Catch the error:** Use appropriate error handling mechanisms (try-except blocks).
        *   **Log details (server-side):** Log the full error details for debugging.
        *   **Return a generic error message:**  In the htmx response, return an HTML fragment containing a *generic* error message.  Do *not* include any sensitive information.
        *   **Target the error element:**  Ensure the returned HTML fragment has the same ID as your dedicated error element.  htmx will automatically swap it into place because of `hx-swap-oob="true"`.
    4.  **Example:**
        ```html
        <div id="error-message" hx-swap-oob="true" style="display: none;"></div>

        <!-- ... other content ... -->

        <!-- Server-side (Python/Flask example): -->
        @app.route('/my-htmx-endpoint', methods=['POST'])
        def my_htmx_endpoint():
            try:
                # ... process the request ...
            except Exception as e:
                logging.exception("Error in /my-htmx-endpoint")  # Log details
                return '<div id="error-message">An unexpected error occurred.</div>', 500
        ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents sensitive error details from being displayed to the user.
    *   **Improved User Experience:** (Severity: Low) - Provides a cleaner way to handle errors without disrupting the main UI flow.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced from Medium to Low.
    *   **User Experience:** Improved.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Errors are often displayed inline, potentially revealing sensitive information.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Complete implementation is missing.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Controlling Request Behavior with `hx-request`](./mitigation_strategies/controlling_request_behavior_with__hx-request_.md)

**5. Controlling Request Behavior with `hx-request`**

* **Description:**
    1. **Review `hx-request` usage:** Examine all instances where `hx-request` is used.
    2. **`include` option:** Use the `include` option to specify exactly which elements' values should be included in the request. This prevents unintended data from being sent.
    3. **`withCredentials` option:** Carefully consider the `withCredentials` option. If set to `true`, cookies and other credentials will be sent with the request. Ensure this is necessary and desired. If not, set it to `false` (the default).
    4. **Server-Side Validation is Key:** Remember that `hx-request` only controls *what* is sent; the server *must* still validate all received data.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Data Leakage:** (Severity: Low to Medium) - By controlling which data is included in requests, you reduce the risk of accidentally sending sensitive information.
    * **CSRF (Indirectly):** (Severity: High) - Proper use of `withCredentials`, combined with other CSRF protections, helps prevent CSRF attacks.

* **Impact:**
    * **Data Leakage:** Risk reduced.
    * **CSRF:** Contributes to overall CSRF mitigation.

* **Currently Implemented:**
    * `hx-request` is not used extensively.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    * A review of existing htmx requests to determine if `hx-request` could be used to improve security is needed.
