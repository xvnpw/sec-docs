## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate htmx Attributes to Trigger Unintended Actions](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_htmx_attributes_to_trigger_unintended_actions.md)

*   **Description:** This path represents the attacker's ability to modify htmx attributes on the client-side to cause the application to behave in unexpected and potentially harmful ways. This is a high-risk path due to the ease of manipulation and the potential for significant impact.
*   **Mitigation (General for this Path):**
    *   Server-Side Validation: Always validate all request parameters and user permissions on the server, regardless of client-side htmx attributes.
    *   Attribute Immutability (Ideal): Design the application so that critical htmx attributes are not modifiable by the client after initial rendering.
    *   Input Sanitization: Sanitize any user input that might influence htmx attributes.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 HX-Trigger Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_hx-trigger_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Modifying the `hx-trigger` attribute to trigger requests on unexpected events (e.g., changing `click` to `mouseover` or injecting custom events).
    *   **Attack Scenario:** Changing a "delete" action's trigger from `click` to `mouseover`, causing accidental deletions.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation (Specific):**
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Restrict allowed event types.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 HX-Target Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_hx-target_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Changing the `hx-target` attribute to direct the response to an unintended element, potentially overwriting sensitive data or injecting malicious content.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** Redirecting a comment update request to target the `#admin-panel` element, potentially injecting malicious content.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation (Specific):**
        *   Server-Side Target Validation: The server *must* determine the correct target element based on the request, not the client-provided `hx-target`.
        *   Strict Output Encoding: Encode all server responses to prevent XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3 HX-Swap Manipulation](./attack_tree_paths/1_3_hx-swap_manipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Altering the `hx-swap` attribute to change how the returned HTML is inserted, potentially enabling XSS attacks that would otherwise be prevented.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** Changing `hx-swap` from `outerHTML` to `innerHTML` to allow script execution within a returned HTML snippet.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation (Specific):**
        *   Server-Side Swap Control: The server should dictate the swap strategy.
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Restrict inline script execution.
        *   Sanitize and Encode: Always sanitize and encode server responses.
        *   Avoid innerHTML: Prefer safer swap strategies when possible.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Exposed by htmx](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_exposed_by_htmx.md)

*   **Description:** This node represents the most severe class of attacks, where htmx is used as a vector to exploit underlying server-side vulnerabilities. This is critical because successful exploitation can lead to complete application compromise.
*   **Mitigation (General for this Node):**
    *   Robust Authentication and Authorization: Ensure only authorized users can access sensitive data and perform actions.
    *   Input Validation and Sanitization: Validate and sanitize all user input on the server-side.
    *   Output Encoding: Encode all data returned from the server to prevent XSS.
    *   CSRF Protection: Implement standard CSRF protection mechanisms.
    *   Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1 XSS via HX-Swap](./attack_tree_paths/3_1_xss_via_hx-swap.md)

*   **Description:** Injecting malicious JavaScript through unsanitized user input returned in an htmx response and inserted into the DOM via `hx-swap`.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** A user submits a comment containing a `<script>` tag.  If the server doesn't sanitize this input, and it's returned in an htmx response, the script could execute in other users' browsers.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation (Specific):**
        *   Strict Output Encoding: Encode all data for the appropriate context (HTML, JavaScript, etc.).
        *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Restrict script execution.
        *   Input Sanitization: Sanitize input *before* storing and *before* returning.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2 CSRF via HX-Trigger](./attack_tree_paths/3_2_csrf_via_hx-trigger.md)

*   **Description:** Tricking a user into triggering an htmx request (often through a malicious website) that performs an unauthorized action on their behalf.  The predictability of `hx-trigger` can facilitate this.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker crafts a malicious link that, when clicked by a logged-in user, triggers an htmx request to delete their account.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Mitigation (Specific):**
        *   CSRF Tokens: Include unique, unpredictable tokens in each request and validate them on the server.
        *   SameSite Cookies: Use `SameSite` cookies to restrict cross-origin cookie sending.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.3 Sensitive Data Exposure](./attack_tree_paths/3_3_sensitive_data_exposure.md)

*   **Description:**  Crafting htmx requests to retrieve sensitive data that the user should not have access to, due to insufficient authorization checks on the server.
    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker discovers an htmx endpoint that returns user data.  By modifying request parameters, they might be able to retrieve data for other users.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Mitigation (Specific):**
        *   Robust Authorization: Enforce strict authorization checks on every request that accesses sensitive data.
        *   Least Privilege: Grant users only the minimum necessary permissions.
