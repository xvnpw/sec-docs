## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via HTMX Exploitation (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_htmx_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a successful breach of the application's security. It signifies that the attacker has achieved their objective by exploiting weaknesses related to HTMX.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities Introduced by HTMX (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_htmx__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on leveraging HTMX's client-side functionalities to inject malicious content or trigger unintended actions within the user's browser. HTMX's dynamic content loading and manipulation capabilities can be exploited if not handled securely.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTMX Response Injection (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_htmx_response_injection__high-risk_path_.md)

This attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into the HTML content that the server sends back in response to an HTMX request. When this response is processed by the client-side HTMX library and inserted into the DOM, the injected script executes in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Script in Server Response Targeted by HTMX (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_script_in_server_response_targeted_by_htmx__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents the point where the malicious script is introduced into the HTMX response. This can happen due to server-side vulnerabilities that allow unsanitized user input to be included in the response.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server-Side Vulnerability Allows Unsanitized Data in HTMX Response (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/server-side_vulnerability_allows_unsanitized_data_in_htmx_response__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This is a fundamental security flaw where the server-side application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-provided data before including it in the HTML fragments sent back to the client via HTMX. This lack of sanitization allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.

## Attack Tree Path: [Stored XSS payload displayed in HTMX response (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/stored_xss_payload_displayed_in_htmx_response__high-risk_path_.md)

In this scenario, the malicious script is not injected in real-time but is already stored within the application's data (e.g., in a database). When an HTMX request triggers the display of this stored data, the malicious script is included in the response and executed in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage HTMX's `hx-swap` or `hx-target` for DOM Manipulation (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_htmx's__hx-swap__or__hx-target__for_dom_manipulation__high-risk_path_.md)

HTMX attributes like `hx-swap` and `hx-target` control how the content received from the server is integrated into the existing DOM. Attackers can exploit this by crafting malicious HTML payloads that, when swapped into the DOM, execute scripts or perform other harmful actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious HTML that executes scripts upon swap (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_html_that_executes_scripts_upon_swap__critical_node_.md)

This critical node highlights the danger of directly injecting unsanitized HTML containing `<script>` tags or event handlers that execute malicious code when the HTMX swap operation occurs.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Vulnerabilities Exposed or Amplified by HTMX (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_vulnerabilities_exposed_or_amplified_by_htmx__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

HTMX's ability to make asynchronous requests can expose or amplify existing server-side vulnerabilities if the server-side application is not designed with security in mind. The ease with which HTMX can send data to the server can make exploitation simpler.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Unsanitized Input in HTMX Requests (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in_htmx_requests__high-risk_path_.md)

If the server-side application uses data received from HTMX requests to execute system commands without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious commands into the request parameters, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [SQL Injection via Unsanitized Input in HTMX Requests (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/sql_injection_via_unsanitized_input_in_htmx_requests__high-risk_path_.md)

Similar to command injection, if the server-side application uses data from HTMX requests to construct SQL queries without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the request parameters, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies or Integrations Used with HTMX (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_or_integrations_used_with_htmx__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

Applications using HTMX often rely on other libraries and frameworks on the server-side to handle requests and responses. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited by attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Vulnerabilities in Libraries Used for Server-Side HTMX Processing (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_libraries_used_for_server-side_htmx_processing__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

This path highlights the risk of using third-party libraries or frameworks that have known security vulnerabilities. If the server-side application uses such vulnerable libraries to process HTMX requests, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application.
