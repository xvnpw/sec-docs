# Attack Surface Analysis for bigskysoftware/htmx

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Server Responses](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_server_responses.md)

**Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the HTML content sent by the server in response to an htmx request. When htmx swaps this content into the DOM, the script executes in the user's browser.

**How htmx Contributes:** htmx's core functionality involves fetching and swapping HTML content. If the server doesn't sanitize data before sending it in response to htmx requests, it becomes a direct vector for delivering malicious scripts. The `hx-swap` and `hx-target` attributes control where and how this potentially malicious content is inserted.

**Example:** A server responding to an htmx request with: `<div id="content">Hello <script>alert('XSS')</script></div>`. If `hx-target="#content"` and `hx-swap="innerHTML"` are used, the script will execute.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session, including stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, and performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Server-Side Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided data before including it in server responses, especially those intended for htmx swaps. Use context-aware escaping techniques.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
*   **Consider `hx-swap="outerHTML swap:once"`:**  While not a complete solution, using `swap:once` can limit the execution of scripts to the initial swap. However, be mindful of the intended behavior.

## Attack Surface: [DOM Manipulation Leading to XSS or Functionality Disruption](./attack_surfaces/dom_manipulation_leading_to_xss_or_functionality_disruption.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate the DOM structure or attributes in ways that cause htmx to behave unexpectedly, potentially leading to XSS or breaking application functionality.

**How htmx Contributes:** htmx relies on specific DOM structures and attributes (e.g., elements with certain IDs or classes targeted by `hx-target`). If an attacker can inject or modify HTML before htmx processes it, they can influence htmx's behavior.

**Example:** An attacker injects `<div id="targetElement"><script>maliciousCode</script></div>` before an htmx request targets `#targetElement` with `hx-swap="innerHTML"`. The injected script might execute before the intended content is swapped.

**Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts (XSS), disruption of application functionality, unexpected behavior.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Secure Client-Side Templating:** Use secure templating libraries that prevent injection vulnerabilities when dynamically generating HTML on the client-side.
*   **Careful Handling of User-Generated Content:**  Sanitize or escape any user-generated content that might influence the DOM structure before htmx interacts with it.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege for DOM Access:** Limit the scope and permissions of client-side JavaScript that can directly manipulate the DOM.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Manipulated htmx Attributes](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_manipulated_htmx_attributes.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate htmx attributes that define the target URL for requests (e.g., `hx-get`, `hx-post`) to force the server to make requests to unintended internal or external resources.

**How htmx Contributes:** htmx attributes directly control the URLs to which AJAX requests are sent. If these attributes are dynamically generated based on user input without proper validation, attackers can inject arbitrary URLs.

**Example:** A form with a hidden field controlling `hx-post` is manipulated to point to an internal service: `<form hx-post="http://internal-service/sensitive-data">...</form>`.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, launching attacks from the server's IP address.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Server-Side URL Validation:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all URLs received from the client, especially those used in htmx requests. Use allow-lists for permitted domains or paths.
*   **Avoid Dynamic Generation of Critical htmx Attributes:** Minimize the dynamic generation of attributes like `hx-get` and `hx-post` based on user input. If necessary, use secure methods to map user input to predefined, safe URLs.
*   **Network Segmentation:**  Isolate internal services from the internet to limit the impact of SSRF vulnerabilities.
