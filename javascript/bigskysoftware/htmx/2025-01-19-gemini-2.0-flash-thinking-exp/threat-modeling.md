## Threat: [Malicious HTMX Attribute Injection](./threats/malicious_htmx_attribute_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTMX attributes into the HTML rendered by the server. This could be achieved through exploiting other vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or by compromising server-side components that generate HTML. The attacker could inject attributes like `hx-get`, `hx-post`, `hx-trigger`, `hx-target`, and `hx-swap` with attacker-controlled values.

**Impact:**
*   **Arbitrary Request Execution:** The injected attributes could force the client's browser to make unintended requests to attacker-controlled URLs, potentially leading to data exfiltration, triggering malicious actions on other systems, or participating in botnet activities.
*   **DOM Manipulation and Defacement:** Attackers could manipulate the DOM by controlling `hx-target` and `hx-swap`, potentially replacing legitimate content with misleading or malicious information, leading to phishing attacks or defacement of the application.
*   **Triggering Unintended Server-Side Actions:** By crafting specific requests through injected attributes, attackers might be able to trigger server-side actions that they are not authorized to perform.

**Affected HTMX Component:**
*   **Attribute Parsing and Request Initiation:** The core HTMX logic that parses HTML attributes and initiates AJAX requests based on them.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Robust Output Encoding/Escaping:**  Ensure all data dynamically inserted into HTML templates is properly encoded/escaped to prevent the injection of malicious HTML attributes. This is a crucial defense against XSS, which is a primary vector for this threat.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP that restricts the sources from which the application can load resources and limits the execution of inline scripts and event handlers. This can help mitigate the impact of injected attributes.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities that could be exploited to inject malicious HTMX attributes.

## Threat: [Malicious Server Response Leading to Indirect Client-Side Code Execution (Indirect XSS)](./threats/malicious_server_response_leading_to_indirect_client-side_code_execution__indirect_xss_.md)

**Description:** The server, in response to an HTMX request, sends back HTML content that contains malicious JavaScript. Because HTMX directly swaps this content into the DOM based on the `hx-target` and `hx-swap` attributes, the malicious script gets executed in the user's browser.

**Impact:**
*   **Full Client-Side Compromise:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, data exfiltration, redirection to malicious sites, and further attacks on the user's system.

**Affected HTMX Component:**
*   **DOM Swapping Logic:** The core functionality of HTMX that replaces parts of the DOM with the server's response.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strict Output Encoding/Escaping on the Server:**  Thoroughly encode or escape all dynamic data before including it in the HTML fragments sent as HTMX responses. This is the primary defense against XSS.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP that restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded and disallows inline scripts. This can significantly reduce the impact of injected malicious scripts.
*   **Regular Security Audits:** Regularly review server-side code responsible for generating HTMX responses to ensure proper output encoding.
