# Threat Model Analysis for bigskysoftware/htmx

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection via HTMX Responses](./threats/server-side_template_injection_via_htmx_responses.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Template Injection
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTMX request to inject code into server-side templates. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server or access sensitive data. This is achieved by exploiting vulnerabilities in the server-side templating engine when processing user-controlled data within HTMX responses.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full server compromise, including unauthorized data access, data modification, and service disruption.
*   **HTMX Component Affected:** Server-side templating engine used to render HTML fragments for HTMX responses.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Use secure and up-to-date templating engines.
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all user-provided data before incorporating it into server-side templates, especially data used in HTMX responses.
    *   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the capabilities of any injected scripts, even if template injection occurs.
    *   Regularly audit server-side code and templates for template injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Client-Side DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTMX Attributes and Responses](./threats/client-side_dom-based_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_htmx_attributes_and_responses.md)

*   **Threat:** DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code that executes in the user's browser. This can be achieved by manipulating HTMX attributes like `hx-vals`, `hx-headers`, or `hx-include` with malicious data, or by exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application handles and renders server responses containing user-provided data within the DOM. Successful exploitation can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or website defacement.
*   **Impact:** High. Account takeover, theft of sensitive user data, website defacement, and malware distribution.
*   **HTMX Component Affected:** HTMX attributes (`hx-vals`, `hx-headers`, `hx-include`), HTMX response processing and DOM manipulation.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and encode user-provided data on the server-side before including it in HTMX responses. Use context-aware output encoding appropriate for HTML, JavaScript, CSS, etc.
    *   Exercise caution when using HTMX attributes that incorporate user-controlled data. Validate and sanitize client-side data before using it in these attributes.
    *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks by restricting script sources and other browser behaviors.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and remediate potential XSS vulnerabilities in HTMX templates and server-side code.
