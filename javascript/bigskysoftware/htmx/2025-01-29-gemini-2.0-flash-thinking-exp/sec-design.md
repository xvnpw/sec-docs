# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Goal: Simplify the development of modern, dynamic web applications.
 - Goal: Enhance user experience by enabling smoother, more interactive web pages without full page reloads.
 - Goal: Reduce server load and improve application performance by minimizing data transfer and processing.
 - Priority: Developer productivity and ease of use.
 - Priority: Performance and efficiency of web applications.
- Business Risks:
 - Risk: Security vulnerabilities in htmx library could be exploited in applications using it, leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
 - Risk: Improper use of htmx by developers could introduce security vulnerabilities into web applications.
 - Risk: Dependency on a third-party library introduces potential supply chain risks.
 - Risk: Lack of comprehensive documentation or community support could hinder adoption and increase development time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, enabling community review and contribution. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
 - security control: Open-source license, allowing for public scrutiny and audits. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
 - security control: Standard development practices for a JavaScript library, likely including testing and linting. (Description: Assumed based on typical open-source projects)
- Accepted Risks:
 - accepted risk: Reliance on client-side JavaScript execution, which is inherently less secure than server-side processing.
 - accepted risk: Potential for client-side manipulation of htmx requests and responses.
 - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by htmx.
- Recommended Security Controls:
 - recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST, dependency checking) in the CI/CD pipeline for htmx development.
 - recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits of the htmx codebase by security experts.
 - recommended security control: Provide clear security guidelines and best practices for developers using htmx in their applications.
 - recommended security control: Establish a process for reporting and addressing security vulnerabilities in htmx.
- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication:
  - Requirement: Authentication is not directly handled by htmx itself. Applications using htmx must implement their own authentication mechanisms on the server-side.
  - Requirement: htmx should not introduce any vulnerabilities that could bypass or weaken application authentication.
 - Authorization:
  - Requirement: Authorization is not directly handled by htmx itself. Applications using htmx must implement their own authorization mechanisms on the server-side to control access to resources and functionalities.
  - Requirement: htmx should not introduce any vulnerabilities that could bypass or weaken application authorization.
 - Input Validation:
  - Requirement: htmx should properly handle and sanitize user inputs to prevent XSS vulnerabilities within the library itself.
  - Requirement: Applications using htmx must perform thorough input validation on both client-side and server-side to protect against various injection attacks.
  - Requirement: htmx should encourage or provide mechanisms for developers to easily sanitize data rendered dynamically.
 - Cryptography:
  - Requirement: Cryptography is not a core functionality of htmx. If cryptographic operations are needed, they should be implemented by the application using htmx, leveraging secure browser APIs or server-side cryptography.
  - Requirement: htmx should not interfere with or weaken cryptographic implementations in applications using it.
  - Requirement: If htmx handles sensitive data in transit (e.g., via AJAX requests), ensure HTTPS is used to encrypt communication.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
 - Process: Development and maintenance of the htmx library itself.
 - Process: Usage of htmx library by developers to build web applications.
 - Process: Distribution and availability of the htmx library.
- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
 - Data: htmx library source code. Sensitivity: High (integrity and confidentiality of the source code are important to prevent malicious modifications and maintain trust).
 - Data: Build artifacts (JavaScript files). Sensitivity: High (integrity and availability of the build artifacts are crucial for users relying on the library).
 - Data: Usage data (indirectly, through applications using htmx). Sensitivity: Depends on the applications using htmx. htmx itself does not directly handle sensitive user data.
