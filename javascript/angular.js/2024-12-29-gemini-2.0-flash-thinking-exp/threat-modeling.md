Here is the updated threat list, focusing only on high and critical threats directly involving AngularJS:

**High and Critical Threats Directly Involving AngularJS**

* **Threat:** Client-Side Template Injection (CSTI)
    * **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into AngularJS templates by exploiting the way AngularJS evaluates expressions within double curly braces `{{ }}` or directives like `ng-bind-html`. The attacker crafts input that, when rendered by AngularJS, executes arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This directly leverages AngularJS's template rendering engine.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, leading to:
        * Stealing user credentials or session tokens.
        * Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
        * Defacing the application.
        * Performing actions on behalf of the user.
        * Injecting malware.
    * **Affected Component:** Template rendering, expression evaluation (`{{ }}`), directives like `ng-bind-html`.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid using `ng-bind-html` with untrusted data.**
        * **Sanitize user input on the server-side before rendering it in the template.**
        * **Use AngularJS's built-in escaping mechanisms where appropriate.**
        * **Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP).**

* **Threat:** AngularJS Expression Sandbox Bypass
    * **Description:** In older versions of AngularJS, an attacker could bypass the expression sandbox (a security mechanism within AngularJS intended to prevent arbitrary JavaScript execution). By crafting specific expressions, they could gain access to privileged JavaScript objects and functions, allowing them to execute arbitrary code. This is a direct vulnerability in AngularJS's expression evaluation.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, similar to CSTI, with the same potential consequences (data theft, redirection, etc.).
    * **Affected Component:** Expression evaluation engine.
    * **Risk Severity:** High (for older AngularJS versions)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Do not rely on the AngularJS expression sandbox as a primary security measure.**
        * **Focus on proper input sanitization and output encoding.**
        * **Upgrade to the latest version of AngularJS (though AngularJS 1.x is no longer actively developed).**

* **Threat:** Directive Vulnerabilities
    * **Description:**  Custom or third-party AngularJS directives can introduce vulnerabilities if not implemented securely. Directives have direct access to the DOM and the application scope within the AngularJS framework. A poorly written directive could be susceptible to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through DOM manipulation or by mishandling user input within the directive's scope.
    * **Impact:**  XSS vulnerabilities leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution, similar to CSTI.
    * **Affected Component:** Custom or third-party directives.
    * **Risk Severity:** Medium to High (depending on the directive's functionality and exposure)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Thoroughly review and audit custom directives for security flaws.**
        * **Exercise caution when using third-party directives from untrusted sources.**
        * **Follow secure coding practices when developing directives, including proper input validation and output encoding.**
        * **Be mindful of the security context within directives and avoid direct DOM manipulation with untrusted data.**
