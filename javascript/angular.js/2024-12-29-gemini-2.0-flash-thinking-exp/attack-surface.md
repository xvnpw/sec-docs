Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving AngularJS, with high and critical severity:

* **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Unsafe Interpolation**
    * **Description:**  Rendering user-controlled data directly into the HTML without proper sanitization, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    * **How AngularJS Contributes:** AngularJS's default interpolation (`{{ }}`) can render HTML. If this is used with unsanitized user input, the browser will execute any script tags or malicious HTML within that input.
    * **Example:**  A comment section where user input `"<img src='x' onerror='alert(\"XSS\")'>"` is directly rendered using `{{comment}}`.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Always sanitize user input before rendering it in templates. Use AngularJS's `$sanitize` service (requires including the `ngSanitize` module). Prefer `ng-bind` for plain text output. Avoid using `ng-bind-html` with untrusted data. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

* **Attack Surface: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `ng-bind-html`**
    * **Description:**  Explicitly rendering HTML content using the `ng-bind-html` directive without proper sanitization.
    * **How AngularJS Contributes:** The `ng-bind-html` directive is designed to render HTML. If the expression bound to it contains user-controlled data that hasn't been sanitized, it becomes a direct XSS vector.
    * **Example:**  Displaying user-generated rich text content using `<div ng-bind-html="userHtmlContent"></div>` where `userHtmlContent` is directly from user input.
    * **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the user's browser, similar to unsafe interpolation.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Sanitize the HTML content *before* binding it to `ng-bind-html`. Use a trusted HTML sanitization library (like the one provided by AngularJS's `$sanitize` service) on the server-side or client-side before rendering. Avoid using `ng-bind-html` if possible, or restrict its usage to trusted sources.

* **Attack Surface: Client-Side Logic and Sensitive Data Exposure**
    * **Description:**  Sensitive business logic, API keys, or other confidential information being present in the client-side AngularJS code.
    * **How AngularJS Contributes:**  AngularJS is a client-side framework, meaning all its code, including controllers, services, and templates, is downloaded to the user's browser. This makes it easily inspectable.
    * **Example:**  Hardcoding an API key directly within an AngularJS service to communicate with a backend.
    * **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data, allowing attackers to access protected resources, impersonate users, or gain unauthorized access to backend systems.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  Never hardcode sensitive information in client-side code. Implement business logic and access control on the server-side. Use secure methods for handling API keys (e.g., environment variables, secure vault). Consider using backend-for-frontend (BFF) patterns to abstract backend complexities.

* **Attack Surface: AngularJS Expression Injection**
    * **Description:**  Injecting malicious AngularJS expressions that are then evaluated by the framework, leading to arbitrary code execution within the AngularJS context.
    * **How AngularJS Contributes:** Functions like `$eval`, `$parse`, and even certain directives if used carelessly, can evaluate strings as AngularJS expressions. If user input is used in these contexts without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious expressions.
    * **Example:**  Using `$scope.$eval(userInput)` where `userInput` is directly taken from user input. An attacker could inject `window.location='http://malicious.com'` to redirect the user.
    * **Impact:**  Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the application's context, potentially leading to XSS, data manipulation, or redirection.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:**  **Absolutely avoid using `$eval` or similar functions with user-provided input.** If dynamic evaluation is necessary, carefully sanitize and validate the input against a strict whitelist. Consider alternative approaches that don't involve evaluating arbitrary strings.

* **Attack Surface: Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Rehydration Issues (if applicable)**
    * **Description:**  Inconsistencies between the server-rendered HTML and the client-side AngularJS application leading to vulnerabilities during the rehydration process.
    * **How AngularJS Contributes:** When using SSR with AngularJS, the initial HTML is rendered on the server. The client-side AngularJS application then "takes over" this DOM. If there are discrepancies, it can lead to XSS or other issues.
    * **Example:**  Server-side rendering might not properly escape user input, leading to XSS when the client-side application rehydrates.
    * **Impact:**  XSS vulnerabilities that might not be present in a purely client-side rendered application.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Developers:** Ensure consistent escaping and sanitization of user input on both the server-side rendering process and the client-side AngularJS application. Carefully manage the state and data flow during rehydration. Thoroughly test the application after implementing SSR.
