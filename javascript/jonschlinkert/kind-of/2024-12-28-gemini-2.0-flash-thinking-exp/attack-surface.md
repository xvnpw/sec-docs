* **Prototype Pollution (Indirect Contribution)**
    * **Description:** While `kind-of` doesn't directly pollute prototypes, its output might be used by application logic to make decisions about object handling. A malicious actor could craft an object that `kind-of` misidentifies, leading to incorrect assumptions and potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities elsewhere in the application.
    * **How `kind-of` Contributes:** By potentially providing an inaccurate type identification, it can mislead subsequent code that relies on this information to manipulate objects.
    * **Example:** An attacker crafts an object that `kind-of` identifies as a plain object, but it has hidden setters on its prototype. The application, trusting `kind-of`'s output, might then attempt to set properties on this object, inadvertently polluting the prototype.
    * **Impact:**  Ability to inject malicious properties into built-in JavaScript object prototypes, potentially leading to code execution or other security breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid relying solely on `kind-of`'s output for critical object handling decisions.
        * Implement more specific and robust type checking mechanisms when dealing with potentially untrusted objects.
        * Utilize techniques to prevent prototype pollution in general, such as freezing prototypes or using `Object.create(null)`.

* **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) (Potential Internal Risk)**
    * **Description:** If `kind-of` internally uses regular expressions for type detection (especially for string or object type identification), a carefully crafted input string could cause catastrophic backtracking in the regex engine, leading to a denial of service.
    * **How `kind-of` Contributes:**  If its internal regex patterns are not optimized or are vulnerable to specific input patterns, it can become a target for ReDoS attacks.
    * **Example:** Providing an extremely long string with specific repeating patterns that exploit a weakness in `kind-of`'s internal regex for string type detection.
    * **Impact:** The application becomes unresponsive or consumes excessive CPU resources, leading to denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Review the source code of `kind-of` to identify any potentially vulnerable regular expressions (if possible).
        * If using a vulnerable version, consider updating to a patched version or forking the library to fix the regex.
        * Implement input length limits or sanitization for strings passed to functions that might internally use vulnerable regex.
