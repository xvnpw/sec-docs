# Threat Model Analysis for jonschlinkert/kind-of

## Threat: [Exploiting Incorrect Type Identification for Logic Bypass](./threats/exploiting_incorrect_type_identification_for_logic_bypass.md)

* **Threat:** Exploiting Incorrect Type Identification for Logic Bypass
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts input data specifically designed to be misidentified by `kind-of`. This could lead the application to execute unintended code paths or bypass security checks that rely on accurate type identification. For example, an attacker might provide a string that `kind-of` incorrectly identifies as a number, allowing them to bypass input validation meant for strings. This directly exploits a flaw in `kind-of`'s core functionality.
    * **Impact:** Logic errors, potential security vulnerabilities due to bypassed checks, data corruption if incorrect code paths are related to data manipulation.
    * **Affected `kind-of` Component:** The core module responsible for determining the type of the input value. Specifically, the internal logic and algorithms used to classify different JavaScript types.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement defense-in-depth by not relying solely on `kind-of` for critical security decisions.
        * Add explicit type checks using native JavaScript methods (e.g., `typeof`, `instanceof`) when type accuracy is paramount for security.
        * Thoroughly test the application's behavior with various input types, including edge cases and potentially malicious inputs designed to confuse type identification within `kind-of`.
        * Consider using schema validation libraries in addition to type checking for more robust input validation.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution Facilitated by Type Confusion](./threats/prototype_pollution_facilitated_by_type_confusion.md)

* **Threat:** Prototype Pollution Facilitated by Type Confusion
    * **Description:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability within `kind-of`'s type identification logic to manipulate object prototypes. If `kind-of` incorrectly identifies an object in a way that bypasses checks intended to prevent prototype pollution, an attacker could inject malicious properties into `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes. This is a direct consequence of `kind-of`'s misclassification allowing subsequent exploitation.
    * **Impact:** Application-wide impact, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or other unexpected behavior as the injected properties can affect all objects in the application.
    * **Affected `kind-of` Component:** The core module's type identification logic, specifically its ability to distinguish between different object types and avoid misclassifications that could be exploited for prototype pollution.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Employ robust prototype pollution prevention techniques independently of `kind-of`, such as freezing critical objects or using `Object.create(null)` for dictionaries.
        * Avoid using user-controlled data directly as keys for object properties without strict validation and sanitization, regardless of `kind-of`'s output.
        * Be extremely cautious when using the output of `kind-of` to make decisions about object manipulation or property access, especially when dealing with user-provided data.
