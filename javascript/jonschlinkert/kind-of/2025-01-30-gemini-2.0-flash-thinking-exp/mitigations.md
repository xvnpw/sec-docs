## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Inputs Based on Intended Use, Not Just `kind-of` Output](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_inputs_based_on_intended_use__not_just__kind-of__output.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Determine input's intended use:** Before processing any input, clearly define how it will be used within your application (e.g., displayed in HTML, used in a database query, executed as a command).
    2.  **Use `kind-of` for type detection (optional):**  `kind-of` can be used to help determine the *type* of input, but this is secondary to sanitization.
    3.  **Apply context-specific sanitization:**  Sanitize the input based on its *intended use*, not just its type as identified by `kind-of`. For example:
        *   If displaying in HTML: Use HTML escaping to prevent XSS, regardless of whether `kind-of` identifies it as a "string".
        *   If used in a SQL query: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, regardless of whether `kind-of` identifies it as a "string" or "number".
        *   If used in a command: Use command parameterization or escaping to prevent command injection.
    4.  **Prioritize sanitization over type checking for security:**  Sanitization is the primary security control. Type checking with `kind-of` is a supplementary step that can inform further processing but should not replace sanitization.
    5.  **Test sanitization effectiveness:** Thoroughly test your sanitization logic to ensure it effectively prevents injection attacks in all intended use cases, regardless of the input types `kind-of` might identify.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   **Injection Attacks (XSS, SQLi, Command Injection):** (High Severity) - Directly mitigates injection attacks by emphasizing context-specific sanitization, regardless of `kind-of`'s type output.
        *   **Security Bypass due to Type-Based Assumptions:** (Medium Severity) - Prevents security bypasses that could occur if sanitization is incorrectly applied based solely on type assumptions derived from `kind-of` without considering the intended use.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Injection Attacks (XSS, SQLi, Command Injection):** High risk reduction - Directly reduces the risk of injection attacks by promoting robust, context-aware sanitization.
        *   **Security Bypass due to Type-Based Assumptions:** Medium risk reduction - Improves the robustness of sanitization by ensuring it's driven by intended use, not just type identification.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Input sanitization is used in some areas, particularly for XSS prevention, but may not always be context-specific or consistently applied based on intended use.
        *   `kind-of` might be used in some places for type checking, but its output is not consistently linked to sanitization logic.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   No standardized sanitization framework or library used consistently across the application, driven by intended use cases.
        *   No clear guidelines or code review checklists to ensure context-specific sanitization is implemented for all user inputs and external data sources, independent of `kind-of`'s type output.
        *   Security testing may not specifically focus on verifying the effectiveness of context-specific sanitization in preventing injection attacks.
