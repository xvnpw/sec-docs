# Attack Surface Analysis for jonschlinkert/kind-of

## Attack Surface: [Type Confusion leading to Security Bypass](./attack_surfaces/type_confusion_leading_to_security_bypass.md)

*   **Description:**  `kind-of` might misidentify the type of a JavaScript value in a way that can be predictably exploited. If application security logic relies *directly* and *unvalidated* on `kind-of`'s output, this misclassification can lead to security bypasses. This is especially critical if the application trusts `kind-of`'s type identification for access control or critical data handling.
*   **How `kind-of` contributes to the attack surface:**  By providing a type identification function, `kind-of` becomes a point of trust in the application's type checking process. If this trust is misplaced (i.e., `kind-of` is assumed to be infallible for security purposes), and `kind-of` makes a mistake, it directly opens a vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    *   An application uses `kind-of(userInput)` to check if an input is a "string" before using it as a key to access a protected resource.
    *   An attacker crafts a JavaScript object with a specific structure or overridden `toString` method that causes `kind-of` to incorrectly identify it as a "string".
    *   The application, *directly* trusting `kind-of`'s output without further validation, uses this object as a key, potentially bypassing intended access controls and granting access to sensitive resources that should only be accessible with a valid string key.
*   **Impact:**  Security bypass, unauthorized access to resources, potential for data manipulation or further exploitation depending on the application's logic and the context where the type confusion occurs.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Never rely solely on `kind-of` for security-critical type validation.**  Treat `kind-of` as a helpful utility, but **always** implement robust, application-specific input validation and sanitization *independent* of `kind-of`'s output, especially for security-sensitive operations.
    *   **Assume `kind-of` can be incorrect.** Design your security logic to be resilient to potential misclassifications by `kind-of`. Implement a "defense in depth" approach where type checking is only one layer of security, not the sole gatekeeper.
    *   **Favor explicit and stricter type checks for security contexts.**  Instead of relying on a general "kind-of" check, use more specific and reliable methods for validating data types in security-critical code paths. For example, use `typeof` checks combined with more specific validation logic relevant to the expected data format and content.
    *   **Thoroughly test input validation logic.**  Test your application's input validation with a wide range of inputs, including edge cases and potentially malicious payloads, to ensure that type confusion vulnerabilities are not exploitable, even if `kind-of` is used.
