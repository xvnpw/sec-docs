## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Application Using `kind-of` [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_application_using__kind-of___critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing damage to the application that utilizes the `kind-of` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Incorrect Type Detection [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_incorrect_type_detection__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the primary high-risk path. It relies on the core functionality of `kind-of` failing to correctly identify the type of input provided to it.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The attacker crafts specific inputs designed to mislead `kind-of` into misclassifying their type. This could involve:
        *   Exploiting edge cases in `kind-of`'s type detection logic.
        *   Providing inputs that are intentionally ambiguous or crafted to resemble a different type than they actually are (especially when dealing with objects or complex data structures).
    *   The application, trusting `kind-of`'s output, then processes this misclassified input incorrectly.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Cause Application Logic Errors [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/3__cause_application_logic_errors__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect type detection leads to errors in the application's logic. The application makes decisions or takes actions based on the flawed type information provided by `kind-of`.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application uses the type information from `kind-of` in conditional statements, routing logic, or data processing steps.
    *   Due to the misclassification, the application executes the wrong code path, leading to:
        *   Unexpected behavior.
        *   Application crashes or errors.
        *   Security vulnerabilities in the incorrectly executed code paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Bypass Input Validation [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/4__bypass_input_validation__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** This is a critical vulnerability. Applications often use type checks as a *preliminary* form of input validation. If `kind-of` is used for this purpose and is fooled, malicious input can bypass these checks.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application uses `kind-of` to check if user input is of a "safe" type (e.g., "string", "number", "plain object") before further processing or sanitization.
    *   The attacker crafts malicious payloads (e.g., XSS scripts, SQL injection code, command injection commands) disguised as a "safe" type that `kind-of` misclassifies.
    *   The application, believing the input is safe based on `kind-of`'s incorrect type identification, bypasses proper security validation and processes the malicious payload.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Inject Malicious Data (e.g., XSS, SQLi, Command Injection payloads disguised as safe types) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/5__inject_malicious_data__e_g___xss__sqli__command_injection_payloads_disguised_as_safe_types___crit_aacda23f.md)

*   **Description:** This is the direct exploitation of the bypassed input validation. Malicious code is injected into the application due to the flawed type detection.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application, having bypassed input validation due to `kind-of`'s misclassification, now processes the malicious payload.
    *   Depending on the context and the application's vulnerabilities, this can lead to:
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code is injected and executed in users' browsers, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
        *   **SQL Injection (SQLi):** Malicious SQL code is injected into database queries, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data in the database, or even gain control of the database server.
        *   **Command Injection:** Malicious commands are injected into system commands executed by the application, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Trigger Unexpected Code Paths [HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/6__trigger_unexpected_code_paths__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

*   **Description:** Even if not directly leading to injection vulnerabilities, incorrect type detection can force the application to execute code paths that are not intended for the given input. These paths might contain logic errors, security flaws, or expose sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application uses `kind-of` to determine which code path to execute based on the input type.
    *   Due to misclassification, the application enters an unintended code path.
    *   This unintended path might:
        *   Contain vulnerabilities that are not present in the intended code path.
        *   Expose internal application state or sensitive data due to different error handling or logging in that path.
        *   Lead to denial of service if the unintended path is computationally expensive or resource-intensive.
