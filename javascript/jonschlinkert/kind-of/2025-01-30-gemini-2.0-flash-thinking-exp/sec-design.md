# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project is a Javascript library called `kind-of`. It is designed to accurately determine the type of any Javascript value.

*   Business Priorities and Goals:
    *   Provide a reliable and accurate Javascript type checking utility for developers.
    *   Increase code quality and reduce bugs in Javascript projects by enabling robust type checking.
    *   Promote code reusability and efficiency by offering a well-tested and readily available type checking solution.
    *   Gain adoption and usage within the Javascript developer community.

*   Business Risks:
    *   Incorrect type identification leading to unexpected behavior or bugs in projects that depend on this library.
    *   Lack of maintenance and updates, causing the library to become outdated or incompatible with newer Javascript environments.
    *   Security vulnerabilities within the library code, although less likely for a utility library of this nature, could still impact dependent projects.
    *   Limited adoption if the library is not perceived as reliable, efficient, or well-documented compared to alternative solutions.

# SECURITY POSTURE

*   Existing Security Controls:
    *   security control: Code review by maintainers (inferred from open source nature and contribution model). Implemented during pull request reviews on GitHub.
    *   security control: Unit tests to ensure functionality and catch regressions. Described in repository's testing setup and visible in CI workflows.
    *   accepted risk: Limited formal security testing or dedicated security audits. Accepted due to the nature of a small utility library and community-driven development.
    *   accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions for identifying and reporting security issues. Accepted due to resource constraints and open-source development model.

*   Recommended Security Controls:
    *   security control: Implement automated static analysis security testing (SAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
    *   security control: Integrate dependency scanning to monitor for known vulnerabilities in any external dependencies (though this library appears to have none).
    *   security control: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities, including a security policy and contact information.
    *   security control: Regularly update dependencies and review code for potential security improvements.

*   Security Requirements:
    *   Authentication: Not applicable. This library is a utility and does not handle user authentication.
    *   Authorization: Not applicable. This library does not manage access control or authorization.
    *   Input Validation:
        *   Requirement: The library must handle all possible Javascript value types as input without crashing or producing unexpected errors.
        *   Requirement: Input validation should be performed internally to ensure robustness and prevent unexpected behavior due to malformed or unusual inputs.
    *   Cryptography: Not applicable. This library does not involve cryptographic operations or handle sensitive data requiring encryption.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Maintaining the integrity and availability of the `kind-of` library on the npm registry.
    *   Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of the type checking functionality provided by the library.
    *   Supporting the Javascript developer community by providing a useful and well-maintained utility.

*   Data Sensitivity:

    *   The data processed by the library is the Javascript values passed as input for type checking, which can be of any type and sensitivity depending on the context of use in consuming projects.
    *   The library's source code and build artifacts are considered public and are stored in a public GitHub repository and npm registry.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

*   Questions:
    *   Are there any specific industries or applications where the `kind-of` library is considered particularly critical or used in security-sensitive contexts?
    *   Are there any known vulnerabilities or past security incidents related to the `kind-of` library or similar type checking utilities?
    *   What is the expected level of security assurance required for this library? Is it intended for use in highly regulated or security-critical environments?

*   Assumptions:
    *   The primary goal of the `kind-of` library is to provide a general-purpose, accurate, and reliable Javascript type checking utility for the broader Javascript developer community.
    *   Security is important but is secondary to functionality and ease of use for a utility library of this nature.
    *   The library is intended to be distributed and used in public Javascript projects and environments.
    *   The development and maintenance of the library are primarily community-driven, with reliance on open-source best practices and community contributions for security.
