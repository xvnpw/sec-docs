## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Input Validation Beyond `kind-of` Type Checking](./mitigation_strategies/1__input_validation_beyond__kind-of__type_checking.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Semantic Input Validation *After* `kind-of` Type Check

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Input Points Using `kind-of`:** Locate all points in your application where `kind-of` is used to determine the type of user input or external data.
    2.  **Perform Basic Type Check with `kind-of`:** Use `kind-of` to confirm the input data conforms to the expected *basic* type (e.g., `kindOf(input) === 'string'`, `kindOf(input) === 'number'`).
    3.  **Apply Semantic Validation *Post* `kind-of` Check:**  Crucially, *after* the `kind-of` type check, implement detailed semantic validation rules. This ensures the input is not only of the correct type but also valid in the context of your application's logic.  This includes:
        *   **Format Validation:**  Validate string formats (email, date, etc.) using regex or parsing libraries.
        *   **Range Validation:** Check numerical ranges.
        *   **Length Validation:** Enforce string and array length limits.
        *   **Allowed Character Validation:** Restrict characters in strings.
        *   **Business Logic Validation:** Validate against application-specific rules.
    4.  **Handle Validation Failures:** If semantic validation fails *after* a successful `kind-of` type check, reject the input and provide appropriate error handling.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation (Medium to High Severity):** Relying solely on `kind-of`'s type identification as sufficient validation. Attackers could provide inputs of the correct *type* (as identified by `kind-of`) but with semantically invalid or malicious content that exploits application logic.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (Medium Severity):**  Semantically invalid data passing type checks by `kind-of` can lead to data corruption and application errors.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of vulnerabilities arising from semantically invalid input that bypasses basic type checks performed by `kind-of`.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues (High Impact):** Minimizes data corruption caused by semantically incorrect data entering the system after passing `kind-of` type checks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic type checks using `kind-of` are implemented in API input validation middleware for some endpoints.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Semantic validation rules are largely missing *after* the `kind-of` type checks in many input handling areas, both in backend and frontend code.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Careful Handling of "Object" Type Output from `kind-of`](./mitigation_strategies/2__careful_handling_of_object_type_output_from__kind-of_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:**  Use Specific Object Type Checks Instead of Generic `kind-of` "Object"

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Analyze Code Using `kind-of` "Object" Check:** Identify all code sections where `kind-of(value) === 'object'` is used.
    2.  **Determine Specific Object Type Needed:** For each instance, determine the *precise* type of object expected (e.g., plain object, array, Date, RegExp, function). Remember `kind-of` classifies many things as "object".
    3.  **Replace Generic Check with Specific Type Tests:**  Instead of just checking for `'object'` with `kind-of`, use more accurate checks based on the determined specific type:
        *   **Plain Objects:** Use `Object.prototype.toString.call(value) === '[object Object]'` or dedicated plain object detection libraries if strict plain object validation is required.
        *   **Arrays:** Use `Array.isArray(value)`.
