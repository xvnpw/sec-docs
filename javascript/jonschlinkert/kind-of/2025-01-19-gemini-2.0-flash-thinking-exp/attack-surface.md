# Attack Surface Analysis for jonschlinkert/kind-of

## Attack Surface: [Type Confusion Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/type_confusion_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:**  Applications relying on `kind-of` for type checking before critical operations might be vulnerable if `kind-of` misidentifies the type of a value. This can lead to the application executing code intended for a different data type.
    * **How `kind-of` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `kind-of` is the mechanism used for determining the type. If its logic has flaws or doesn't handle certain edge cases as expected, it can provide an incorrect type, leading to the vulnerability.
    * **Example:** An application expects an array but receives an object that `kind-of` incorrectly identifies as an array (due to specific properties or prototype manipulation). The application then attempts array operations on the object, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
    * **Impact:** Logic errors, security bypasses (if type checking is used for authorization), unexpected application behavior, potential crashes.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Sole Reliance:** Do not rely solely on `kind-of` for security-critical type checks. Use more specific and robust type checking mechanisms when necessary (e.g., `Array.isArray()`, `typeof`, `instanceof`).
        * **Input Validation:**  Implement thorough input validation to ensure data conforms to expected types and formats *before* relying on `kind-of`'s output.
        * **Defensive Programming:** Design code to handle unexpected data types gracefully, even if `kind-of` provides an incorrect result.

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution via Misinterpreted Output](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution_via_misinterpreted_output.md)

* **Description:** If an application uses the *string output* of `kind-of` to dynamically access or modify object properties, and `kind-of` returns an unexpected or attacker-controlled string (even indirectly), it could lead to prototype pollution.
    * **How `kind-of` Contributes to the Attack Surface:** `kind-of` provides the string representation of the type. If this string is then used as a key to access object properties without proper sanitization, it can become an attack vector.
    * **Example:** An application uses `kind-of(userInput)` to get a type string and then uses this string to access a property on an object: `myObject[kindOfResult] = someValue;`. If `userInput` is crafted such that `kindOfResult` becomes `__proto__` or `constructor`, it can modify the prototype chain.
    * **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) in certain environments, security bypasses by altering the behavior of built-in objects.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Using `kind-of` Output as Object Keys:**  Do not directly use the string output of `kind-of` as keys for accessing or modifying object properties, especially when dealing with user-provided data or external sources.
        * **Sanitize Output:** If you must use the output as a key, strictly sanitize it to ensure it only contains expected characters and does not include potentially dangerous prototype properties.
        * **Object.create(null):**  Consider using `Object.create(null)` for objects where prototype pollution is a concern, as these objects do not inherit from `Object.prototype`.
