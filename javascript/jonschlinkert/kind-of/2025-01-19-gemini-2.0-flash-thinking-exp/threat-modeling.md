# Threat Model Analysis for jonschlinkert/kind-of

## Threat: [Type Confusion Leading to Logic Errors](./threats/type_confusion_leading_to_logic_errors.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could provide input to the application that `kind-of` misidentifies the type of. This could lead to the application executing incorrect logic based on the flawed type information. For example, an attacker might provide a string that `kind-of` incorrectly identifies as an object, causing the application to attempt object operations on it, leading to errors or unexpected behavior.
*   **Impact:** Incorrect data processing, application errors, potential for bypassing security checks that rely on type identification.
*   **Affected Component:** Core type detection logic within the `kind-of` library (all functions that determine the type of a value).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization in the application, regardless of the type identified by `kind-of`.
    *   Avoid relying solely on `kind-of` for critical security decisions or data processing logic.
    *   Thoroughly test the application's behavior with various input types, including edge cases and potentially malicious inputs designed to confuse type detection.
    *   Consider using more specific and reliable type checking mechanisms when necessary.

## Threat: [Type Confusion Enabling Prototype Pollution](./threats/type_confusion_enabling_prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could craft a malicious object that, when passed through `kind-of`, is misidentified in a way that allows the application to inadvertently modify the `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes. For instance, if `kind-of` incorrectly identifies a specially crafted object as a plain object, the application might then process its properties in a way that leads to prototype pollution.
*   **Impact:** Application-wide configuration changes, potential for arbitrary code execution if attacker-controlled properties are accessed in a vulnerable way.
*   **Affected Component:** Core type detection logic within the `kind-of` library, specifically when handling object types.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Be extremely cautious when using the output of `kind-of` to make decisions about how to process object properties, especially from user-provided data.
    *   Implement safeguards against prototype pollution, such as freezing prototypes or using `Object.create(null)` for object creation where appropriate.
    *   Sanitize and validate object properties before using them.
