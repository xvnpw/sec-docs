- **Vulnerability Name:**  
  Stored Cross‐Site Scripting (XSS) via the Pet List Import Feature

- **Description:**  
  An attacker can craft a malicious pet list file containing specially formed pet names (or other fields) that include HTML/JavaScript payloads. By tricking a user into importing this file via the extension’s “Import pet list” command, the extension will read and later render these pet names (for example, as labels or within speech bubbles in the pet panel). If the pet names are inserted directly into the DOM (for instance via a webview’s innerHTML) without proper escaping or sanitization, the injected script payload will execute inside the VS Code environment.

  _Step-by-step triggering process:_  
  1. The attacker creates a JSON file that follows the pet list format but uses a pet name like:  
     `"<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>"`  
     (or any other malicious JavaScript payload that triggers execution).  
  2. The attacker convinces the victim (perhaps via social engineering) to import this pet list file using the “Import pet list” command (`vscode-pets.import-pets`).  
  3. Once imported, the extension stores this data (possibly in its global state) and later renders the pet names within its pet panel or speech bubbles.  
  4. During the rendering process, the malicious HTML (and embedded JavaScript) is inserted into the page without adequate sanitization, causing the payload to execute in the user's VS Code process.

- **Impact:**  
  If successfully exploited, the attacker’s script runs with the privileges of the VS Code extension. This can lead to:  
  • Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the extension (and possibly VS Code),  
  • Unauthorized access to local files or sensitive environment data available to the extension’s process,  
  • Phishing or further lateral movement in the user’s environment.  
  Essentially, full compromise of the trusted VS Code session is possible.

- **Vulnerability Rank:**  
  High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
  • Based on the available project files and documentation, there is no evidence that the pet list import functionality validates or sanitizes user-supplied pet names before later rendering them in the UI.  
  • No explicit Content Security Policy (CSP) for any webview content is documented.

- **Missing Mitigations:**  
  • Input Validation and Sanitization: There is no indication that the data imported via the pet list command is sanitized.  
  • Output Encoding: When displaying pet names (or other imported fields) in the UI, proper HTML escaping or safe templating should be applied to ensure that any malicious payload is rendered as plain text.  
  • Enforced Content Security Policy: If a webview is used to display the pet panel, a strict CSP should prevent inlined or remote script execution.

- **Preconditions:**  
  • The victim must trigger the “Import pet list” functionality (via the `vscode-pets.import-pets` command) and load a maliciously crafted pet list JSON file.  
  • The extension must render the pet names (or other imported fields) in a context where HTML/JavaScript execution is possible (for example, inside a webview or dynamically updated panel).  
  • The extension does not perform proper input sanitization or output encoding on the imported values.

- **Source Code Analysis:**  
  Although the actual implementation of the pet list import isn’t directly visible in the provided files, the following observations can be made from the documentation and changelog:  
  • Documentation under “Importing or Exporting your Pet List” indicates that JSON files are used to store and load pet configurations.  
  • The pet names (and possibly other properties) are later rendered in the pet panel and/or in speech bubbles as the user interacts with the pets.  
  • In many webview-based VS Code extensions, if a value from a JSON file is inserted via `innerHTML` (or similar methods) without sanitization, it can lead to XSS.  
  • A typical insecure flow might be:  
  – User runs `vscode-pets.import-pets`  
  – The extension reads the JSON file and stores pet objects, including a “name” field containing the malicious payload.  
  – Later, when rendering the pet panel, the extension uses an HTML template that inserts the pet’s name via an unsanitized method.  
  – The malicious payload executes as part of the document’s DOM.

- **Security Test Case:**  
  1. **Preparation:**  
  • Create a pet list JSON file that follows the expected format. Include at least one pet object with a name field set to a payload such as:  
   `"<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>"`  
  • Ensure that any additional required fields (pet type, color, etc.) are provided with valid values so that the file is accepted.  
  2. **Execution:**  
  • Launch VS Code with the VS Code Pets extension installed.  
  • Open the Command Palette and run the command `vscode-pets.import-pets`.  
  • When prompted, select the malicious pet list file prepared in step 1.  
  3. **Observation:**  
  • After import, open the pet panel (or trigger any action that causes pet names to be rendered—such as starting a pet coding session).  
  • Observe whether the pet name containing the malicious payload is rendered as active HTML that executes the embedded JavaScript (for example, an alert box appears or console logs show that the payload was executed).  
  4. **Verification:**  
  • Confirm that the payload execution is observable and that the malicious script runs in the context of the extension, validating the presence of an XSS vulnerability.  
  • Document the behavior (screenshots or logs) as proof of the vulnerability.
