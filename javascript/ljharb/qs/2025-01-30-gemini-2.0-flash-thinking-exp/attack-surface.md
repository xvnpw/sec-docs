# Attack Surface Analysis for ljharb/qs

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution.md)

*   **Description:**  The ability to inject properties into the `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes in JavaScript, leading to widespread and unexpected application behavior.

*   **`qs` Contribution:** Older versions of `qs` were directly vulnerable to prototype pollution due to its parsing logic for nested objects and arrays in query strings.  It could unintentionally modify `Object.prototype` when parsing specially crafted query parameters using bracket notation and property names like `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`.

*   **Example:**
    *   **Malicious Query String:** `?__proto__[isAdmin]=true`
    *   **`qs` Parsing (Vulnerable Version):** Parsing this with a vulnerable `qs` version could set `Object.prototype.isAdmin = true`.  Subsequently, all JavaScript objects in the application would inherit `isAdmin: true`, potentially bypassing authorization checks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote Code Execution (RCE) (in certain scenarios)
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)
    *   Logic Flaws and Application Instability
    *   Authentication and Authorization bypass

*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** to **High**

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Upgrade `qs` Version:**  Immediately upgrade to the latest version of `qs` or a patched version that addresses prototype pollution vulnerabilities.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Implement server-side validation and sanitization of query string parameters *before* they are processed by `qs`.  Specifically, reject or escape potentially dangerous property names like `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`.
    *   **Object Creation without Prototype:** When working with parsed query parameters, consider using `Object.create(null)` to create objects without a prototype chain, minimizing the risk of prototype pollution exploits.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to help mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities that could arise from prototype pollution.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Complex Query Strings](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__via_complex_query_strings.md)

*   **Description:**  Making an application unavailable or significantly slower by overwhelming it with requests that consume excessive server resources.

*   **`qs` Contribution:** `qs`'s parsing process can become resource-intensive when dealing with extremely complex query strings. Deeply nested structures, a very large number of parameters, or excessively long parameter names in the query string can lead to high CPU and memory usage during parsing within `qs`.

*   **Example:**
    *   **Malicious Query String:** `?a[b[c[d[e[f[g[h[i[j[k[l[m[n[o[p[q[r[s[t[u[v[w[x[y[z]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]]=value&... (repeated many times)` -  A deeply nested query string designed to maximize parsing complexity.
    *   **Malicious Query String:** `?param1=value1&param2=value2&...&paramN=valueN` - A query string with a massive number of parameters, forcing `qs` to process a huge amount of data.

*   **Impact:**
    *   Application Downtime and Unavailability
    *   Severe Performance Degradation and Slow Response Times
    *   Server Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory)

*   **Risk Severity:** **Medium** to **High** (High if application is resource-constrained or handles high traffic)

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Request Limits:**  Implement strict limits on the complexity and size of incoming requests, including:
        *   Maximum allowed query string length.
        *   Maximum number of query parameters permitted per request.
        *   Maximum depth of nesting allowed in query parameters.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Employ rate limiting to restrict the number of requests from a single IP address or user within a defined time window.
    *   **Resource Monitoring and Alerting:**  Continuously monitor server resource utilization (CPU, memory) and set up alerts to detect unusual spikes that could indicate a DoS attack in progress.
    *   **Request Timeouts:**  Configure timeouts for request processing to prevent requests from consuming resources indefinitely, especially during parsing.
    *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):**  Consider using a WAF to filter out requests with excessively complex query strings before they reach the application and `qs`.
