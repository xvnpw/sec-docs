# BUSINESS POSTURE

The `qs` library is a widely used JavaScript library for parsing and stringifying URL query strings. Its primary business purpose is to simplify the handling of query parameters in web applications and APIs.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Efficiency in web development: The library aims to save developers time and effort by providing a robust and well-tested solution for query string manipulation.
  - Compatibility and Interoperability:  It ensures consistent query string parsing and stringification across different JavaScript environments (Node.js and browsers) and conforms to common standards.
  - Reliability: As a dependency in many projects, the library needs to be reliable and performant to avoid impacting the applications that use it.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities: Bugs in the library could lead to security issues in applications that rely on it, such as denial-of-service attacks, parameter pollution, or other injection vulnerabilities if not handled correctly by the consuming application.
  - Performance issues: Inefficient parsing or stringification could lead to performance bottlenecks in web applications, especially under heavy load.
  - Compatibility breaks: Changes to the library that are not backward-compatible could break existing applications that depend on it.
  - Supply chain risks: Compromise of the library's source code or build process could introduce malicious code into a vast number of applications.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code review - The project is open source and hosted on GitHub, allowing for community code review. (Implemented: GitHub repository)
  - security control: Unit testing - The repository includes a comprehensive suite of unit tests to ensure the correctness of the parsing and stringification logic. (Implemented: `test/` directory in the repository)
  - security control: Static analysis -  Likely used by developers during development, although not explicitly mentioned in the repository. (Likely Implemented: Developer's local environment)
  - security control: Dependency scanning - Developers using the library in their projects might use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in `qs` and its dependencies. (Implemented: User's responsibility in their projects)

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies - The library depends on other packages in the npm ecosystem, which might have their own vulnerabilities.
  - accepted risk:  Complex input handling - Parsing query strings, especially with nested objects and arrays, can be complex and might lead to unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities if not handled with extreme care.
  - accepted risk:  Open source nature - While open source allows for community review, it also means that vulnerabilities can be publicly disclosed before a fix is available.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated security scanning - Implement automated security scanning (SAST and dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline for the `qs` library itself to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Fuzz testing - Perform fuzz testing to identify edge cases and potential vulnerabilities when parsing maliciously crafted query strings.
  - security control: Security audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to review the codebase and identify potential security weaknesses.
  - security control: Signed releases - Sign npm package releases to ensure authenticity and prevent tampering.
  - security control: SBOM generation - Generate Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to provide transparency into the library's dependencies.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable to a query string parsing library itself. Authentication is handled by the applications that use this library.
  - Authorization: Not applicable to a query string parsing library itself. Authorization is handled by the applications that use this library based on the parsed query parameters.
  - Input Validation: The library must perform robust input validation to handle various query string formats, including edge cases, and prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities. This is the core function of the library, and security depends on the correctness of this validation.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to a query string parsing library. Cryptography is used by applications using this library for secure communication (HTTPS) and potentially for encrypting data within query parameters, but `qs` itself does not handle cryptographic operations.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Web application functionality: The `qs` library is essential for web applications that rely on parsing and generating URL query strings. Malfunctioning or vulnerable `qs` library can disrupt core application functionality.
  - API communication: APIs heavily use query parameters for data exchange. The `qs` library facilitates this communication in JavaScript environments. Issues with `qs` can impact API integrations.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Query string data: The library processes query string data, which can contain various types of information, including:
    - User inputs: Search terms, form data, API parameters. Sensitivity depends on the application context. Some user inputs might be considered personally identifiable information (PII) or sensitive data.
    - Application state: Query parameters can be used to maintain application state, which might include session identifiers or temporary data.
    - Configuration data: In some cases, query parameters might carry configuration data.
  - Sensitivity level: The sensitivity of query string data is highly context-dependent. While the `qs` library itself doesn't handle sensitive data directly, it processes data that applications use, and this data can be sensitive. The primary risk is not data confidentiality within the library itself, but rather vulnerabilities in parsing that could lead to application-level security issues (e.g., injection, DoS).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the intended use case and business criticality of applications that will use this design document for threat modeling? (Assuming general web application and API usage for now).
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that applications using `qs` need to adhere to? (Assuming general best practices for web security for now).
  - What is the risk appetite of the organization using applications that depend on `qs`? (Assuming a moderate risk appetite, requiring standard security controls).

- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary business goal is to provide a reliable and efficient query string parsing library for general web development purposes. Security is a significant concern due to the library's widespread use.
  - SECURITY POSTURE:  Existing security controls are primarily focused on basic software development best practices (code review, unit testing). There is room for improvement in automated security testing and supply chain security. Applications using `qs` are responsible for handling authentication, authorization, and application-level input validation.
  - DESIGN: The `qs` library is a standalone JavaScript library distributed via npm. Deployment context is considered from the perspective of applications that *use* the library, typically in cloud environments. The build process is assumed to be standard for npm packages using GitHub Actions.
