## Attack Tree Path: [Prototype Pollution [CRITICAL NODE, POTENTIALLY HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/prototype_pollution__critical_node__potentially_high-risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Manipulate Object Prototype via `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`, or similar properties (if vulnerable version used) [POTENTIALLY HIGH-RISK]
    *   **Mechanism:** Craft query string parameters that attempt to modify the prototype of `Object` or other built-in objects through `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` properties.
    *   **Impact:** Pollution of JavaScript object prototypes, potentially leading to:
        *   Unexpected application behavior.
        *   Security vulnerabilities if application logic relies on default object properties or behaviors.
        *   In some scenarios, potentially lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other attacks if polluted properties are later accessed in a vulnerable context.
    *   **Mitigation:**
        *   Use a patched and up-to-date version of `qs` library. Modern versions of `qs` have mitigations against prototype pollution.
        *   Sanitize or validate data parsed by `qs` before using it in sensitive operations.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential XSS if prototype pollution leads to script injection.
    *   **Example Query String:** `?__proto__[isAdmin]=true` or `?constructor.prototype.polluted=true` (These are examples, actual exploitability depends on `qs` version and application context)
    *   **Risk Estimations:**
        *   Likelihood: Low (for recent `qs` versions) to Medium (for older, unpatched versions)
        *   Impact: Medium to High
        *   Effort: Low to Medium
        *   Skill Level: Medium
        *   Detection Difficulty: High

## Attack Tree Path: [Injection Vulnerabilities due to Unsafe Handling of Parsed Data [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/injection_vulnerabilities_due_to_unsafe_handling_of_parsed_data__critical_node__high-risk_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Application fails to sanitize or validate data parsed by `qs` before using it in sensitive operations. [HIGH-RISK]

    *   **2.1. SQL Injection [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker crafts query string parameters that, when parsed by `qs` and used in SQL queries without proper sanitization, lead to SQL injection.
        *   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized access to database.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Parameterized queries or prepared statements: Use these to prevent SQL injection.
            *   Input validation and sanitization: Validate and sanitize all data received from `qs` before using it in SQL queries.
        *   **Example Query String:** `?search='; DROP TABLE users; --` (classic SQL injection example)
        *   **Risk Estimations:**
            *   Likelihood: High
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Low to Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium

    *   **2.2. Command Injection [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker crafts query string parameters that, when parsed by `qs` and used in system commands without proper sanitization, lead to command injection.
        *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Avoid executing system commands based on user input whenever possible.
            *   If system commands are necessary, use safe APIs and libraries that avoid shell execution.
            *   Input validation and sanitization: Strictly validate and sanitize any data from `qs` used in system commands.
        *   **Example Query String:** `?file=; rm -rf /` (dangerous command injection example)
        *   **Risk Estimations:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: High
            *   Effort: Medium
            *   Skill Level: Medium
            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium to High

    *   **2.3. Path Traversal [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker crafts query string parameters that, when parsed by `qs` and used to construct file paths without proper validation, lead to path traversal.
        *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to files on the server, potential information disclosure.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Validate and sanitize file paths: Ensure that paths constructed from `qs` data are properly validated to prevent traversal outside of allowed directories.
            *   Use secure file handling APIs that restrict access to specific directories.
        *   **Example Query String:** `?file=../../../../etc/passwd` (path traversal example)
        *   **Risk Estimations:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium to High
            *   Effort: Low
            *   Skill Level: Low
            *   Detection Difficulty: Low to Medium

    *   **2.4. Logic Bugs and Application-Specific Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH]**
        *   **Mechanism:** Attacker exploits application logic flaws that arise from how the application processes and uses the data parsed by `qs`. This is highly application-specific.
        *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the application logic, could range from data manipulation to privilege escalation or other security breaches.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   Thoroughly review application logic that uses `qs` parsed data.
            *   Implement robust input validation and business logic checks.
            *   Perform security testing specific to the application's functionality.
        *   **Example:** Application uses a parsed parameter to determine user role without proper authorization checks.
        *   **Risk Estimations:**
            *   Likelihood: Medium
            *   Impact: Medium to High
            *   Effort: Medium to High
            *   Skill Level: Medium to High
            *   Detection Difficulty: High
