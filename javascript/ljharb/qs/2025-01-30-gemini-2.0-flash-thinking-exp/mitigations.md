# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ljharb/qs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Upgrade `qs` to the Latest Version](./mitigation_strategies/upgrade__qs__to_the_latest_version.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Identify the current version of `qs` used in your project by checking `package.json` or your dependency lock file.
    *   Step 2: Check the `qs` GitHub repository or npm page for the latest stable version.
    *   Step 3: Update the `qs` dependency in `package.json` to the latest version.
    *   Step 4: Run `npm install` or `yarn install` to update and refresh your lock file.
    *   Step 5: Test your application, focusing on query string parsing functionality, to ensure compatibility.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Prototype Pollution - Severity: High (Latest versions patch known prototype pollution vulnerabilities in `qs`)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Severity: Medium (Newer versions may include performance improvements and bug fixes relevant to DoS)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Prototype Pollution: High Reduction (Significantly reduces risk by incorporating latest security patches in `qs`)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium Reduction (May improve performance and fix DoS-related bugs in `qs`)

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it is implemented. Example: Yes - package.json and dependency lock file]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it is missing if not fully implemented. Example: N/A - Fully Implemented / Missing in specific microservice X]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization of Query Parameters (Pre-`qs` Parsing)](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_of_query_parameters__pre-_qs__parsing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define a strict schema for expected query parameters *before* they are processed by `qs`.
    *   Step 2: Implement validation logic *before* calling `qs.parse()`. This validation should check against the defined schema.
    *   Step 3: Sanitize or reject invalid parameters *before* passing them to `qs.parse()`.
        *   Reject requests with unexpected parameters or values.
        *   Sanitize values to conform to expected types if possible.
        *   Specifically reject parameters resembling prototype pollution attacks (e.g., `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`).
    *   Step 4: Ensure consistent validation across all query parameter handling in your application *before* `qs.parse()` is invoked.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Prototype Pollution - Severity: High (Prevents malicious parameters from being parsed by `qs` and polluting prototypes)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Severity: Low (Reduces DoS risk by rejecting complex or malicious structures before `qs` parsing)
    *   Data Injection Attacks - Severity: Medium (Validation helps prevent broader data injection issues by controlling input to `qs`)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Prototype Pollution: High Reduction (Strongly reduces risk by pre-parsing input filtering)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Low Reduction (Minor DoS reduction through early rejection of malformed input)
    *   Data Injection Attacks: Medium Reduction (Effectiveness depends on validation schema comprehensiveness)

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it is implemented. Example: Partially - Implemented in API Gateway but not in backend services]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it is missing if not fully implemented. Example: Missing in backend service X and Y]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use `Object.create(null)` for Processing Parsed Data (Post-`qs` Parsing)](./mitigation_strategies/use__object_create_null___for_processing_parsed_data__post-_qs__parsing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: After parsing with `qs.parse()`, create a new object using `Object.create(null)`.
    *   Step 2: Iterate through the properties of the object returned by `qs.parse()`.
    *   Step 3: Copy *validated and sanitized* properties from the `qs.parse()` result to the `Object.create(null)` object. Only copy properties that passed pre-`qs` input validation.
    *   Step 4: Use the `Object.create(null)` object for all subsequent application logic, isolating from potential prototype pollution from `qs` parsing.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Prototype Pollution - Severity: High (Isolates application logic from prototype pollution originating from `qs` parsing)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Prototype Pollution: High Reduction (Effectively eliminates prototype pollution impact on application logic using the `Object.create(null)` object)

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it is implemented. Example: No - Not implemented anywhere]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it is missing if not fully implemented. Example: Should be implemented in all modules processing query parameters parsed by `qs`]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Freeze or Seal Parsed Objects (Post-`qs` Parsing)](./mitigation_strategies/freeze_or_seal_parsed_objects__post-_qs__parsing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: After parsing with `qs.parse()` and processing the data (especially if not using `Object.create(null)`), apply `Object.freeze()` or `Object.seal()` to the object returned by `qs.parse()`. `Object.freeze()` is recommended for stronger protection.
    *   Step 2: Ensure application logic does not attempt to modify the frozen or sealed object after this step.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Prototype Pollution - Severity: Medium (Prevents *further* prototype pollution attempts *after* `qs` parsing by making the object immutable)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Prototype Pollution: Medium Reduction (Reduces the window for post-parsing prototype pollution, but doesn't prevent initial pollution during `qs` parsing if the library is vulnerable)

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it is implemented. Example: No - Not implemented anywhere]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it is missing if not fully implemented. Example: Should be implemented after parsing query parameters with `qs` in relevant modules]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Query String Length (DoS related to `qs` parsing)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_query_string_length__dos_related_to__qs__parsing_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Define a maximum acceptable query string length relevant to your application and server capabilities. Consider the impact of long strings on `qs` parsing performance.
    *   Step 2: Implement a check for query string length *before* processing with `qs.parse()`. 
    *   Step 3: Reject requests with query strings exceeding the defined limit, returning a 414 or 400 error.
    *   Step 4: Log rejected requests for monitoring and potential DoS detection.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Severity: Medium (Prevents DoS attacks exploiting `qs` parsing with excessively long query strings)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium Reduction (Reduces DoS risk from overly long query strings processed by `qs`)

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it is implemented. Example: Yes - Implemented in API Gateway configuration]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it is missing if not fully implemented. Example: N/A - Fully Implemented / Needs to be implemented in backend services as a fallback]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Parameter Depth and Array Limit in `qs` Options](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_parameter_depth_and_array_limit_in__qs__options.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: When calling `qs.parse()`, configure the `depth` and `arrayLimit` options to restrict parsing complexity.
        *   `depth`: Set a maximum nesting depth for objects (e.g., 5-10).
        *   `arrayLimit`: Set a maximum array element count (e.g., 20-50).
    *   Step 2: Apply these options consistently wherever `qs.parse()` is used.
    *   Step 3: Document the chosen `depth` and `arrayLimit` values and their purpose.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) - Severity: Medium (Prevents DoS attacks exploiting `qs` parsing performance with complex nested objects or large arrays)

*   **Impact:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Medium Reduction (Significantly reduces DoS risk from complex query strings parsed by `qs` by limiting parsing complexity)

*   **Currently Implemented:** [Specify Yes/No/Partially and where it is implemented. Example: Partially - Implemented in some modules but not consistently]

*   **Missing Implementation:** [Specify where it is missing if not fully implemented. Example: Missing in modules X, Y, and Z. Needs consistent application across the application]
