# Threat Model Analysis for ljharb/qs

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution via Query String Manipulation](./threats/prototype_pollution_via_query_string_manipulation.md)

*   **Description**: An attacker crafts a malicious query string containing prototype pollution payloads (e.g., `__proto__`, `constructor.prototype`). When `qs` parses this query string, it can inject properties into the JavaScript Object prototype. This can lead to unexpected application behavior, potentially allowing for code execution or data manipulation if the application interacts with the polluted prototype.
*   **Impact**: Prototype pollution, potential code execution, application compromise, data manipulation, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Affected QS Component**: Parsing module, specifically the object parsing logic and handling of property names.
*   **Risk Severity**: High to Critical (if using vulnerable `qs` versions).
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   **Immediately update `qs` library to version 6.5.2 or later.**
    *   Use `Object.create(null)` when processing data parsed by `qs`, especially for sensitive operations.
    *   Sanitize and validate query string parameters to prevent injection of malicious property names.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate potential XSS exploitation.
    *   Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Complex Query String Parsing DoS](./threats/complex_query_string_parsing_dos.md)

*   **Description**: An attacker crafts a deeply nested or highly complex query string and sends it to the application. The `qs` library, when parsing this malicious query, consumes excessive server resources (CPU, memory), leading to slow response times or service unavailability for legitimate users.
*   **Impact**: Denial of Service, application performance degradation, service unavailability.
*   **Affected QS Component**: Parsing module, specifically the parsing logic for nested objects and arrays.
*   **Risk Severity**: High (in specific scenarios and older `qs` versions).
*   **Mitigation Strategies**:
    *   Update `qs` library to the latest version.
    *   Implement input validation to limit the depth and complexity of query strings.
    *   Configure web server request limits (e.g., request size, header size).
    *   Implement rate limiting to restrict requests from single IPs.
    *   Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
