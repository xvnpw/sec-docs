# Attack Surface Analysis for ljharb/qs

## Attack Surface: [Prototype Pollution](./attack_surfaces/prototype_pollution.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject properties into the `Object.prototype` by manipulating query string parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially security vulnerabilities across the application.
*   **How `qs` Contributes:**  Versions of `qs` prior to v6.5.2 were vulnerable to this. The library's parsing logic allowed specially crafted keys (e.g., `__proto__.polluted`) to modify the prototype chain.
*   **Example:** A malicious URL like `https://example.com/?__proto__.isAdmin=true` could, in vulnerable versions of `qs`, set the `isAdmin` property on `Object.prototype` to `true`, potentially affecting all objects in the application.
*   **Impact:**  Critical. This can lead to security bypasses, privilege escalation, and potentially remote code execution depending on how the application uses object properties.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Upgrade `qs` to version 6.5.2 or later.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Deeply Nested Objects](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_deeply_nested_objects.md)

**Description:**  An attacker can cause excessive resource consumption by submitting a query string with extremely deep nesting, leading to performance degradation or application crashes.
*   **How `qs` Contributes:** `qs` parses nested objects from query strings. Without limits, deeply nested structures (e.g., `a[b][c][d]...[z]=value`) can consume significant memory and CPU during parsing.
*   **Example:** A crafted URL like `https://example.com/?a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i][j][k][l][m][n][o][p][q][r][s][t][u][v][w][x][y][z]=malicious` could exhaust server resources.
*   **Impact:** High. Application downtime, resource exhaustion, and potential service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure the `depth` option in `qs` to restrict the maximum depth of nested objects allowed during parsing.

## Attack Surface: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Large Number of Parameters](./attack_surfaces/denial_of_service__dos__through_large_number_of_parameters.md)

**Description:**  Submitting a query string with a very large number of distinct parameters can overwhelm the server's parsing capabilities and lead to resource exhaustion.
*   **How `qs` Contributes:** `qs` processes each parameter in the query string. A large number of parameters (e.g., `a=1&b=2&c=3...&zzzzzz=n`) requires processing for each key-value pair.
*   **Example:** A crafted URL like `https://example.com/?param1=value1&param2=value2&...&param10000=value10000` could strain server resources.
*   **Impact:** High. Application slowdown, resource exhaustion, and potential service disruption.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Configure the `parameterLimit` option in `qs` to restrict the maximum number of parameters allowed in a query string.
