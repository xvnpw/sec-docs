# Threat Model Analysis for ljharb/qs

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested Objects](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_deeply_nested_objects.md)

**Description:** An attacker might craft a malicious HTTP request with a query string containing deeply nested parameters (e.g., `a[b][c][d]...[z]=value`). When the application uses `qs` to parse this query string, the `parse` function will recursively create nested JavaScript objects. This can consume excessive CPU time and memory on the server, potentially leading to a server crash or unresponsiveness.

**Impact:** Server becomes unavailable, disrupting service for legitimate users.

**Affected `qs` Component:** `parse` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure the `depth` option in `qs.parse()` to limit the maximum depth of nesting allowed.
* Implement request timeouts on the server to prevent long-running parsing operations.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Parameter Bomb](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_parameter_bomb.md)

**Description:** An attacker might send a request with a query string containing an extremely large number of unique parameters (e.g., `param1=value1&param2=value2&...&paramN=valueN`). When `qs` parses this, the `parse` function will create a large JavaScript object with numerous properties. This can consume significant server memory and CPU time, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Impact:** Server becomes unavailable or experiences significant performance degradation.

**Affected `qs` Component:** `parse` function.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure the `parameterLimit` option in `qs.parse()` to limit the maximum number of parameters allowed in the query string.
* Implement request timeouts.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution](./threats/prototype_pollution.md)

**Description:** An attacker might craft a query string that injects properties into the `Object.prototype` using specially crafted parameter names (e.g., `__proto__[isAdmin]=true`). When `qs` parses this, it could inadvertently modify the prototype chain of all JavaScript objects in the application's scope. This can lead to various security vulnerabilities, including arbitrary code execution or bypassing security checks.

**Impact:** Critical security vulnerabilities, potentially leading to complete compromise of the application and server.

**Affected `qs` Component:** `parse` function, specifically how it handles bracket notation and prototype properties.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Upgrade to the latest version of `qs`:** Newer versions have mitigations against prototype pollution.
* **Carefully review `qs` configuration:** Ensure that options like `allowPrototypes` are set to `false` (or not used if possible). This is the default in newer versions.

## Threat: [Bypass of Security Checks based on Query Parameter Interpretation](./threats/bypass_of_security_checks_based_on_query_parameter_interpretation.md)

**Description:** If the application relies on specific interpretations of query parameters for security checks, an attacker might craft a query string that exploits nuances in `qs`'s parsing behavior to bypass these checks. This could involve exploiting how `qs` handles duplicate parameters or different encoding schemes.

**Impact:** Potential for unauthorized access or actions, bypassing intended security mechanisms.

**Affected `qs` Component:** `parse` function and its specific parsing rules for different query string formats.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Thoroughly test security checks with various query string inputs**, including edge cases and potentially malicious inputs that exploit `qs`'s parsing behavior.
* **Standardize query parameter handling** throughout the application to ensure consistent interpretation, regardless of the order or format.
