# Attack Tree Analysis for ljharb/qs

Objective: Gain unauthorized access, cause denial of service, or manipulate application behavior by leveraging vulnerabilities in the `qs` library's parsing of query strings (focusing on high-risk scenarios).

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) - CPU Exhaustion via Complex Parsing](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__-_cpu_exhaustion_via_complex_parsing.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft specific query strings that exploit inefficiencies in `qs`'s parsing algorithms. These strings often involve combinations of nested objects, arrays, and indexed parameters in ways that force the parser to perform excessive computations.
    *   **Impact:** Successful exploitation can lead to a significant increase in CPU usage on the server, potentially slowing down or even crashing the application, making it unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement timeouts for query string parsing, limit the complexity of allowed query parameters, and consider using alternative parsing libraries or techniques for complex scenarios. Regularly update `qs` as performance improvements might be included.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) - Memory Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__-_memory_exhaustion.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers send requests with extremely large or deeply nested data structures within the query string. `qs` attempts to parse these structures, leading to the allocation of a large amount of memory.
    *   **Impact:** If the attacker can force the server to allocate more memory than available, it can lead to out-of-memory errors, causing the application to crash and become unavailable.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implement limits on the size and depth of query string parameters. Configure web servers and application frameworks to limit request sizes. Monitor memory usage and implement alerts for unusual spikes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Prototype Pollution (Indirect) - Exploit Prototype Pollution Vulnerability - Target `__proto__` Property](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__via_prototype_pollution__indirect__-_exploit_prototype_pollution_vulnera_d76b0c90.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers send a query string containing the `__proto__` property as a key. `qs` (in vulnerable versions or configurations) will process this and attempt to set properties on the `Object.prototype`. For example, `?__proto__.isAdmin=true`.
    *   **Impact:** Modifying `Object.prototype` can have global consequences, affecting all JavaScript objects in the application. This can lead to unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, and potentially RCE if application code relies on these polluted properties.
    *   **Mitigation:** Update `qs` to versions that mitigate prototype pollution. Configure `qs` to disallow prototype manipulation (if the option is available). Implement robust input validation and sanitization to prevent the processing of `__proto__` or similar properties. Use JavaScript features like `Object.create(null)` for objects where prototype inheritance is not needed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Prototype Pollution (Indirect) - Exploit Prototype Pollution Vulnerability - Target `constructor.prototype`](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__via_prototype_pollution__indirect__-_exploit_prototype_pollution_vulnera_ac1bb19a.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Similar to targeting `__proto__`, attackers can target the `prototype` of a constructor function (e.g., `?constructor.prototype.isAdmin=true`).
    *   **Impact:** Modifying constructor prototypes affects all instances created using that constructor, potentially leading to similar security issues as `__proto__` pollution.
    *   **Mitigation:** Similar mitigations as for `__proto__` pollution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Prototype Pollution (Indirect) - Exploit Prototype Pollution Vulnerability - Leverage Pollution for RCE](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__via_prototype_pollution__indirect__-_exploit_prototype_pollution_vulnera_f154a370.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** After successfully polluting a prototype, attackers rely on vulnerabilities in the application code. If the application uses the polluted properties without proper checks or sanitization (e.g., accessing a polluted function or using a polluted value in a security-sensitive context), it can lead to RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Successful RCE allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially gaining full control of the application and the underlying system.
    *   **Mitigation:** Thoroughly audit application code for usage of properties that could be influenced by prototype pollution. Implement secure coding practices, including avoiding reliance on prototype properties for critical logic and using safe alternatives. Employ security analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities. Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) as a defense-in-depth measure.
