## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Parsing Logic Flaws in `qs` [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_parsing_logic_flaws_in__qs___critical_node_.md)

This represents the broad category of attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in how `qs` parses query strings. Success here can lead to various critical outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Prototype Pollution [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/prototype_pollution__critical_node_.md)

This is a significant vulnerability where attackers can inject malicious properties into JavaScript object prototypes.
* Successful exploitation can have widespread consequences, affecting the behavior of the entire application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious properties into Object.prototype [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_properties_into_object_prototype__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attackers craft URLs with `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype` keys to inject properties directly into the base `Object.prototype`.
* Example: `?__proto__.isAdmin=true`
* Impact: Can modify global object properties, potentially bypassing security checks, injecting malicious functionality, or leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Parameter Pollution leading to Logic Errors [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/parameter_pollution_leading_to_logic_errors__critical_node_.md)

This category involves exploiting how `qs` handles duplicate parameters to cause logic errors in the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Overwrite critical application parameters [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/overwrite_critical_application_parameters__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attackers craft URLs with multiple instances of the same parameter, relying on `qs`'s parsing behavior to overwrite critical parameters.
* Example: `?admin=false&admin=true`
* Impact: Can bypass authentication or authorization checks, leading to unauthorized access or manipulation of application state.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Configuration Issues in `qs` [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_configuration_issues_in__qs___critical_node_.md)

This involves exploiting insecure configurations of the `qs` library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Misconfigured `allowPrototypes` option [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/misconfigured__allowprototypes__option__high-risk_path_.md)

* If the `allowPrototypes` option is enabled (set to `true`), it directly allows attackers to perform prototype pollution attacks.
* Impact: Significantly increases the application's vulnerability to prototype pollution, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Interaction with Application Logic After Parsing [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_interaction_with_application_logic_after_parsing__critical_node_.md)

This category focuses on vulnerabilities that arise from how the application handles the data parsed by `qs`. Even if `qs` parses correctly, the application's logic might be vulnerable.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Input Validation due to `qs`'s Parsing [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_input_validation_due_to__qs_'s_parsing__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attackers craft URLs that `qs` parses in a way that circumvents the application's input validation mechanisms.
* Example: Application expects a comma-separated string, but `qs` parses a nested structure into an array, bypassing validation that only checks for commas in a string.
* Impact: Allows injection of malicious data that would otherwise be blocked, potentially leading to various vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or SQL Injection if the data is used in further operations.
