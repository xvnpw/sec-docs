# Threat Model Analysis for ljharb/qs

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Deeply Nested Objects/Arrays](./threats/denial_of_service_via_deeply_nested_objectsarrays.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious query string with excessively nested objects or arrays. The `qs` library attempts to parse this deeply nested structure, leading to high CPU and memory consumption on the server. This can make the server unresponsive or crash, denying service to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Server overload, application slowdown, or complete unavailability, leading to business disruption and potential financial loss.

**Affected Component:** `qs`'s parsing logic within the main module, specifically how it handles nested structures.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure the `depth` option in `qs` to limit the maximum depth of nesting allowed.
* Implement input validation on the query string before passing it to `qs` to reject excessively nested structures.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution via `__proto__`, `constructor`, or `prototype`](./threats/prototype_pollution_via____proto______constructor___or__prototype_.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a query string with parameters like `__proto__.isAdmin=true` or similar manipulations targeting the `Object.prototype`. When `qs` parses this (especially in older versions or without proper configuration), it can inject properties into the prototype of all JavaScript objects. This can lead to unexpected behavior, security bypasses, or even remote code execution in some scenarios if the polluted prototype is later accessed by vulnerable code.

**Impact:** Potentially critical vulnerabilities, including privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution, and data manipulation, depending on how the polluted prototype is used within the application.

**Affected Component:** `qs`'s parsing logic, specifically how it handles object property assignment, particularly when the `allowPrototypes` option is not explicitly set to `false`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Upgrade `qs` to the latest version:** Newer versions of `qs` have mitigations against prototype pollution.
* **Explicitly set the `allowPrototypes` option to `false` when initializing `qs`:** This prevents parsing of `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` properties.
