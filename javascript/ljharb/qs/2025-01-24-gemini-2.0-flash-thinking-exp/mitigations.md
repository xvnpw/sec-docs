# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ljharb/qs

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit `qs` Parsing Depth (`depth` option)](./mitigation_strategies/limit__qs__parsing_depth___depth__option_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When you use `qs.parse()` in your application code, locate the places where this function is called.
    2.  Modify each `qs.parse()` call to include the `depth` option. For example, instead of `qs.parse(queryString)`, use `qs.parse(queryString, { depth: 5 }).
    3.  Choose a suitable integer value for `depth`. This value determines how many levels of nesting `qs` will parse in objects and arrays within the query string. A lower value is generally safer. Start with a small value like `3` or `5` and increase it only if your application legitimately requires deeper nesting.
    4.  Document the chosen `depth` value and the reason for selecting it. This helps in understanding the configuration during future reviews and updates.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Prototype Pollution (High Severity): By limiting parsing depth, you restrict the ability of attackers to create deeply nested structures in the query string, which are often necessary to exploit prototype pollution vulnerabilities in `qs`.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): Parsing deeply nested query strings can be computationally expensive. Limiting depth reduces the resources `qs` consumes, mitigating potential DoS attacks that rely on sending complex, nested queries.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Prototype Pollution: High Risk Reduction - Directly reduces the attack surface for prototype pollution by limiting the depth of parsable structures.
    *   DoS: Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the impact of DoS attacks targeting parser resource consumption.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Likely using default `qs` settings without explicit depth limits)
*   **Missing Implementation:** Wherever `qs.parse()` is used in the backend application. You need to modify each instance of `qs.parse()` to include the `depth` option with a chosen value.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit `qs` Parameter Count (`parameterLimit` option)](./mitigation_strategies/limit__qs__parameter_count___parameterlimit__option_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Find all instances of `qs.parse()` in your application's codebase.
    2.  For each `qs.parse()` call, add the `parameterLimit` option. For example, change `qs.parse(queryString)` to `qs.parse(queryString, { parameterLimit: 100 }).
    3.  Select an appropriate integer value for `parameterLimit`. This value sets the maximum number of parameters `qs` will parse. Choose a value that is high enough to accommodate legitimate use cases but low enough to prevent excessively large parameter counts. Consider starting with `50` or `100` and adjust based on your application's needs.
    4.  Document the chosen `parameterLimit` and the rationale behind it for future reference.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity): By limiting the number of parameters `qs` parses, you prevent attackers from sending requests with an extremely large number of parameters. Parsing a huge number of parameters can consume significant server resources, leading to DoS.
*   **Impact:**
    *   DoS: Medium Risk Reduction - Limits the impact of DoS attacks based on excessive parameter counts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Likely using default `qs` settings without explicit parameter limits)
*   **Missing Implementation:** Wherever `qs.parse()` is used in the backend application. You need to update each `qs.parse()` call to include the `parameterLimit` option with a chosen value.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid or Limit `allowDots` and `arrayLimit` Options](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_or_limit__allowdots__and__arraylimit__options.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Review your application's query parameter handling logic and determine if you are explicitly using or relying on the `allowDots` or `arrayLimit` options in `qs.parse()`.
    2.  If you are not intentionally using `allowDots`, ensure that you are *not* enabling it in your `qs.parse()` calls.  If you are currently enabling it, consider if it's truly necessary and if you can achieve the same functionality without it. Removing `allowDots` simplifies parsing and reduces potential complexity.
    3.  If you need to handle arrays in query parameters and are using `arrayLimit`, review the chosen value. If it's set to a very high number or the default, consider reducing it to a more reasonable value that reflects the maximum expected array size in legitimate requests. If possible, explore alternative ways to handle array data in query parameters that might not rely on `arrayLimit` if security is a primary concern.
    4.  When using `qs.parse()`, explicitly set `allowDots: false` if you don't need dot notation parsing. If you use `arrayLimit`, set it to a specific, reasonable value instead of relying on defaults or very high numbers. For example: `qs.parse(queryString, { allowDots: false, arrayLimit: 20 }).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Prototype Pollution (Low to Medium Severity): Reducing complexity by avoiding `allowDots` and limiting `arrayLimit` can indirectly reduce potential attack vectors related to complex parsing logic and unexpected object/array structures.
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) (Low Severity): Simplifying parsing can slightly reduce resource consumption and potential DoS risks associated with complex parsing operations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Prototype Pollution: Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces complexity and potential attack surface, although less direct than depth/parameter limits.
    *   DoS: Low Risk Reduction - Minor improvement in resource consumption.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No (Likely using default `qs` behavior, which might implicitly use `arrayLimit` defaults and allow dot notation if not explicitly configured otherwise)
*   **Missing Implementation:** Wherever `qs.parse()` is used. You need to explicitly configure `qs.parse()` calls to set `allowDots` to `false` (if not needed) and set a reasonable `arrayLimit` if arrays are used, instead of relying on default or high values.
