# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gatsbyjs/gatsby

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Gatsby Plugin Selection and Vetting](./mitigation_strategies/careful_gatsby_plugin_selection_and_vetting.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Research Plugin Purpose and Necessity:** Before adding a Gatsby plugin, clearly define its purpose and ensure it's truly necessary for your application's functionality within the Gatsby context. Avoid adding plugins for features that can be implemented with core Gatsby APIs or standard JavaScript.
2.  **Check Plugin Popularity and Gatsby Ecosystem Reputation:** Look at the plugin's npm page for download statistics, GitHub stars, and user reviews specifically within the Gatsby community. Prioritize plugins that are well-regarded and actively used in the Gatsby ecosystem.
3.  **Review Plugin Maintainership and Gatsby Compatibility:** Check the plugin's GitHub repository for recent commits, issue activity, and maintainer responsiveness, specifically regarding Gatsby version compatibility and updates. Ensure the plugin is actively maintained and compatible with your Gatsby version.
4.  **Examine Plugin Dependencies (Within Gatsby Context):** Use `npm list <plugin-name>` or `yarn info <plugin-name> dependencies` to inspect the plugin's dependencies. Evaluate if these dependencies are reputable and well-maintained *within the context of Gatsby plugin ecosystem*.
5.  **Consider Plugin Source Code Review (For Critical Gatsby Plugins):** For Gatsby plugins handling sensitive data or core Gatsby functionalities (like data sourcing or routing), consider reviewing the plugin's source code on GitHub to understand its implementation and identify potential security concerns *specific to Gatsby plugin interactions*.
6.  **Prioritize Plugins from Trusted Gatsby Sources:** Favor plugins from well-known Gatsby ecosystem contributors, Gatsby core team members, or organizations with a good security track record within the Gatsby community.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Malicious Gatsby Plugin Injection (Medium to High Severity) -  Reduces the risk of incorporating Gatsby plugins containing malicious code or backdoors that could compromise your Gatsby application or user data *through Gatsby's plugin architecture*.
*   Vulnerable Gatsby Plugin Dependencies (Medium Severity) - Minimizes the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through poorly maintained or vulnerable plugin dependencies *within the Gatsby plugin ecosystem*.
*   Unnecessary Gatsby Plugin Attack Surface (Low Severity) - Reduces the overall attack surface of your Gatsby application by limiting the number of third-party Gatsby plugins.
**Impact:**
*   Malicious Gatsby Plugin Injection (Medium to High Impact) - Significantly reduces the risk by proactively vetting Gatsby plugins and choosing reputable options within the Gatsby ecosystem.
*   Vulnerable Gatsby Plugin Dependencies (Medium Impact) - Reduces the risk by considering Gatsby plugin dependencies during selection.
*   Unnecessary Gatsby Plugin Attack Surface (Low Impact) -  Slightly reduces the attack surface, contributing to overall Gatsby application security.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   Developers generally check Gatsby plugin documentation and basic popularity before adding them.
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Formal Gatsby plugin vetting process with documented criteria (popularity within Gatsby community, maintainership, Gatsby compatibility, dependencies, code review for critical plugins).
*   Security guidelines for Gatsby plugin selection included in development onboarding and best practices documentation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable GraphQL Introspection in Production (Gatsby Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_graphql_introspection_in_production__gatsby_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Open `gatsby-config.js`:** Locate your Gatsby project's `gatsby-config.js` file.
2.  **Modify `gatsby-plugin-graphql` Options (or relevant GraphQL plugin):** Within the `plugins` array, find the configuration for `gatsby-plugin-graphql` (or the specific Gatsby plugin you are using to expose GraphQL if it's not the default).
3.  **Set `introspection` to `false` for Production Environment:** Add or modify the `options` object within the plugin configuration to include `introspection: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production'`. This conditionally disables GraphQL introspection specifically in production environments for your Gatsby application.
4.  **Deploy Gatsby Application Changes:** Deploy the updated `gatsby-config.js` as part of your Gatsby application build and deployment process to your production environment.
5.  **Verify in Production Gatsby Build:** After deployment, attempt to access the Gatsby GraphQL introspection endpoint in your production environment (usually `/___graphql`). Verify that introspection is disabled and you cannot retrieve the schema *in your deployed Gatsby application*.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Gatsby GraphQL Schema Exposure (Medium Severity) - Prevents attackers from easily discovering your Gatsby application's GraphQL schema structure, types, and queries, which are exposed by Gatsby for data fetching. This schema information could be used to identify potential vulnerabilities or data access points *within your Gatsby data layer*.
**Impact:**
*   Gatsby GraphQL Schema Exposure (Medium Impact) - Reduces the risk of information disclosure and makes it harder for attackers to understand and exploit your Gatsby GraphQL API *specifically exposed by Gatsby*.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   Not currently implemented. Gatsby GraphQL introspection is enabled in all environments by default.
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Configuration change in `gatsby-config.js` to disable GraphQL introspection in production for Gatsby.
*   Deployment of the updated Gatsby configuration to production environments.
*   Verification step to confirm GraphQL introspection is disabled in production for the deployed Gatsby application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Build Process Security (Gatsby Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/build_process_security__gatsby_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Secure Gatsby Build Environment:** Ensure your build environment used for generating the static Gatsby site is secure and isolated. Protect build servers from unauthorized access and malware, as this environment directly creates your Gatsby application's deployable assets.
2.  **Input Sanitization During Gatsby Build:** If your Gatsby build process involves fetching data from external sources (APIs, databases, CMS) or user-provided inputs *during Gatsby's data sourcing phase*, sanitize and validate this data to prevent injection attacks that could be embedded into the static site during the build phase.
3.  **Monitor Gatsby Build Logs for Suspicious Activity:** Regularly review build logs generated by Gatsby's build process for any unusual or suspicious activity that might indicate a compromised build process *within the Gatsby build context*. Look for errors, warnings, or unexpected commands executed during the Gatsby build.
4.  **Principle of Least Privilege for Gatsby Build Processes:** Grant only necessary permissions to build processes and scripts involved in the Gatsby build to minimize the potential impact of a compromised build environment *specifically within the Gatsby build pipeline*.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Compromised Gatsby Build Output (High Severity) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious code or content into the static files generated by Gatsby during the build process. This could lead to serving compromised static assets to users.
*   Build-Time Injection Attacks (Medium Severity) - Mitigates injection attacks that occur during Gatsby's data sourcing or build phases, preventing malicious data from being incorporated into the static site.
**Impact:**
*   Compromised Gatsby Build Output (High Impact) - Significantly reduces the risk of serving compromised static assets generated by Gatsby.
*   Build-Time Injection Attacks (Medium Impact) - Reduces the risk of injection vulnerabilities during the Gatsby build process.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic security measures for the build server are in place (OS hardening, access control).
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Specific input sanitization during Gatsby build data sourcing.
*   Automated monitoring of Gatsby build logs for security-related events.
*   Formalized principle of least privilege for Gatsby build processes and scripts.

## Mitigation Strategy: [GraphQL Security Best Practices (Gatsby Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/graphql_security_best_practices__gatsby_specific_.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Implement Rate Limiting for Gatsby GraphQL Endpoint:** Protect your Gatsby application's GraphQL endpoint (typically `/___graphql` in development, potentially exposed in custom setups) from denial-of-service attacks by implementing rate limiting. This restricts the number of requests a user or IP address can make to the Gatsby GraphQL endpoint within a given timeframe.
2.  **Apply Authentication and Authorization to Gatsby GraphQL Queries (If Necessary):** If your Gatsby GraphQL endpoint exposes sensitive data or mutations *beyond public content*, implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access. This might involve using API keys, JWTs, or other authentication methods to verify user identity and permissions *for accessing Gatsby GraphQL data*. This is less common in typical Gatsby static sites but relevant if you extend Gatsby's GraphQL capabilities.
3.  **Limit Query Complexity and Depth for Gatsby GraphQL:**  Protect against GraphQL query complexity attacks targeting your Gatsby GraphQL endpoint by setting limits on the depth and complexity of GraphQL queries. This prevents malicious actors from crafting excessively complex queries that can overload your Gatsby server *if you are running a Gatsby server or have extended GraphQL capabilities beyond static site generation*.
**Threats Mitigated:**
*   Gatsby GraphQL Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium to High Severity) - Prevents attackers from overwhelming your Gatsby application (especially in development or if running a Gatsby server) by sending a large number of requests to the GraphQL endpoint.
*   Unauthorized Access to Gatsby GraphQL Data (Medium Severity - if applicable): If your Gatsby GraphQL exposes sensitive data, this mitigates unauthorized access by enforcing authentication and authorization.
*   Gatsby GraphQL Query Complexity Attacks (Medium Severity - if applicable): Prevents attackers from using excessively complex GraphQL queries to overload your Gatsby server.
**Impact:**
*   Gatsby GraphQL Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium to High Impact) - Reduces the risk of DoS attacks targeting the Gatsby GraphQL endpoint.
*   Unauthorized Access to Gatsby GraphQL Data (Medium Impact - if applicable): Protects sensitive data exposed through Gatsby GraphQL.
*   Gatsby GraphQL Query Complexity Attacks (Medium Impact - if applicable): Mitigates query complexity attacks.
**Currently Implemented:**
*   No specific GraphQL security measures beyond disabling introspection are currently implemented for the Gatsby GraphQL endpoint.
**Missing Implementation:**
*   Rate limiting for the Gatsby GraphQL endpoint.
*   Authentication and authorization mechanisms for Gatsby GraphQL (if sensitive data is exposed).
*   Query complexity and depth limits for Gatsby GraphQL.
