# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for gatsbyjs/gatsby

## Mitigation Strategy: [GraphQL Query Minimization and Gatsby-Level Authorization](./mitigation_strategies/graphql_query_minimization_and_gatsby-level_authorization.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for GraphQL Queries and Careful Use of `createPages` Context.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Data Needs:** For each Gatsby page and component, meticulously list the *exact* data fields required from your GraphQL data layer.
    2.  **Craft Minimal Queries:** Write GraphQL queries within your Gatsby components and `gatsby-node.js` that *only* request those identified fields. Avoid fetching entire nodes unless absolutely necessary. Use fragments judiciously to avoid repetition, but ensure they are also minimal.
    3.  **Gatsby `createPages` Context:**  In `gatsby-node.js`, when using the `createPages` API to dynamically generate pages, be *extremely* cautious about the data passed to the `context` object.  Pass *only* the absolute minimum data required by the page template.  Avoid passing entire data objects; instead, pass specific IDs or individual fields.  This minimizes the data exposed to the client-side.
    4.  **Gatsby Plugin Options:** If using source plugins (e.g., `gatsby-source-contentful`, `gatsby-source-filesystem`), review their configuration options in `gatsby-config.js`. Some plugins might offer options to limit the data fetched or to filter data at the source.
    5.  **Regular Audits (Gatsby Focus):** Schedule regular reviews (e.g., monthly) of all GraphQL queries *within your Gatsby project* (components, `gatsby-node.js`). Use Gatsby-specific linters or static analysis tools (if available) to help identify potential over-fetching.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure via Gatsby's GraphQL Layer (High Severity):** Unintentional exposure of sensitive data through overly permissive GraphQL queries *within the Gatsby application*.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Leaking information about the application's data model or internal structure through Gatsby's GraphQL layer.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low) by minimizing the data exposed through Gatsby's GraphQL queries and `createPages` context.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduced (from Medium to Low) by limiting the information revealed through Gatsby's data layer.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   GraphQL queries in `src/components/ProductList.js` are minimized.
    *   `gatsby-node.js` passes only `postId` to the blog post template context.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal audit process for GraphQL queries within Gatsby is in place.
    *   Some older components might still be over-fetching data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Plugin Security Management (Gatsby Ecosystem)](./mitigation_strategies/plugin_security_management__gatsby_ecosystem_.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Gatsby Plugin Vetting, Updating, and Vulnerability Scanning.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Vetting (Gatsby Focus):** Before installing *any* Gatsby plugin:
        *   Check its GitHub repository: stars, forks, recent commits, open issues (especially security-related). Look for Gatsby-specific issues.
        *   Research the maintainer's reputation and responsiveness *within the Gatsby community*.
        *   Search for known vulnerabilities specifically related to the plugin's interaction with Gatsby.
        *   Prioritize official Gatsby plugins or those from well-known and trusted sources *within the Gatsby ecosystem*.
    2.  **Updating (Gatsby Focus):** Establish a regular update schedule (e.g., weekly) specifically for your Gatsby project. Use `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to update all Gatsby plugins and related dependencies. Pay close attention to Gatsby's own version updates.
    3.  **Vulnerability Scanning (Gatsby Focus):** Integrate a dependency vulnerability scanner that understands Gatsby's plugin architecture (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, Dependabot) into your workflow:
        *   Run it locally before committing code, focusing on Gatsby-related dependencies.
        *   Include it in your CI/CD pipeline, specifically targeting the Gatsby build process.
        *   Configure automated alerts for vulnerabilities in Gatsby plugins.
    4.  **Monitoring (Gatsby Focus):** Set up alerts (e.g., GitHub issue notifications) for the repositories of critical Gatsby plugins to be notified of security advisories *specifically affecting Gatsby*.
    5. **Gatsby Plugin Options Review:** Regularly review the configuration options of your installed Gatsby plugins in `gatsby-config.js`. Look for security-related settings that might help mitigate vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Gatsby Plugin Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Vulnerabilities in Gatsby plugins that could lead to RCE, XSS, data breaches, or other security issues *specifically through their interaction with Gatsby*.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks (High Severity):** A compromised Gatsby plugin (or its dependencies) could be used to inject malicious code into your Gatsby site.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Gatsby Plugin Vulnerabilities, Supply Chain Attacks:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low/Medium) by using vetted, updated, and scanned Gatsby plugins.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   We use `npm audit` locally before committing code.
    *   Dependabot is enabled on our GitHub repository.
    *   We primarily use official Gatsby plugins.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No formal Gatsby-specific plugin vetting process documented.
    *   No alerts set up for Gatsby plugin repository updates.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Client-Side Data Handling within Gatsby](./mitigation_strategies/secure_client-side_data_handling_within_gatsby.md)

**Mitigation Strategy:** Data Sanitization within Gatsby Components and Avoiding `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sanitization (Gatsby Focus):** Within your Gatsby components, *always* sanitize any data *sourced from Gatsby's data layer* before rendering it in the browser, even if it comes from a seemingly trusted source (like your CMS, accessed via a Gatsby source plugin).
        *   Use a robust sanitization library like `DOMPurify` *within your Gatsby components*.
        *   Sanitize HTML content *before* using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` *within a Gatsby component*.
    2.  **`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` Avoidance (Gatsby Focus):** Minimize the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` *within your Gatsby components*. Prefer using standard React components and JSX to render content sourced from Gatsby's data layer. If you *must* use it, *always* sanitize the input with `DOMPurify` *before passing it to the prop*.
    3. **Review Gatsby Plugin Transformations:** If using transformer plugins (e.g., `gatsby-transformer-remark`), be aware of how they handle potentially unsafe content.  Ensure they are configured securely and that their output is properly sanitized if necessary.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Gatsby's Data Layer (High Severity):** Malicious scripts injected into the site through data sourced from Gatsby's data layer (e.g., a compromised CMS connected via a source plugin).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk significantly reduced (from High to Low) by sanitizing data within Gatsby components and minimizing the use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   We use `DOMPurify` to sanitize HTML content from our CMS (accessed via `gatsby-source-contentful`) before rendering it with `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in the `BlogPost` component.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Sanitization is not consistently applied to all data from Gatsby's data layer rendered on the client-side.
