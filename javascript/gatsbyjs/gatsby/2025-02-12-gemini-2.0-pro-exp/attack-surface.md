# Attack Surface Analysis for gatsbyjs/gatsby

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Third-Party Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_third-party_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of security flaws in Gatsby plugins installed from the plugin ecosystem.
*   **How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby's core functionality is extended through a large, third-party plugin ecosystem. This reliance on external code *directly* introduces the risk of vulnerable plugins. The plugin API, while powerful, can be misused to create insecure functionality.
*   **Example:** A plugin designed to handle form submissions has a vulnerability allowing cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a form field, which is then executed in the browsers of other users visiting the site.
*   **Impact:** Complete site compromise, data breaches, defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if the plugin has high privileges or handles sensitive data) / **High** (for most plugins).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Selection:** Choose well-maintained, reputable plugins with a good security track record. Favor plugins from known developers.
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** *Regularly* use tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, or Dependabot to identify and update vulnerable plugins and their dependencies. Automate this.
    *   **Updates:** Keep *all* plugins updated to the latest versions. Subscribe to update notifications.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Configure plugins with the *minimum* necessary permissions.
    *   **Code Review (Optional):** For *critical* plugins, consider reviewing the source code.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a *strict* CSP to limit the resources a plugin can access.
    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Use only *essential* plugins.

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL Misconfiguration and Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/graphql_misconfiguration_and_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploiting weaknesses in the GraphQL data layer, often due to misconfiguration or lack of proper access controls.
*   **How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby *uses GraphQL as its core data layer*. This is a fundamental architectural choice that directly introduces the GraphQL attack surface. Gatsby's automatic schema generation, while convenient, can lead to unintended data exposure if not carefully managed.
*   **Example:** An attacker uses an introspection query to discover the entire GraphQL schema, including fields related to user authentication tokens. They then craft queries to retrieve these tokens, gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, denial of service, unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (if sensitive data is exposed) / **High** (for DoS).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Introspection:** *Disable* GraphQL introspection in *production* environments using Gatsby's configuration.
    *   **Query Complexity Limits:** Implement query complexity analysis and depth limiting. Use libraries like `graphql-validation-complexity`.
    *   **Authorization:** Implement *robust* authorization and access control at the GraphQL layer. Use Gatsby's `createPages` API and context.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting on GraphQL API requests.
    *   **Input Validation:** *Sanitize and validate* all user input used in GraphQL queries.
    *   **Schema Validation:** Use a GraphQL schema validation library.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed API Keys and Secrets (within Gatsby context)](./attack_surfaces/exposed_api_keys_and_secrets__within_gatsby_context_.md)

*   **Description:** Accidental exposure of API keys, secrets, or other sensitive credentials used by Gatsby plugins *or within the Gatsby build process*.
*   **How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby's build process, and the frequent use of plugins that interact with external services, *directly* increases the risk of exposing secrets if not handled carefully. The client-side nature of the final output means build-time secrets must be handled with extreme care.
*   **Example:** A developer accidentally includes a build-time environment variable containing an API key in a client-side JavaScript bundle, exposing the key to anyone who views the site's source code.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, financial loss, unauthorized access to third-party services, account compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** / **High** (depending on the sensitivity of the exposed credentials).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Environment Variables:** Use environment variables *correctly*. Understand the difference between build-time and runtime variables in Gatsby.
    *   **.gitignore:** Ensure `.env` files (and any files with secrets) are in `.gitignore`.
    *   **.env.example:** Provide a `.env.example` file.
    *   **Secret Management Tools:** Consider using secret management tools (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault) for production deployments.
    *   **Code Scanning:** Use tools to scan for accidentally committed secrets *before* pushing to the repository.
    *   **Build-time vs. Runtime:** Carefully distinguish between build-time and runtime environment variables. *Never* expose build-time secrets in client-side code.

## Attack Surface: [Gatsby Functions Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/gatsby_functions_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in serverless functions used with Gatsby Functions.
*   **How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby Functions *directly* introduce server-side code execution into the Gatsby environment, creating a new attack surface that wouldn't exist in a purely static site.
*   **Example:** A Gatsby Function that interacts with a database is vulnerable to SQL injection. An attacker crafts a malicious input that modifies the SQL query, allowing them to access or modify data in the database.
*   **Impact:** Server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, unauthorized access.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** / **Critical** (depending on the function's purpose and data).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Coding Practices:** Follow secure coding practices for serverless functions *rigorously*.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Configure functions with the *minimum* necessary permissions.
    *   **Dependency Management:** Keep function dependencies updated; use a vulnerability scanner.
    *   **Input Validation:** *Thoroughly* validate and sanitize *all* user input.
    *   **Authentication and Authorization:** Implement strong authentication and authorization where needed.
    *   **Monitoring and Logging:** Monitor function execution logs.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting.
