# Threat Model Analysis for gatsbyjs/gatsby

## Threat: [Malicious Gatsby Plugin Injection](./threats/malicious_gatsby_plugin_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker publishes a malicious Gatsby plugin to the npm registry, or compromises a legitimate plugin. Developers unknowingly install and use this plugin. During the build process (`gatsby build`), the malicious plugin executes arbitrary code. This is a *direct* attack on Gatsby's plugin architecture.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the generated static site. The attacker can inject malicious scripts, steal data (if present during build), modify content, or redirect users. The attacker could also potentially gain access to the build environment itself, depending on the plugin's capabilities.
    *   **Gatsby Component Affected:** `gatsby-*.js` plugins (any plugin), `gatsby-node.js` (where plugins often hook into the build process and have significant control), the entire build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Vetting:** Thoroughly vet plugins before installation. Check the plugin's author, download statistics, recent activity, and community feedback. Look for signs of abandonment or suspicious code.
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like `npm audit`, Snyk, or Dependabot to automatically scan for known vulnerabilities in plugins *and their dependencies*. This is crucial.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all plugins and dependencies updated to the latest secure versions. Enable automatic updates if using a CI/CD system.
        *   **Lockfiles:** Use `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent dependency resolution and prevent unexpected updates or "dependency confusion" attacks.
        *   **Forking (Extreme):** For *critical* plugins that are essential to the site's functionality, consider forking the repository and maintaining your own, audited version. This is a high-effort but high-security approach.
        *   **Code Review:** If feasible (for smaller plugins), review the source code of the plugin before using it, looking for suspicious patterns or potential vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Compromised npm Dependency (Used Directly by Gatsby or Plugins)](./threats/compromised_npm_dependency__used_directly_by_gatsby_or_plugins_.md)

*   **Description:** A dependency (not a Gatsby plugin itself, but an npm package *used by Gatsby or its plugins*) is compromised. This could be a direct dependency of Gatsby, or a transitive dependency (a dependency of a dependency). The compromised code executes during the `gatsby build` process. This directly impacts Gatsby because it relies on the npm ecosystem.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to the malicious plugin, this can lead to arbitrary code execution during the build, resulting in a compromised static site. The attacker gains control over the build output and potentially the build environment.
    *   **Gatsby Component Affected:** Any part of the Gatsby build process that uses the compromised dependency. This could be within `gatsby-core`, `gatsby-node.js`, `gatsby-config.js`, page templates, components, or any installed plugin.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools like `npm audit`, Snyk, or Dependabot to automatically scan for known vulnerabilities in *all* dependencies, including transitive dependencies.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep *all* dependencies updated to the latest secure versions. This is a continuous process.
        *   **Lockfiles:** Use `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` to ensure consistent dependency resolution and prevent unexpected updates.
        *   **Pinning (Caution):** Consider pinning dependencies to specific versions *if* you have a robust process for regularly reviewing and updating those pinned versions.  Otherwise, pinning can lead to using outdated and vulnerable packages.
        *   **Supply Chain Security Tools:** Explore tools specifically designed for software supply chain security, which may offer more advanced detection capabilities beyond simple vulnerability scanning.

## Threat: [Build Environment Compromise (Affecting Gatsby Build)](./threats/build_environment_compromise__affecting_gatsby_build_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the environment where the Gatsby `build` command is executed (e.g., a developer's machine, a CI/CD pipeline). The attacker can then directly modify the Gatsby build process, inject malicious code, or alter Gatsby's configuration. This directly targets the Gatsby build process.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the generated static site. The attacker can inject arbitrary code, steal data present during the build, or modify content. This is a very powerful attack vector because it bypasses any security measures within the Gatsby application itself.
    *   **Gatsby Component Affected:** The entire Gatsby build process, including `gatsby-cli`, `gatsby-config.js`, `gatsby-node.js`, and all plugins.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure CI/CD:** Use secure CI/CD pipelines with limited access and strong authentication (multi-factor authentication). Ensure the CI/CD system itself is regularly patched and secured.
        *   **Clean Build Environments:** Use dedicated, clean build environments (e.g., Docker containers or ephemeral virtual machines) that are created fresh for each build and destroyed afterward. This prevents persistent malware from affecting subsequent builds.
        *   **Limited Access:** Restrict access to the build environment to authorized personnel only. Follow the principle of least privilege.
        *   **Monitoring:** Monitor build logs for anomalies, unauthorized access attempts, and unexpected changes to the build process.
        *   **Code Signing (Advanced):** Consider code signing for build artifacts to ensure their integrity and verify that they haven't been tampered with after the build.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization in Gatsby Plugins](./threats/insecure_deserialization_in_gatsby_plugins.md)

* **Description:** A Gatsby plugin uses insecure deserialization of untrusted data. This can occur if the plugin processes data from external sources or user input without proper validation, and uses a vulnerable deserialization library or method. This is a direct vulnerability within the Gatsby plugin ecosystem.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution (RCE) within the build process, leading to a complete compromise of the generated static site and potentially the build environment.
    * **Gatsby Component Affected:** Any `gatsby-*.js` plugin that handles external data, particularly those using libraries known to be vulnerable to deserialization issues (e.g., older versions of libraries that handle YAML, XML, or serialized JavaScript objects).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Untrusted Deserialization:** Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources whenever possible. If the plugin doesn't *need* to deserialize data, it shouldn't.
        * **Safe Deserialization Libraries:** If deserialization is absolutely necessary, use libraries that are known to be secure and have built-in protections against deserialization vulnerabilities. Research the chosen library thoroughly.
        * **Input Validation:** Thoroughly validate and sanitize *any* data *before* deserializing it. This includes checking data types, lengths, and allowed characters.
        * **Dependency Scanning:** Regularly scan dependencies (including the plugin's dependencies) for known deserialization vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or Snyk.
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Run the Gatsby build process with the least necessary privileges to limit the impact of a successful attack. This might involve running the build in a sandboxed environment.
