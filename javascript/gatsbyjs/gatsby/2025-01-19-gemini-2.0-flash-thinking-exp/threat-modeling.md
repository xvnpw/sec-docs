# Threat Model Analysis for gatsbyjs/gatsby

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Injection](./threats/malicious_plugin_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker with access to the project's `package.json` or build environment adds a malicious Gatsby plugin. This plugin executes arbitrary code during the build process, potentially injecting malicious scripts into the generated static files or exfiltrating sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Serving malware to website visitors, redirecting traffic to malicious sites, stealing user data, or compromising the integrity of the website content.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gatsby's plugin loading mechanism and the build process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict access control for the project's codebase and build environment.
        *   Regularly review the `package.json` file for unexpected or suspicious dependencies.
        *   Use a secure and trusted CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Employ code review practices for changes to dependencies.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data via GraphQL Introspection](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_via_graphql_introspection.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data via GraphQL Introspection
    *   **Description:** If the Gatsby application uses GraphQL for data fetching during the build process and introspection is enabled without proper access controls, an attacker could query the GraphQL schema to discover sensitive data structures and potentially extract data not intended for public access.
    *   **Impact:** Disclosure of confidential information, such as internal data structures, API keys, or other sensitive details used during the build.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gatsby's GraphQL data layer, specifically the GraphQL server configuration during build time.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium  *(Note: While the impact can be high, the direct involvement of Gatsby might be considered medium in some contexts. However, given the potential for sensitive data exposure, it's often treated with high vigilance)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Disable GraphQL introspection in production or restrict access to authorized users/systems during the build process.
        *   Carefully review the GraphQL schema to ensure no sensitive data is inadvertently exposed.

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion during Build](./threats/denial_of_service_via_resource_exhaustion_during_build.md)

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service via Resource Exhaustion during Build
    *   **Description:** An attacker could attempt to trigger a resource-intensive Gatsby build process, potentially by manipulating data sources or build configurations, leading to excessive CPU or memory usage on the build server and causing a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Inability to deploy updates, increased infrastructure costs, and potential disruption of the development workflow.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gatsby's build process, particularly data fetching and transformation stages.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(Note: The severity can escalate to high depending on the criticality of the deployment pipeline)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement resource limits and monitoring for the build process.
        *   Optimize data fetching and transformation logic to minimize resource consumption.
        *   Implement safeguards against malicious or excessively large data inputs.

## Threat: [Client-Side Data Injection during Hydration](./threats/client-side_data_injection_during_hydration.md)

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Data Injection during Hydration
    *   **Description:** If data used for client-side hydration is sourced from untrusted sources or not properly sanitized during the build process, an attacker could inject malicious scripts or data that are executed when the static site becomes interactive in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to steal user credentials, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of users.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gatsby's data fetching and rendering pipeline, particularly the hydration process.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize all data used for client-side rendering to prevent XSS attacks.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
        *   Regularly review and audit the data flow and rendering logic.

## Threat: [Insecure Defaults or Misconfigurations](./threats/insecure_defaults_or_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Defaults or Misconfigurations
    *   **Description:** Developers might rely on insecure default configurations provided by Gatsby or its plugins, or they might misconfigure certain aspects of the application, leading to security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:** Increased attack surface and potential for various types of exploits depending on the specific misconfiguration.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gatsby's core configuration and potentially plugin configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(Note: The severity depends heavily on the specific default or misconfiguration)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review Gatsby's documentation and best practices for security configurations.
        *   Perform security audits of the application's configuration settings.
        *   Follow security hardening guidelines for web applications.

## Threat: [Stale or Outdated Dependencies in Gatsby Core](./threats/stale_or_outdated_dependencies_in_gatsby_core.md)

*   **Threat:** Stale or Outdated Dependencies in Gatsby Core
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities might exist in the core dependencies used by Gatsby itself. If these dependencies are not regularly updated, applications built with older versions of Gatsby could be vulnerable.
    *   **Impact:** Potential for various exploits depending on the nature of the vulnerability in the underlying dependency.
    *   **Affected Component:** Gatsby's core dependencies (e.g., webpack, React).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium *(Note: Severity can be high or critical depending on the specific vulnerability)*
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Gatsby itself updated to the latest stable version.
        *   Monitor security advisories related to Gatsby's core dependencies.
