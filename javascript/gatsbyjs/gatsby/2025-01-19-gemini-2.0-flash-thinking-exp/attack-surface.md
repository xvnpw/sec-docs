# Attack Surface Analysis for gatsbyjs/gatsby

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Data Sources](./attack_surfaces/compromised_data_sources.md)

**Description:** Malicious content injected into the static site during the build process due to compromised data sources.

**How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby's static site generation pulls data from various sources (CMS, APIs, local files) at build time. If these sources are compromised, the generated site will inherently contain malicious content.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to a headless CMS used by Gatsby and injects malicious JavaScript into a blog post's content. When Gatsby builds the site, this script is included in the static HTML, leading to XSS for visitors.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), phishing attacks, redirection to malicious sites, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong authentication and authorization for all data sources.
*   Regularly audit and monitor data sources for suspicious activity.
*   Sanitize and validate data retrieved from external sources before using it in Gatsby components.
*   Use secure communication protocols (HTTPS) for fetching data.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Build Tools](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_build_tools.md)

**Description:** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Node.js packages and build tools used by Gatsby.

**How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby relies on a Node.js environment and a vast ecosystem of npm packages for its functionality and plugins. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited during the build process.

**Example:** A critical security flaw is discovered in a popular Gatsby plugin's dependency. An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability during the `npm install` or build phase to gain control of the build server.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, denial of service, supply chain attacks.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Node.js and npm to the latest stable versions.
*   Use a dependency management tool (like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`) to identify and address known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.
*   Consider using tools like Dependabot for automated dependency updates.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Code Injection via Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_code_injection_via_plugins.md)

**Description:** Introduction of malicious code into the build process or the generated site through compromised or malicious Gatsby plugins.

**How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby's plugin architecture allows developers to extend its functionality. Installing untrusted or vulnerable plugins can introduce security risks.

**Example:** A developer installs a seemingly useful Gatsby plugin from an untrusted source. This plugin contains malicious code that injects a keylogger into the generated website, capturing user input.

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), data theft, backdoors, compromised build process.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only install plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
*   Thoroughly review the code of plugins before installation, especially those from unknown authors.
*   Keep plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of injected scripts.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Storage of API Keys and Secrets](./attack_surfaces/insecure_storage_of_api_keys_and_secrets.md)

**Description:** Storing sensitive API keys or other secrets directly in the codebase or easily accessible configuration files.

**How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby applications often need to interact with external APIs, requiring API keys. Improper storage exposes these secrets.

**Example:** An API key for a content delivery network (CDN) is hardcoded in `gatsby-config.js` and committed to a public Git repository. An attacker finds this key and can now manipulate the CDN's content.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, financial loss.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Store API keys and secrets securely using environment variables.
*   Use a secrets management tool (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
*   Avoid committing sensitive information to version control.
*   Implement proper access controls for accessing secrets.
