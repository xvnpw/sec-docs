**Gatsby Application Threat Model - Focused on High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes**

**Objective:** Compromise application data or functionality by exploiting weaknesses within the Gatsby framework or its ecosystem.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Gatsby Application
*   AND - Gain Unauthorized Access/Control
    *   OR - Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gatsby Core
        *   Exploit Known Gatsby Vulnerabilities *** HIGH-RISK PATH START *** *** CRITICAL NODE ***
        *   Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gatsby Dependencies *** HIGH-RISK PATH START *** *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    *   OR - Exploit Gatsby Plugin Ecosystem
        *   Exploit Vulnerable Gatsby Plugins *** HIGH-RISK PATH START *** *** CRITICAL NODE ***
        *   Malicious Plugin Injection *** CRITICAL NODE ***
    *   OR - Exploit Gatsby Build Process
        *   Malicious Code Injection during Build *** HIGH-RISK PATH START *** *** CRITICAL NODE ***
        *   Compromise Build Environment *** CRITICAL NODE *** *** HIGH-RISK PATH START ***
    *   OR - Exploit Gatsby Development Environment
        *   Compromise Developer Machines *** CRITICAL NODE *** *** HIGH-RISK PATH START ***
*   AND - Impact Application
    *   OR - Data Breach *** HIGH-RISK PATH END ***
    *   OR - Malicious Code Execution *** HIGH-RISK PATH END ***
    *   OR - Account Takeover *** HIGH-RISK PATH END ***

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Known Gatsby Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_gatsby_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers research publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in specific Gatsby versions used by the target application. They then develop or utilize existing exploits to take advantage of these weaknesses.
    *   **Why High-Risk:**  Known vulnerabilities are well-documented, and exploits are often readily available, making this a relatively easy and impactful attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Gatsby Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_gatsby_dependencies.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify vulnerabilities in the libraries that Gatsby relies on (e.g., React, Webpack). They then exploit these vulnerabilities within the context of the Gatsby application.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Gatsby's functionality depends on these libraries, and vulnerabilities within them can have a wide-ranging impact. Exploits for common dependencies are often developed and shared.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Vulnerable Gatsby Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerable_gatsby_plugins.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers identify known vulnerabilities in the Gatsby plugins installed in the target application. They then exploit these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or control.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** The Gatsby plugin ecosystem is vast, and not all plugins are maintained with the same level of security rigor. This creates numerous potential entry points for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Code Injection during Build](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_code_injection_during_build.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious code into the application during the Gatsby build process. This can be achieved by compromising data sources, exploiting vulnerable transformers, or manipulating GraphQL queries.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Successful code injection during the build process can lead to persistent vulnerabilities in the deployed application, affecting all users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Build Environment](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_build_environment.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to the build server or developer machines involved in the Gatsby build process. This allows them to directly modify build scripts, configurations, or inject malicious code.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Compromising the build environment provides attackers with a high degree of control over the application's final output, enabling them to inject persistent backdoors or malicious functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Developer Machines](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_developer_machines.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers compromise the machines of developers working on the Gatsby application. This can be achieved through phishing, malware, or exploiting vulnerabilities on their systems.
    *   **Why High-Risk:** Compromised developer machines can be used to inject malicious code directly into the codebase, introduce vulnerable dependencies, or leak sensitive credentials.
