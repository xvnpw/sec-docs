# Attack Surface Analysis for gatsbyjs/gatsby

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Build-Time Secrets](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_build-time_secrets.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or private tokens are inadvertently included in the generated static files or build logs.

**How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby's build process often involves fetching data from external sources or using environment variables. If these are not handled securely, they can end up in the final output.

**Example:** An API key for a headless CMS is directly embedded in a JavaScript file during the build process to fetch blog posts. This key is now publicly accessible in the generated `main.js` file.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services, data breaches, or the ability to manipulate application behavior.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Utilize environment variables at runtime instead of build time where possible.
*   Use secure secret management tools (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) and avoid committing secrets directly to the codebase.
*   Carefully review build outputs and logs for any accidentally exposed sensitive information.
*   Implement proper access controls on build servers and CI/CD pipelines.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Gatsby Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_gatsby_plugins.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within third-party Gatsby plugins used in the project.

**How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby's plugin architecture encourages extensibility, but relying on external code introduces dependencies with potential vulnerabilities.

**Example:** A popular image optimization plugin has a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious scripts into the website when certain image URLs are processed.

**Impact:** XSS attacks, arbitrary code execution (depending on the plugin's functionality), data breaches, or website defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Thoroughly vet and audit the security of all Gatsby plugins before using them.
*   Keep all plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Subscribe to security advisories for popular Gatsby plugins.
*   Consider alternatives or developing custom solutions for critical functionalities if plugin security is a concern.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Gatsby Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_gatsby_plugins.md)

**Description:** Intentionally malicious plugins are used in the project, designed to compromise the application or steal data.

**How Gatsby Contributes:** The open nature of the Gatsby plugin ecosystem makes it possible for malicious actors to publish harmful plugins.

**Example:** A plugin disguised as a utility library secretly injects code to exfiltrate user data or inject cryptocurrency mining scripts into the generated website.

**Impact:** Data theft, compromised user accounts, website defacement, or resource hijacking.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Only install plugins from trusted sources with a strong reputation and active maintenance.
*   Carefully review the plugin's source code (if available) before installation.
*   Be wary of plugins with excessive permissions or that request access to sensitive data.
*   Regularly audit installed plugins and remove any that are no longer needed or appear suspicious.

## Attack Surface: [GraphQL Injection Attacks](./attack_surfaces/graphql_injection_attacks.md)

**Description:** Attackers craft malicious GraphQL queries to extract sensitive data or manipulate data sources connected via Gatsby's GraphQL layer.

**How Gatsby Contributes:** Gatsby uses GraphQL to fetch and manage data during the build process. If data sources are not properly sanitized, they can be vulnerable to injection.

**Example:** A Gatsby site fetches data from a headless CMS using GraphQL. An attacker crafts a query that bypasses authorization checks and retrieves data from other users or projects.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breaches, or manipulation of backend data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement proper authorization and authentication mechanisms on the GraphQL data sources.
*   Sanitize and validate all inputs to GraphQL resolvers.
*   Use parameterized queries or prepared statements where applicable.
*   Enforce rate limiting and query complexity limits to prevent abuse.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Handling of User-Generated Content (if applicable)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_handling_of_user-generated_content__if_applicable_.md)

**Description:** If the Gatsby site incorporates user-generated content (e.g., through integrations with comment systems or forms), improper sanitization can lead to vulnerabilities.

**How Gatsby Contributes:** While Gatsby primarily generates static sites, integrations might introduce dynamic elements and user input handling.

**Example:** A comment section integrated with the Gatsby site doesn't sanitize user input, allowing attackers to inject malicious JavaScript that executes in other users' browsers (XSS).

**Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, session hijacking, or other client-side vulnerabilities.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Sanitize and validate all user-generated content before displaying it on the website.
*   Use appropriate encoding techniques to prevent script injection.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.
