# Threat Model Analysis for gatsbyjs/gatsby

## Threat: [Malicious Dependency Injection](./threats/malicious_dependency_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker could compromise a direct or transitive dependency used by the Gatsby project. This involves publishing a malicious version or exploiting a vulnerability to inject malicious code during `npm install` or `yarn install`. This code executes during Gatsby's build process.

**Impact:** Code execution during the Gatsby build, potentially leading to manipulation of the generated static site, data theft (including environment variables used by Gatsby), or supply chain attacks where malicious code is included in the final website.

**Affected Gatsby Component:** `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, Node.js module resolution *within the context of Gatsby's build process*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly audit project dependencies using `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
* Implement dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline.
* Use a dependency lock file (package-lock.json or yarn.lock).
* Review and understand the dependencies being used.

## Threat: [Compromised Gatsby Plugin](./threats/compromised_gatsby_plugin.md)

**Description:** An attacker could create a malicious Gatsby plugin or compromise an existing one. When a developer installs and uses this plugin, the malicious code within the plugin can execute *during the Gatsby build process*, leveraging Gatsby's plugin APIs.

**Impact:** Injection of malicious code into the generated website, leading to client-side attacks (e.g., XSS), data exfiltration, or defacement. Potential for code execution on the build server if the plugin performs server-side operations during the Gatsby build.

**Affected Gatsby Component:** Gatsby's plugin system, `gatsby-config.js`, Node.js module resolution *within the Gatsby plugin ecosystem*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully vet plugins before installation.
* Review plugin code if possible.
* Keep plugins updated.
* Implement code review for changes to `gatsby-config.js` and plugin additions.

## Threat: [Build Script Injection](./threats/build_script_injection.md)

**Description:** If the development environment is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious commands into Gatsby's build scripts defined in `package.json` or custom scripts referenced in `gatsby-config.js`. These commands are then executed *as part of the Gatsby build process*.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution on the build server, allowing the attacker to steal secrets used by Gatsby, modify build outputs, or disrupt the build process.

**Affected Gatsby Component:** `package.json` scripts, custom build scripts referenced by Gatsby, Gatsby's build pipeline.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure the development environment.
* Implement strict access controls for modifying build configuration files.
* Use environment variables for sensitive configuration data instead of hardcoding them in build scripts.
* Implement code review for changes to build scripts.

## Threat: [Data Source Manipulation During Build](./threats/data_source_manipulation_during_build.md)

**Description:** If Gatsby fetches data from external sources (APIs, CMSs, databases) during the build, an attacker compromising these sources could inject malicious content into the data. This malicious data is then incorporated into the generated static files *by Gatsby*.

**Impact:** Serving malicious content to website visitors, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or website defacement.

**Affected Gatsby Component:** Gatsby's data fetching mechanisms (e.g., `gatsby-source-*` plugins, GraphQL queries), build pipeline.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure data sources with strong authentication and authorization.
* Implement input validation and sanitization for data fetched during the build process.
* Use read-only API keys or tokens for data fetching where possible.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Build Artifacts](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_build_artifacts.md)

**Description:** Developers might unintentionally include sensitive information (API keys, secrets, internal data) directly in the code or configuration files that are then processed and included in the generated static files *by Gatsby*.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive information, potentially leading to account compromise, data breaches, or further attacks.

**Affected Gatsby Component:** All generated static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), build logs *generated by Gatsby*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in code.
* Use environment variables for sensitive configuration and access them securely during the build process.
* Implement mechanisms to prevent sensitive data from being included in build outputs.

## Threat: [Unsecured GraphQL API in Production](./threats/unsecured_graphql_api_in_production.md)

**Description:** Gatsby exposes a GraphQL API during development. If this API is inadvertently left enabled or improperly secured in a production environment, attackers can query it to potentially extract sensitive data *managed by Gatsby's data layer*.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, revealing internal data structures, content not intended for public access, or potentially sensitive business logic managed through Gatsby's data sourcing.

**Affected Gatsby Component:** Gatsby's internal GraphQL server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure the GraphQL API is explicitly disabled in production builds.
* If the API is intentionally exposed, implement strong authentication and authorization.
* Limit the scope of the GraphQL schema in production.

## Threat: [Cache Poisoning via CDN (Directly related to Gatsby's output)](./threats/cache_poisoning_via_cdn__directly_related_to_gatsby's_output_.md)

**Description:** If a CDN is used to serve the Gatsby site, vulnerabilities in the CDN configuration or the origin server could allow attackers to poison the CDN's cache with malicious content. This malicious content, generated by Gatsby, would then be served to users.

**Impact:** Serving malicious content to website visitors, potentially leading to phishing attacks, malware distribution, or defacement of the Gatsby-generated website.

**Affected Gatsby Component:** The generated static files produced by Gatsby and served through the CDN.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure CDN configurations and access controls.
* Implement proper cache invalidation mechanisms.
* Use signed URLs or tokens for accessing sensitive content.
* Monitor CDN logs for suspicious activity.
