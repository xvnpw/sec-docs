# Attack Tree Analysis for gatsbyjs/gatsby

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To execute arbitrary code within the application's build process or client-side environment by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Gatsby itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
High-Risk Sub-Tree: Compromise Gatsby Application
* OR: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gatsby Core *** HIGH RISK PATH ***
    * AND: Trigger SSRF during build process
        * Leverage vulnerable plugin fetching external data **CRITICAL NODE**
    * AND: Exploit Client-Side Hydration Vulnerabilities *** HIGH RISK PATH ***
        * Inject malicious data into GraphQL data layer **CRITICAL NODE**
* OR: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gatsby Plugins *** HIGH RISK PATH ***
    * AND: Inject malicious code via vulnerable plugin **CRITICAL NODE**
        * Exploit insecure plugin configuration
        * Exploit vulnerabilities in plugin's dependencies **CRITICAL NODE**
* OR: Compromise Gatsby Configuration *** HIGH RISK PATH ***
    * AND: Inject malicious configuration during build **CRITICAL NODE**
```


## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gatsby Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_gatsby_core.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Trigger SSRF during build process:
        * Leverage vulnerable plugin fetching external data (CRITICAL NODE): An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability in a Gatsby plugin that fetches data from external sources. By manipulating the input to the plugin, the attacker can force it to make requests to internal resources, potentially revealing sensitive information or interacting with internal services.
    * Exploit Client-Side Hydration Vulnerabilities:
        * Inject malicious data into GraphQL data layer (CRITICAL NODE): The attacker compromises a data source used during the Gatsby build process (e.g., a CMS or data file). This allows them to inject malicious data into the GraphQL data layer. When the static site is hydrated on the client-side, this malicious data can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to persistent XSS.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Gatsby Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_gatsby_plugins.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Inject malicious code via vulnerable plugin (CRITICAL NODE):
        * Exploit insecure plugin configuration: Some Gatsby plugins allow configuration through `gatsby-config.js`. If a plugin doesn't properly sanitize these configuration options, an attacker who can modify this file (e.g., through a compromised CI/CD pipeline) can inject malicious code that gets executed during the build process.
        * Exploit vulnerabilities in plugin's dependencies (CRITICAL NODE): Gatsby plugins rely on numerous npm packages. If a plugin uses a vulnerable dependency, an attacker can exploit that vulnerability to inject malicious code during the build or at runtime.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Gatsby Configuration](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_gatsby_configuration.md)

* Attack Vectors:
    * Inject malicious configuration during build (CRITICAL NODE):
        * Leverage vulnerabilities in Gatsby's configuration loading mechanism: If there are vulnerabilities in how Gatsby loads and processes its configuration files (`gatsby-config.js`, `gatsby-node.js`, etc.), an attacker might be able to inject malicious configuration that gets executed during the build process. This could involve manipulating file paths, environment variables, or other configuration settings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage vulnerable plugin fetching external data](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_vulnerable_plugin_fetching_external_data.md)

This node is critical because it represents a common vulnerability in web applications (SSRF) that can be exploited through third-party Gatsby plugins. Successful exploitation can grant access to internal resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious data into GraphQL data layer](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_graphql_data_layer.md)

This node is critical because it directly leads to persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), a high-impact client-side vulnerability that can compromise user accounts and sessions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious code via vulnerable plugin](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_vulnerable_plugin.md)

This node is critical because it allows for arbitrary code execution during the build process. This level of access can be used to compromise the entire build output, inject backdoors, or steal sensitive information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in plugin's dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_plugin's_dependencies.md)

This node is critical because it represents a broad attack surface. Gatsby plugins often have numerous dependencies, and vulnerabilities in these dependencies are a common source of security issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious configuration during build](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_configuration_during_build.md)

This node is critical because it allows for arbitrary code execution and manipulation of the entire build process. Compromising the build process can have widespread and severe consequences for the application's security.
