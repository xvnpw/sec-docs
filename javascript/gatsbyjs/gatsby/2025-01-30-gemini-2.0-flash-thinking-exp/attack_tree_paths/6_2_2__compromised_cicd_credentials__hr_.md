### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 6.2.2. Compromised CI/CD Credentials [HR]

**Attack Step:** Compromise CI/CD credentials to gain control over the deployment process.

**Description:** This attack path focuses on gaining unauthorized access to the credentials used by the Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) system to deploy the GatsbyJS application.  Successful compromise of these credentials allows an attacker to manipulate the deployment pipeline, potentially leading to:

*   **Code Injection:** Injecting malicious code into the GatsbyJS application codebase during the build or deployment process. This could range from defacement to more sophisticated attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS) or backdoors.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Modifying the deployment process to exfiltrate sensitive data, such as environment variables, configuration files, or even parts of the application's database if accessible through the CI/CD pipeline.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Disrupting the deployment process, preventing legitimate updates, or even deploying a modified application that causes instability or downtime.
*   **Supply Chain Attack:**  Compromising the application's dependencies or build process to introduce vulnerabilities that affect all users of the deployed application.
*   **Privilege Escalation:**  Using compromised CI/CD access to potentially gain further access to infrastructure or other systems connected to the deployment pipeline.

**Risk Rating Breakdown:**

*   **Likelihood: Low-Medium:**  While not as trivial as exploiting a public-facing vulnerability, compromising CI/CD credentials is a realistic threat. The likelihood depends heavily on the security practices implemented around credential management and access control within the development team and the CI/CD platform itself.  Factors increasing likelihood include:
    *   **Weak Credential Management:** Storing credentials in insecure locations (e.g., plain text in code repositories, easily guessable passwords).
    *   **Insufficient Access Control:** Overly permissive access to CI/CD systems and credential stores.
    *   **Social Engineering:** Phishing or social engineering attacks targeting developers or operations personnel with access to CI/CD credentials.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in CI/CD Platform:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform itself.

*   **Impact: High:** The impact of compromised CI/CD credentials is considered **High** because it grants the attacker significant control over the application deployment process. This can lead to severe consequences, including data breaches, application defacement, service disruption, and reputational damage.  A compromised GatsbyJS application can directly impact users and the organization's online presence.

*   **Effort: Low-Medium:** The effort required to compromise CI/CD credentials can range from **Low to Medium**.  Simple attacks like guessing weak passwords or exploiting publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated CI/CD platforms require less effort. More sophisticated attacks, such as targeted phishing or exploiting complex CI/CD misconfigurations, might require medium effort.

*   **Skill Level: Low-Medium:**  The skill level required can also vary. Basic attacks like password guessing or using readily available exploits require **Low** skill. However, more advanced attacks involving social engineering, exploiting complex CI/CD workflows, or developing custom exploits might require **Medium** skill.

*   **Detection Difficulty: Medium:** Detecting compromised CI/CD credentials can be **Medium** in difficulty.  While some CI/CD platforms offer audit logs and anomaly detection features, attackers can often operate stealthily by mimicking legitimate deployment activities or disabling logging.  Effective detection requires proactive monitoring, security information and event management (SIEM) systems, and anomaly detection rules tailored to typical CI/CD pipeline behavior.

**Potential Attack Vectors:**

*   **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Targeting developers or operations personnel with access to CI/CD systems to trick them into revealing credentials (passwords, API keys, tokens).
*   **Credential Stuffing/Password Spraying:** Using leaked credentials from other breaches to attempt to log in to CI/CD platforms or access credential stores.
*   **Compromised Developer Machines:**  If a developer's machine is compromised, attackers could potentially extract credentials stored locally or used for CI/CD access.
*   **Insecure Credential Storage:** Finding credentials stored in insecure locations such as:
    *   Plain text files in code repositories (even if not committed, they might be present in local developer environments or build artifacts).
    *   Unencrypted environment variables or configuration files.
    *   Weakly protected secrets management systems.
*   **Exploiting CI/CD Platform Vulnerabilities:**  Identifying and exploiting known or zero-day vulnerabilities in the CI/CD platform itself to gain access to credentials or bypass authentication.
*   **Insider Threat:** Malicious or negligent insiders with legitimate access to CI/CD systems could intentionally or unintentionally compromise credentials.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** Intercepting network traffic to capture credentials during transmission, especially if unencrypted channels are used.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** Attempting to brute-force passwords or API keys, although often less effective due to rate limiting and account lockout mechanisms.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **Strong Credential Management:**
    *   **Use Dedicated Secrets Management Tools:** Implement dedicated secrets management solutions (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, Google Cloud Secret Manager) to securely store and manage CI/CD credentials.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only necessary permissions to CI/CD users and service accounts.
    *   **Regular Credential Rotation:** Implement a policy for regular rotation of CI/CD credentials (passwords, API keys, tokens).
    *   **Avoid Storing Credentials in Code:** Never store credentials directly in code repositories, configuration files, or environment variables that are easily accessible.
*   **Secure CI/CD Platform Configuration:**
    *   **Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Enforce MFA for all users accessing the CI/CD platform.
    *   **Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  Use RBAC to restrict access to CI/CD resources and functionalities based on user roles and responsibilities.
    *   **Regularly Update CI/CD Platform:** Keep the CI/CD platform and its dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches.
    *   **Harden CI/CD Agents/Runners:** Secure the environments where CI/CD jobs are executed (agents/runners) to prevent credential theft from these systems.
    *   **Secure Communication Channels:** Ensure all communication within the CI/CD pipeline and with external services is encrypted (HTTPS, SSH).
*   **Code Review and Security Audits:**
    *   **Regular Code Reviews:** Conduct code reviews to identify potential vulnerabilities in CI/CD configurations and scripts.
    *   **Security Audits of CI/CD Pipeline:** Perform periodic security audits of the entire CI/CD pipeline to identify weaknesses and misconfigurations.
*   **Developer Security Awareness Training:**
    *   **Train Developers on Secure Coding Practices:** Educate developers on secure coding practices, including secure credential management and avoiding common pitfalls.
    *   **Phishing Awareness Training:** Conduct regular phishing awareness training to help developers recognize and avoid social engineering attacks.
*   **Network Security:**
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Segment the CI/CD environment from other networks to limit the impact of a potential breach.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Implement firewall rules to restrict network access to and from the CI/CD environment.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:**
    *   **Enable Comprehensive Logging:** Enable detailed logging of all CI/CD activities, including authentication attempts, access to secrets, and deployment actions.
    *   **Implement Security Monitoring and Alerting:** Set up security monitoring and alerting systems to detect suspicious activities in the CI/CD pipeline, such as unusual login attempts, unauthorized access to secrets, or unexpected deployment changes.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Implement anomaly detection mechanisms to identify deviations from normal CI/CD pipeline behavior that could indicate a compromise.

**Detection and Response Recommendations:**

*   **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement real-time monitoring of CI/CD logs for suspicious activities, such as:
    *   Failed login attempts from unusual locations.
    *   Access to secrets by unauthorized users or processes.
    *   Unexpected changes to CI/CD configurations or pipelines.
    *   Unusual deployment activities.
*   **Alerting and Notifications:** Configure alerts to notify security teams and relevant personnel immediately upon detection of suspicious activities.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** Develop and maintain an incident response plan specifically for CI/CD credential compromise scenarios. This plan should include steps for:
    *   **Isolation:** Immediately isolate compromised CI/CD systems or accounts.
    *   **Containment:** Prevent further damage by stopping malicious deployments and revoking compromised credentials.
    *   **Eradication:** Identify and remove any malicious code or configurations injected into the application or CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Recovery:** Restore the CI/CD pipeline and application to a secure state.
    *   **Lessons Learned:** Conduct a post-incident review to identify the root cause of the compromise and implement preventative measures to avoid future incidents.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

By implementing these mitigation and detection strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk of compromised CI/CD credentials and protect their GatsbyJS application from potential attacks targeting the deployment pipeline. Regular review and updates of these security measures are crucial to adapt to evolving threats and maintain a strong security posture.
