## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Gatsby's GraphQL Endpoint](./mitigation_strategies/secure_gatsby's_graphql_endpoint.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Gatsby's GraphQL Endpoint
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Restrict Gatsby GraphQL Access in Production (Recommended):**  For static Gatsby sites, the GraphQL endpoint (`/___graphql`) is primarily for development. Ensure it's not publicly accessible in production. Configure your web server or hosting provider to block access to this path.
    2.  **Rate Limiting for Gatsby GraphQL (If Exposed):** If you intentionally expose the Gatsby GraphQL endpoint (e.g., for server-side rendering or specific Gatsby use cases), implement rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks targeting the Gatsby GraphQL API.
    3.  **Authentication and Authorization for Gatsby GraphQL (If Sensitive Data):** If your Gatsby GraphQL endpoint exposes sensitive data (which is less common in typical static Gatsby sites but possible in SSR or extended setups), implement authentication and authorization to control access to the Gatsby GraphQL API.
    4.  **Disable Gatsby GraphQL in Production (If Not Needed):** If the Gatsby GraphQL endpoint is not required in production for your Gatsby application, explore Gatsby configuration options or server-side configurations to completely disable it in production environments to minimize the attack surface.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) against Gatsby GraphQL (Medium Severity):**  Unprotected Gatsby GraphQL endpoint can be targeted for DoS attacks.
    *   **Information Disclosure via Gatsby GraphQL (Medium Severity):**  Exposed Gatsby GraphQL endpoint can reveal Gatsby application schema and potentially data if not secured.
    *   **Unauthorized Data Access via Gatsby GraphQL (High Severity - if sensitive data exposed):** If sensitive data is accessible through the Gatsby GraphQL endpoint and it's not secured.

    *   **Injection Attacks via Gatsby GraphQL (High Severity):** Prevents injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if Gatsby GraphQL resolvers interact with databases) through custom Gatsby GraphQL resolvers.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Gatsby Data Layer (Medium Severity):** Prevents data corruption or inconsistencies within your Gatsby data layer if custom resolvers handle data mutations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks via Gatsby GraphQL (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk of injection attacks through custom Gatsby GraphQL resolvers.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Gatsby Data Layer (Medium Reduction):** Reduces the risk of data integrity problems within the Gatsby data layer.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No, input validation in custom Gatsby GraphQL resolvers is not systematically implemented.
*   **Missing Implementation:** Input validation needs to be implemented in all custom Gatsby GraphQL resolvers that handle user input or interact with external data sources within the Gatsby application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize Data During Gatsby Build](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_data_during_gatsby_build.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize Data During Gatsby Build
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Gatsby Data Sources:** Identify external data sources (APIs, databases, CMS) from which your Gatsby application fetches data *during the Gatsby build process*.
    2.  **Sanitize Fetched Data in Gatsby Build:** Implement data sanitization logic for data fetched from external sources *during the Gatsby build*, especially if it includes user-generated content or HTML that will be incorporated into the static site. This is crucial for preventing XSS in the generated static site.
        *   **HTML Encoding:** Encode HTML entities in string data fetched during the Gatsby build to prevent XSS in the static output.
        *   **Input Validation (Server-Side in Build):** Apply server-side input validation to data fetched during the Gatsby build to ensure data integrity in the static site.
    3.  **Apply Output Encoding in Gatsby Components:** Ensure that when rendering fetched data in Gatsby components, appropriate output encoding is used. Gatsby components and JSX generally handle output encoding well, but review for any potential bypasses, especially when using dangerouslySetInnerHTML or similar.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Gatsby Static Site (High Severity):** Prevents XSS vulnerabilities in the generated static site that could arise from displaying unsanitized data fetched during the Gatsby build.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Gatsby Static Site (Medium Severity):** Improves data integrity of the static site by ensuring data fetched during the Gatsby build is sanitized.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Gatsby Static Site (High Reduction):** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities in the Gatsby static site.
    *   **Data Integrity Issues in Gatsby Static Site (Medium Reduction):** Improves data integrity of the Gatsby static site.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes, basic HTML encoding is used for user-generated content fetched from external APIs during the Gatsby build.
*   **Missing Implementation:**  More comprehensive server-side input validation of fetched data during the Gatsby build and systematic output encoding review across all Gatsby components are missing.
