# Threat Model Analysis for gatsbyjs/gatsby

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/dependency_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in a Gatsby dependency (core, plugin, or transitive dependency). This could lead to remote code execution during the build process, compromising the build server or developer machine, or injecting malicious code into the generated static site. For example, a vulnerability in an image processing library used by a Gatsby plugin could be exploited during image optimization.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code injection into the generated static site.
    *   Compromise of the build server or developer machine.
    *   Exposure of sensitive data during the build process.
    *   Website defacement or malicious redirects on the generated site.
*   **Gatsby Component Affected:** `npm` or `yarn` dependency management, `package.json`, `yarn.lock`/`package-lock.json`, Gatsby core modules, Gatsby plugins, Node.js modules.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update Gatsby core, plugins, and all dependencies using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
    *   Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Employ dependency scanning tools like Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check in CI/CD pipelines.
    *   Pin dependency versions in `package.json` and use lock files (`yarn.lock`/`package-lock.json`) to ensure consistent builds.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Gatsby and its dependencies.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Installation](./threats/malicious_plugin_installation.md)

*   **Description:** A developer installs a malicious Gatsby plugin from an untrusted source. The plugin injects malicious code into the build process or the generated static site. This could result in data theft, backdoors, or website compromise. For example, a malicious plugin could modify `gatsby-node.js` to exfiltrate environment variables or inject JavaScript code into every page.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code injection into the generated static site.
    *   Data exfiltration (API keys, secrets, source code).
    *   Compromise of developer machines.
    *   Backdoors in the website for persistent access.
    *   Supply chain attack impacting website users.
*   **Gatsby Component Affected:** Gatsby plugin system, `gatsby-config.js`, `npm` or `yarn` package installation, `gatsby-node.js`, build process.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet plugins before installation. Check plugin popularity, maintainer reputation, and last update date on npm/yarn registry.
    *   Review plugin code, especially for plugins with broad permissions or sensitive functionality.
    *   Prefer plugins from trusted sources, the official Gatsby organization, or reputable developers.
    *   Use a plugin security scanner if available.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of injected scripts.

## Threat: [Build Process Code Injection](./threats/build_process_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the Gatsby build environment and injects malicious code into the build process. This code modifies `gatsby-node.js`, `gatsby-config.js`, or build scripts to inject malicious content into the generated static site, steal secrets, or compromise the build environment. For example, an attacker could modify a build script to inject a script tag into the HTML output of every page.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code injection into the generated static site.
    *   Exposure of build-time secrets (environment variables, API keys).
    *   Compromise of the build environment.
    *   Supply chain attack if the build process is part of a larger deployment pipeline.
    *   Website defacement or malicious redirects.
*   **Gatsby Component Affected:** Gatsby build process, `gatsby-node.js`, `gatsby-config.js`, build scripts, CI/CD pipeline, build environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Secure the build environment with strong access controls and regular security updates.
    *   Implement code review for changes to build scripts and Gatsby configuration.
    *   Use secure secret management practices (environment variables, dedicated secret stores) and avoid hardcoding secrets.
    *   Monitor build logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Harden the CI/CD pipeline and build servers.

## Threat: [Environment Variable Exposure in Client-Side Code](./threats/environment_variable_exposure_in_client-side_code.md)

*   **Description:** Developers mistakenly expose sensitive environment variables in client-side JavaScript code during the Gatsby build process. Attackers can extract these secrets by inspecting the client-side code, leading to unauthorized access or data breaches. For example, using `process.env.API_KEY` directly in a React component without proper safeguards.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive API keys, credentials, or other secrets.
    *   Unauthorized access to backend services or APIs.
    *   Data breaches if exposed secrets grant access to sensitive data.
*   **Gatsby Component Affected:** Gatsby build process, environment variable handling, client-side JavaScript bundling, `process.env`.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully manage environment variables and avoid exposing sensitive ones in client-side code.
    *   Use environment variables only for build-time configuration and not for client-side secrets.
    *   If client-side secrets are absolutely necessary, use secure methods for managing them (e.g., backend proxy, secure token service).
    *   Review generated client-side JavaScript bundles to ensure no sensitive environment variables are exposed.
    *   Use Gatsby's environment variable features correctly, understanding the difference between build-time and client-side variables.
