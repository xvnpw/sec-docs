# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Gatsby is a free and open-source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.
  - Primary goal is to provide a performant, accessible, and user-friendly platform for building static websites and web applications.
  - Focus on developer experience, allowing for rapid development and easy content integration from various sources.
  - Aim to empower developers to create websites that are fast, secure, and scalable.
  - Support a large and active open-source community around the framework.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in Gatsby core or plugins could lead to compromised websites built with Gatsby.
  - Reliance on open-source community for maintenance and security updates.
  - Potential for performance issues if websites are not properly optimized or plugins are inefficient.
  - Risk of supply chain attacks through compromised dependencies in the Gatsby ecosystem.
  - Misconfiguration during deployment can lead to security vulnerabilities or performance problems.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Gatsby core framework undergoes security reviews and bug fixes by the core team and community contributors. Described in GitHub repository issue tracking and pull requests.
  - security control: Dependency management using npm/yarn, allowing for dependency updates and vulnerability patching. Described in `package.json` and `yarn.lock` / `package-lock.json` files.
  - security control: Static site generation inherently reduces attack surface compared to dynamic server-rendered applications, as there is no server-side code to exploit in the deployed website. Implicit in Gatsby's architecture.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on third-party plugins, which may have their own security vulnerabilities. Risk acknowledged in Gatsby's plugin ecosystem nature.
  - accepted risk: Security of content sources (CMS, APIs) is outside of Gatsby's direct control. Risk assumed by users integrating external content sources.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning for both Gatsby core and plugins used in projects to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools into the development and build pipeline to detect potential security flaws in Gatsby plugins and custom code.
  - security control: Promote and enforce secure coding practices for plugin development within the Gatsby community.
  - security control: Provide guidelines and best practices for secure deployment of Gatsby sites, including secure hosting configurations and Content Security Policy (CSP) implementation.
  - security control: Encourage regular security audits and penetration testing of Gatsby core and popular plugins.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: If Gatsby is used with a CMS or admin interface, ensure strong authentication mechanisms are in place to protect access to content management and site configuration.
    - Requirement: For Gatsby Cloud or similar services, secure authentication for user accounts and API access is crucial.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for any CMS or admin interfaces to restrict access to sensitive functionalities based on user roles.
    - Requirement: Ensure proper authorization checks within plugins that handle user data or sensitive operations.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Plugins that accept user input or process external data must implement robust input validation to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection if applicable in plugin context).
    - Requirement: Sanitize and encode user-generated content before rendering it on the website to mitigate XSS risks.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: If sensitive data is handled by Gatsby plugins or during build processes (e.g., API keys, secrets), ensure proper encryption at rest and in transit.
    - Requirement: Utilize HTTPS for all website traffic to protect data in transit between users and the deployed website.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Website Availability: Ensuring the website is accessible to users without interruption.
  - Content Integrity: Maintaining the accuracy and integrity of the website content.
  - Developer Productivity: Enabling developers to build and deploy websites efficiently and securely.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - Website Content: Publicly accessible content, but integrity is important for brand reputation and user trust. Sensitivity: Low to Medium (depending on content type).
  - Source Code: Intellectual property, access control is important to prevent unauthorized modifications or disclosure. Sensitivity: Medium to High.
  - Build and Deployment Secrets: API keys, credentials for deployment platforms, need to be protected to prevent unauthorized access and deployments. Sensitivity: High.
  - User Data (if collected by plugins or CMS): Personal information collected through forms or user accounts (if applicable via plugins or integrated CMS). Sensitivity: Medium to High (depending on data type and regulations).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the specific use case for Gatsby? (e.g., blog, marketing website, e-commerce, application). This will influence the sensitivity of data and criticality of processes.
  - What is the risk appetite of the organization using Gatsby? (Startup vs. Fortune 500). This will determine the level of security controls required.
  - Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA, PCI DSS) that the Gatsby website needs to adhere to? This will dictate specific security requirements.
  - What is the process for managing and updating Gatsby core and plugins? Patching strategy and timelines.
  - Are there any plans to use Gatsby Cloud or other commercial Gatsby services? This might introduce additional security considerations and controls.

- Assumptions:
  - Gatsby is primarily used for building static websites with publicly accessible content.
  - The organization using Gatsby has a moderate risk appetite and is concerned about basic website security and availability.
  - Standard web security best practices are expected to be implemented.
  - Developers are responsible for selecting and securing plugins used in their Gatsby projects.
  - Deployment is assumed to be on a modern cloud platform with standard security features.
