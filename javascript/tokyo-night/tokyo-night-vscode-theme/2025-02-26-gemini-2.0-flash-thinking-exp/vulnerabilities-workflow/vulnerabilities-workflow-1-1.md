Based on the provided project files (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`), no high-rank vulnerabilities have been identified.

**Reasoning:**

The project files provided are documentation files for a Visual Studio Code theme. These files (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`) primarily contain descriptive information about the theme, including:
- Theme description and features
- Screenshots
- Instructions for customization
- Color palettes
- Links to ports for other applications
- Release notes and changelog

These files do not contain executable code or configuration logic that could directly introduce security vulnerabilities in the VSCode theme or the VSCode editor itself. VSCode themes are primarily declarative, defining visual styles and colors, and do not typically handle user input or perform actions that could lead to vulnerabilities like code injection, data breaches, or privilege escalation.

It's important to note that the analysis is limited to the provided files (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`). If the actual theme definition files (e.g., JSON files that define theme colors and rules) were provided, a different analysis focusing on potential issues in theme configuration might be necessary. However, based on the current files, no vulnerabilities are identified.

It is possible that vulnerabilities could exist in the broader VSCode extension ecosystem or in VSCode itself, but these would not be vulnerabilities introduced by the Tokyo Night VSCode theme project based on the provided documentation files.

**Therefore, based on the provided files, there are no vulnerabilities to report that meet the criteria of being:**
- Introduced by the project from the provided files.
- Valid and not already mitigated.
- Of vulnerability rank at least high.
- Not excluded by the specified exclusion criteria.

If additional project files containing the theme's code or configuration are provided, a more comprehensive security analysis might be possible.
