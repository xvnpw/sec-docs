## Vulnerability List for Tokyo Night VS Code Theme

Based on the analysis of the Tokyo Night VS Code Theme project files (README.md, CHANGELOG.md) and considering the criteria for external attacker exploitation, vulnerability rank, and excluding specific vulnerability types, **no vulnerabilities meeting the specified requirements have been identified.**

VS Code themes are declarative and primarily define the visual appearance of the editor. They do not contain executable code that could be directly exploited by an external attacker in a publicly available instance of the application to cause high or critical impact vulnerabilities such as code injection, data breaches, or privilege escalation.

Therefore, the list of vulnerabilities is currently empty.
