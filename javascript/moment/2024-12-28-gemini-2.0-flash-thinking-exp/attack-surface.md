* **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)**
    * **Description:**  Maliciously crafted date strings can exploit the complexity of Moment.js's internal regular expressions used for parsing, leading to excessive processing time and potential denial of service.
    * **How Moment Contributes:** The library's reliance on regular expressions for flexible parsing makes it potentially vulnerable to ReDoS attacks if the expressions are not carefully designed.
    * **Example:** Providing a very long string with repeating patterns that cause the regular expression engine to backtrack excessively, consuming significant CPU resources and potentially freezing the application.
    * **Impact:** Application slowdown, resource exhaustion, and potential denial of service.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Limit Input Length:**  Restrict the maximum length of date strings accepted by the application.
        * **Implement Timeouts:**  Set timeouts for date parsing operations to prevent indefinite processing.
        * **Consider Alternatives for Untrusted Input:** If dealing with untrusted input, consider using simpler, less regex-intensive parsing methods or alternative libraries for validation before using Moment.js.
        * **Keep Moment.js Updated:** Ensure you are using the latest version of Moment.js, as security updates might address ReDoS vulnerabilities.
