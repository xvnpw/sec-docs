### High and Critical Moment.js Threats

* **Threat:** Malicious Input in Date Parsing
    * **Description:** An attacker might provide specially crafted date strings as input to Moment.js parsing functions (like `moment()`) to cause unexpected behavior. This could involve strings that trigger errors or consume excessive resources leading to a denial-of-service.
    * **Impact:** Application errors, unexpected behavior, potential denial-of-service (DoS).
    * **Affected Component:** Parsing functions (`moment()`, `moment.utc()`, `moment.parseZone()`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate user-provided date strings before passing them to Moment.js.
        * Use specific parsing formats with `moment(userInput, formatString)` instead of relying on automatic parsing.
        * Implement input length limits for date strings.
        * Consider using regular expressions to pre-validate the format of the input string.

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Moment.js Library
    * **Description:** Attackers could exploit known security vulnerabilities present in specific versions of the Moment.js library. This could involve leveraging flaws in the parsing logic, formatting routines, or other internal mechanisms.
    * **Impact:**  Various security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially leading to remote code execution, information disclosure, or denial-of-service.
    * **Affected Component:**  Various modules and functions within the core Moment.js library depending on the specific vulnerability.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update Moment.js to the latest stable version.
        * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE databases, GitHub security advisories) for reported issues in Moment.js.
        * Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
