## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_exhaustion.md)

**Attack Vector:** Send specially crafted input strings to Moment.js parsing functions.
**Description:** An attacker sends a large number of requests containing complex or deeply nested date/time strings. This forces the Moment.js parsing functions to consume excessive CPU or memory resources.
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Significant (Application unavailability)
**Effort:** Low to Medium (Scripting required)
**Skill Level:** Low to Medium
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Spike in resource usage)

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Date/Time Comparisons](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_datetime_comparisons.md)

**Attack Vector:** Manipulate input to bypass authentication or authorization checks based on date/time.
**Description:** The application uses Moment.js for comparing dates/times in security-sensitive operations (e.g., access control). An attacker manipulates input to exploit flaws in these comparisons, such as timezone issues or incorrect format assumptions.
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Significant (Unauthorized access)
**Effort:** Medium (Requires understanding of application logic)
**Skill Level:** Medium
**Detection Difficulty:** Difficult (Logic flaws are harder to detect)

## Attack Tree Path: [Reliance on Client-Side Date/Time](./attack_tree_paths/reliance_on_client-side_datetime.md)

**Attack Vector:** Manipulate client-side date/time to bypass checks or gain unauthorized access.
**Description:** The application relies on the client's date and time (obtained through Moment.js) for security-sensitive operations. An attacker can easily manipulate their local time to bypass restrictions or gain unauthorized access.
**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** Significant (Unauthorized access, bypassing restrictions)
**Effort:** Low
**Skill Level:** Low
**Detection Difficulty:** Easy (If server-side checks are in place)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit a Known CVE in the Used Version of Moment.js](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_a_known_cve_in_the_used_version_of_moment_js.md)

**Attack Vector:** Identify and exploit a publicly known vulnerability in the specific version of Moment.js used by the application.
**Description:** An attacker researches the application's Moment.js version and finds a documented vulnerability (CVE). They then use an existing exploit or develop their own to leverage this vulnerability for malicious purposes, such as code execution or information disclosure.
**Likelihood:** Medium
**Impact:** Critical (Full application compromise possible)
**Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits might be readily available)
**Skill Level:** Medium (Understanding of exploit techniques)
**Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Vulnerability scanners can help)

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via Moment.js Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_moment_js_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, disrupting functionality, or stealing sensitive information from the application through a weakness in the Moment.js library or its usage.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Input Handling (Parsing Vulnerabilities)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_input_handling__parsing_vulnerabilities_.md)

**Description:** This node represents the category of attacks that exploit how Moment.js parses date and time strings. By providing unexpected or malicious input, attackers can trigger errors, consume excessive resources, or potentially lead to further exploitation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Logic Errors in Application's Use of Moment.js](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_logic_errors_in_application's_use_of_moment_js.md)

**Description:** This node focuses on vulnerabilities arising from how the application *uses* Moment.js. Even if Moment.js itself is secure, incorrect assumptions, insecure comparisons, or reliance on client-side data can create exploitable weaknesses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Moment.js Library (Supply Chain Attack)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_moment_js_library__supply_chain_attack_.md)

**Description:** This node highlights the risks associated with using third-party libraries. It encompasses attacks that exploit known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Moment.js being used or, in a more complex scenario, involve compromising the library's supply chain to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit a Known CVE in the Used Version of Moment.js](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_a_known_cve_in_the_used_version_of_moment_js.md)

**Description:**  This node specifically addresses the risk of using a version of Moment.js with publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs). Attackers can leverage readily available information and potentially exploits to compromise the application.
