# Attack Surface Analysis for moment/moment

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Parsing](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_parsing.md)

*   **Description:**  `moment.js` uses regular expressions internally for parsing. Specifically crafted input strings can exploit vulnerabilities in these regexes, causing excessive backtracking and consuming significant CPU time, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How Moment Contributes:** The library's parsing logic relies on regular expressions, which are inherently susceptible to ReDoS if not carefully designed.
    *   **Example:** Providing a date string with many repeating patterns that can cause the regex engine to backtrack excessively (specific examples depend on the internal regex implementation of the Moment.js version).
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS): The server becomes unresponsive due to high CPU utilization.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Restrict the allowed formats and characters in date/time input strings.
        *   **Update Moment.js:** Newer versions of `moment.js` may have addressed ReDoS vulnerabilities in their parsing regexes.
        *   **Consider Alternatives for Critical Paths:** For performance-sensitive or public-facing applications, evaluate alternative date/time libraries with more robust parsing implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Use of Deprecated or Vulnerable API Functions (Older Versions)](./attack_surfaces/use_of_deprecated_or_vulnerable_api_functions__older_versions_.md)

*   **Description:** Older versions of `moment.js` might contain API functions with known security issues or unexpected behavior. Using outdated versions exposes the application to these vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Moment Contributes:** The library itself might have contained flaws in older versions.
    *   **Example:** An older version might have a parsing function with a known ReDoS vulnerability that has been patched in later versions.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from DoS to data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Keep Moment.js Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of `moment.js` to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Review code for usage of deprecated functions and replace them with recommended alternatives.
