# Threat Model Analysis for moment/moment

## Threat: [Denial of Service via Regular Expression Complexity](./threats/denial_of_service_via_regular_expression_complexity.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a specific date string with excessive nested quantifiers or overlapping patterns designed to make Moment.js's regular expression engine perform extensive backtracking. This consumes significant CPU resources on the server or client-side, leading to a slowdown or complete freeze of the application.

**Impact:** Application becomes unresponsive, impacting availability for legitimate users. Server resources are exhausted, potentially affecting other services.

**Affected Component:** Parsing functionality within `moment.js`, specifically the regular expressions used for date string interpretation.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Moment.js updated to the latest version, as performance improvements and security fixes related to regex complexity are often addressed.
* Implement input validation on date strings before passing them to Moment.js. Limit the length of input strings.
* Consider using a more restrictive parsing format or explicitly specifying the parsing format to avoid relying on complex regular expression matching.
* Implement rate limiting or request timeouts to mitigate the impact of excessive requests.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated Versions](./threats/exploitation_of_known_vulnerabilities_in_outdated_versions.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits known security vulnerabilities present in an outdated version of Moment.js being used by the application. These vulnerabilities could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution, depending on the specific flaw.

**Impact:** Various security breaches depending on the nature of the vulnerability, including data breaches, remote code execution, and denial of service.

**Affected Component:** The entire `moment.js` library or specific modules affected by the vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Regularly update Moment.js to the latest stable version.
* Monitor security advisories and release notes for any reported vulnerabilities in Moment.js.
* Use dependency scanning tools to identify outdated and vulnerable dependencies.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack - Compromised Moment.js Package](./threats/supply_chain_attack_-_compromised_moment_js_package.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the Moment.js package on a package registry (e.g., npm) or the development infrastructure used to build or distribute the library. This could involve injecting malicious code into the library itself.

**Impact:** Introduction of malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data theft, backdoors, or other malicious activities.

**Affected Component:** The entire `moment.js` library as distributed through package managers.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use package managers with integrity checks (e.g., `npm` with lock files and integrity hashes, `yarn`).
* Verify the integrity of downloaded packages.
* Consider using software composition analysis (SCA) tools to detect known vulnerabilities and potential supply chain risks in dependencies.
* Implement a secure development pipeline to minimize the risk of introducing compromised dependencies.
