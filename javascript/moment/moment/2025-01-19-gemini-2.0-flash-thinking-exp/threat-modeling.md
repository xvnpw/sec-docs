# Threat Model Analysis for moment/moment

## Threat: [Malicious Format String Exploitation](./threats/malicious_format_string_exploitation.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted format string to a Moment.js formatting function (e.g., `format()`). This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, such as the disclosure of internal data, application errors, or in older JavaScript environments, potentially even code execution within the context of the application. The attacker might achieve this by controlling user input that is directly used as a format string.

**Impact:** Information disclosure (revealing internal data or system information), application instability or crashes, potential for remote code execution in vulnerable environments.

**Affected Component:** Formatting functions (`format()`).

**Risk Severity:** High (potential for remote code execution in vulnerable environments).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid using user-supplied input directly as format strings.** Always use predefined, safe format strings.
* **Sanitize or validate user input** if it absolutely must influence the formatting.
* **Keep Moment.js updated** to the latest version, as past vulnerabilities related to format strings have been addressed.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) during Parsing](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__during_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted date string that exploits inefficient regular expressions used by Moment.js during parsing. This can cause the parsing process to take an excessively long time, consuming significant CPU resources and potentially leading to a denial of service for the application. The attacker might submit these malicious date strings through input fields or APIs that are processed by Moment.js.

**Impact:** Application slowdown, resource exhaustion, denial of service.

**Affected Component:** Parsing functions (`moment()`, `moment.utc()`, and other parsing variations).

**Risk Severity:** High (can lead to application-level denial of service).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Implement input validation and sanitization** to reject overly complex or suspicious date strings before they reach Moment.js.
* **Set timeouts for parsing operations** to prevent them from running indefinitely.
* **Consider using stricter parsing modes** if available, which might be less susceptible to ReDoS.
* **Keep Moment.js updated**, as parsing logic might be improved in newer versions.

## Threat: [Compromised Moment.js Package](./threats/compromised_moment_js_package.md)

**Description:** The official Moment.js package on npm could be compromised, leading to malicious code being injected into the package. If developers install or update to a compromised version, their applications could be affected.

**Impact:** Potentially severe, including remote code execution, data theft, or other malicious actions within the application's environment.

**Affected Component:** The entire Moment.js library as distributed.

**Risk Severity:** Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use package integrity checks** (e.g., using `npm` or `yarn` with integrity checking enabled) to verify the authenticity of downloaded packages.
* **Monitor security advisories** related to Moment.js and its dependencies.
* **Consider using a private npm registry** to have more control over the packages used in the project.

## Threat: [Lack of Updates and Maintenance Leading to Unpatched Vulnerabilities](./threats/lack_of_updates_and_maintenance_leading_to_unpatched_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** If Moment.js is no longer actively maintained, newly discovered vulnerabilities within the library itself might not be patched. This leaves applications using older versions vulnerable to known exploits in Moment.js.

**Impact:** Applications remain vulnerable to known security flaws within the Moment.js library, potentially leading to various security breaches.

**Affected Component:** The entire Moment.js library.

**Risk Severity:** Increases over time as new vulnerabilities are discovered and remain unpatched. Can become Critical if severe vulnerabilities are found.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Stay informed about the maintenance status of Moment.js.**
* **Consider migrating to actively maintained alternatives** if Moment.js is no longer being updated.
* **Implement additional security measures** to mitigate potential vulnerabilities if migration is not immediately feasible.
