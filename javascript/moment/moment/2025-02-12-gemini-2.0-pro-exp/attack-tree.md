## Attack Tree Path: [1. Manipulate Input Date/Time Strings [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__manipulate_input_datetime_strings__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the most crucial attack vector, as it focuses on controlling the input provided to the `moment` library.  If an attacker can manipulate the input, they can potentially exploit various parsing and handling weaknesses.
*   **Why Critical:**  This node is the gateway to many other attack paths.  Securing input is paramount.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1 Exploit Locale-Specific Parsing Ambiguities](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_exploit_locale-specific_parsing_ambiguities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Provide ambiguous date formats (e.g., "10/11/12" - US vs. EU) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_provide_ambiguous_date_formats__e_g___101112_-_us_vs__eu___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a date string in a format that can be interpreted differently depending on the locale settings. For example, "10/11/12" could be October 11th, 2012 (US format) or November 10th, 2012 (European format).
*   **Action:** The application misinterprets the date due to the ambiguity, leading to incorrect business logic execution, data corruption, or other unintended consequences.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If input validation is weak or absent)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depending on the criticality of the date/time data)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires auditing input validation and date handling logic)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Inject Invalid or Out-of-Range Values](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_inject_invalid_or_out-of-range_values.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.2 Provide invalid month/day combinations (e.g., February 30th) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_2_provide_invalid_monthday_combinations__e_g___february_30th___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a date string with an invalid combination of month and day, such as February 30th.  `moment`'s lenient parsing (especially in older versions or if not explicitly disabled) might "correct" this to a valid date (e.g., March 2nd), leading to unexpected behavior.
*   **Action:** `moment` "corrects" the invalid date to a valid one, but this corrected date is not what the user intended or what the application's validation should have allowed.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If input validation is weak)
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires auditing input validation and date handling logic)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4 Bypass Input Validation by Exploiting `moment`'s Parsing Flexibility [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_bypass_input_validation_by_exploiting__moment_'s_parsing_flexibility__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This highlights the core vulnerability: `moment`'s ability to parse a wide variety of date/time formats, even those not explicitly intended, can be used to bypass the application's own input validation if that validation is not sufficiently strict.
*   **Why Critical:** This node emphasizes the importance of validating input *before* it reaches `moment`.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.1 Use unexpected date/time separators or formats [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_1_use_unexpected_datetime_separators_or_formats__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker provides a date string with separators or a format that the application's *own* validation logic doesn't expect, but that `moment` might still accept.  For example, if the application expects "YYYY-MM-DD", the attacker might provide "YYYY/MM/DD" or "YYYYMMDD".
*   **Action:** The application's validation might pass the input because it doesn't strictly enforce the expected format, and `moment` then parses the unexpected format, leading to incorrect data.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If input validation is weak or relies solely on `moment`)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Depending on the criticality of the data)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires auditing input validation logic)

## Attack Tree Path: [1.4.2 Provide extra characters or whitespace [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_4_2_provide_extra_characters_or_whitespace__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** Similar to 1.4.1, the attacker adds extra characters or whitespace to the date string that the application's validation might not catch, but that `moment`'s lenient parsing might ignore.
*   **Action:** `moment` parses the input despite the extra characters, bypassing the application's intended validation.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (If input validation is weak)
*   **Impact:** Medium
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires auditing input validation logic)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Timezone Handling [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_timezone_handling__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on exploiting inconsistencies or ambiguities in how timezones are handled between the client, server, and the `moment` library.
*   **Why Critical:** Timezone mishandling is a common source of errors and can lead to significant data inconsistencies, especially in applications that deal with users in different timezones.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Exploit Inconsistent Timezone Handling Between Client and Server](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_exploit_inconsistent_timezone_handling_between_client_and_server.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [2.1.1 Send dates without timezone information, relying on default behavior [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_1_send_dates_without_timezone_information__relying_on_default_behavior__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker sends a date/time string without any explicit timezone information.  This forces the client and server to rely on their default timezone settings, which might be different.
*   **Action:** The client and server interpret the same date/time string differently, leading to incorrect calculations, data storage, or display.  For example, a date intended to be in UTC might be interpreted as the server's local time, resulting in an offset of several hours.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Common issue if timezone handling is not explicitly managed)
*   **Impact:** Medium to High (Can lead to significant data inconsistencies)
*   **Effort:** Very Low
*   **Skill Level:** Novice
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires comparing client and server-side behavior)
