# Attack Surface Analysis for moment/moment

## Attack Surface: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) via Locale Data](./attack_surfaces/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__via_locale_data.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can craft malicious date/time strings that, when parsed with specific locales, trigger excessive backtracking in `moment`'s regular expressions, causing CPU exhaustion.
*   **How Moment Contributes:** `moment`'s reliance on complex regular expressions within locale data files for parsing and formatting makes it susceptible to ReDoS if those expressions are poorly designed.
*   **Example:** An attacker submits a date string like `"2024-02-31111111111111111111111111"` (invalid date with excessive trailing digits) targeting a locale with a vulnerable parsing regex.
*   **Impact:** Denial of service (DoS) â€“ the application becomes unresponsive or crashes due to high CPU usage.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical if it affects a core service)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Pre-Moment Input Validation:** *Crucially*, validate user-supplied date/time strings *before* passing them to `moment`. Use a *safe* regular expression or a dedicated date/time validation library to check the format and length.  Reject any input that doesn't conform to expected patterns.
    *   **Locale Whitelisting:** Restrict the set of supported locales to a known-safe list.  Reject any input attempting to use an unsupported locale.
    *   **Resource Limits:** Implement server-side resource limits (CPU time, memory) to prevent a single request from consuming excessive resources.
    *   **Migration:** Migrate to a maintained alternative library (e.g., `date-fns`, `Luxon`, `Day.js`).

## Attack Surface: [Unpatched Vulnerabilities Due to Deprecation](./attack_surfaces/unpatched_vulnerabilities_due_to_deprecation.md)

*   **Description:** `moment` is deprecated and no longer actively maintained, meaning newly discovered vulnerabilities will likely remain unpatched.
*   **How Moment Contributes:** The library itself is the source of the risk due to its end-of-life status.
*   **Example:** A new ReDoS vulnerability is discovered in a specific locale's parsing logic.  Since `moment` is deprecated, no official patch will be released.
*   **Impact:** Potential for various exploits, depending on the nature of the unpatched vulnerability (DoS, data corruption, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (Potentially Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Migration:** *The primary mitigation is to migrate to a actively maintained alternative library.* This is the only long-term solution.
    *   **Forking (Last Resort):** In extreme cases, if migration is impossible in the short term, consider forking the `moment` repository and applying security patches yourself.  This is a high-effort, high-risk approach and should only be considered as a temporary measure.

## Attack Surface: [Lenient Parsing Leading to Unexpected Behavior](./attack_surfaces/lenient_parsing_leading_to_unexpected_behavior.md)

*   **Description:** `moment`'s default parsing behavior can be overly lenient, accepting malformed input that might bypass subsequent validation checks.  While rated "Medium" overall, in security-critical contexts, this can become a High risk.
*   **How Moment Contributes:** `moment`'s default parsing attempts to "guess" the date/time from various input formats, even if they are not strictly valid.
*   **Example:**  An application uses `moment` to parse a date used in an authorization check.  An attacker provides a slightly malformed date that `moment` parses incorrectly, but which bypasses a subsequent (less robust) validation check, granting unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Logic errors, data corruption, *potential bypass of security controls*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (in security-critical contexts)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Mode Parsing:** *Always* use `moment`'s strict parsing mode: `moment(string, format, true)`. This forces `moment` to adhere precisely to the specified format.
    *   **Pre-Moment Input Validation:** Implement robust input validation *before* calling `moment`, ensuring the input conforms to the expected format. This validation should be *more* strict than `moment`'s parsing, even in strict mode.
    *   **Migration:** Migrate to a library with stricter default parsing or better control over parsing behavior.
