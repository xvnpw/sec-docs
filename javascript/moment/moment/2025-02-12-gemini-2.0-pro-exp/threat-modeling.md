# Threat Model Analysis for moment/moment

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution via `updateLocale`](./threats/prototype_pollution_via__updatelocale_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload containing specially crafted keys and values. This payload is then passed (directly or indirectly) to the `moment.updateLocale()` function in a *vulnerable version* of `moment`. The attacker's goal is to pollute the global `Object.prototype`, adding or modifying properties that will affect the behavior of other parts of the application. This can lead to unexpected behavior, denial of service, or potentially even remote code execution (RCE) in certain scenarios, particularly on the server-side.
    *   **Impact:** Application instability, denial of service, potential remote code execution (RCE), data corruption, or unauthorized access.
    *   **Affected Component:** `moment.updateLocale()` function.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if using a vulnerable version and user input is passed to `updateLocale`). Critical (if RCE is possible).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** Update `moment` to version 2.29.2 or later. This is the most crucial mitigation.
        *   **Secondary:**  *Never* pass unsanitized user input directly to `updateLocale()`.  Thoroughly validate and sanitize any data used to modify locales.  Ideally, use a whitelist approach, allowing only known-good locale configurations.

## Threat: [Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Localized Month Parsing](./threats/regular_expression_denial_of_service__redos__in_localized_month_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker provides a specially crafted string as input to `moment`'s date parsing functionality, specifically targeting localized month names (e.g., in the Bengali locale - `bn`). This string exploits a vulnerability in the regular expression used to parse these month names in *older versions* of `moment`. The attacker's goal is to cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of excessive backtracking, consuming a large amount of CPU time and potentially causing a denial of service.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of service (application becomes unresponsive).
    *   **Affected Component:** Date parsing functions (e.g., `moment()`, `moment.utc()`, `moment.parseZone()`) when used with localized month names, particularly in vulnerable locales like `bn` (Bengali) in older versions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if using a vulnerable version and accepting user-input dates with localized month names).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** Update `moment` to version 2.19.3 or later.
        *   **Secondary:** If updating is not immediately possible, implement strict input validation to limit the length and characters allowed in user-supplied date strings, especially when dealing with localized month names.  Consider rejecting input containing potentially problematic characters or patterns.
