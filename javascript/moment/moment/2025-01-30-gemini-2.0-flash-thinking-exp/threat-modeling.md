# Threat Model Analysis for moment/moment

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Malicious Date Strings](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_malicious_date_strings.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker sends specially crafted, complex, or extremely long date strings to an application using Moment.js for parsing. This causes Moment.js parsing functions to consume excessive CPU and memory, leading to application slowdown or unresponsiveness, effectively denying service to legitimate users. Repeated malicious strings amplify the impact.
*   **Impact:** Application becomes unavailable or severely degraded for legitimate users, causing business disruption, financial loss, and reputational damage.
*   **Moment Component Affected:** Parsing Module (e.g., `moment()`, `moment.parseZone()`).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on user-provided date strings *before* Moment.js parsing. Restrict allowed formats and string lengths.
    *   Use strict parsing modes in Moment.js (e.g., `moment(dateString, format, true)`) to limit flexibility and complex parsing paths.
    *   Implement rate limiting on date processing functionalities to limit malicious request frequency.
    *   Monitor server resource utilization (CPU, memory) and set up alerts for unusual spikes.
    *   Regularly update Moment.js to the latest version for performance and vulnerability fixes.

## Threat: [Logic Errors due to Incorrect Parsing](./threats/logic_errors_due_to_incorrect_parsing.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits edge cases or locale-specific parsing ambiguities in Moment.js by providing specific date strings. This causes Moment.js to misinterpret the intended date. If the application uses these incorrectly parsed dates in security-sensitive logic (e.g., access control, session management), the attacker could bypass security measures or cause unintended actions, like gaining unauthorized access.
*   **Impact:** Security bypasses, unauthorized access to resources, incorrect application behavior leading to data corruption or other unintended consequences.
*   **Moment Component Affected:** Parsing Module (e.g., `moment()`, `moment.parseZone()`), Locale Handling
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always use strict parsing formats with Moment.js (e.g., `moment(dateString, 'YYYY-MM-DD', true)`) to minimize ambiguity.
    *   Develop comprehensive unit tests for date parsing and manipulation logic, including edge cases and locales.
    *   Explicitly specify the expected date format when parsing, avoiding reliance on automatic format detection.
    *   Perform date validation and processing primarily on the server-side.
    *   Carefully review and test security-critical logic relying on dates parsed by Moment.js.

## Threat: [Timezone Handling Errors Causing Logic Flaws](./threats/timezone_handling_errors_causing_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect usage of Moment.js timezone functions or underlying bugs in timezone logic can lead to inaccurate date/time calculations, especially across timezones and daylight saving time. If timezone-sensitive calculations are used in security-critical features (e.g., time-based access control across regions), an attacker could exploit these errors to bypass security or disrupt operations, such as gaining access outside permitted time windows by manipulating timezone information.
*   **Impact:** Security bypasses, incorrect access control, disruption of scheduled tasks, data inconsistencies, and potential for unauthorized actions.
*   **Moment Component Affected:** Timezone Handling (with or without `moment-timezone` addon), Core Date/Time Manipulation
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Extensively test all timezone-related functionality, including conversions, daylight saving time, and edge cases.
    *   Store and process dates/times in UTC on the server-side whenever possible to minimize timezone ambiguity. Convert to local timezones only for display.
    *   Explicitly specify timezones when using Moment.js timezone functions.
    *   Regularly update Moment.js and ensure up-to-date timezone data in the application's environment.
    *   Consider simpler date/time handling if timezone complexity is not strictly necessary.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated Moment.js Version](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_outdated_moment_js_version.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated Moment.js version exposes the application to publicly known security vulnerabilities patched in newer versions. Attackers can scan for vulnerable Moment.js versions and exploit these vulnerabilities for unauthorized access, malicious code execution, or other breaches. Public vulnerability databases and advisories detail known weaknesses in older Moment.js versions.
*   **Impact:** Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), Information Disclosure, Denial of Service.
*   **Moment Component Affected:** Entire Library - Vulnerability could be in any module.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a robust dependency management process and regularly update Moment.js to the latest stable version.
    *   Utilize automated dependency scanning tools to monitor dependencies and identify outdated libraries with known vulnerabilities.
    *   Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for Moment.js to stay informed about vulnerabilities and updates.
    *   Establish a process for promptly patching or upgrading Moment.js when security vulnerabilities are announced.
    *   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool for deeper insights into dependency security risks.
