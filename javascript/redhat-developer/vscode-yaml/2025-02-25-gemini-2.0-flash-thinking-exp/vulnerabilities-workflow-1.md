### Consolidated Vulnerability List for vscode-yaml

This document consolidates identified vulnerabilities for the vscode-yaml extension, detailing their descriptions, impacts, ranks, mitigations, and test cases.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Proxy SSL Certificate Validation
  - **Description:**
    The extension’s configuration includes an option (`http.proxyStrictSSL`) that is set to `false` by default. Consequently, when the language server downloads schemas from remote sources or sends telemetry data, it does not validate the SSL certificate of the proxy server against trusted certificate authorities. This lack of validation creates an opportunity for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker positioned to intercept or manipulate network traffic, such as on public Wi-Fi networks or compromised enterprise networks, can exploit this vulnerability. By substituting a fraudulent SSL certificate, the attacker can inject malicious content, like altered schema definitions, or tamper with data transmitted to or from the extension.
  - **Impact:**
    - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to intercept and modify content downloaded by the extension, including crucial JSON schema definitions.
    - Manipulation of schema definitions can lead to unpredictable behavior of the language server, providing misleading information via hover text or validation results. This could also pave the way for more advanced attacks if the modified content is further processed without proper trust.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension provides a configuration setting, `http.proxyStrictSSL`, which users can manually set to `true` to enforce SSL certificate verification for proxy servers.
    - The existence and purpose of this setting are documented in the extension's README, but it remains disabled by default.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The extension does not enforce secure SSL certificate validation by default, nor does it warn users about the security risks associated with the default insecure configuration, especially when a proxy is detected in the environment.
    - Enabling strict SSL verification by default or, at a minimum, displaying a warning to users when operating through a proxy with the default setting would significantly improve security.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user must be working in a network environment that utilizes a proxy server and where network traffic is susceptible to interception. Examples include public Wi-Fi hotspots or compromised internal networks.
    - The user must not have explicitly enabled the `http.proxyStrictSSL` setting, thus using the insecure default value of `false`.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The extension's README file, specifically in the "Extension Settings" section, documents the `http.proxyStrictSSL` option and clearly states that its default value is `false`.
    - When the extension initiates HTTP requests, such as downloading remote schemas from the JSON Schema Store or transmitting telemetry data, it adheres to the proxy settings configured by the user. With strict SSL verification disabled, the TLS/SSL handshake process does not validate the legitimacy of the proxy server's certificate.

      ```
      Setting in configuration: "http.proxyStrictSSL": false (default)
      HTTP Request Flow:
      User's Machine --> Request --> Proxy (Certificate NOT Verified) --> Target Server --> Response --> Proxy --> User's Machine
      ```
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Set up a controlled testing environment that includes a proxy server configured to perform active MITM interception using a self-signed SSL certificate.
    2. Install and activate the vscode-yaml extension within Visual Studio Code, ensuring it is using the default configuration where `http.proxyStrictSSL` is set to `false`.
    3. Trigger an action within the extension that necessitates a remote HTTP request. For example, open a YAML file that requires fetching a schema from a remote location.
    4. Verify that the extension establishes a connection through the MITM proxy and accepts the forged certificate, successfully downloading the schema despite the invalid certificate.
    5. Subsequently, modify the user settings to enable strict SSL verification by setting `"http.proxyStrictSSL": true`. Repeat the action from step 3.
    6. Confirm that with strict SSL enabled, the connection to the proxy fails due to certificate validation failure, and the extension does not download the schema, effectively preventing the MITM attack.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary File Disclosure via Malicious Relative Schema Reference
  - **Description:**
    The vscode-yaml extension allows users to associate a YAML file with a schema using a modeline within the YAML document itself (e.g., `# yaml-language-server: $schema=<urlToTheSchema>`). When a relative URL is used for the schema, the extension resolves this path relative to the directory of the YAML file. This behavior introduces a vulnerability: if an attacker can provide a user with a malicious YAML file—for instance, through a public repository or a shared workspace—they can embed a modeline with a relative path designed to traverse outside the intended workspace. For example, a malicious YAML file could contain `# yaml-language-server: $schema=../../sensitive_file.json`. Upon opening such a file, the language server might attempt to load and validate against a file located at an arbitrary path on the user's filesystem.
  - **Impact:**
    - This vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive local files, including configuration files, private data, or any other files accessible to the user running the extension. The file content might be revealed through error messages, hover details displayed in the editor, or in logs generated by the language server.
    - Attackers could socially engineer users into opening a specially crafted YAML file that references sensitive system files, resulting in unintended file disclosure.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The extension's README documentation explains that relative paths in schema URLs are resolved relative to the YAML file’s location. However, there are no built-in security measures, such as restrictions or sandboxing, to limit file system access through relative schema references.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - The extension lacks any validation or sandboxing to restrict the scope of relative schema references. It should ideally limit access to a safe subset of the file system, such as the current workspace, or directories explicitly permitted by the user.
    - A recommended mitigation strategy would be to reject or issue a warning for schema references that resolve to paths outside of an allowed directory. Alternatively, the extension could require explicit user confirmation before accessing files outside the workspace.
  - **Preconditions:**
    - An attacker needs to create a malicious YAML file that includes a modeline with a relative schema path that points to a sensitive file. This is often achieved using path traversal techniques like `../../sensitive_file.json`.
    - A victim user must then open this crafted YAML file using Visual Studio Code with the vscode-yaml extension enabled.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - The documentation located in `/code/README.md` explains the functionality of specifying schema URLs within YAML files and clarifies that relative paths are resolved starting from the directory containing the YAML file.
    - Based on the available documentation and changelogs, there is no indication that the current implementation includes any form of validation or restriction on these resolved paths.
    - *(Visualization)*
      ```
      Example Malicious YAML Modeline:  # yaml-language-server: $schema=../../secret.txt
      Resolution Logic:
      Computed Absolute Path = (Directory of the YAML file) + "../../secret.txt"
      Outcome: Language server attempts to read content of the file at the resolved path without further security checks.
      ```
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled test environment, set up a workspace and create a YAML file within it. This YAML file should contain the modeline: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=../../test_sensitive.txt`. Ensure that `test_sensitive.txt` is a file containing known sensitive content and is located outside of the workspace directory.
    2. Open Visual Studio Code, enable the vscode-yaml extension, and then open the YAML file created in step 1.
    3. Observe if the extension attempts to read the file `test_sensitive.txt` based on the relative path provided in the modeline.
    4. Check for any signs of file content disclosure. This could manifest as the sensitive content appearing in validation error messages, hover tooltips when hovering over YAML elements, or in logs produced by the language server.
    5. Confirm that without any additional mitigations, the extension reads and potentially exposes the content of the sensitive file.
    6. To test a remediation, implement a sandboxing or path-restriction mechanism. Then, repeat steps 1-4 and verify that attempts to reference files outside the permitted directory are either rejected or trigger a clear warning message to the user, preventing unauthorized file access.
