- **Vulnerability Name:** Dependency Confusion and Insecure HTTP in JDK Update Script
  - **Description:**
    The script located at `/code/.github/scripts/check_and_update_jdk.py` is responsible for fetching the latest JDK version and related test results to update project configurations. This script is vulnerable due to two main issues:

    1. **Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Risk:** The script fetches the latest JDK version from `http://javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com/update/baseline.version` and test reports from `https://ci.eclipse.org/ls/job/jdt-ls-master/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/`. If an attacker gains control over either of these external resources, they could manipulate the data returned to the script. This could lead to the script using a malicious JDK version or falsely reporting successful test outcomes, even if tests failed or were never run against the "updated" JDK.

    2. **Insecure HTTP Connection:** The script uses plain HTTP to query `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com`. This insecure connection makes the request susceptible to Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker intercepting network traffic could alter the response from the Oracle server, injecting a manipulated JDK version string.

    **Step-by-step trigger:**
      1. An attacker compromises either `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com` or `ci.eclipse.org`, or positions themselves to perform a MITM attack on the HTTP request to `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com`.
      2. **Dependency Confusion Scenario:** The attacker modifies the response from `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com` to return a malicious or incorrect JDK version number. Alternatively, the attacker manipulates `ci.eclipse.org` to always report test success, regardless of actual test results.
      3. **Insecure HTTP Scenario:** The attacker intercepts the HTTP request to `http://javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com/update/baseline.version` and modifies the response to inject a malicious or incorrect JDK version string during transit.
      4. The script parses the manipulated response and extracts the attacker-controlled JDK version.
      5. The script proceeds to update `README.md` and potentially `package.json` with the attacker-provided JDK version.
      6. This could lead to the project being built and released with a compromised JDK or incorrect version information, potentially impacting users of the vscode-java extension.

  - **Impact:**
    This vulnerability can lead to a compromise of the vscode-java extension distribution through supply chain attack or by using an unsupported JDK version. Users could download and use a vulnerable version of the extension built with a malicious JDK or with incorrect configuration, potentially leading to various security issues, including build failures, runtime errors, or even remote code execution if a backdoored JDK is used. Erroneous updates to the supported JDK version in project documentation and configuration files can also cause confusion and instability.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** high

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None. The script directly fetches data from external HTTP resources without any integrity checks, and uses HTTP without enforcing HTTPS.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Enforce HTTPS:** Use HTTPS instead of HTTP for all external requests, especially to `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com`, to ensure encrypted communication and mitigate MITM attacks.
    - **Implement Integrity Checks and Certificate Verification:** Verify SSL/TLS certificates to ensure communication is with the intended server.
    - **Verify Data Integrity:** Implement integrity checks for responses from external resources. For example, explore if Oracle provides an API with checksums or signatures for version information. Investigate if Eclipse CI provides signed test reports or a more secure API for test results.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate the extracted JDK version against expected formats and ranges before updating files.
    - **Static Pinning:** Consider using static pinning of expected JDK versions for a release cycle to reduce reliance on external version fetching during automated updates, or as a fallback mechanism.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The automated workflow must execute the script `/code/.github/scripts/check_and_update_jdk.py`.
    - **Dependency Confusion Scenario:** Attacker needs to compromise `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com` or `ci.eclipse.org`.
    - **Insecure HTTP Scenario:** The CI or update process must be running in an environment where an attacker can intercept or manipulate unsecured HTTP traffic (e.g., on an untrusted network).

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    ```python
    import re
    import requests
    import json
    import ast

    # ...

    # Query the Oracle website for the latest JDK version
    response = requests.get('http://javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com/update/baseline.version') # Vulnerable line: Line 11, uses HTTP, no integrity check on response
    latest_jdk = re.search(r'(?P<major>\d+)\.?', response.text)

    # ...

    # Define the test URLs to check using the template and list comprehension
    uri_base = 'https://ci.eclipse.org/ls/job/jdt-ls-master/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.eclipse.jdt.ls.core.internal.{package}/{java_class}/{method}/api/python' # Vulnerable line: Line 23, relies on external CI for test status
    tests = [
        uri_base.format(package='managers', java_class=c, method=m) for c, m in [('EclipseProjectImporterTest', 'testPreviewFeaturesDisabledByDefault'), ('InvisibleProjectImporterTest', 'testPreviewFeaturesEnabledByDefault'), ('MavenProjectImporterTest', f'testJava{latest_jdk}Project')]
    ]

    # Check the test status for each test URL
    all_tests_passed = True
    for i in range(len(tests)):
        response = requests.get(tests[i]) # Vulnerable line: Line 31, no integrity check on response
        data = ast.literal_eval(response.text)  # Use ast.literal_eval, because response.json() fails

    # ...
    ```
    The script uses `requests.get()` to fetch data from external websites. Critically, the request to `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com` for the JDK version is made over HTTP, lacking transport layer security and integrity. While HTTPS is used for `ci.eclipse.org`, there's no verification of the integrity or authenticity of the responses beyond basic SSL/TLS encryption. An attacker compromising `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com` or performing a MITM attack on the HTTP request could manipulate the responses to inject malicious data. Furthermore, compromising `ci.eclipse.org` could lead to falsified test results. The script then blindly trusts these external sources, updating project files with potentially malicious or incorrect information.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Prerequisites:** Set up a controlled network environment where you can intercept or mimic network requests. This can be achieved using a proxy (like Burp Suite or mitmproxy) or by setting up a local HTTP server and DNS spoofing.
    2. **Mimic Oracle JDK Version Endpoint (HTTP Scenario):** Set up a local HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or `netcat`) that listens on port 80. Configure it to mimic the response of `http://javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com/update/baseline.version` but return a malicious JDK version number, such as "999".
    3. **Configure Proxy or DNS Spoofing:** Configure your testing environment (where the script will run) to route requests to `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com` to your local HTTP server (either via proxy settings or DNS spoofing).
    4. **Run the Script or Trigger Workflow:**
       - Execute the script directly in a test environment that uses your configured proxy or DNS spoofing: `python .github/scripts/check_and_update_jdk.py`.
       - Alternatively, if possible in your testing environment, trigger the `bump-jdk.yml` workflow after setting up the network interception.
    5. **Observe Script Output and File Changes:** Monitor the script's output. It should indicate that it detected "999" as the latest JDK version.
    6. **Verify File Updates:** Check the `README.md` and `package.json` files. The JDK version mentioned in these files should be incorrectly updated to "999".
    7. **(Optional) Mimic Eclipse CI Test Report Endpoint (Dependency Confusion Scenario):**  Similarly, set up another local HTTP server to mimic `https://ci.eclipse.org` and the test report API. Configure it to always return a "PASSED" status, regardless of actual test outcomes. Modify the script (temporarily, if needed) to point to this mock server for test reports and verify that the script proceeds with the JDK update even if real tests would fail.

    This test case demonstrates that by intercepting or controlling responses from external endpoints, an attacker can manipulate the JDK version update process and potentially bypass test status checks, confirming both the insecure HTTP and dependency confusion/supply chain vulnerabilities.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Sensitive Telemetry Data Exposure
  - **Description:**
    The extension's telemetry system, as detailed in `USAGE_DATA.md`, collects a wide range of data, including project configurations, build tool information, compiler settings, diagnostic errors, classpath details, file paths, and error stack traces. While telemetry is opt-in via the `redhat.telemetry.enabled` setting and governed by VS Code's telemetry level, the breadth of collected data presents a risk. If the transmission or storage of this data is compromised, or if users are unaware of the extent of data being sent, sensitive details about a developer's environment and projects could be exposed to attackers.

    - **Step-by-step trigger:**
      1. The extension, with telemetry enabled (either by default or user-configured), automatically collects and sends telemetry events.
      2. These events contain sensitive configuration and diagnostic information as outlined in `USAGE_DATA.md`.
      3. An attacker intercepts the telemetry data during transmission (if the channel is not adequately secured) or compromises the telemetry backend service where data is stored.
      4. The attacker analyzes the intercepted or accessed telemetry data to extract detailed information about developers' environments, project structures, file system paths, error messages, and potentially intellectual property revealed through code snippets in stack traces or diagnostic data.
      5. This information can be used for reconnaissance, targeted attacks, social engineering, or even corporate espionage.

  - **Impact:**
    Exposure of sensitive project details and personal information about developers and their environments. This data can be leveraged to facilitate targeted attacks, corporate espionage, or inadvertent exposure of intellectual property. The impact is high due to the potential for significant information leakage that could be exploited for malicious purposes.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Telemetry is opt-in and controlled by Visual Studio Code's built-in telemetry level (`telemetry.telemetryLevel`).
    - The `vscode-redhat-telemetry` package is used, consistent with other Red Hat extensions, implying adherence to Red Hat's telemetry practices.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Data Anonymization and Minimization:** Implement more robust anonymization of collected data to remove or hash sensitive file paths, project names, and personal identifiers before transmission. Minimize the collection of highly sensitive data where possible.
    - **Secure Transmission:** Ensure all telemetry data is transmitted exclusively over secure, encrypted channels (HTTPS). Verify the security of the telemetry backend infrastructure.
    - **User Transparency and Control:** Provide clearer user documentation about the specific types of data collected and their potential sensitivity. Offer more granular configuration options to allow users to control the level of detail in telemetry data or to opt-out of specific categories of data collection.
    - **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of the telemetry system, including data collection, transmission, and storage, to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user must have telemetry enabled within VS Code (either by default setting or by explicit user choice).
    - An attacker must be capable of intercepting network traffic from the user's machine or compromising the telemetry backend infrastructure.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Documentation in `USAGE_DATA.md` clearly outlines the extensive types of data collected, including potentially sensitive diagnostic and build configuration information.
    - There is no readily available evidence suggesting extensive anonymization or redaction of sensitive fields before telemetry data transmission. Further code review would be needed to confirm the data processing and anonymization steps within the `vscode-redhat-telemetry` package and the extension itself.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup Test Environment:** Configure the extension in a controlled test environment where telemetry can be enabled.
    2. **Enable Telemetry:** Ensure that telemetry is enabled in VS Code settings (`redhat.telemetry.enabled` and `telemetry.telemetryLevel` at least set to 'error' or 'all').
    3. **Intercept Telemetry Transmissions:** Use a network traffic sniffer (e.g., Wireshark) or a proxy (e.g., Burp Suite, mitmproxy) to intercept network traffic originating from VS Code and the Java extension. Configure the proxy to capture HTTPS traffic if possible.
    4. **Trigger Telemetry Events:** Use the Java extension as a typical developer would, opening projects, building, running code, encountering errors, etc., to generate telemetry events.
    5. **Analyze Intercepted Data:** Examine the intercepted telemetry data to identify the contents of the transmitted information. Specifically, check for:
        - Absolute file paths from the local file system.
        - Project names or directory structures.
        - Detailed error messages and stack traces, which might contain code snippets or sensitive information.
        - Configuration details that could reveal environment specifics.
    6. **Evaluate Anonymization:** Assess whether sensitive data is transmitted in clear text or if any anonymization or redaction techniques are applied. Determine if the level of anonymization is sufficient to protect user privacy and project confidentiality.
    7. **(Optional) Replay and Correlation:** Attempt to replay intercepted telemetry events to a test server to simulate data reception and processing. Investigate if the intercepted information can be effectively extracted, correlated, and used to build a profile of the user's development environment and projects.

- **Vulnerability Name:** XML External Entity Injection in Formatter Settings
- **Description:**
    The `java.format.settings.url` setting in the Java extension allows users to specify a URL or a local file path to an Eclipse formatter XML settings file. If the extension's XML parser is vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection (XXE), an attacker could exploit this by providing a malicious XML file. When a user configures this setting to point to attacker-controlled XML and then triggers code formatting, the vulnerable parser could be tricked into processing external entities defined in the malicious XML. This could lead to reading local files on the user's system or, in more advanced scenarios, potentially achieving remote code execution.

    - **Step-by-step trigger:**
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious XML file containing an XXE payload designed to exploit XML parsers that process external entities. This payload typically involves defining an external entity that references a local file or a remote resource.
        2. The attacker needs to make this malicious XML file accessible to the victim. This could be done by hosting it on a web server (accessible via a URL) or by placing it on the local file system if the attacker has some form of local access.
        3. The attacker convinces a victim to configure the `java.format.settings.url` setting in VS Code to point to the malicious XML file. This could be achieved through social engineering or by exploiting other vulnerabilities to modify the user's VS Code settings.
        4. The victim triggers the code formatting feature in VS Code. This could be done manually by using the "Format Document" command or automatically through VS Code's auto-formatting features.
        5. The Java extension, in response to the formatting command, parses the XML file specified in `java.format.settings.url`.
        6. If the XML parser used by the extension is vulnerable to XXE and if external entity processing is enabled in its configuration, the attacker's XXE payload is executed. This could result in the XML parser attempting to read the file specified in the external entity definition (e.g., `/etc/passwd` or `C:\Windows\win.ini`).
        7. The contents of the accessed file or error messages related to the file access might be logged or otherwise exposed, confirming the XXE vulnerability.

- **Impact:**
    **High**. Successful exploitation of this XXE vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    - **Read arbitrary local files:** The attacker can craft XML payloads to read files from the victim's file system that the VS Code process has permissions to access, leading to information disclosure of potentially sensitive data (e.g., configuration files, source code, credentials).
    - **Potential Remote Code Execution (in advanced scenarios):** While less common with XXE, depending on the specific XML parser and system configurations, it might be possible to leverage XXE vulnerabilities to achieve remote code execution. This is often more complex and less direct than simple file reading.
    - **Denial of Service:** In some cases, XXE can be used to trigger denial-of-service attacks, for example, by attempting to access extremely large files or by causing the parser to consume excessive resources.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** high

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    None mentioned in the provided documentation or project files. There is no indication that the extension actively mitigates XXE vulnerabilities when parsing XML formatter settings.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Disable External Entity Resolution:** The Java extension should ensure that the XML parser used to process the formatter settings file is securely configured to prevent XXE attacks. The primary mitigation is to disable external entity resolution entirely when parsing XML from potentially untrusted sources (like user-provided URLs or local files). Most XML parsing libraries provide options to disable external entity processing.
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization:** While disabling external entities is the most effective mitigation for XXE, additional input validation of the `java.format.settings.url` setting and sanitization of the XML file content could provide defense in depth. However, these are secondary to disabling external entities.
    - **Security Audits of XML Parsing:** Regularly audit the XML parsing logic in the Java extension to ensure secure XML parsing practices are followed and that XXE vulnerabilities are effectively prevented.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. **User Configuration:** The victim user must configure the `java.format.settings.url` setting in VS Code. This setting is not enabled by default and requires explicit user action.
    2. **Attacker-Controlled XML:** The attacker must be able to provide a malicious XML file accessible to the victim, either via a URL or by placing it on the local file system if they have some level of access.
    3. **Trigger Code Formatting:** The victim user must trigger the code formatting feature in VS Code. This action initiates the parsing of the XML file specified in `java.format.settings.url`.
    4. **Vulnerable XML Parser:** The Java extension must use an XML parser that is vulnerable to XXE (by default or due to misconfiguration) and must not have disabled external entity processing.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Without access to the source code of the Java extension, specifically the part that handles the `java.format.settings.url` setting and parses the XML file, it's impossible to definitively confirm or deny the presence of an XXE vulnerability or the effectiveness of any mitigations.
    - To analyze the source code, one should:
        1. **Identify XML Parsing Code:** Locate the code responsible for reading and parsing the XML file specified by `java.format.settings.url`.
        2. **Identify XML Parsing Library:** Determine which XML parsing library is being used (e.g., Java's built-in XML libraries like `javax.xml.parsers` or third-party libraries).
        3. **Check Parser Configuration:** Examine how the XML parser is configured. Look for settings related to external entity processing. In Java XML libraries, this often involves using `DocumentBuilderFactory` or `SAXParserFactory` to configure the parser to disable external entity resolution (e.g., setting `setFeature(XMLConstants.FEATURE_SECURE_PROCESSING, true)` and disabling features related to external entities).
        4. **Verify Mitigation Implementation:** Confirm that the code explicitly disables external entity resolution or employs other effective XXE mitigation techniques. If standard Java XML parsing libraries are used without specific security configurations to disable external entity resolution, the vulnerability is likely present by default.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Create Malicious XML File:** Create a file named `xxe_formatter_settings.xml` with the following XXE payload:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <!DOCTYPE settings [
          <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
        ]>
        <settings>
          <profile name="XXEProfile">
            <setting id="org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.lineSplit" value="120"/>
            <setting id="org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.tabulation.char" value="space"/>
            <setting id="org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.indentation.size" value="2"/>
            <setting id="org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.comment.line_length" value="80"/>
            <setting id="xxe_payload" value="&xxe;"/>
          </profile>
        </settings>
        ```
        *(Note: For Windows, replace `file:///etc/passwd` with a path to an accessible file like `file:///C:/Windows/win.ini`.)*
    2. **Host or Place XML File:**
        - **URL Method:** Host the `xxe_formatter_settings.xml` file on a web server that you control, making it accessible via a URL (e.g., `http://your-server.com/xxe_formatter_settings.xml`).
        - **Local File Method:** Save the `xxe_formatter_settings.xml` file to a known location on your local file system where VS Code can access it (e.g., your home directory).
    3. **Configure `java.format.settings.url`:** Open VS Code Settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Settings > Settings on macOS). Search for `java.format.settings.url` and set its value to:
        - **URL Method:** The URL of your hosted malicious XML file (e.g., `"http://your-server.com/xxe_formatter_settings.xml"`).
        - **Local File Method:** The absolute file path to the `xxe_formatter_settings.xml` file (e.g., `"file:///home/user/xxe_formatter_settings.xml"` on Linux/macOS or `"file:///C:/Users/YourUser/xxe_formatter_settings.xml"` on Windows).
    4. **Trigger Code Formatting:** Open any Java file in VS Code. Trigger the code formatting command (e.g., Shift + Alt + F, or right-click and select "Format Document").
    5. **Examine Java Extension Logs:** After formatting, open the Java Extension Logs using the command `Java: Open Java Extension Log File` or `Java: Open All Log Files`.
    6. **Check for XXE Evidence:** Examine the logs for evidence of successful XXE exploitation. Look for:
        - The content of `/etc/passwd` (or the file you targeted) appearing in the logs.
        - Error messages related to file access or XML parsing that indicate the parser attempted to process the external entity and access the specified file.
        - Any unusual log entries that might suggest the parser tried to resolve external entities.

    If the log contains the contents of the targeted file or error messages related to accessing it, it confirms the presence of an XXE vulnerability in the XML parsing of formatter settings.
