- Vulnerability Name: Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Vulnerability in JDK Version Update Script
  - Description:
    1. The script `/code/.github/scripts/check_and_update_jdk.py` fetches the latest JDK version from `http://javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com/update/baseline.version`.
    2. It also fetches test reports from `https://ci.eclipse.org/ls/job/jdt-ls-master/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/`.
    3. If an attacker can compromise `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com` to return a malicious version number, or compromise `ci.eclipse.org` to fake test pass results, the script will incorrectly update the JDK version in `README.md` and `package.json`.
    4. This could lead to the project being built and released with a vulnerable or backdoored JDK, potentially affecting users of the vscode-java extension.
  - Impact:
    Compromise of the vscode-java extension distribution. Users could download and use a vulnerable version of the extension that is built with a malicious JDK, potentially leading to various security issues including remote code execution on developer machines and users' machines.
  - Vulnerability Rank: high
  - Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    None. The script directly fetches data from external HTTP resources without any integrity checks.
  - Missing Mitigations:
    - Implement integrity checks for external resources. For example, enforce HTTPS and verify SSL/TLS certificates to ensure communication is encrypted and with the intended server.
    - Consider using more reliable and verifiable sources for JDK version information and test results. Explore if Oracle provides an API with checksums or signatures for version information. Investigate if Eclipse CI provides signed test reports or a more secure API for test results.
    - Implement some form of verification for the downloaded JDK or the reported test results, if feasible. Although verifying the JDK itself is complex, verifying the source of truth for version information and test status is crucial.
    - Consider using static pinning of expected JDK versions for a release cycle to reduce the reliance on external version fetching during automated updates.
  - Preconditions:
    - Attacker needs to compromise `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com` or `ci.eclipse.org`.
    - The automated workflow runs the script `/code/.github/scripts/check_and_update_jdk.py`.
  - Source Code Analysis:
    ```python
    import re
    import requests
    import json
    import ast

    # ...

    # Query the Oracle website for the latest JDK version
    response = requests.get('http://javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com/update/baseline.version') # Vulnerable line: Line 11, no integrity check on response
    latest_jdk = re.search(r'(?P<major>\d+)\.?', response.text)

    # ...

    # Define the test URLs to check using the template and list comprehension
    uri_base = 'https://ci.eclipse.org/ls/job/jdt-ls-master/lastCompletedBuild/testReport/org.eclipse.jdt.ls.core.internal.{package}/{java_class}/{method}/api/python' # Vulnerable line: Line 23, relies on external CI for test status
    tests = [
        uri_base.format(package='managers', java_class=c, method=m) for c, m in [('EclipseProjectImporterTest', 'testPreviewFeaturesDisabledByDefault'), ('InvisibleProjectImporterTest', 'testPreviewFeaturesEnabledByDefault'), ('MavenProjectImporterTest', f'testJava{latest_jdk}Project')]
    ]

    # Check the test status for each test URL
    all_tests_passed = True
    for i in range(len(tests)):
        response = requests.get(tests[i]) # Vulnerable line: Line 31, no integrity check on response
        data = ast.literal_eval(response.text)  # Use ast.literal_eval, because response.json() fails

    # ...
    ```
    The script uses `requests.get()` to fetch data from external websites over HTTP/HTTPS. However, it lacks any mechanism to verify the integrity or authenticity of the responses beyond basic SSL/TLS encryption provided by HTTPS. If `javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com` or `ci.eclipse.org` were compromised, an attacker could manipulate the responses to inject malicious data, leading to the script updating to a compromised JDK version or falsely reporting successful test outcomes.
  - Security Test Case:
    1. Prerequisites: You need to be able to intercept or mimic network requests made by the GitHub Actions runner. This might require setting up a local network and DNS spoofing, or using a proxy to intercept requests. For a simpler test, you can modify the script directly in a local branch and run it locally with network interception.
    2. Mimic Oracle JDK Version Endpoint: Set up a local HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or `netcat`) that listens on port 80 or 443 and mimics the response of `http://javadl-esd-secure.oracle.com/update/baseline.version`. Configure it to return a malicious JDK version number, such as "99".
    3. Modify Script for Local Test (If direct modification is chosen for simplicity): In a local branch of the `vscode-java` repository, temporarily modify the script `/code/.github/scripts/check_and_update_jdk.py` to point to your local HTTP server instead of the real Oracle website. Change line 11 to: `response = requests.get('http://localhost:<your_port>/update/baseline.version')` (adjust port accordingly).
    4. Run the Script Locally or Trigger Workflow:
       - For local test: Execute the modified script directly: `python .github/scripts/check_and_update_jdk.py`.
       - For workflow test: Commit and push the modified script to a test branch and trigger the `bump-jdk.yml` workflow (if possible in your testing environment).
    5. Observe Script Output and File Changes: Check the output of the script. It should indicate that it detected "99" as the latest JDK version.
    6. Verify File Updates: Examine the `README.md` and `package.json` files. The JDK version mentioned in these files should be incorrectly updated to "99".
    7. (Optional) Mimic Eclipse CI Test Report Endpoint:  Similarly, set up another local HTTP server to mimic `https://ci.eclipse.org` and the test report API. Configure it to always return a "PASSED" status, regardless of actual test outcomes. Modify the script to point to this mock server for test reports and verify that the script proceeds with the JDK update even if real tests would fail.

This test case demonstrates that by controlling the responses from external endpoints, an attacker can manipulate the JDK version update process, confirming the dependency confusion/supply chain vulnerability.
