### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: XML External Entity Injection in Formatter Settings
- Description:
    - The `java.format.settings.url` setting allows users to specify a URL or a local file path to an Eclipse formatter XML settings file.
    - If a user configures this setting to point to a malicious XML file, and the extension's XML parser is vulnerable to XML External Entity Injection (XXE), an attacker could exploit this to read local files or potentially achieve remote code execution on the user's machine.
    - Steps to trigger the vulnerability:
        1. An attacker crafts a malicious XML file containing an XXE payload.
        2. The attacker convinces a victim to set the `java.format.settings.url` setting in VS Code to point to the attacker's malicious XML file (either hosted remotely via URL or provided locally if the attacker has local access).
        3. The victim triggers the code formatting feature in VS Code (e.g., by using the "Format Document" command).
        4. The Java extension parses the XML file specified in `java.format.settings.url`.
        5. If the XML parser is vulnerable to XXE and external entity processing is not disabled, the attacker's XXE payload is executed.
- Impact:
    - **High**: An attacker could potentially read arbitrary files from the victim's file system, leading to information disclosure. In more advanced scenarios, depending on the XML parser and system configuration, it might be possible to achieve remote code execution.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None mentioned in the provided documentation or project files. The documentation only describes the setting and its usage.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - The Java extension should ensure that the XML parser used to process the formatter settings file is securely configured to prevent XXE attacks. This typically involves disabling external entity resolution when parsing XML from potentially untrusted sources.
- Preconditions:
    1. The victim user must configure the `java.format.settings.url` setting.
    2. The attacker must be able to provide a malicious XML file accessible to the victim, either via a URL or by placing it on the local file system if they have some level of access.
    3. The victim user must trigger the code formatting feature in VS Code, which causes the extension to parse the XML file.
- Source Code Analysis:
    - Based on the provided project files, there is no source code available to analyze the XML parsing implementation and confirm or deny the existence of XXE vulnerability or its mitigation.
    - To confirm this vulnerability, the source code of the Java extension, specifically the part that handles the `java.format.settings.url` setting and parses the XML file, would need to be reviewed.
    - Look for the XML parsing libraries being used and how they are configured. Check if there are any explicit measures to disable or mitigate XXE vulnerabilities when parsing the formatter settings XML file.
    - If standard Java XML parsing libraries are used without specific security configurations to disable external entity resolution, the vulnerability is likely present.
- Security Test Case:
    1. Create a malicious XML file named `xxe_formatter_settings.xml` with the following content:
        ```xml
        <?xml version="1.0"?>
        <!DOCTYPE settings [
          <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
        ]>
        <settings>
          <profile name="XXEProfile">
            <setting id="org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.lineSplit" value="120"/>
            <setting id="org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.tabulation.char" value="space"/>
            <setting id="org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.indentation.size" value="2"/>
            <setting id="org.eclipse.jdt.core.formatter.comment.line_length" value="80"/>
            <setting id="xxe_payload" value="&xxe;"/>
          </profile>
        </settings>
        ```
        *(Note: For Windows, you can try to access `file:///C:/Windows/win.ini` or similar accessible files.)*
    2. Save this file to a location accessible by VS Code (e.g., your home directory).
    3. Open VS Code and navigate to Settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Code > Settings > Settings on macOS).
    4. Search for `java.format.settings.url`.
    5. In the settings, set `java.format.settings.url` to the absolute file path of the `xxe_formatter_settings.xml` file you created. For example, if the file is in your home directory, it might be something like `"file:///home/user/xxe_formatter_settings.xml"` (on Linux/macOS) or `"file:///C:/Users/YourUser/xxe_formatter_settings.xml"` (on Windows).
    6. Open any Java file in VS Code.
    7. Trigger the code formatting command (e.g., press Shift + Alt + F, or right-click in the editor and select "Format Document").
    8. After formatting, open the Java Extension Logs (using the command `Java: Open Java Extension Log File` or `Java: Open All Log Files`).
    9. Examine the logs for the content of `/etc/passwd` (or the file you targeted). If the log contains the contents of the file, it indicates a successful XXE vulnerability. Look for log entries that might contain parts of the `/etc/passwd` file or error messages related to file access if the parser attempts to process the external entity.
