### Key Attack Surface List Involving `qs` (High & Critical)

Here's an updated list of key attack surfaces that directly involve the `qs` library, focusing on those with high and critical severity:

* **Attack Surface:** Prototype Pollution
    * **Description:** Attackers can inject properties into the `Object.prototype` or other built-in object prototypes by manipulating query parameters. This can lead to unexpected behavior, security vulnerabilities, or even denial of service.
    * **How `qs` Contributes:** `qs`'s default parsing behavior allows for the creation of nested objects using bracket notation (e.g., `a[__proto__][b]=c`). This enables attackers to directly target the `__proto__` property.
    * **Example:** `?__proto__.isAdmin=true`
    * **Impact:**  Can lead to privilege escalation, arbitrary code execution (in certain contexts), or denial of service by modifying core JavaScript object behavior.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Validate and sanitize data after parsing with `qs`:**  Do not directly use the parsed data without validation. Check for and remove potentially malicious properties like `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype`.
        * **Use `Object.create(null)` for objects where prototype pollution is a concern:**  Create objects without a prototype chain to prevent manipulation of the default `Object.prototype`.
        * **Consider using `qs`'s `allowPrototypes: false` option (if applicable and understood):** This option, if available in your `qs` version, can prevent parsing of properties on the `Object.prototype`. However, understand the implications as it might break expected functionality.

* **Attack Surface:** Resource Exhaustion via Deeply Nested Objects/Arrays
    * **Description:** Attackers can craft query strings with excessively deep nesting of objects or arrays, causing the server to consume excessive CPU and memory during parsing, potentially leading to a denial of service.
    * **How `qs` Contributes:** `qs` by default attempts to parse arbitrarily nested structures. Without limits, a malicious query string can force the parser to perform a large number of operations.
    * **Example:** `?a[b][c][d][e][f][g][h][i][j][k][l][m][n][o][p]=value` (and even deeper)
    * **Impact:** Denial of service, making the application unavailable to legitimate users.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Limit the parsing depth:** Configure `qs` (if possible through options or by wrapping its functionality) to limit the maximum depth of nested objects and arrays it will parse.
        * **Implement request timeouts:** Configure web servers and application frameworks to have timeouts for request processing, preventing indefinitely long parsing operations.
