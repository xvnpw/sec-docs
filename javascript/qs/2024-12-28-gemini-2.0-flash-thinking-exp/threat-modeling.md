*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Deeply Nested Objects

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious query string with excessively deep nesting of parameters (e.g., `a[b][c][d]...[z]=value`). The `qs` library, when parsing this string, attempts to create a deeply nested JavaScript object. This can consume significant server resources (CPU and memory). The attacker might repeatedly send such requests to overwhelm the server.
    *   **Impact:** The server becomes overloaded and unresponsive, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users. The application might crash or become extremely slow.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `parse` function, specifically its logic for handling nested object structures.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the `depth` option in `qs` to limit the maximum depth of nesting allowed during parsing.

*   **Threat:** Denial of Service (DoS) via Large Number of Keys

    *   **Description:** An attacker sends a query string with an extremely large number of unique parameters (e.g., `a1=value&a2=value&a3=value...&aN=value`). When `qs` parses this, it creates a large number of properties in the resulting JavaScript object. This can consume significant memory and processing time.
    *   **Impact:** The server's memory usage increases dramatically, potentially leading to crashes or slowdowns. The parsing process itself can become a bottleneck, delaying request processing.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `parse` function, specifically its logic for creating object properties from query parameters.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Configure the `parameterLimit` option in `qs` to limit the maximum number of parameters that can be parsed.

*   **Threat:** Prototype Pollution

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a query string that exploits `qs`'s ability to create properties on the `Object.prototype` if the `allowPrototypes` option is not explicitly set to `false`. For example, a query string like `__proto__[isAdmin]=true` could add an `isAdmin` property to the `Object.prototype`.
    *   **Impact:** Modifying `Object.prototype` can have widespread and potentially catastrophic consequences. It can lead to unexpected behavior in the application, security vulnerabilities where attacker-controlled properties are unexpectedly accessed, and potential for remote code execution in some scenarios.
    *   **Affected Component:** The `parse` function, specifically its handling of keys like `__proto__` and `constructor`. The `allowPrototypes` option controls this behavior.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always set the `allowPrototypes` option to `false` when configuring `qs`. This is the most crucial mitigation.**
