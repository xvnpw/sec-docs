## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities were identified. The provided files primarily consist of documentation, CI configuration, and test project setups, lacking the source code of the Dart Code VS Code extension itself. Without the source code, it's not possible to perform a detailed security analysis to identify vulnerabilities within the extension's logic.

It's important to note that the absence of identified vulnerabilities in these files does not guarantee the absence of vulnerabilities in the Dart Code extension as a whole. A comprehensive security assessment would require access to and analysis of the extension's source code.

Therefore, based solely on the provided PROJECT FILES, there are no vulnerabilities to list according to the specified criteria.
