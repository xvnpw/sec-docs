Okay, based on your instructions and the initial assessment that no high or critical vulnerabilities were identified from the provided documentation files (`/code/README.md`, `/code/CHANGELOG.md`), here is the updated vulnerability list in markdown format.

It's important to reiterate that this analysis is limited to the provided documentation files. A comprehensive security assessment would necessitate a review of the actual source code.

## Updated Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files (`/code/README.md`, `/code/CHANGELOG.md`), and applying the specified filtering criteria for external attackers and high/critical rank vulnerabilities, no vulnerabilities meeting these requirements were identified.

This means that, according to the information available in the documentation files alone, there are currently no vulnerabilities to report that:

*   Are exploitable by an external attacker on a publicly available instance.
*   Are ranked as high or critical.
*   Are not already mitigated.
*   Are not excluded by the negative criteria (insecure code patterns in project files, missing documentation only, or DoS vulnerabilities).

**To provide a more accurate and complete vulnerability assessment, access to the source code of the application is required.**  Analyzing the code directly would allow for identification of potential vulnerabilities that are not apparent from documentation alone.

If you can provide access to the source code, I can perform a more thorough analysis and update this list accordingly.
