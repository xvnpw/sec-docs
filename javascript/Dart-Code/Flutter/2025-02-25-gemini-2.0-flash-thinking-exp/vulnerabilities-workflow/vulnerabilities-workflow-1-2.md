### Vulnerability List

- **No Vulnerabilities Found**
  - **Description**: The analyzed project files consist only of documentation (README.md and CHANGELOG.md). There is no code or configuration present that can be exploited for triggering a security issue.
  - **Impact**: Since there is no exploitable code or configuration in these files, an external attacker does not have a means to trigger a vulnerability based on the current project files.
  - **Vulnerability Rank**: Not applicable (no high, critical, or otherwise ranked vulnerabilities detected).
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: Not applicable.
  - **Missing Mitigations**: Not applicable.
  - **Preconditions**: Not applicable.
  - **Source Code Analysis**:
    - **Step 1:** The /code/README.md file provides basic information about the extension, its dependencies, and installation instructions.
    - **Step 2:** The /code/CHANGELOG.md file contains a reference to release notes.
    - **Conclusion:** Neither file contains source code or dynamic configuration elements that could be exploited.
  - **Security Test Case**: Not applicable testing is needed because there is no vulnerability vector in these documentation files.
