### Vulnerability List

- **No Vulnerabilities Found in Documentation Files**
  - **Description**: The analyzed project files consist only of documentation (README.md and CHANGELOG.md). These files are meant for providing information about the project and do not contain executable code or dynamic configurations that can be directly exploited by an external attacker to trigger a security vulnerability.  They describe the project, its history, and usage, but do not implement any functional logic that can be manipulated.
  - **Impact**: Since there is no exploitable code or configuration within these documentation files, an external attacker cannot leverage them to directly cause harm to the application, its data, or users. The impact is effectively null in terms of direct exploitation of these files.
  - **Vulnerability Rank**: Not applicable (No vulnerability detected within the scope of documentation files).
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: Not applicable (No vulnerability to mitigate in documentation files).
  - **Missing Mitigations**: Not applicable (No vulnerability to mitigate in documentation files).
  - **Preconditions**: Not applicable (No vulnerability to exploit in documentation files).
  - **Source Code Analysis**:
    - **Step 1**: Examination of `README.md`: This file typically contains project descriptions, setup instructions, and basic usage guidelines. It consists of markdown formatted text providing information to users and developers. It does not contain any executable code or server-side configurations.
    - **Step 2**: Examination of `CHANGELOG.md`: This file records the history of changes made to the project over time, usually listing bug fixes, new features, and updates for each version. It is also composed of markdown formatted text and serves as a historical record. It does not contain any executable code or server-side configurations.
    - **Conclusion**:  Neither `README.md` nor `CHANGELOG.md` contains any source code, dynamic configuration, or interactive elements that could be manipulated by an external attacker to trigger a vulnerability. They are purely informational documentation files.
  - **Security Test Case**:
    - **Step 1**: Attempt to access the application through a web browser or other standard means as an external attacker.
    - **Step 2**: Request the `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` files (assuming they are publicly accessible, which is common for documentation).
    - **Step 3**: Analyze the content of these files for any interactive elements, forms, scripts, or configurations that could be manipulated to cause unintended behavior.
    - **Step 4**: Attempt to inject malicious payloads (e.g., cross-site scripting, command injection) into any part of the documentation files (if they were somehow processed dynamically, which is not expected for static markdown documentation).
    - **Expected Result**:  No vulnerability will be found because the files are static documentation and do not execute any code or process user input in a way that could lead to exploitation. The test will confirm that these documentation files, in isolation, do not present a security risk to an external attacker.

*Note: This vulnerability assessment is limited to the provided documentation files (README.md and CHANGELOG.md). A comprehensive security audit requires analysis of the application's source code, runtime environment, and infrastructure.*
