# Attack Surface Analysis for sveltejs/svelte

## Attack Surface: [Template Injection via Unsanitized Data](./attack_surfaces/template_injection_via_unsanitized_data.md)

*   **Description:**  User-provided data is directly embedded into Svelte templates without proper sanitization, allowing execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
*   **How Svelte Contributes:** Svelte's template syntax allows embedding JavaScript expressions directly within the HTML using curly braces `{}`. If these expressions contain unsanitized user input, it becomes a vector for XSS.
*   **Example:**
    ```svelte
    <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>
    ```
    If `name` comes directly from user input like `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`, this script will be executed.
*   **Impact:**  Critical. Can lead to account takeover, data theft, malware injection, and other malicious activities.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Always sanitize user input:** Use browser built-in functions like `textContent` or libraries like DOMPurify to sanitize data before rendering it in templates.
    *   **Avoid using `{@html ...}` with untrusted data:** The `{@html ...}` tag renders raw HTML and should only be used with trusted sources.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Attribute Injection via Unsanitized Data](./attack_surfaces/attribute_injection_via_unsanitized_data.md)

*   **Description:** User-provided data is used within HTML attributes without proper sanitization, potentially allowing execution of JavaScript or manipulation of the page's behavior.
*   **How Svelte Contributes:** Similar to template injection, Svelte allows embedding expressions within HTML attributes. Unsanitized user input here can lead to XSS or other vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:**
    ```svelte
    <div class="{userClass}">This is a div</div>
    ```
    If `userClass` is user input like `"attack" onclick="alert('XSS')"`, the `onclick` event will be injected.
*   **Impact:** High. Can lead to XSS, potentially less severe than direct template injection but still allows malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sanitize user input before using it in attributes:**  Encode HTML entities or use appropriate sanitization libraries.
    *   **Avoid dynamic attribute names based on user input:** If possible, limit the allowed values for attributes.
    *   **Use event listeners instead of inline handlers:**  Attach event listeners programmatically instead of relying on inline attributes like `onclick`.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) HTML Injection](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__html_injection.md)

*   **Description:** When using SSR, if data used during the server-side rendering process is not properly sanitized, it can lead to HTML injection vulnerabilities in the initial rendered output.
*   **How Svelte Contributes:** Svelte's SSR capabilities involve rendering components to HTML on the server. If unsanitized user data is included in this process, it can be injected into the HTML sent to the client.
*   **Example:**  A blog post title fetched from a database and rendered on the server without sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
*   **Impact:** High. Can lead to XSS vulnerabilities that are present even before the client-side application fully loads.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sanitize data on the server-side before rendering:** Ensure all user-provided data is properly escaped or sanitized before being included in the SSR output.
    *   **Use secure templating practices on the server.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Svelte Compiler or Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_svelte_compiler_or_dependencies.md)

*   **Description:** Security vulnerabilities in the Svelte compiler itself or its dependencies (like Rollup) could potentially introduce vulnerabilities into the compiled application.
*   **How Svelte Contributes:**  The Svelte compiler transforms Svelte code into JavaScript. If the compiler has a vulnerability, it could generate insecure code.
*   **Example:** A bug in the compiler that allows bypassing sanitization logic or introduces a new XSS vector.
*   **Impact:**  Medium to High. Can affect all applications built with the vulnerable version of Svelte.
*   **Risk Severity:** High (assuming a critical vulnerability in the compiler)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Svelte and its dependencies updated:** Regularly update to the latest versions to benefit from security patches.
    *   **Monitor security advisories for Svelte and its ecosystem.**
