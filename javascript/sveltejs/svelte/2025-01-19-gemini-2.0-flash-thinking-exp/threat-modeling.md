# Threat Model Analysis for sveltejs/svelte

## Threat: [Malicious Code Injection via Compiler Vulnerability](./threats/malicious_code_injection_via_compiler_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability within the Svelte compiler itself. This could allow them to craft malicious Svelte code that, when compiled, injects arbitrary JavaScript or other harmful code into the final application bundle. This could happen without the developer's explicit knowledge during the build process.

**Impact:**  If successful, the attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript in users' browsers, leading to data theft, session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. The impact would be widespread, affecting all users of the application.

**Affected Svelte Component:** `svelte` npm package (specifically the compiler module).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep the `svelte` npm package updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
*   Monitor Svelte's official channels and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
*   Consider using static analysis tools on the compiled JavaScript output to detect suspicious code patterns.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Compiler Dependencies](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_compiler_dependencies.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a dependency of the Svelte compiler. This could involve injecting malicious code into a widely used library that the Svelte compiler relies on. When developers install or update the Svelte compiler, this malicious code gets included in their build process.

**Impact:** Similar to a compiler vulnerability, this could lead to the injection of malicious code into the final application, resulting in various client-side attacks affecting users.

**Affected Svelte Component:** Dependencies of the `svelte` npm package.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions.
*   Regularly audit project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
*   Consider using dependency scanning tools like Snyk or Dependabot to automate vulnerability detection and updates.

## Threat: [Improper Handling of Dynamic Content with `{@html ...}`](./threats/improper_handling_of_dynamic_content_with__{@html____}_.md)

**Description:** A developer uses the `{@html ...}` tag to render dynamic content without proper sanitization. An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into this dynamic content, which would then be executed in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Affected Svelte Component:** The `{@html ...}` tag within Svelte templates.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using `{@html ...}` unless absolutely necessary and the source of the content is completely trusted.
*   If `{@html ...}` is unavoidable, rigorously sanitize the dynamic content using a trusted HTML sanitization library before rendering it.
