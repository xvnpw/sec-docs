## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Svelte Compilation Process](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_svelte_compilation_process.md)

* Compromise Svelte Application [CRITICAL]: The ultimate goal of the attacker.
* Exploit Vulnerabilities in Svelte Compilation Process [CRITICAL]:  Targeting the compilation stage to inject malicious code.
* Inject Malicious Code During Compilation [CRITICAL]: The core action of this attack path.
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Svelte Compiler Dependencies [CRITICAL]:
        * Attack Vector: Compromising a dependency used by the Svelte compiler (e.g., through a supply chain attack by injecting malicious code into a popular package).
        * Impact: Malicious code gets injected into the application during the build process, potentially leading to full control over the application and its data.
    * Exploit Vulnerabilities in Custom Svelte Plugins/Preprocessors [CRITICAL]:
        * Attack Vector: Introducing malicious logic through a poorly written or intentionally compromised custom Svelte plugin or preprocessor used in the build process.
        * Impact: Similar to dependency compromise, malicious code is injected during the build, leading to potential full control.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Exploiting Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities Introduced by Svelte](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_exploiting_client-side_rendering_vulnerabilities_introduced_by_svelte.md)

* Compromise Svelte Application [CRITICAL]: The ultimate goal of the attacker.
* Exploit Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities Introduced by Svelte [CRITICAL]: Targeting vulnerabilities arising from Svelte's client-side rendering mechanisms.
* Exploit Svelte's Reactivity System [CRITICAL]: Focusing on Svelte's data binding and reactivity features.
    * Inject Malicious Code via Reactive Data Binding [CRITICAL]:
        * Attack Vector: Supplying malicious data that, when bound to the DOM using Svelte's reactive syntax (e.g., `{@html}` or direct binding without proper sanitization), executes arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
        * Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, redirect users, or perform actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Exploiting Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Specific Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_exploiting_server-side_rendering__ssr__specific_vulnerabilities.md)

* Compromise Svelte Application [CRITICAL]: The ultimate goal of the attacker.
* Exploit Client-Side Rendering Vulnerabilities Introduced by Svelte [CRITICAL]: Targeting vulnerabilities arising from Svelte's client-side rendering mechanisms, specifically in the context of SSR.
* Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Specific Vulnerabilities (If Applicable) [CRITICAL]: Focusing on vulnerabilities unique to the server-side rendering process.
    * Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via SSR Hydration [CRITICAL]:
        * Attack Vector: Injecting malicious scripts into data that is rendered on the server and then used to "hydrate" the client-side application. When the client-side Svelte app takes over, these scripts are executed.
        * Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), similar to the client-side version, but potentially more impactful as it occurs during the initial page load.
