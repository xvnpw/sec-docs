## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Svelte Application (Attacker Goal) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_svelte_application__attacker_goal___critical_.md)

This represents the ultimate objective of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized control or causing significant harm to the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Compiled Svelte Code [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_compiled_svelte_code__critical_node_.md)

This critical node represents the attacker's attempt to leverage weaknesses in the code generated by the Svelte compiler. Success here can lead to direct code execution or other vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code During Compilation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_during_compilation__high-risk_path_.md)

This path involves introducing malicious code into the application during the build process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Svelte Compiler (Hypothetical, Low Likelihood) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_svelte_compiler__hypothetical__low_likelihood___critical_.md)

While unlikely, if the Svelte compiler itself were compromised, attackers could inject malicious code into *all* applications built with that version. This would have a critical impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Svelte Component Files Before Compilation [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_svelte_component_files_before_compilation__high-risk_path___critical_node_.md)

This is a more realistic scenario where an attacker gains access to the source code repository or development environment and modifies Svelte component files before the compilation process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce malicious JavaScript within `<script>` tags. [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_javascript_within__script__tags___high-risk_path___critical_.md)

Attackers can directly embed malicious JavaScript code within the `<script>` tags of Svelte components. This code will be executed in the user's browser, allowing for actions like stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing actions on their behalf.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious HTML within the template section, leading to XSS. [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_html_within_the_template_section__leading_to_xss___high-risk_path___critical_.md)

By injecting malicious HTML, particularly including `<script>` tags or event handlers, attackers can introduce Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. When the component is rendered, this malicious HTML will be executed in the user's browser, similar to the previous attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypass Security Checks Through Reactive Updates [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/bypass_security_checks_through_reactive_updates__high-risk_path___critical_.md)

This path exploits Svelte's reactivity system to circumvent security measures.
    *   Attackers can manipulate application state in a way that bypasses validation or authorization logic implemented within Svelte components. For example, by carefully crafting input or manipulating data sources, an attacker might be able to change the state such that a security check evaluates to true even though the underlying conditions for access are not met. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources or actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Specific Vulnerabilities (If Applicable) [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL NODE] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__specific_vulnerabilities__if_applicable___high-risk_path___criti_580bb635.md)

This path focuses on vulnerabilities that arise when using Server-Side Rendering with Svelte. SSR involves rendering components on the server and sending the initial HTML to the client.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in SSR Context [HIGH-RISK PATH] [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_ssr_context__high-risk_path___critical_.md)

A primary risk with SSR is the potential for injecting malicious scripts that are rendered on the server and become part of the initial HTML sent to the client. If user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being included in the server-rendered HTML, an attacker can inject malicious scripts that will execute in the user's browser when the page loads. This is a particularly dangerous form of XSS because it occurs before any client-side JavaScript has executed, making it harder to mitigate.
