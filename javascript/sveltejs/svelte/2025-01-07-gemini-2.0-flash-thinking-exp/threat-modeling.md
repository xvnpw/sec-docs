# Threat Model Analysis for sveltejs/svelte

## Threat: [Compiler Bugs Leading to Unexpected Code Generation](./threats/compiler_bugs_leading_to_unexpected_code_generation.md)

*   **Description:** A bug in the Svelte compiler itself could result in the generation of insecure or unintended JavaScript code in the final application bundle. This could introduce vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or logic flaws that attackers could exploit.
*   **Impact:** Introduction of security vulnerabilities in the application, potentially leading to XSS, data breaches, or unauthorized actions.
*   **Affected Svelte Component:** Svelte Compiler.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated with the latest stable version of Svelte, which includes bug fixes.
    *   Follow Svelte's release notes and security advisories.
    *   Report any suspected compiler bugs to the Svelte team.
    *   Implement thorough testing, including security testing, of the built application.

## Threat: [Improper Sanitization of Props Leading to XSS](./threats/improper_sanitization_of_props_leading_to_xss.md)

*   **Description:** When passing data as props between Svelte components, inadequate sanitization of user-provided data could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. If a component directly renders unsanitized data received as a prop, an attacker could inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or performing actions on the user's behalf.
*   **Affected Svelte Component:** Component Props, Template Syntax (specifically rendering expressions).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize user-provided data before rendering it in components.
    *   Utilize Svelte's built-in escaping mechanisms.
    *   Be particularly cautious when rendering HTML directly using `{@html}`; sanitize the HTML thoroughly before rendering.
    *   Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
