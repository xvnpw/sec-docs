# Attack Surface Analysis for sveltejs/svelte

## Attack Surface: [1. Unsafe `@html` Directive Usage](./attack_surfaces/1__unsafe__@html__directive_usage.md)

*   **Description:**  Rendering raw, unsanitized HTML using the `@html` directive in Svelte templates. This bypasses Svelte's built-in XSS protection and can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **Svelte Contribution:** The `@html` directive is a specific Svelte feature that, when misused, directly introduces this attack surface. Svelte provides it for specific use cases, but it requires careful handling by developers.
*   **Example:**
    ```svelte
    <script>
        export let userInputHTML; // User-controlled HTML content
    </script>

    {@html userInputHTML} <!-- Directly rendering unsanitized HTML -->
    ```
    If `userInputHTML` contains malicious JavaScript (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`), it will execute in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, website defacement, and other malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strongly avoid using `@html` whenever possible.**  Rely on Svelte's default templating and data binding, which automatically escape content and prevent XSS.
    *   **If `@html` is absolutely necessary, sanitize HTML content rigorously *before* rendering.** Use a trusted HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify) to remove potentially malicious code. Sanitize on the server-side or as close to the data source as possible.
    *   **Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP).**  CSP can limit the impact of XSS vulnerabilities by restricting the capabilities of injected scripts, even if `@html` is misused.

## Attack Surface: [2. Reactivity Misuse Leading to Critical State Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/2__reactivity_misuse_leading_to_critical_state_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Flaws in component logic arising from a misunderstanding or misuse of Svelte's reactivity system, resulting in critical security issues like unintended data exposure or application control bypass.
*   **Svelte Contribution:** Svelte's reactivity is a core feature.  While powerful, incorrect implementation of reactive statements and dependencies can create unexpected and potentially exploitable application states.
*   **Example:**
    ```svelte
    <script>
        let isAdmin = false;
        export let userRole; // User role from API

        $: isAdmin = userRole === 'admin'; // Reactivity to determine admin status

        // Vulnerability: Incorrect logic - isAdmin can be manipulated client-side
        function makeAdmin() {
            isAdmin = true; // Client-side manipulation of reactive variable
            // ... potentially bypasses server-side checks based on isAdmin ...
        }
    </script>

    {#if isAdmin}
        <button on:click={makeAdmin}>Become Admin (Vulnerable)</button>
        <p>Admin Panel Access Granted</p>
        <!-- ... Admin Panel Functionality ... -->
    {/if}
    ```
    In this flawed example, client-side code directly manipulates a reactive variable (`isAdmin`), potentially bypassing intended server-side authorization checks that might rely on this client-side state.
*   **Impact:**  Privilege Escalation, Authorization Bypass, Access Control Vulnerabilities. Attackers could gain unauthorized access to sensitive features or data by manipulating client-side reactive state.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical** (depending on the severity of the bypassed functionality and the sensitivity of the data accessible).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Deeply understand Svelte's reactivity and state management.**  Ensure reactive logic accurately reflects intended application behavior and security requirements.
    *   **Avoid relying on client-side reactive state for critical security decisions.**  Authorization and access control should primarily be enforced on the server-side. Client-side state should be used for UI reactivity, not security.
    *   **Thoroughly test and review reactive logic.**  Pay close attention to how reactive variables are updated and used, especially in security-sensitive parts of the application.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege.** Minimize the amount of sensitive data and functionality exposed on the client-side.
