# Threat Model Analysis for sveltejs/svelte

## Threat: [Compiler Bug - XSS Vulnerability](./threats/compiler_bug_-_xss_vulnerability.md)

*   **Threat:** Compiler Bug - XSS Vulnerability
*   **Description:** A bug within the Svelte compiler results in the generation of vulnerable JavaScript code that incorrectly handles user input within Svelte templates. This leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through user-controlled input, which is then executed in a victim's browser due to the compiler's flawed output.
*   **Impact:** High. Successful XSS attacks can lead to account takeover, data theft, malware distribution, website defacement, and complete compromise of the user's session and data within the application.
*   **Affected Svelte Component:** Svelte Compiler, Generated JavaScript Code, Templates.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Prioritize Svelte Compiler Updates:** Immediately update the Svelte compiler to the latest version as soon as security patches are released. Monitor Svelte release notes and security advisories.
    *   **Report Suspected Compiler Issues:** If you encounter unusual behavior or suspect a compiler bug might be generating insecure code, report it to the Svelte team with detailed reproduction steps.
    *   **Implement Strict Content Security Policy (CSP):** Deploy a robust Content Security Policy to significantly limit the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if they bypass initial defenses. CSP can prevent execution of inline scripts and restrict script sources.
    *   **Conduct Security Code Reviews:** Focus code reviews on areas where user input is rendered, and examine the generated JavaScript to verify correct escaping and handling of dynamic content.

## Threat: [Compiler Dependency Vulnerability - Code Injection into Generated Code](./threats/compiler_dependency_vulnerability_-_code_injection_into_generated_code.md)

*   **Threat:** Compiler Dependency Vulnerability - Code Injection into Generated Code
*   **Description:** A security vulnerability in a dependency of the Svelte compiler (e.g., a parser, code generator, or other build tool dependency) is exploited. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code during the Svelte compilation process. The injected code becomes part of the final JavaScript bundle generated by Svelte, effectively embedding malicious functionality directly into the application.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Code injection at the compilation stage is a severe supply chain risk. It can lead to widespread compromise of the application and all its users. Attackers can gain full control over the application's behavior and user data from the moment the compromised code is deployed.
*   **Affected Svelte Component:** Svelte Compiler, Compiler Dependencies, Build Process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Comprehensive Dependency Scanning and Management:** Implement automated dependency scanning for all Svelte project dependencies, including those of the compiler itself. Use tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, or dedicated supply chain security scanners.
    *   **Timely Dependency Updates and Patching:**  Prioritize updating compiler dependencies and all project dependencies to patched versions as soon as vulnerabilities are disclosed and fixes are available.
    *   **Secure and Isolated Build Environment:** Ensure the build environment is hardened and isolated to prevent unauthorized access and manipulation. Implement controls to verify the integrity of build tools and dependencies.
    *   **Supply Chain Security Best Practices:** Adopt robust supply chain security practices, including using dependency lock files to ensure consistent builds, verifying package integrity using checksums, and potentially using private registries for dependencies.

## Threat: [Incorrect `@html` Directive Usage Leading to Unsanitized Output - XSS](./threats/incorrect__@html__directive_usage_leading_to_unsanitized_output_-_xss.md)

*   **Threat:** Incorrect `@html` Directive Usage Leading to Unsanitized Output - XSS
*   **Description:** Developers incorrectly use the `@html` directive in Svelte templates to render user-provided or externally sourced HTML content without proper sanitization. This bypasses Svelte's automatic XSS protection and directly injects potentially malicious HTML and JavaScript into the DOM. Attackers can exploit this to inject arbitrary scripts that execute in users' browsers.
*   **Impact:** High. This is a classic XSS vulnerability with the same severe consequences: account hijacking, data theft, malware propagation, and website manipulation.
*   **Affected Svelte Component:** Svelte Templates, `@html` directive.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strictly Avoid `@html` with Untrusted Content:**  Never use the `@html` directive to render any content that originates from user input or external, untrusted sources without rigorous sanitization.
    *   **Mandatory Sanitization for `@html` Usage:** If `@html` must be used with potentially unsafe content, enforce mandatory sanitization using a well-vetted and actively maintained HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) *before* rendering with `@html`. Sanitize on the server-side whenever possible.
    *   **Code Review and Developer Training on `@html` Security:** Conduct thorough code reviews specifically looking for `@html` directive usage. Train developers on the severe security risks of misusing `@html` and emphasize secure alternatives.
    *   **Consider Alternatives to `@html`:** Explore alternative Svelte features and approaches to achieve the desired rendering without resorting to `@html` for dynamic content, if possible.

## Threat: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection Vulnerabilities in SvelteKit](./threats/server-side_rendering__ssr__injection_vulnerabilities_in_sveltekit.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection Vulnerabilities in SvelteKit
*   **Description:** When utilizing SvelteKit for Server-Side Rendering, vulnerabilities can arise from improper handling of user input or external data within server-side `load` functions or other SSR logic. If data is directly embedded into the HTML rendered on the server without adequate escaping or sanitization, it can lead to Server-Side Injection vulnerabilities, including Server-Side XSS and potentially other injection types.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical. Server-Side XSS is often more critical than client-side XSS. It can expose server-side data, internal application logic, and in some cases, even facilitate server-side attacks or information disclosure.
*   **Affected Svelte Component:** SvelteKit Server-Side Rendering, `load` functions, Server-side code, SvelteKit routing.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Robust Input Sanitization and Validation in SSR Logic:**  Implement strict input sanitization and validation for all user-provided data and external data sources processed within SvelteKit `load` functions and server-side rendering code. Sanitize and validate *before* using the data in SSR.
    *   **Secure Templating Practices for SSR:** Ensure that templating mechanisms used during SSR (even if implicitly through Svelte templates) automatically and correctly escape user input to prevent injection vulnerabilities. Verify the SSR output is properly encoded.
    *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** Apply context-aware output encoding based on where data is being rendered in the SSR output (HTML, attributes, JavaScript, etc.) to prevent misinterpretation of data as code.
    *   **Regular Security Audits Focused on SSR:** Conduct dedicated security audits specifically targeting the Server-Side Rendering implementation in SvelteKit applications. Pay close attention to data flow and handling within `load` functions and SSR components.
