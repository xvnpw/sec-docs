# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Svelte project aims to provide a modern, efficient, and developer-friendly approach to building web applications. It differentiates itself by being a compiler that transforms component code into highly optimized vanilla JavaScript, leading to better runtime performance and a smaller bundle size compared to traditional JavaScript frameworks.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a performant and efficient frontend framework for web developers.
- Enhance developer experience by offering a concise and intuitive syntax.
- Foster a strong and active community around the framework.
- Ensure long-term stability and maintainability of the framework.
- Promote the adoption of Svelte for building various types of web applications.

Most Important Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the Svelte compiler or runtime could negatively impact applications built with Svelte, leading to potential data breaches or service disruptions.
- Supply chain attacks targeting Svelte's dependencies or build process could compromise the integrity of the framework and applications using it.
- Performance regressions or architectural flaws could undermine the core value proposition of Svelte.
- Lack of community support or insufficient documentation could hinder adoption and developer satisfaction.
- Changes in web standards or browser technologies could require significant rework and impact compatibility.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open Source Development - The project is publicly accessible on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny of the codebase. Implemented: GitHub repository.
- security control: Dependency Management - Utilizes `npm` for managing dependencies, which includes mechanisms for package integrity checks. Implemented: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, npm registry.
- security control: GitHub Security Features - Leverages GitHub's built-in security features such as vulnerability scanning for dependencies. Implemented: GitHub Dependabot.
- security control: Community Contributions and Review - Pull requests are reviewed by maintainers before merging, providing a degree of code review. Implemented: GitHub Pull Request process.

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on Third-Party Dependencies - The project depends on external libraries and tools, which could introduce vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Open Source Vulnerability Disclosure - Vulnerabilities might be publicly disclosed before a patch is available, potentially leading to exploitation.
- accepted risk: Community-Driven Security - Security relies on the vigilance and expertise of the open-source community, which can vary.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated static application security testing (SAST) and dependency scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
- security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses in the codebase and architecture.
- security control: Security Champions - Designate security champions within the core development team to promote security awareness and best practices.
- security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy to guide security researchers and users on how to report security issues responsibly.
- security control: Fuzzing - Implement fuzzing techniques to automatically test the compiler and runtime for unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the Svelte framework itself. Authentication is typically handled by applications built using Svelte. Svelte should provide guidance and best practices for secure authentication in its documentation and examples.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to the Svelte framework itself. Authorization is typically handled by applications built using Svelte. Svelte should provide guidance and best practices for secure authorization in its documentation and examples.
- Input Validation: The Svelte compiler needs to perform input validation on component code to prevent injection vulnerabilities and ensure code integrity. The runtime needs to handle user inputs in applications built with Svelte securely, following general web security best practices.
- Cryptography: While Svelte itself might not directly implement cryptographic functions, it should not hinder or discourage the use of strong cryptography in applications built with Svelte. If Svelte provides any utility functions related to cryptography (e.g., in examples), they must adhere to security best practices.

## BUILD

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Developer] --> B{Code Changes};
    B -- Commit & Push --> C[GitHub Repository];
    C --> D[GitHub Actions Workflow];
    D --> E{Build Process};
    E -- "npm install" --> F[Dependency Download];
    E -- "Svelte Compile" --> G[Compiled Code];
    E -- "Tests & Linters" --> H{Security Checks};

    H -- Fail --> J[Build Failure & Notifications];
    I --> K[Artifact Storage (e.g., npm, Cloud Storage)];
    K --> L[Deployment Pipeline];
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer makes code changes and commits them to the GitHub repository.
2. GitHub Actions workflow is triggered by code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
3. The workflow initiates the build process, which typically includes:
    - Downloading dependencies using `npm install` or similar package manager commands.
    - Compiling Svelte components using the Svelte compiler.
    - Running tests (unit tests, integration tests) to ensure code quality and functionality.
    - Executing linters and static analysis tools to identify code style issues and potential vulnerabilities.
    - Performing security checks, such as dependency scanning and SAST.
4. If all checks pass, build artifacts (compiled JavaScript, CSS, assets) are generated.
5. Build artifacts are stored in artifact storage, such as npm registry for libraries or cloud storage for applications.
6. The deployment pipeline then picks up the build artifacts for deployment to target environments.
7. If any checks fail during the build process, the build fails, and notifications are sent to developers.
