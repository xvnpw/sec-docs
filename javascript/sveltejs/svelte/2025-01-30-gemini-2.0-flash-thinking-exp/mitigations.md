# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for sveltejs/svelte

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Sanitization of User Inputs within Svelte Templates](./mitigation_strategies/strict_sanitization_of_user_inputs_within_svelte_templates.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Identify all Svelte components that render user-provided data (from props, stores, or directly from user interactions).
    2.  For text content, rely on Svelte's default text interpolation (`{variable}`) which automatically escapes HTML entities, mitigating basic XSS.
    3.  When rendering user-provided HTML, especially when using the `{@html}` directive, implement robust sanitization *before* passing the HTML string to `{@html}`.
        *   Utilize a dedicated HTML sanitization library within your Svelte component (e.g., DOMPurify).
        *   Sanitize the HTML string in a Svelte action or a utility function before it reaches the `{@html}` directive.
    4.  Avoid directly using user input to construct HTML strings within Svelte templates that are then rendered using `{@html}` without sanitization.
    5.  Test sanitization within your Svelte components with various malicious HTML inputs to ensure effective XSS prevention in the Svelte rendering context.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High
        *   HTML Injection - Severity: Medium

    *   **Impact:**
        *   XSS: High - Effectively prevents XSS attacks originating from unsanitized user input rendered within Svelte templates, especially when using `{@html}`.
        *   HTML Injection: High - Prevents malicious HTML from being injected and rendered through Svelte's templating mechanisms.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Default HTML escaping with text interpolation (`{variable}`) is inherently implemented by Svelte.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Consistent and robust HTML sanitization using a dedicated library, particularly for scenarios involving `{@html}` and rich text handling within Svelte components.
        *   Clear guidelines and component-level implementation for sanitizing user-provided HTML before rendering in Svelte.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize and Secure Usage of Svelte's `{@html}` Directive](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_and_secure_usage_of_svelte's__{@html}__directive.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  Conduct a thorough review of your Svelte codebase to identify all instances where the `{@html}` directive is used.
    2.  Evaluate each usage of `{@html}` and determine if it is absolutely necessary. Explore alternative Svelte template structures or component-based approaches to achieve the desired rendering without relying on raw HTML.
    3.  If `{@html}` is deemed essential:
        *   Strictly control the source of the HTML content passed to `{@html}`. Ideally, generate this HTML server-side or within trusted application logic, minimizing user influence.
        *   Implement mandatory and rigorous sanitization of the HTML string *immediately before* it is used with `{@html}` within the Svelte component.
        *   Document the justification for using `{@html}` in each specific Svelte component and the corresponding sanitization measures applied directly within that component or its associated utilities.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High
        *   HTML Injection - Severity: Medium

    *   **Impact:**
        *   XSS: High - Significantly reduces the attack surface for XSS vulnerabilities by minimizing the use of the inherently riskier `{@html}` directive in Svelte components.
        *   HTML Injection: High - Prevents malicious HTML injection specifically through the `{@html}` directive in Svelte templates.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Potentially limited and ad-hoc usage of `{@html}` in certain Svelte components where rich text or specific HTML structures are required.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   A project-wide policy to minimize `{@html}` usage in Svelte components.
        *   Standardized and enforced sanitization practices specifically for HTML content used with `{@html}` within Svelte components.
        *   Clear documentation and component-level justification for each instance of `{@html}` usage in the Svelte application.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Data Handling in Svelte Applications](./mitigation_strategies/secure_server-side_rendering__ssr__data_handling_in_svelte_applications.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  When using SvelteKit or a custom SSR setup, identify all data fetching and processing steps that occur on the server during the rendering phase of your Svelte application.
    2.  Implement robust sanitization and validation of data fetched on the server *before* it is passed to Svelte components for rendering. This is crucial as server-rendered HTML is directly sent to the client.
    3.  Utilize secure data access patterns in your server-side Svelte code. Employ parameterized queries or ORMs to prevent injection vulnerabilities when interacting with databases from your Svelte SSR logic.
    4.  When fetching data from external APIs during SSR, validate API responses and sanitize any data that will be rendered in the server-generated HTML by Svelte components.
    5.  Ensure secure handling of server-side secrets and API keys within your Svelte SSR environment. Avoid hardcoding secrets in Svelte components or server-side code. Use environment variables or secure secret management solutions accessible in your SSR environment.

    *   **Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Server-Side Injection Vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL Injection, Template Injection) in SSR context - Severity: High
        *   Information Disclosure through SSR errors or insecure data handling - Severity: Medium
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities originating from server-rendered content by Svelte - Severity: High

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Server-Side Injection Vulnerabilities: High - Prevents attackers from exploiting server-side injection points within the SSR process of your Svelte application.
        *   Information Disclosure: Medium - Reduces the risk of exposing sensitive server-side data through errors or insecure SSR data handling in Svelte.
        *   XSS: High - Prevents XSS vulnerabilities that could be introduced through unsanitized data rendered by Svelte components during SSR.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Basic data fetching for SSR might be implemented in SvelteKit routes or custom SSR setup.
        *   Parameterized queries might be used in some server-side database interactions within the SSR context.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Systematic sanitization and validation of all data used in Svelte SSR rendering.
        *   Comprehensive security measures against server-side injection vulnerabilities specifically within the SSR logic of the Svelte application.
        *   Secure secret management practices within the Svelte SSR environment to protect sensitive credentials used in server-side data fetching.
