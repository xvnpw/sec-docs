# Threat Model Analysis for sveltejs/svelte

## Threat: [Unintentional Data Exposure via Reactivity](./threats/unintentional_data_exposure_via_reactivity.md)

*   **Threat:** Unintentional Data Exposure via Reactivity

    *   **Description:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data that was unintentionally made reactive within a Svelte component. They might achieve this by analyzing the compiled JavaScript, observing network traffic, or exploiting other vulnerabilities to trigger unexpected component re-renders that briefly expose the data in the DOM or console.  Svelte's reactivity system, if not used carefully, makes this easier than in some other frameworks.
    *   **Impact:** Leakage of sensitive information such as API keys, user tokens, PII, or internal application state. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or further attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any Svelte component using reactive variables (`$:`) or stores, especially writable stores. Deeply nested components and components using complex reactivity logic are at higher risk. This is a direct consequence of how Svelte's reactivity is implemented.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Minimize Reactive Scope:** Use `const` or `let` without reactive assignments (`$:`) for data that doesn't need to trigger UI updates.
        *   **Careful Store Usage:** Avoid storing sensitive data in writable stores. Use read-only or derived stores with careful filtering.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Thoroughly review code for unintentional reactive dependencies.
        *   **Avoid Debugging in Production:** Never expose debugging information (especially reactive variables) in production.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate all data coming from external sources before assigning it to reactive variables.

## Threat: [Client-Side Only Security Checks in `onMount`/`onDestroy`](./threats/client-side_only_security_checks_in__onmount__ondestroy_.md)

*   **Threat:** Client-Side Only Security Checks in `onMount`/`onDestroy`

    *   **Description:** An attacker could bypass security checks that are implemented *only* within `onMount` or `onDestroy` lifecycle hooks. Since these hooks don't run during server-side rendering (SSR), an attacker could request the server-rendered version of a page and potentially access sensitive content or perform unauthorized actions. This is a direct consequence of Svelte's SSR behavior and lifecycle hook implementation.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, bypassing of authentication or authorization mechanisms, potential for data manipulation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any Svelte component that relies solely on `onMount` or `onDestroy` for security-critical logic, especially in applications using SSR (SvelteKit). This is specific to how Svelte handles component lifecycle and SSR.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **SSR-Safe Logic:** Implement security checks both on the server (e.g., using SvelteKit's `load` functions in `+page.server.js`) and the client.
        *   **Conditional Rendering:** Use conditional rendering (`{#if}`) to prevent sensitive content from being rendered on the server if security checks haven't passed.
        *   **Hydration Awareness:** Ensure client-side state is properly initialized after SSR, including security-related state.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `@html`](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via__@html_.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `@html`

    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into content that is rendered using Svelte's `@html` directive. This typically happens when the HTML string comes from an untrusted source. The injected script would then execute in the context of the user's browser. This threat is *directly* tied to the `@html` directive, a Svelte-specific feature.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of user accounts, data theft, session hijacking, website defacement, potential for phishing attacks.
    *   **Affected Component:** Any Svelte component that uses the `@html` directive with untrusted or unsanitized input. This is a direct vulnerability introduced by the `@html` feature.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid `@html` if Possible:** Use Svelte's built-in templating features whenever possible.
        *   **Sanitize HTML:** If `@html` is necessary, *always* use a robust HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify) to remove malicious code *before* rendering.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS, even if sanitization fails.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack on Svelte Compiler/Build Process](./threats/supply_chain_attack_on_svelte_compilerbuild_process.md)

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack on Svelte Compiler/Build Process

    *   **Description:** A highly sophisticated attacker could compromise the Svelte compiler, build tools, or the npm registry itself, injecting malicious code that would be included in *all* Svelte applications built using the compromised tools. This directly targets the Svelte compiler and build process.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of Svelte applications, potentially affecting a large number of users. The attacker could gain control of affected applications.
    *   **Affected Component:** All Svelte applications built with the compromised compiler or build tools. This is a direct attack on the Svelte infrastructure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (but extremely low probability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rely on Community Vigilance:** The Svelte community is active.
        *   **Monitor Official Channels:** Stay informed about security advisories from the Svelte team.
        *   **(Extreme) Verify Compiler Integrity:** In extremely high-security environments, it might be necessary to verify the integrity of the compiler and build tools.
        *   **Use a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM):** Maintain and track an SBOM.
