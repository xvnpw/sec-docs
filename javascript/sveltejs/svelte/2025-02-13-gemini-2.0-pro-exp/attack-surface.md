# Attack Surface Analysis for sveltejs/svelte

## Attack Surface: [1. `{@html ...}` Misuse (Svelte-Specific XSS)](./attack_surfaces/1___{@html____}__misuse__svelte-specific_xss_.md)

*   **Description:**  Rendering unsanitized user input directly as HTML using Svelte's `{@html ...}` tag. This is the most direct and dangerous Svelte-specific vulnerability.  It's *not* a general XSS vulnerability; it's specific to how Svelte handles raw HTML.
*   **How Svelte Contributes:** Svelte provides the `{@html ...}` tag for rendering raw HTML, which *intentionally* bypasses Svelte's built-in escaping mechanisms. This is a core Svelte feature that, if misused, creates a direct XSS vulnerability.
*   **Example:**
    ```svelte
    <script>
      let userInput = "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>";
    </script>

    {@html userInput}
    ```
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, defacement, and other severe consequences.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid `{@html ...}` whenever possible.** Use Svelte's standard templating for dynamic content. This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **If `{@html ...}` is absolutely unavoidable, *always* sanitize the input using a robust HTML sanitization library like DOMPurify.**  This is *not* optional. Example:
        ```javascript
        import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

        let sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
        ```
    *   **Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the impact of any successful XSS.** A CSP can prevent the execution of inline scripts and restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded. This is a defense-in-depth measure.
    *   **Educate developers on the dangers of `{@html}` and the absolute necessity of sanitization.** This is a crucial preventative measure.

## Attack Surface: [2.  Unsafe `bind:` Directives (Svelte-Facilitated XSS/Injection)](./attack_surfaces/2___unsafe__bind__directives__svelte-facilitated_xssinjection_.md)

*   **Description:**  Using `bind:` directives with potentially dangerous HTML attributes (e.g., `innerHTML`, `href`, `src` on `<a>` or `<iframe>` tags) and unsanitized user input. While not *exclusive* to Svelte, Svelte's `bind:` makes this easier to do incorrectly.
*   **How Svelte Contributes:** Svelte's `bind:` directives provide convenient two-way data binding. This convenience can lead developers to directly bind user input to sensitive attributes without proper sanitization, creating an injection vulnerability. Svelte *facilitates* this vulnerability through its design.
*   **Example:**
    ```svelte
    <script>
      let userLink = "javascript:alert('XSS')";
    </script>

    <a bind:href={userLink}>Click me</a>
    ```
*   **Impact:**  Similar to `{@html ...}` misuse, this can lead to XSS or other injection attacks. The attack surface is generally smaller than `{@html}`, but still significant.
*   **Risk Severity:**  **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Avoid binding directly to dangerous attributes.** Prefer safer alternatives or intermediate variables.
    *   **Sanitize the bound value *before* it's applied.** Use a URL sanitization library for `href` attributes, and DOMPurify or a similar library for `innerHTML` and `outerHTML`.  The sanitization must happen *before* the value is used in the binding.
    *   **Prefer Svelte's built-in components (e.g., `<input>`, `<textarea>`) for user input.** These components often have some built-in protections (though they are not a substitute for proper sanitization).
    *   **Use input validation to restrict the types of values allowed in bound variables.** This can help prevent unexpected or malicious input from being used.

## Attack Surface: [3.  Unintentional Data Exposure via Stores (Svelte-Specific Data Leak)](./attack_surfaces/3___unintentional_data_exposure_via_stores__svelte-specific_data_leak_.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data stored in Svelte stores being exposed to unauthorized components or directly to the client's JavaScript console. This is a risk specific to how Svelte manages shared state.
*   **How Svelte Contributes:** Svelte's stores are a core feature for managing shared state.  The framework itself doesn't inherently protect the data within stores; it's the developer's responsibility to manage access and scope appropriately.  The ease of creating and using stores can lead to unintentional exposure if not handled carefully.
*   **Example:** A store containing user authentication tokens being accessible to all components, even those that don't need access. Or, a store being directly logged to the console for debugging purposes in a production environment.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data breaches, or privacy violations. The severity depends directly on the sensitivity of the exposed data.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** (depending on the sensitivity of the data. Could be Critical if highly sensitive data is exposed.)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Carefully scope stores.** Use derived stores or custom stores with restricted access methods (getters/setters) to control which components can read or modify the store's data.
    *   **Avoid storing sensitive data directly in stores if possible.** If unavoidable, encrypt or otherwise protect the data *before* it's placed in the store.
    *   **Sanitize user input *before* it is used to update a store.** This prevents injection attacks that could modify the store's contents.
    *   **Use read-only stores where appropriate** to prevent unintended modification of the store's data.
    *   **Avoid exposing the entire store object directly to the template; subscribe to specific properties instead.** This limits the potential for accidental exposure.
    *   **Remove any debugging code (e.g., `console.log(store)`) before deploying to production.** This is a critical step to prevent accidental data leaks.
