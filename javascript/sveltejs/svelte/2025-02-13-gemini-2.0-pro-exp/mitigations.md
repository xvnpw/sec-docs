## Mitigation Strategy: [{@html ...} Sanitization with DOMPurify](./mitigation_strategies/{@html____}_sanitization_with_dompurify.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy:**  `{@html ...}` Sanitization with DOMPurify

*	**Description:**
	1.	**Identify all instances of `{@html ...}`:**  Search the entire codebase (components, `.svelte` files) for the `{@html ...}` directive.  Document each location. This is *crucial* because `{@html ...}` is the primary Svelte-specific vector for XSS.
	2.	**Install DOMPurify:**  Add `DOMPurify` as a project dependency: `npm install dompurify` or `yarn add dompurify`.
	3.	**Import DOMPurify:** In each component using `{@html ...}`, import the library: `import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';`
	4.	**Sanitize Input:** Before rendering any content with `{@html ...}`, pass the untrusted HTML string through `DOMPurify.sanitize()`.  Example:
		```javascript
		let unsafeHTML = ...; // From user input, API, etc.
		let safeHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(unsafeHTML, {
			ALLOWED_TAGS: ['b', 'i', 'em', 'strong', 'a'], // Example: Allow only these tags
			ALLOWED_ATTR: ['href'] // Example: Allow only 'href' attribute for <a> tags
		});
		```
		*   **Crucially, configure `ALLOWED_TAGS` and `ALLOWED_ATTR` as restrictively as possible.**  Only allow the absolute minimum necessary tags and attributes.  A whitelist approach is essential.
	5.	**Replace `{@html unsafeHTML}` with `{@html safeHTML}`:**  Use the sanitized output in the template.
	6.	**Regularly Update DOMPurify:**  Keep the `dompurify` package updated to the latest version.
	7.	**Test Thoroughly:** Test with various inputs, including malicious ones.

*	**Threats Mitigated:**
	*	**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: **Critical**) - This is the *primary* threat.  `{@html ...}` without sanitization is a direct XSS vulnerability.
	*	**HTML Injection:** (Severity: **High**) - Prevents injection of unwanted HTML elements.
	*	**Malware Distribution (via XSS):** (Severity: **Critical**) - Indirectly mitigates this by preventing the XSS vector.

*	**Impact:**
	*	**XSS:** Risk reduction: **Very High** (Effectively eliminates XSS risk *from `{@html ...}` if implemented correctly).
	*	**HTML Injection:** Risk reduction: **High**
	*	**Malware Distribution:** Risk reduction: **High**

*	**Currently Implemented:**
	*	`/src/components/Comment.svelte`: Implemented with a basic `ALLOWED_TAGS` configuration.
	*	`/src/components/BlogPost.svelte`: Partially implemented; sanitizes blog post content but not author bio.

*	**Missing Implementation:**
	*	`/src/components/UserProfile.svelte`:  Uses `{@html ...}` to render user-provided "About Me" section *without any sanitization*.  **Critical vulnerability.**
	*	`/src/components/ForumPost.svelte`:  Missing sanitization for user-generated forum posts. **Critical vulnerability.**
	*	No global configuration for DOMPurify; inconsistencies are possible.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Component-Level Input Validation and Sanitization (Focus on `bind:` and props)](./mitigation_strategies/component-level_input_validation_and_sanitization__focus_on__bind__and_props_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy:** Component-Level Input Validation and Sanitization (Focus on `bind:` and props)

*	**Description:**
	1.	**Identify Input Points:** Within each Svelte component, identify all `props` and variables used with the `bind:` directive. These are the entry points for external data.
	2.	**Define Validation Rules:** For each prop and bound variable, define *strict* validation rules.  Consider data type, format, length, and allowed values.
	3.	**Implement Validation:** *Within the component*, before using the prop or bound variable, validate it.  Use a validation library or custom functions.  Handle validation errors appropriately (display messages, prevent further action).
	4.	**Sanitize (Context-Specific):** If the input, *even after validation*, might be used in a sensitive context (e.g., within `{@html ...}`, as part of a URL, etc.), sanitize it appropriately.  This is *crucial* if the data will be rendered as HTML.
	5.  **Test Thoroughly:** Test with valid, invalid, and edge-case inputs.

*	**Threats Mitigated:**
	*	**Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: **High**) - Reduces XSS risk by validating and sanitizing data *before* it's used in potentially vulnerable Svelte constructs (especially `{@html ...}`, but also potentially in attributes or other template expressions).
	*	**Data Corruption:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Prevents invalid data from being processed by the component.
	*	**Injection Attacks (Indirectly):** (Severity: **Medium to High**) - While not directly Svelte-specific, proper input handling within components is a crucial part of preventing various injection attacks.

*	**Impact:**
	*	**XSS:** Risk reduction: **Medium to High** (Provides defense-in-depth; essential when combined with `{@html ...}` sanitization).
	*	**Data Corruption:** Risk reduction: **High**
	*	**Injection Attacks:** Risk reduction: **Medium to High** (Depends on broader application context).

*	**Currently Implemented:**
	*	`/src/components/LoginForm.svelte`: Basic validation for email and password (checks for emptiness and basic format).
	*	`/src/components/SearchInput.svelte`: Escapes special characters before sending to server (not directly a Svelte issue, but good practice).

*	**Missing Implementation:**
	*	`/src/components/CommentForm.svelte`: No validation or sanitization of the comment text, which is likely bound using `bind:value`. **High vulnerability.**
	*	`/src/components/BlogPostEditor.svelte`: Limited validation; relies on a rich-text editor but doesn't validate the *underlying HTML* that might be used with `{@html ...}` later. **Medium vulnerability.**
	*	No consistent validation approach across components.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Use of `bind:` (Two-Way Binding)](./mitigation_strategies/careful_use_of__bind___two-way_binding_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy:** Careful Use of `bind:` (Two-Way Binding)

* **Description:**
    1. **Identify all `bind:` usages:** Search your Svelte components for all instances of the `bind:` directive.
    2. **Assess Risk:** For each `bind:` usage, determine where the bound data *ultimately ends up*. Is it used in `{@html ...}`? Is it sent to the server? Is it used in other potentially sensitive contexts?
    3. **Validate and Sanitize:** Implement validation and, *if necessary*, sanitization *before* the bound data is used in any risky way. This might involve:
        *   Using a reactive statement (`$: ...`) to validate/sanitize the bound variable whenever it changes.
        *   Using event handlers (e.g., `on:input`) to perform validation/sanitization as the user types.
        *   Validating/sanitizing the data *before* sending it to the server or using it in `{@html ...}`.
    4. **Consider Alternatives:** If the `bind:` directive is used with a complex or untrusted data source, consider if an alternative approach (e.g., using one-way binding and explicit event handlers) would be more secure.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: **High**) - If the bound data is eventually used in `{@html ...}`, `bind:` without proper handling creates an XSS vulnerability.
    *   **Data Tampering:** (Severity: **Medium**) - Ensures that the data bound to the component is valid and safe.

* **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: **Medium to High** (Crucial if the bound data is used with `{@html ...}`).
    *   **Data Tampering:** Risk reduction: **Medium**

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   `/src/components/LoginForm.svelte`: Uses `bind:value` for email and password, with basic validation.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `/src/components/CommentForm.svelte`: Uses `bind:value` for the comment text area *without any validation or sanitization*. **High vulnerability** (especially if comments are later rendered with `{@html ...}`).
    *   `/src/components/UserProfile.svelte`: Potentially uses `bind:` for editable profile fields, without clear validation/sanitization.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Avoid Unnecessary `{@html ...}`](./mitigation_strategies/avoid_unnecessary__{@html____}_.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy:** Avoid Unnecessary `{@html ...}`

* **Description:**
    1. **Review all `{@html ...}` usages:** Examine each instance of `{@html ...}` in your codebase.
    2. **Question Necessity:** For *each* instance, ask: "Is `{@html ...}` absolutely necessary here? Can I achieve the same result using Svelte's built-in templating features (components, loops, conditionals, text interpolation)?"
    3. **Refactor if Possible:** If `{@html ...}` is not strictly necessary, refactor the code to use safer alternatives. This is the *most effective* mitigation strategy.
    4. **Document Rationale:** If `{@html ...}` *is* deemed necessary, document the reason clearly in a code comment. Explain why safer alternatives were not possible. This helps with future code reviews and maintenance.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** (Severity: **Critical**) - Eliminating `{@html ...}` eliminates the *primary* Svelte-specific XSS vector.
    *   **HTML Injection:** (Severity: **High**)

* **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: **Very High** (Potentially eliminates the risk entirely in the refactored areas).
    *   **HTML Injection:** Risk reduction: **Very High**

* **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No formal review of `{@html ...}` usage has been conducted.

* **Missing Implementation:**
    *   A project-wide review and refactoring effort is needed to minimize `{@html ...}` usage. This should be a high priority.
