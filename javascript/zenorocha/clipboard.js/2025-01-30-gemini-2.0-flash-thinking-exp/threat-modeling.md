# Threat Model Analysis for zenorocha/clipboard.js

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure via Clipboard](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_via_clipboard.md)

*   **Description:** If an application uses `clipboard.js` to copy sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys, personal information) to the user's clipboard, an attacker could potentially access this data. Malware or other applications running on the user's system could monitor or retrieve clipboard contents after the user copies the sensitive information using `clipboard.js`.
*   **Impact:** Confidentiality breach leading to unauthorized access to accounts, systems, or personal data; potential for identity theft and data leakage.
*   **Affected Component:** `clipboard.js` core copy functionality.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid copying sensitive data to the clipboard whenever possible. Explore alternative methods for handling sensitive information.
    *   If copying sensitive data is unavoidable, minimize the duration it remains on the clipboard.
    *   Clearly inform users when sensitive data is being copied and educate them about the potential risks associated with clipboard usage.
    *   Sanitize data before copying to the clipboard to prevent accidental exposure of more information than intended.

## Threat: [Manipulation of Copied Content via DOM XSS](./threats/manipulation_of_copied_content_via_dom_xss.md)

*   **Description:** If the web application using `clipboard.js` is vulnerable to DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), an attacker can inject malicious scripts that modify the content intended to be copied by `clipboard.js`. When a user copies data using `clipboard.js` from a compromised part of the DOM and pastes it elsewhere, the manipulated content, including potentially malicious scripts, is transferred.
*   **Impact:** Execution of malicious scripts when pasted into a vulnerable application or context; data corruption if pasted into data fields; potential for further attacks depending on where the manipulated content is pasted and how it is processed.
*   **Affected Component:** `clipboard.js` data retrieval from DOM elements.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding to prevent DOM-based XSS vulnerabilities in the application.
    *   Carefully review the source of data being copied by `clipboard.js` to ensure it originates from a trusted and secure source.
    *   Consider copying specific, controlled data elements programmatically instead of relying on potentially vulnerable or modifiable DOM structures for data extraction by `clipboard.js`.
