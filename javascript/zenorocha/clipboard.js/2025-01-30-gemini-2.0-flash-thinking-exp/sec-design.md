# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, clipboard.js, aims to provide a simple and efficient way for web developers to implement copy-to-clipboard functionality on their websites. The core business priority is to offer a reliable, lightweight, and easy-to-integrate JavaScript library that enhances user experience by enabling quick and seamless copying of text content.

Business goals include:
- Simplifying the implementation of copy-to-clipboard functionality for web developers.
- Improving user interaction and content sharing on websites.
- Maintaining a lightweight and performant library to minimize website performance impact.
- Ensuring broad browser compatibility for maximum usability.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:
- Security vulnerabilities in the library could be exploited by malicious actors, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks or other security breaches on websites using clipboard.js.
- Library incompatibility with certain browsers or devices could negatively impact user experience and adoption.
- Performance issues or bugs in the library could degrade website performance and user satisfaction.
- Lack of maintenance and updates could lead to the library becoming outdated and vulnerable over time.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Source code hosted on GitHub, allowing for community review and contributions. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
- security control: Open-source license (MIT License), promoting transparency and community scrutiny. (Implemented: LICENSE file in repository)
- security control: Use of standard JavaScript development practices. (Implemented: Implicit in the codebase)
- security control: Dependency management using npm. (Implemented: package.json file)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on client-side JavaScript, which is inherently exposed to client-side attacks.
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- accepted risk: Risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities in the library code itself.

Recommended security controls:
- recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST and dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline.
- recommended security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits or penetration testing of the library.
- recommended security control: Follow secure coding practices and guidelines during development.

Security requirements:
- Authentication: Not applicable for a client-side library. Clipboard.js does not handle user authentication.
- Authorization: Not applicable for a client-side library. Clipboard.js does not handle user authorization.
- Input validation:
    - security requirement: Implement input validation to sanitize or encode data being copied to the clipboard to prevent potential injection attacks if the copied content is later used in a different context on the website or elsewhere.
    - security requirement: Validate the target element passed to the ClipboardJS constructor to ensure it is a valid DOM element to prevent unexpected behavior or potential DOM manipulation vulnerabilities.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable for the core functionality of copying text to the clipboard. If future features involve handling sensitive data, appropriate cryptographic measures should be considered.

```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer makes code changes and commits them to the GitHub repository.
2. GitHub Actions CI is triggered upon code changes (e.g., push, pull request).
3. Build Process within GitHub Actions CI includes:
    - npm install: Installs project dependencies.
    - build: Compiles and bundles the JavaScript code.
    - test: Runs automated unit and integration tests.
    - lint: Performs code linting and style checks.
    - SAST (Static Application Security Testing): Runs static security analysis tools to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
4. Build Artifacts are generated, including:
    - clipboard.js (full version)
    - clipboard.min.js (minified version)
5. Build Artifacts are published to the npm Registry, making the library available for developers to install and use.
6. Optionally, build artifacts can be published to a CDN for faster distribution.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the clipboard.js library.
- Ensuring the security of websites that use clipboard.js by preventing vulnerabilities in the library.
- Protecting the reputation and trust associated with the clipboard.js project.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Source code of clipboard.js: Sensitive, as unauthorized access or modification could lead to vulnerabilities being introduced.
- Build artifacts (clipboard.js, clipboard.min.js): Sensitive, as compromised artifacts could be distributed to users, leading to widespread security issues.
- Project infrastructure (GitHub repository, npm registry account): Sensitive, as unauthorized access could compromise the project and its distribution channels.
- User data (text copied to clipboard): Potentially sensitive, depending on the context of the website using clipboard.js. Clipboard.js itself does not store or process this data, but websites using it should be mindful of the sensitivity of the data being copied.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the specific context for this threat modeling exercise? Is it for the library maintainers, website developers using clipboard.js, or end-users?
- Are there any specific security concerns or past incidents related to clipboard.js that are driving this design document?
- What is the risk appetite of the organization or individuals responsible for clipboard.js or websites using it?
- Are there any specific compliance requirements or industry standards that need to be considered?

Assumptions:
- The primary goal is to create a secure and reliable clipboard.js library that minimizes security risks for websites using it and their end-users.
- The target audience for this design document is security-conscious developers and project maintainers who want to understand the security aspects of clipboard.js.
- The library is intended for general-purpose use in web browsers and is not specifically designed for handling highly sensitive or regulated data.
- Standard web security best practices are applicable and should be followed for both the library development and website integration.
