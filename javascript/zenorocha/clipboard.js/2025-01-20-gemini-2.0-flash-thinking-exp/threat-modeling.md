# Threat Model Analysis for zenorocha/clipboard.js

## Threat: [Clipboard Content Injection via Malicious Attributes](./threats/clipboard_content_injection_via_malicious_attributes.md)

**Description:** An attacker could manipulate the HTML attributes used by `clipboard.js` (e.g., `data-clipboard-text`, `data-clipboard-target`) to inject malicious or unexpected content into the user's clipboard. This directly leverages how `clipboard.js` reads these attributes to determine what to copy. When the user pastes this content, it could lead to unintended actions like phishing or XSS.

**Impact:**
* **Phishing Attacks:** Pasting a malicious link could redirect the user to a fake login page.
* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Pasting a malicious script into a vulnerable application could lead to account compromise or further attacks.
* **Data Corruption:** Pasting unexpected data into a form field could corrupt data.

**Affected Component:**
* `src/clipboard.js`: Specifically the logic that reads the `data-clipboard-text` and `data-clipboard-target` attributes.
* The event handlers that trigger the copy action within `clipboard.js`.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Strictly control the generation of `data-clipboard-text` and `data-clipboard-target` attributes:** Ensure these attributes are generated server-side or within a secure frontend context, preventing user-supplied or easily manipulated input.
* **Implement robust input validation and sanitization:** Sanitize any data that influences the content being copied *before* it's used in the `data-clipboard-*` attributes.
* **Use Content Security Policy (CSP):** Configure CSP headers to mitigate the risk of XSS that could be used to manipulate these attributes *before* `clipboard.js` reads them.

## Threat: [Dependency on a Potentially Compromised Library](./threats/dependency_on_a_potentially_compromised_library.md)

**Description:**  If the `clipboard.js` library itself were to be compromised (e.g., through a supply chain attack), malicious code could be injected directly into the functionality of the clipboard interaction. This means the core mechanism of copying could be manipulated to perform malicious actions.

**Impact:**
* **Wide range of potential impacts:** Attackers could gain access to sensitive data handled by the application, inject malicious scripts that execute within the application's context, or manipulate the clipboard content in unexpected ways. This could affect any functionality relying on `clipboard.js`.

**Affected Component:**
* The entire `clipboard.js` library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Use Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Implement SRI for the `clipboard.js` script tag to ensure the integrity of the loaded library and prevent loading of a tampered version.
* **Regularly update `clipboard.js`:** Keep the library updated to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches that address potential vulnerabilities within the library itself.
* **Dependency scanning:** Use tools to scan your project dependencies for known vulnerabilities in `clipboard.js` or its dependencies.
* **Consider alternative solutions:** If security concerns are extremely high, evaluate alternative methods for clipboard interaction that might offer stronger security guarantees.
