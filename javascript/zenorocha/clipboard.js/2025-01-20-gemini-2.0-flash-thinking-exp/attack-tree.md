## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration/Improper Use of Clipboard.js](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfigurationimproper_use_of_clipboard_js.md)

This node is critical because it represents a collection of common developer errors that can lead to significant security vulnerabilities when using clipboard.js. These errors often involve a failure to properly sanitize or control the data being copied or pasted.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1: Inject Malicious Script/Content via `data-clipboard-text`](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1_inject_malicious_scriptcontent_via__data-clipboard-text_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application dynamically sets the `data-clipboard-text` attribute of a clipboard.js trigger based on user-provided input.
    *   This user input is not properly sanitized or encoded before being used as the value for `data-clipboard-text`.
    *   An attacker provides malicious input containing JavaScript code or other harmful content (e.g., an `<img>` tag with an `onerror` attribute).
    *   When a user clicks the clipboard.js trigger, this malicious content is copied to their clipboard.
    *   When the user pastes this content into another part of the application or a different application, the malicious script is executed, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), session hijacking, or other attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2: Inject Malicious Script/Content into Target Element](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2_inject_malicious_scriptcontent_into_target_element.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   The application uses the `data-clipboard-target` attribute to specify an HTML element whose content should be copied.
    *   The content of this target element is influenced by user input or data from an untrusted source.
    *   This content is not properly sanitized or encoded before being rendered in the target element.
    *   An attacker injects malicious script or content into the target element.
    *   When a user clicks the clipboard.js trigger, this malicious content is copied to their clipboard.
    *   When the user pastes this content elsewhere, the malicious script can be executed, leading to similar consequences as the previous attack vector (XSS, etc.).

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3: Inject Malicious Script/Content via Clipboard (Indirect)](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3_inject_malicious_scriptcontent_via_clipboard__indirect_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**
    *   This attack leverages the fact that clipboard.js facilitates copying data that is then pasted into the application.
    *   The attacker does not directly target clipboard.js itself but focuses on manipulating content on an external website or application.
    *   The attacker injects malicious script or content into this external source.
    *   A user, perhaps through social engineering or by simply browsing a compromised site, copies this malicious content from the external source.
    *   The user then pastes this content into the target application.
    *   If the application does not properly sanitize the pasted data, the malicious script is executed, leading to vulnerabilities like XSS. While clipboard.js is involved in the copy action, the vulnerability lies in the application's handling of the pasted data.
