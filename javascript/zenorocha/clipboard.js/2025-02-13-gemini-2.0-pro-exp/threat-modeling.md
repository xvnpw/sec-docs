# Threat Model Analysis for zenorocha/clipboard.js

## Threat: [T1: Clipboard Data Hijacking (Content Replacement)](./threats/t1_clipboard_data_hijacking__content_replacement_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the same origin as the application using clipboard.js (e.g., through a successful XSS attack).  Before the user initiates a paste operation, the attacker's script uses clipboard.js's API to *actively overwrite* the clipboard content with malicious data.  For example, replacing a copied cryptocurrency address with the attacker's address, or replacing a copied command with a malicious one. This relies on the attacker's ability to call clipboard.js functions.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Financial loss (cryptocurrency address swapping).
        *   System compromise (execution of malicious commands).
        *   Data breach (sensitive data replaced with attacker-controlled data).
        *   Loss of user trust.

    *   **Affected clipboard.js Component:**
        *   `ClipboardJS` constructor (instantiation, setting up the mechanism).
        *   Any methods or event handlers that result in writing to the clipboard (implicitly through the library's core functionality).
        *   DOM elements used as triggers, if the attacker can manipulate them to trigger unintended copies.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** Robust XSS prevention (CSP, input sanitization, output encoding, secure frameworks). This is the *most critical* mitigation, as it prevents the attacker from injecting the malicious script in the first place.
        *   **Secondary:** Validate data *before* writing it to the clipboard using clipboard.js. Ensure it conforms to expected formats and doesn't contain malicious patterns.
        *   **Secondary:** Implement a "copy confirmation" mechanism (visual preview) to allow the user to verify the content *before* it's placed on the clipboard.
        *   **Secondary (User Education):** Educate users about the risks of pasting into untrusted applications.

## Threat: [T2: Clipboard Data Leakage (Event Sniffing)](./threats/t2_clipboard_data_leakage__event_sniffing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript into the same origin. The attacker's script *actively* attaches a listener to the clipboard.js `success` event. When the user copies something using clipboard.js, the attacker's listener captures the `e.text` property (the copied data) and exfiltrates it. This relies on the attacker leveraging clipboard.js's event system.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (sensitive information copied by the user is stolen).
        *   Loss of privacy.
        *   Potential for further attacks based on the stolen data.

    *   **Affected clipboard.js Component:**
        *   `.on('success', ...)` event handler. Specifically, the attacker exploits the `e.text` property of the event object provided by clipboard.js.

    *   **Risk Severity:** High

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** Robust XSS prevention (CSP, input sanitization, output encoding, secure frameworks).
        *   **Secondary:** Avoid using the `e.text` property within the `success` event handler if it's not absolutely necessary. If you only need to know *that* something was copied, but not *what*, don't access the text. This limits the attacker's ability to exploit the event.
        *   **Secondary:** Audit all code that uses clipboard.js event listeners to ensure they are legitimate and do not leak sensitive data.

## Threat: [T4: Security Mechanism Bypass (Clipboard as a Vector) - *Modified for Direct Involvement*](./threats/t4_security_mechanism_bypass__clipboard_as_a_vector__-_modified_for_direct_involvement.md)

*   **Description:** The application is *designed* to use clipboard.js for a security-related purpose (e.g., copying a one-time token). An attacker, through injected JavaScript, leverages clipboard.js's API to intercept and modify the clipboard content *before* it's used by the application's security logic.  The key difference here is that clipboard.js is *intended* to be part of the security flow, making its misuse a direct threat.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Compromise of the security mechanism (e.g., unauthorized access, account takeover).
        *   Severity depends on the specific security mechanism.

    *   **Affected clipboard.js Component:**
        *   Any component of clipboard.js that writes to the clipboard, as the attacker is actively manipulating the library's intended functionality.

    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical (if the bypassed mechanism is critical) or High (if less critical)

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Primary:** **Do not use the clipboard for transferring security-critical data.** This is a fundamental design flaw. Use secure, purpose-built mechanisms.
        *   **Secondary (If Clipboard Use is Unavoidable):** Implement strong integrity checks (checksums, digital signatures) on the pasted data *before* using it. Verify the data hasn't been tampered with. This is crucial because the application *expects* to use clipboard.js.
        *   **Secondary:** Combine clipboard-based input with other authentication factors (multi-factor authentication).
