# Attack Surface Analysis for zenorocha/clipboard.js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Content Injection (Clipboard Hijacking - Write)](./attack_surfaces/malicious_content_injection__clipboard_hijacking_-_write_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious content into the user's clipboard through the application's use of `clipboard.js`. This occurs when the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied data before passing it to the library.
*   **How clipboard.js Contributes:** `clipboard.js` provides the mechanism for writing to the clipboard. The vulnerability lies in the *application's* failure to sanitize the data *before* using `clipboard.js`.
*   **Example:**
    *   A user enters `javascript:alert('XSS')` into a form field that is then copied to the clipboard using `clipboard.js`. When the user pastes this into a browser address bar, the JavaScript code executes.
    *   A user enters `rm -rf /*` into a field intended for a filename, and the application copies this to the clipboard. If pasted into a terminal, this could delete files.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Code Execution:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript (XSS), shell commands, or other code in the context of the user's browser or system.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Data Loss/Corruption:** Deletion or modification of user data (if pasted into a terminal or other sensitive context).
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical** (for code execution scenarios) to **High** (for phishing/data loss).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation:** *Strictly* validate all user input before passing it to `clipboard.js`.  Use allow-lists (whitelists) whenever possible, specifying exactly what characters and formats are permitted.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Encode the data appropriately for the intended context.  Use HTML encoding, URL encoding, or other relevant encoding schemes to prevent malicious code from being interpreted as executable.
    *   **Context-Aware Sanitization:** Understand where the user is likely to paste the data and sanitize accordingly.  For example, if the data is intended for a URL, use URL encoding. If it's intended for display within HTML, use HTML encoding.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Use CSP to restrict the types of content that can be executed in the browser, mitigating the impact of XSS attacks.
    *   **Limit Data Size:**  Implement limits on the size of the data that can be copied to the clipboard to prevent denial-of-service attacks.
    * **User Confirmation (Optional):** For high-risk scenarios, consider adding a user confirmation step (e.g., a modal dialog) before copying sensitive data to the clipboard.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency-Related Vulnerabilities (Outdated Library)](./attack_surfaces/dependency-related_vulnerabilities__outdated_library_.md)

*   **Description:** Using an outdated version of `clipboard.js` that contains known vulnerabilities.
*   **How clipboard.js Contributes:**  The vulnerability exists *within* the outdated version of `clipboard.js` itself.
*   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability is discovered in `clipboard.js` version 1.0 that allows an attacker to bypass certain security checks.  An application using version 1.0 is vulnerable, while an application using the patched version 1.1 is not.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability.  Could lead to malicious content injection.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can be **Critical** to **High**.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep `clipboard.js` updated to the latest version.  Use dependency management tools (e.g., npm, yarn) to track and manage dependencies.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to scan for known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
    *   **Security Advisories:**  Monitor security advisories and mailing lists related to `clipboard.js` and its dependencies.
