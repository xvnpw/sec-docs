# Attack Surface Analysis for zenorocha/clipboard.js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Data Injected via Clipboard Functionality](./attack_surfaces/malicious_data_injected_via_clipboard_functionality.md)

*   **Description:** Untrusted or malicious data can be injected into the clipboard through the `clipboard.js` library if the source of the data to be copied is not properly sanitized.
*   **How clipboard.js Contributes:** `clipboard.js` facilitates the copying of content defined by `data-clipboard-text` or the target element of `data-clipboard-target`. If these values originate from untrusted sources, the library will faithfully copy the malicious content.
*   **Example:** A website allows users to input text that can be copied using `clipboard.js`. An attacker injects a string containing JavaScript code into this input. When another user copies this text and pastes it into a vulnerable application (e.g., a developer console or an application with insufficient input sanitization), the code could be executed.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Code Injection in other applications.
    *   Data exfiltration when the pasted content triggers actions in the receiving application.
    *   Social engineering attacks by crafting deceptive text that appears legitimate when pasted.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate any data that will be used as the source for clipboard content before it's used with `clipboard.js`.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to mitigate the risk of injected scripts being executed in the context of your application, although this doesn't directly prevent malicious content from being copied.
    *   **Users:**
        *   Be cautious about pasting content from untrusted websites or sources into sensitive applications.
