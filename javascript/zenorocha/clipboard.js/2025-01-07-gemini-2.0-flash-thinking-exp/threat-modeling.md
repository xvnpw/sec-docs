# Threat Model Analysis for zenorocha/clipboard.js

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in `clipboard.js` (or its dependencies, if any in future)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in__clipboard_js___or_its_dependencies__if_any_in_future_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities might be discovered in the `clipboard.js` library itself or in any of its dependencies (though it currently has none). Attackers could exploit these vulnerabilities if the library is not kept up-to-date. This could involve exploiting weaknesses in the library's code for event handling, selector processing, or interaction with the browser's clipboard API.
*   **Impact:** Potential for various client-side attacks, including cross-site scripting (XSS) if the vulnerability allows for injecting and executing arbitrary JavaScript, or other code execution within the user's browser context. This could lead to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.
*   **Affected Component:** The `clipboard.js` library code itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly update the `clipboard.js` library to the latest version to apply security patches.
    *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with `clipboard.js`.
    *   Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to automatically detect known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Threat: [Malicious Input Exploiting `clipboard.js` Selector Logic (Potential Future Threat)](./threats/malicious_input_exploiting__clipboard_js__selector_logic__potential_future_threat_.md)

**Description:**  While not currently a known vulnerability, a hypothetical scenario could involve carefully crafted malicious input within `data-clipboard-target` selectors that could exploit potential vulnerabilities in the selector engine used by `clipboard.js` (if any complex logic is introduced in future versions). This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior or even arbitrary code execution if the selector engine has exploitable flaws.
*   **Impact:**  Could lead to the execution of unintended code or actions within the user's browser, potentially compromising the user's session or data.
*   **Affected Component:** The selector processing logic within `clipboard.js` (specifically how it interprets and uses the `data-clipboard-target` value).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure the `clipboard.js` library is regularly updated to benefit from any security patches related to selector processing.
    *   If possible, limit the complexity of selectors used with `clipboard.js` to reduce the attack surface.
    *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the `clipboard.js` codebase for potential vulnerabilities in selector handling if the library evolves to include more complex selector logic.
