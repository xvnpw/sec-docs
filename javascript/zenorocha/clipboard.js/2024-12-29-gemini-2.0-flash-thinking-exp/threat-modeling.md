* **Threat:** Malicious Data Injection via Controlled Source Element
    * **Description:** An attacker manipulates the content of the HTML element that `clipboard.js` is configured to copy. This could involve injecting malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript) or harmful data into the element's text content or attributes. When a user triggers the copy action, this malicious content is copied to their clipboard. The attacker might achieve this through vulnerabilities in the application that allow them to control the content of the target element, such as DOM-based XSS or insecurely handled user input.
    * **Impact:** If the copied content is malicious JavaScript, a user could unknowingly paste it into their browser's developer console or another application that executes JavaScript, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks. Harmful data could also trick users into performing unintended actions when pasted into other applications.
    * **Affected Component:** `clipboard.js`'s event listener and the mechanism for retrieving the text content from the target element (e.g., `target.textContent`, `target.getAttribute('data-clipboard-text')`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Sanitize and validate all user-controlled input that could influence the content of elements used with `clipboard.js`.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of injected scripts.
        * Avoid using user-controlled data directly as the source for clipboard content without proper encoding.
        * If possible, use static content or server-rendered content for elements targeted by `clipboard.js`.

* **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in `clipboard.js` Library
    * **Description:** Like any third-party library, `clipboard.js` itself might contain security vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability is discovered in `clipboard.js`, attackers could potentially exploit it if the application is using a vulnerable version of the library. This could lead to various attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if the vulnerability allows for the injection of malicious scripts.
    * **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability. It could range from information disclosure to arbitrary code execution within the user's browser.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `clipboard.js` library.
    * **Risk Severity:** Can range from Medium to Critical depending on the vulnerability.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly update `clipboard.js` to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        * Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with `clipboard.js`.
        * Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) tags when including `clipboard.js` from a CDN to ensure the integrity of the file.

* **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks Targeting `clipboard.js`
    * **Description:** An attacker could compromise the distribution channel or repository of `clipboard.js`, potentially injecting malicious code into the library. If developers unknowingly include this compromised version in their applications, they could introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Impact:**  The impact could be severe, potentially allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code within the user's browser or steal sensitive information.
    * **Affected Component:** The entire `clipboard.js` library as distributed.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Use reputable sources for obtaining `clipboard.js`.
        * Verify the integrity of the downloaded library using checksums or other verification methods.
        * Implement Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to detect known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
        * Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) tags when including `clipboard.js` from a CDN.
