## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Brackets Core Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_brackets_core_vulnerabilities__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Publicly Disclosed CVEs [CRITICAL NODE - Entry Point]:**
        *   Attackers leverage known vulnerabilities in Brackets core code that have been publicly documented (CVEs).
        *   Exploits may be readily available or easily developed based on CVE details.
        *   Targets older, unpatched versions of Brackets.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact, Low Likelihood]:**
        *   Attackers discover and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in Brackets core code.
        *   Requires significant reverse engineering and vulnerability research skills.
        *   Extremely impactful as no patches or defenses exist initially.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerable Dependency [CRITICAL NODE - Exploitation Point]:**
        *   Brackets relies on third-party libraries (dependencies). Attackers target known vulnerabilities in these dependencies.
        *   Exploitation depends on how the vulnerable dependency is used within Brackets.
        *   Can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the vulnerability allows it.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Dependency [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact Outcome]:**
        *   Successful exploitation of a dependency vulnerability leading to the attacker's ability to execute arbitrary code on the system running Brackets.
        *   Grants full control over the application and potentially the underlying system.
    *   **Exploit Brackets-Specific Code Flaws [HIGH RISK PATH]:**
        *   Attackers identify and exploit coding errors or design flaws unique to Brackets' own codebase.
        *   **Code Injection Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Type]:**
            *   Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., JavaScript, HTML) into Brackets through user-supplied input or data processing flaws.
            *   Code is executed within the context of Brackets, potentially leading to RCE or other malicious actions.
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Brackets UI [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Type]:**
            *   Attackers inject malicious scripts that execute within the Brackets editor's user interface.
            *   Can lead to session hijacking, UI manipulation, or further attacks within the Brackets context.
        *   **Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in File Handling [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Type]:**
            *   Attackers exploit flaws in how Brackets handles file paths to access files and directories outside of the intended scope.
            *   Can lead to information disclosure, access to sensitive application files, or even file manipulation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Brackets Extension Ecosystem [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_brackets_extension_ecosystem__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Extension Installation [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:**
        *   Attackers trick users into installing malicious Brackets extensions.
        *   **Social Engineering [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:**
            *   Attackers use social engineering tactics (phishing, deceptive websites, misleading instructions) to convince users to install a seemingly legitimate but malicious extension.
        *   **Supply Chain Attack [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact, Lower Likelihood but Devastating]:**
            *   Attackers compromise the extension supply chain (e.g., extension repository, developer accounts) to inject malicious code into legitimate extensions.
            *   Can affect a large number of users who install or update the compromised extension.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerable Extension [CRITICAL NODE - Exploitation Point]:**
        *   Attackers target vulnerabilities within legitimate Brackets extensions.
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Extension [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact Outcome]:**
            *   Exploiting a vulnerability in an extension to execute arbitrary code within the Brackets environment.
            *   Can lead to application compromise or further attacks.
        *   **Data Exfiltration via Extension [CRITICAL NODE - Data Breach Outcome]:**
            *   Malicious extensions are designed to steal sensitive data from the application or the user's environment.
            *   Can lead to data breaches and loss of confidential information.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Brackets File System Access [HIGH RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_brackets_file_system_access__high_risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Path Traversal via Brackets File Operations [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Type]:**
        *   Similar to path traversal in core Brackets, but specifically targeting file operations exposed through Brackets' file system access features.
        *   Allows access to unauthorized files and directories.
    *   **File Manipulation via Brackets [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:**
        *   Attackers abuse Brackets' file manipulation capabilities to compromise the application.
        *   **Malicious File Upload/Overwrite [CRITICAL NODE - Attack Vector]:**
            *   Using Brackets' file upload or overwrite features to upload malicious files or replace legitimate application files with malicious ones.
        *   **Code Injection via File Modification [CRITICAL NODE - High Impact Outcome]:**
            *   Modifying existing application code files using Brackets' file editing features to inject malicious code directly into the application's codebase.
            *   Can create persistent backdoors or directly compromise application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Brackets Communication Channels - Frontend-Backend (If Backend Exists) [HIGH RISK PATH if Backend Exists]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_brackets_communication_channels_-_frontend-backend__if_backend_exists___high_risk_path_if_ba_1e2ba1c4.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Insecure API Endpoints [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Type]:**
        *   If Brackets communicates with a backend server, vulnerabilities in the backend APIs can be exploited.
        *   Common API vulnerabilities include injection flaws, broken authentication, and insufficient authorization.
    *   **Data Injection in Communication [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Type]:**
        *   Injecting malicious data into the communication channels between the Brackets frontend and backend.
        *   Can lead to backend compromise, data manipulation, or bypassing application logic.
    *   **Authentication/Authorization Bypass [CRITICAL NODE - Vulnerability Type]:**
        *   Bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms in the communication between Brackets and the backend.
        *   Allows unauthorized access to backend functionality and data.
