These vulnerabilities are typically reported by security researchers and disclosed in public databases like the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).
*   **Attack Scenario:**
    1.  **Vulnerability Discovery & Disclosure:** A security researcher discovers a vulnerability in a specific version of Brackets and reports it to Adobe or a public disclosure platform. A CVE ID is assigned.
    2.  **Public Availability of CVE Details:**  Details of the vulnerability, including affected versions, vulnerability type, and potential impact, become publicly available through CVE databases and security advisories.
    3.  **Exploit Development (or Availability):** Attackers analyze the CVE details and either develop their own exploit code or find publicly available exploits (e.g., on exploit databases or security blogs).
    4.  **Targeting Unpatched Systems:** Attackers scan the internet or target specific organizations looking for systems running vulnerable, unpatched versions of Brackets.
    5.  **Exploitation:** Attackers use the exploit to target vulnerable Brackets instances, potentially gaining unauthorized access or executing malicious code.
*   **Technical Details:**
    *   CVEs can cover a wide range of vulnerability types, including buffer overflows, SQL injection (less likely in Brackets core but possible in extensions or related server-side components if any), cross-site scripting (XSS), remote code execution (RCE), and more.
    *   Exploits can be crafted to leverage specific weaknesses in the vulnerable code, often manipulating input data or program flow to achieve malicious outcomes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **High to Critical:** Depending on the vulnerability type, successful exploitation of a CVE can lead to:
        *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Complete control over the Brackets application and potentially the underlying system.
        *   **Data Breach:** Access to sensitive data handled by Brackets or the system.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing or rendering Brackets unusable.
