# Threat Model Analysis for adobe/brackets

## Threat: [Code Injection via Brackets Editor](./threats/code_injection_via_brackets_editor.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates code within the Brackets editor (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS) and exploits vulnerabilities in the application's code processing logic. The attacker could inject malicious scripts that are then executed by the application, potentially leading to unauthorized actions. For example, if the application takes JavaScript code edited in Brackets and executes it on the server without sanitization, an attacker could inject server-side code to gain control of the server.

**Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), data breach, server compromise, application takeover, denial of service.

**Affected Brackets Component:** Brackets Editor (core functionality), potentially any part of the application that processes code from Brackets.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strict input sanitization and validation of all code received from Brackets before processing or execution.
*   Implement secure sandboxing for code execution environments.
*   Principle of least privilege for code execution permissions.
*   Regular code reviews of code processing logic.
*   Consider using static analysis security testing (SAST) tools to identify potential code injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [XSS Vulnerability in Brackets Core](./threats/xss_vulnerability_in_brackets_core.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits an existing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the Brackets codebase itself. By crafting a malicious input or URL that triggers the vulnerability in the embedded Brackets instance, the attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the host application's user session. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, data theft, account compromise, defacement, redirection to malicious sites.

**Affected Brackets Component:** Brackets Core (various modules depending on the specific vulnerability).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Brackets updated to the latest stable version.
*   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) for the application.
*   Regular security audits and penetration testing of the application and embedded Brackets.
*   Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Brackets resources if applicable.

## Threat: [File System Traversal via Brackets](./threats/file_system_traversal_via_brackets.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages Brackets' file system access capabilities to navigate and access files and directories outside the intended scope defined by the application. This could be achieved by manipulating file paths within the Brackets editor or exploiting vulnerabilities in Brackets' file handling logic. The attacker could read sensitive configuration files, application code, or user data. In some scenarios, they might even be able to modify or delete files.

**Impact:** Unauthorized data access, data breach, data modification, data deletion, configuration compromise, application malfunction.

**Affected Brackets Component:** Brackets File System API, Brackets Editor (file browsing and manipulation features).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Restrict Brackets' file system access to only necessary directories and files.
*   Implement operating system-level sandboxing or containerization for Brackets.
*   Principle of least privilege for file system permissions granted to Brackets.
*   Regularly review and audit file access configurations.

## Threat: [Malicious Brackets Extension Installation](./threats/malicious_brackets_extension_installation.md)

**Description:** An attacker tricks a user or exploits a vulnerability to install a malicious Brackets extension. This extension could be designed to steal user credentials, inject malicious code into projects, exfiltrate data, or perform other malicious actions within the Brackets environment and potentially the host application's context if extensions have access. The attacker might distribute the malicious extension through unofficial channels or compromise legitimate extension repositories.

**Impact:** Data theft, credential compromise, code injection, privilege escalation, denial of service, system compromise.

**Affected Brackets Component:** Brackets Extension Manager, Brackets Extension APIs.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Disable Brackets extension installation if not essential.
*   Implement a curated and vetted extension store.
*   Review and approve extensions before making them available.
*   Implement extension sandboxing mechanisms.
*   Educate users about the risks of installing untrusted extensions.
*   Utilize extension signature verification if available.
