# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a free and open-source code editor tailored for web development.
  - Offer a user-friendly environment for front-end developers.
  - Foster a community around web development tools and practices.
  - Enable extensibility through a robust extension ecosystem.
  - Support modern web technologies and workflows.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of losing community support and contributions if the project becomes stagnant or misaligned with community needs.
  - Risk of security vulnerabilities in the editor or extensions that could harm users or their projects.
  - Risk of competition from other code editors with more features or better performance.
  - Risk of project abandonment if maintainers lose interest or resources.
  - Risk of supply chain attacks through compromised dependencies or build processes.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are likely performed by maintainers and contributors as part of the open-source development process. (Location: GitHub Pull Request process)
  - security control: Static code analysis tools might be used to identify potential code quality and security issues. (Location: Potentially integrated into CI/CD pipelines, if any)
  - security control: Dependency scanning to identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. (Location: Potentially integrated into CI/CD pipelines, if any)
  - security control: Operating system level security controls on user's machine where Brackets is installed. (Location: User's responsibility, OS documentation)
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party extensions due to the open and community-driven nature of the extension ecosystem.
  - accepted risk: Users running Brackets on potentially insecure operating systems or environments.
  - accepted risk: Social engineering attacks targeting developers using Brackets.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies and components. (Location: Build process and release artifacts)
  - security control: Enhance input validation and sanitization throughout the application, especially in features that handle external data or user input (e.g., file handling, extension loading, preferences). (Location: Codebase - backend and frontend)
  - security control: Implement automated security testing (SAST, DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline. (Location: CI/CD pipeline)
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability reporting and response process. (Location: Project documentation and security policy)
  - security control: Provide guidelines and best practices for extension developers to promote secure extension development. (Location: Extension development documentation)
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Not directly applicable to a desktop code editor in terms of user authentication to the application itself.
    - Consider authentication for any online services integrated with Brackets (e.g., extension marketplace, if any).
  - Authorization:
    - File system access should be limited to the user's permissions.
    - Access to system resources should be minimized and follow the principle of least privilege.
    - Extension permissions should be clearly defined and controlled to prevent malicious extensions from gaining excessive access.
  - Input Validation:
    - Validate all user inputs, including file content, settings, and extension inputs, to prevent injection attacks (e.g., code injection, command injection).
    - Sanitize inputs to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if Brackets renders web content (e.g., in live preview or extension UIs).
  - Cryptography:
    - Use cryptography for secure storage of sensitive data, such as user credentials if any are stored locally (though unlikely for a code editor itself, potentially relevant for extension settings).
    - Ensure secure communication if Brackets communicates with external services (e.g., for updates or extension downloads).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Providing a functional and reliable code editor to users.
  - Maintaining the open-source community and contributions.
  - Ensuring the security and integrity of the Brackets application and its extensions.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - User Project Code: Sensitive. Contains intellectual property, potentially confidential information, and business logic. Confidentiality, integrity, and availability are important.
  - User Settings and Preferences: Low to Medium sensitivity. Contains user-specific configurations. Integrity and availability are important.
  - Extension Code: Medium to High sensitivity. Extensions can have significant access to the editor and user projects. Integrity and availability are critical.
  - Application Code: Publicly available as open source. Integrity and availability are important to maintain trust and prevent supply chain attacks.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the current process for managing and reviewing extension security?
  - Are there any automated security tests currently integrated into the development or release process?
  - Is there a formal vulnerability reporting and response process in place?
  - What is the strategy for maintaining Brackets in the long term, given it's no longer actively developed by Adobe?
- Assumptions:
  - BUSINESS POSTURE: The primary goal is to maintain Brackets as a useful open-source tool for the web development community.
  - SECURITY POSTURE: Security is considered important, but resources for dedicated security efforts might be limited due to the community-driven nature of the project.
  - DESIGN: The architecture is relatively straightforward for a desktop application, with core modules and an extension system. The build and deployment processes are likely standard for open-source desktop software.
