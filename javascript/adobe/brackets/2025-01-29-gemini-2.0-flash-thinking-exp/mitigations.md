## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement a Strict Extension Vetting Process](./mitigation_strategies/implement_a_strict_extension_vetting_process.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a Strict Extension Vetting Process
    *   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Establish a central repository or document listing approved Brackets extensions for team use.
        *   Step 2: Define clear criteria for extension approval, including:
            *   Source code availability and reviewability.
            *   Permissions requested by the extension within Brackets.
            *   Developer reputation and history within the Brackets extension ecosystem.
            *   Community reviews and ratings specifically related to Brackets extensions.
            *   Active maintenance status and update frequency within the Brackets extension registry.
        *   Step 3: Assign a designated team member or security team to review extension requests against the defined criteria, focusing on Brackets-specific risks.
        *   Step 4: Document the review process and approval decisions for each extension within the context of Brackets usage.
        *   Step 5: Communicate the list of approved extensions to the development team and enforce its use within Brackets.
        *   Step 6: Regularly review and update the approved extension list, removing or deprecating extensions as needed within the Brackets environment.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Malicious Extension Installation within Brackets - Severity: High (Potential for code execution within Brackets, data theft from Brackets projects, Brackets application compromise)
        *   Vulnerable Extension Exploitation within Brackets - Severity: High (Potential for code execution within Brackets, data theft from Brackets projects, Brackets application compromise)
        *   Data Leakage through Brackets Extensions - Severity: Medium (Potential for sensitive data from Brackets projects exfiltration to external servers via extensions)
    *   **Impact:**

## Mitigation Strategy: [Principle of Least Privilege for Brackets Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/principle_of_least_privilege_for_brackets_extensions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Principle of Least Privilege for Brackets Extensions
    *   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: When evaluating extensions for Brackets, prioritize those that request minimal permissions *within the Brackets environment*.
        *   Step 2: Carefully review the permissions requested by each Brackets extension before installation, focusing on what access they request within Brackets and to Brackets projects.
        *   Step 3: If multiple Brackets extensions offer similar functionality, choose the one with the least demanding permission set *within Brackets*.
        *   Step 4: Avoid Brackets extensions that request broad permissions like "full file system access" or "network access" unless absolutely necessary for their Brackets-related functionality and justified by their Brackets use case.
        *   Step 5: If possible, configure Brackets extension settings to further restrict their access or capabilities *within the Brackets editor*.
    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Impact of Malicious Brackets Extension - Severity: High (Limits the damage a malicious Brackets extension can cause by restricting its access *within Brackets*)
        *   Impact of Vulnerable Brackets Extension - Severity: High (Limits the damage a vulnerable Brackets extension can cause by restricting its access *within Brackets*)
        *   Accidental Data Exposure by Brackets Extension - Severity: Medium (Reduces the chance of accidental data exposure if a Brackets extension has limited access *within Brackets*)
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Impact of Malicious Brackets Extension: Significantly reduces impact.
        *   Impact of Vulnerable Brackets Extension: Significantly reduces impact.
        *   Accidental Data Exposure by Brackets Extension: Moderately reduces risk.
    *   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Developers are generally aware of permissions but no formal enforcement or guidance exists specifically for Brackets extensions.
    *   **Missing Implementation:**  No formal guidelines or training on least privilege for Brackets extensions. No automated checks or warnings during Brackets extension installation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Audit and Review Installed Brackets Extensions](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_audit_and_review_installed_brackets_extensions.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Audit and Review Installed Brackets Extensions
    *   **Description:**
        *   Step 1: Schedule periodic reviews (e.g., monthly or quarterly) of all Brackets extensions installed by team members *within their Brackets installations*.
        *   Step 2: Create a process to easily list all installed Brackets extensions across the team's Brackets installations (e.g., using a shared document or script to collect extension lists from Brackets).
        *   Step 3: During the review, specifically for Brackets extensions, check for:
            *   Brackets extensions that are no longer needed or used within Brackets.
            *   Outdated Brackets extensions with known vulnerabilities *within the Brackets ecosystem*.
            *   Brackets extensions from untrusted or unknown sources *within the Brackets extension context*.
            *   Brackets extensions that violate the principle of least privilege *within Brackets*.
        *   Step 4: Remove or disable any Brackets extensions identified as problematic during the review from Brackets installations.
        *   Step 5: Communicate the review findings and any necessary actions to the development team regarding their Brackets extensions.

        *   Step 3: If network access is not essential for the Brackets extension's core function, disable or uninstall the extension from Brackets.
        *   Step 4: For Brackets extensions requiring network access, investigate:
            *   Where the Brackets extension connects to (domains, IPs) from within Brackets.
            *   What data is transmitted by the Brackets extension.
            *   If communication is encrypted (HTTPS) by the Brackets extension.
        *   Step 5: If concerns arise about a Brackets extension's network activity, consider alternative Brackets extensions or restrict its usage within Brackets.
        *   Step 6: Implement network monitoring tools (if feasible) to observe Brackets extension network traffic for suspicious activity originating from Brackets.
