## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Brackets (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_brackets__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and thus a critical node. Success at any of the leaf nodes in the high-risk paths leads to achieving this goal.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Brackets Extensions (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_brackets_extensions__critical_node_.md)

* Extensions, being third-party code, introduce a significant attack surface. This node is critical because successful exploitation of extensions can directly lead to compromising the developer's environment and potentially the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents the actual act of leveraging a weakness in a Brackets extension. It's critical because it's the point of successful compromise within the extension attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Extension UI (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_extension_ui__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attackers inject malicious JavaScript into the extension's user interface. When a developer interacts with the compromised extension, the script executes within the Brackets context.
    * High-Risk Path: Due to the moderate likelihood of finding XSS vulnerabilities in extensions and the potential for medium impact (access to developer's Brackets instance, further attacks).

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Extension (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__via_extension__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* A vulnerability in an extension allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine.
    * High-Risk Path: While the likelihood might be lower than XSS, the impact of full machine compromise is very high, making it a significant risk.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Code Injection via Brackets Editor (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_code_injection_via_brackets_editor__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents the attacker successfully injecting malicious code into the application's codebase or related files using the Brackets editor after gaining access to the developer's machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Access to Developer's Machine (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/gain_access_to_developer's_machine__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* This is a crucial step that enables subsequent malicious actions. Methods include phishing, social engineering, or exploiting vulnerabilities on the developer's machine.
    * High-Risk Path: The likelihood of attackers successfully gaining access to developer machines is moderate, and the impact as a precursor to further attacks is very high.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code__critical_node_.md)

* This node represents the action of inserting harmful code into the application's files. It's a critical step in the code injection attack vector.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly into Application Code (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/directly_into_application_code__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* Malicious code is inserted directly into the application's source code files.
    * High-Risk Path: Moderate likelihood (depending on access and code review practices) and high impact (direct compromise of the application).

## Attack Tree Path: [Into Configuration Files Used by Application (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/into_configuration_files_used_by_application__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* Attackers modify configuration files to alter the application's behavior, potentially weakening security or exposing sensitive information.
    * High-Risk Path: Moderate likelihood and medium to high impact depending on the sensitivity of the configuration.

## Attack Tree Path: [Into Build/Deployment Scripts (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/into_builddeployment_scripts__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* Malicious code is injected into the scripts used to build and deploy the application, leading to the deployment of compromised versions.
    * High-Risk Path: Lower to moderate likelihood but high impact due to the compromise of the entire deployment pipeline.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Brackets Process (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__in_brackets_process__critical_node_.md)

* Exploiting a vulnerability in the Brackets core application itself to execute arbitrary code on the developer's machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Arbitrary Code (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_arbitrary_code__critical_node_.md)

* The successful outcome of an RCE exploit in the Brackets core, leading to full control of the developer's machine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Brackets' Node.js Dependencies (Critical Node)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_brackets'_node_js_dependencies__critical_node_.md)

* Leveraging known vulnerabilities in the third-party libraries used by Brackets' Node.js backend. This node is critical because these dependencies are a common source of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Vulnerability (Critical Node, High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_vulnerability__critical_node__high-risk_path_.md)

* The action of exploiting a specific vulnerability in a Brackets Node.js dependency.
    * High-Risk Path: Moderate likelihood of finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in dependencies, with a potentially high impact ranging from denial of service to remote code execution.
