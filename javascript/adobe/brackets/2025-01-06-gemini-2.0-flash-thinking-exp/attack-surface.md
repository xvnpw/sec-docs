# Attack Surface Analysis for adobe/brackets

## Attack Surface: [Node.js Backend Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/node_js_backend_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description**: Exploitation of security flaws within the Node.js runtime environment that Brackets relies on for core functionality.
    * **How Brackets Contributes to the Attack Surface**: Brackets bundles a specific version of Node.js. Vulnerabilities in this version directly impact Brackets' security. Custom Node.js modules or integrations within Brackets' backend code can also introduce vulnerabilities.
    * **Example**: A known vulnerability in the bundled Node.js version allows for remote code execution if a specific crafted request is sent to Brackets' internal server.
    * **Impact**: Critical. Can lead to complete compromise of the system running Brackets, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary code, access sensitive data, or disrupt operations.
    * **Risk Severity**: Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Developers should regularly update Brackets to the latest version, which includes updated Node.js.
        * Implement robust input validation and sanitization for any data processed by the Node.js backend.
        * Follow secure coding practices for any custom Node.js modules or integrations.
        * Monitor for and patch any known vulnerabilities in the specific Node.js version being used.

## Attack Surface: [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/chromium_embedded_framework__cef__vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description**: Security flaws within the CEF, which is used to render Brackets' user interface.
    * **How Brackets Contributes to the Attack Surface**: Brackets embeds a specific version of CEF. Vulnerabilities in this CEF version can be exploited to compromise the editor's UI or gain access to underlying system resources.
    * **Example**: A vulnerability in the embedded CEF allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the Brackets UI, potentially stealing credentials or executing commands with the user's privileges.
    * **Impact**: High. Can lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) within the editor, information disclosure, or potentially remote code execution if the CEF vulnerability allows it.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Developers should prioritize updating Brackets to versions that incorporate the latest stable and secure CEF releases.
        * Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) within Brackets' UI to mitigate XSS risks.
        * Be cautious about loading external content or resources within the Brackets UI.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Extensions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_extensions.md)

* **Description**:  Third-party extensions installed within Brackets containing malicious code or security vulnerabilities.
    * **How Brackets Contributes to the Attack Surface**: Brackets' extension architecture allows third-party code to run within the editor's context, granting access to resources and APIs. A lack of rigorous security review for extensions increases the risk.
    * **Example**: A developer installs an extension that claims to enhance code formatting but secretly exfiltrates project files to an external server. Alternatively, a vulnerable extension could be exploited by an attacker to gain control of the editor.
    * **Impact**: High. Malicious extensions can steal sensitive data, modify files, execute arbitrary code, or compromise the user's system. Vulnerable extensions can be exploited by attackers.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Users should only install extensions from trusted sources and developers.
        * Review extension permissions before installation to understand what access they require.
        * Regularly audit installed extensions and remove any that are no longer needed or seem suspicious.
        * Developers creating extensions should follow secure coding practices and undergo security reviews.

## Attack Surface: [File System Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/file_system_access_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description**: Exploiting vulnerabilities in how Brackets handles file system operations, allowing unauthorized access or modification of files.
    * **How Brackets Contributes to the Attack Surface**: Brackets requires extensive access to the local file system to function as a code editor. Vulnerabilities in file path handling or access control can be exploited.
    * **Example**: A path traversal vulnerability in Brackets could allow an attacker to access or modify files outside the currently open project directory.
    * **Impact**: High. Can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files, modification or deletion of critical data, or injection of malicious code into project files.
    * **Risk Severity**: High
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Developers should implement robust input validation and sanitization for all file paths and operations.
        * Follow the principle of least privilege when accessing the file system.
        * Regularly audit file system access logic for potential vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Update Mechanism Compromise](./attack_surfaces/update_mechanism_compromise.md)

* **Description**:  Attacks targeting the process of updating Brackets to install malicious software.
    * **How Brackets Contributes to the Attack Surface**: Brackets has an auto-update mechanism. If this process is not securely implemented, attackers could potentially intercept update requests and deliver malicious updates.
    * **Example**: A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack could intercept an update request and serve a compromised Brackets installer containing malware.
    * **Impact**: Critical. A compromised update can lead to the installation of malware, giving attackers full control over the user's system.
    * **Risk Severity**: Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies**:
        * Ensure that Brackets uses HTTPS for update downloads and verifies the integrity of update packages using digital signatures.
        * Users should download Brackets updates only from the official website or trusted sources.
        * Verify the digital signature of downloaded installers.
