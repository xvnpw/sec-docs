## Attack Tree Path: [1.1.1 Exploit Node.js Integration (Shell Execution) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_1_1_exploit_node_js_integration__shell_execution___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on leveraging Brackets' integration with Node.js to achieve shell execution and ultimately, Remote Code Execution (RCE). Brackets uses Node.js for various functionalities, including Live Preview and extension capabilities.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **1.1.1.1 Malicious "Live Preview" Configuration:**
            *   **Description:**  An attacker crafts a malicious project configuration (e.g., a `.brackets.json` file) that specifies a harmful command to be executed when the Live Preview feature is used. This could involve setting a malicious `livePreviewCustomServerUrl` or similar setting.
            *   **1.1.1.1.1 Craft a project with a `.brackets.json` file... [CRITICAL]:** This is the specific action the attacker takes – creating or modifying the project configuration file to include the malicious command.
        *   **1.1.1.2 Abuse Node.js APIs exposed to Extensions [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **Description:** Brackets extensions have access to Node.js APIs, which can be abused to execute arbitrary code. An attacker creates a malicious extension that utilizes these APIs for harmful purposes.
            *   **1.1.1.2.1 Craft a malicious extension that uses Node.js APIs... [CRITICAL]:** This is the core action – developing an extension that leverages Node.js APIs (like `child_process.exec`, `fs` for file system access, etc.) to execute commands or manipulate the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2 Social Engineering to Install Malicious Extension [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_social_engineering_to_install_malicious_extension__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector relies on tricking the user into installing a malicious extension. The attacker doesn't exploit a technical vulnerability in Brackets itself, but rather the user's trust.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **1.2.1 Trick User into Installing Malicious Extension [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **Description:** The attacker uses social engineering techniques to persuade the user to install the malicious extension. This could involve disguising the extension as a legitimate tool, distributing it through a compromised website, or using phishing techniques.
            *   **1.2.1.1 Distribute a malicious extension... [CRITICAL]:** This is the key action – getting the malicious extension into the user's hands and convincing them to install it.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1 Access Files via Brackets' File System Access](./attack_tree_paths/2_1_access_files_via_brackets'_file_system_access.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on using Brackets' legitimate file system access capabilities to read sensitive data.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **2.1.1 Malicious Extension Reads Files [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **Description:** A malicious extension utilizes Brackets' file system API to access and read sensitive files on the user's system, such as configuration files, SSH keys, or other personal data.
            *   **2.1.1.1 A malicious extension uses Brackets' file system API... [CRITICAL]:** This is the core action – the extension using the API to read files.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2 Transmit Data Outward](./attack_tree_paths/2_2_transmit_data_outward.md)

*   **Description:** This attack vector focuses on exfiltrating the data obtained in the previous step (2.1) to an attacker-controlled location.
    *   **Sub-Vectors:**
        *   **2.2.1 Use Node.js Networking Capabilities (within an extension) [HIGH RISK]:**
            *   **Description:** The malicious extension uses Node.js's networking capabilities (e.g., the `http`, `net`, or `https` modules) to send the stolen data to a remote server controlled by the attacker.
            *   **2.2.1.1 The malicious extension uses Node.js's `http` or `net` modules... [CRITICAL]:** This is the specific action – the extension establishing a network connection and transmitting the data.
