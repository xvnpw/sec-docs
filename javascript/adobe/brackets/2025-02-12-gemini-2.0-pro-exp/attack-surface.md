# Attack Surface Analysis for adobe/brackets

## Attack Surface: [Unrestricted File System Access (Read/Write)](./attack_surfaces/unrestricted_file_system_access__readwrite_.md)

*   **Description:** Brackets' core functionality requires read/write access to the file system.  Unconstrained access is the most significant Brackets-specific risk.
*   **How Brackets Contributes:** This is *inherent* to Brackets' design as a code editor.  It *must* interact with the file system.
*   **Example:**
    *   Attacker uses a path traversal vulnerability in how the application handles file paths passed to Brackets (e.g., `../../../../etc/passwd`) to read sensitive system files.
    *   Attacker uploads a web shell (`.php`, `.jsp`, etc.) via Brackets to a web-accessible directory, achieving remote code execution.
    *   Attacker modifies application configuration files (e.g., `.htaccess`, `web.config`) through Brackets to weaken security.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete system compromise.
    *   Data exfiltration (sensitive files, source code).
    *   Denial of service (by deleting or corrupting files).
    *   Application defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Sandboxing:** Use OS-level mechanisms (chroot, containers, AppArmor, SELinux) to *completely* isolate Brackets' file system access to a dedicated, *empty* directory.  This directory should *never* contain sensitive files or the application's core code.  This is the *most important* mitigation.
    *   **Path Validation (Whitelist):** Implement *strict whitelisting* of allowed file paths.  Use precise regular expressions that define the *exact* allowed patterns, and *reject* anything that doesn't match.  Example: `^\/var\/www\/user_data\/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\/[a-zA-Z0-9_-]+\.(txt|js|css)$` (This allows only alphanumeric filenames with underscores/hyphens, specific extensions, within a user data directory).  *Never* use blacklisting.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Brackets process (and any associated server-side components, including Node.js) with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  *Never* run as root or an administrator.
    *   **File Type Restriction:** Strictly limit the types of files Brackets can interact with (e.g., only allow `.txt`, `.js`, `.css`, `.html`).  This prevents uploading executable files or server-side scripting languages.
    *   **Read-Only Mode:** If the application only needs to *display* code, configure Brackets in read-only mode.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Extensions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_extensions.md)

*   **Description:** Brackets' extensibility allows for powerful features, but also introduces the risk of running untrusted code within the Brackets environment.
*   **How Brackets Contributes:** Brackets' architecture is *designed* for extensibility.  Extensions have significant privileges within the Brackets context.
*   **Example:**
    *   An attacker installs a malicious extension that bypasses the intended file system sandbox and accesses sensitive files.
    *   A seemingly harmless extension has a hidden vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the Brackets process.
    *   An extension interacts with a server-side component (provided by the host application) and introduces a vulnerability there (e.g., SQL injection â€“ *if* the extension interacts with a database through the host application).
*   **Impact:**
    *   File system compromise (potentially bypassing the sandbox).
    *   Data exfiltration (from within the Brackets environment).
    *   Potential for remote code execution (if the extension interacts with server-side components *provided by the host application*).
    *   Introduction of vulnerabilities into the Brackets editor itself.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Disable Extensions (Strongly Recommended):** If the application's functionality does *not* absolutely require Brackets extensions, *disable them entirely*. This is the most secure option and drastically reduces the attack surface.
    *   **Strict Extension Vetting (If Extensions are Required):** *Manually* and *thoroughly* review the source code of *every* extension before allowing it.  Focus on file system access, network requests, and any interaction with the host application.  Look for dangerous functions like `eval()`.
    *   **Trusted Source Only:** Only allow extensions from a trusted, curated source that you control.  *Never* allow users to install arbitrary extensions.
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all enabled extensions up-to-date to patch vulnerabilities.  Automate this process if possible.
    *   **Sandboxing (Advanced):** Explore if the extension system itself can be further sandboxed (this may require modifying Brackets' core code and is a complex undertaking).

## Attack Surface: [Unsecured Live Preview (If Enabled)](./attack_surfaces/unsecured_live_preview__if_enabled_.md)

*   **Description:** Brackets' Live Preview feature, which typically runs a local web server, can create an externally accessible endpoint if misconfigured.
*   **How Brackets Contributes:** Live Preview is a built-in feature of Brackets.
*   **Example:**
    *   The Live Preview server is accidentally bound to a public IP address (or 0.0.0.0), allowing external access to files within the Brackets project directory.
    *   A vulnerability in the Live Preview server itself (less likely, but possible) is exploited.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exposure of project files (potentially including source code or sensitive data).
    *   Potential for remote code execution (if a vulnerability exists in the Live Preview server).
*   **Risk Severity:** High (if exposed externally), Medium (if only accessible locally and no server vulnerabilities exist)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Bind to Localhost Only:** *Force* the Live Preview server to listen *exclusively* on the localhost interface (127.0.0.1).  Ensure this setting cannot be overridden by users.
    *   **Non-Standard Port:** Use a non-standard, high-numbered port for Live Preview.
    *   **Disable if Unnecessary:** If Live Preview is not essential for the application's functionality, *disable it completely*.
    *   **Firewall Rules:** Use OS-level firewall rules (iptables, ufw, Windows Firewall) to *block* all external access to the Live Preview port.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Node.js Backend (brackets-shell)](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_node_js_backend__brackets-shell_.md)

*   **Description:** Brackets uses a Node.js backend (brackets-shell) for certain operations. Vulnerabilities in Node.js or its dependencies are a direct risk.
*   **How Brackets Contributes:** The brackets-shell component is an *integral* part of Brackets' architecture.
*   **Example:**
    *   A vulnerability in a Node.js module used by brackets-shell allows remote code execution.
    *   An outdated version of Node.js itself has a known, exploitable vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Remote code execution on the server.
    *   Complete system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep the Node.js runtime and *all* dependencies of brackets-shell up-to-date. Use a dependency management tool (npm, yarn) and *regularly* audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., `npm audit`, `snyk`). This is *critical*.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Run the Node.js process with the *lowest possible* privileges. Never as root or an administrator.
    *   **Network Isolation:** If the Node.js component does *not* require external network access, restrict its network access using firewall rules.
