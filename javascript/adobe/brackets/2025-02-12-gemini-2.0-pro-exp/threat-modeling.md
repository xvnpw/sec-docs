# Threat Model Analysis for adobe/brackets

## Threat: [Malicious Extension Installation](./threats/malicious_extension_installation.md)

*   **Threat:**  Installation of a Backdoored Extension
*   **Description:** An attacker convinces a user (through social engineering, phishing, or a compromised update server) to install a malicious extension disguised as a legitimate one. The extension contains hidden code that executes upon installation or when specific Brackets functions are used. The attacker might use this to steal data, modify code, or interact with the application's backend.
*   **Impact:**  Complete compromise of the user's Brackets environment and potentially the application's data and functionality. Data exfiltration, code injection, and privilege escalation are likely.
*   **Affected Brackets Component:**  `ExtensionManager` (handles extension installation, loading, and unloading), `NodeDomain` (if the extension uses Node.js for backend tasks), potentially any API exposed to extensions.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Extension Source Control:** Implement a whitelist of trusted extension sources (e.g., a private registry or a curated list). Block installation from unknown sources.
    *   **Code Signing:** Require extensions to be digitally signed by trusted developers. Verify signatures before installation.
    *   **User Education:** Train users to be wary of installing extensions from untrusted sources and to carefully review extension permissions.
    *   **Sandboxing (if feasible):** Explore sandboxing techniques to isolate extensions from each other and from the core Brackets environment. This is complex but offers strong protection.
    *   **Permission System:** Implement a granular permission system for extensions, limiting their access to specific Brackets APIs and system resources.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Legitimate Extension](./threats/vulnerable_legitimate_extension.md)

*   **Threat:**  Exploitation of a Zero-Day in a Popular Extension
*   **Description:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability (e.g., a buffer overflow, an injection flaw, or an insecure API usage) in a widely used, legitimate Brackets extension. They craft an exploit that triggers the vulnerability when the user performs a specific action within Brackets (e.g., opening a specially crafted file, using a particular extension feature).
*   **Impact:** Variable, depending on the vulnerability. Could range from denial of service (crashing Brackets) to arbitrary code execution within the extension's context, potentially leading to data theft or further attacks.
*   **Affected Brackets Component:** The specific vulnerable extension (e.g., `emmetio/emmet-brackets`, a third-party linting extension, etc.), and potentially any Brackets APIs it interacts with.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Regularly audit the dependencies (including Brackets extensions) of the application for known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` or similar for Node.js-based extensions.
    *   **Prompt Updates:** Implement a process for quickly updating extensions when security patches are released. Consider automatic updates for critical security fixes.
    *   **Vulnerability Disclosure Program:** Encourage the use of (or participate in) vulnerability disclosure programs for commonly used extensions.
    *   **Input Validation:** If the vulnerability is related to input handling, ensure the extension (and the application's integration with it) performs robust input validation and sanitization.

## Threat: [Live Preview Manipulation](./threats/live_preview_manipulation.md)

*   **Threat:**  Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Live Preview
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious code snippet that, when rendered in Brackets' Live Preview, executes JavaScript in the context of the preview window. This could be used to steal cookies, redirect the user, or interact with the application's backend if the preview window shares the same origin.
*   **Impact:** Medium to High. Could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement if the Live Preview is not properly isolated.
*   **Affected Brackets Component:** `LiveDevelopment` module (specifically the communication between Brackets and the browser), the underlying browser engine used for Live Preview.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP for the Live Preview window to prevent the execution of inline scripts and to restrict the sources from which resources can be loaded.
    *   **Output Encoding:** Ensure that all data sent to the Live Preview window is properly encoded to prevent script injection. Use context-aware encoding (e.g., HTML encoding, JavaScript encoding).
    *   **Origin Isolation:** If possible, serve the Live Preview content from a different origin than the main application to prevent cross-origin attacks.
    *   **Sandboxed iframe:** Consider rendering the Live Preview within a sandboxed `<iframe>` to further restrict its capabilities.

## Threat: [Unauthorized File System Access](./threats/unauthorized_file_system_access.md)

*   **Threat:**  Path Traversal via File Open Dialog
*   **Description:** An attacker uses the Brackets file open dialog (or a similar file selection mechanism) to navigate outside of the intended working directory and access sensitive files on the server or the user's local machine (depending on the application's architecture). They might try to read configuration files, source code, or other sensitive data.
*   **Impact:** High. Could lead to data breaches, code disclosure, and potentially system compromise.
*   **Affected Brackets Component:** `FileSystem` module (specifically the functions related to file opening, saving, and directory traversal), `ProjectManager` (which manages the current project's root directory).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restricted Root Directory:** Configure Brackets to operate within a strictly defined root directory. Prevent users from navigating outside of this directory.
    *   **Path Validation:** Implement server-side validation of all file paths provided by Brackets. Reject any paths that contain ".." or other suspicious characters. Use a whitelist approach, allowing only specific file extensions and directory structures.
    *   **Chroot Jail (Server-Side):** If Brackets is interacting with a server-side file system, consider using a chroot jail to confine its access to a specific directory tree.
    *   **Least Privilege:** Ensure that the user account under which Brackets (or the server-side component interacting with it) runs has the minimum necessary file system permissions.

## Threat: [Brackets Core Vulnerability Exploitation](./threats/brackets_core_vulnerability_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:**  Remote Code Execution via a Brackets Core Bug
*   **Description:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in Brackets' core code (e.g., a buffer overflow in a parsing function, an insecure deserialization vulnerability). They craft a malicious file or input that triggers the vulnerability when processed by Brackets, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical. Could lead to complete compromise of the Brackets instance and potentially the wider application.
*   **Affected Brackets Component:** Potentially any part of the Brackets core codebase (e.g., `EditorManager`, `DocumentManager`, `CommandManager`, specific parsing functions, etc.).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Brackets updated to the latest stable version. Monitor the Brackets release notes and security advisories.
    *   **Security Audits:** If feasible, conduct periodic security audits of the Brackets codebase (or the parts integrated into the application).
    *   **Fuzzing:** Consider using fuzzing techniques to identify potential vulnerabilities in Brackets' input handling.
    *   **Memory Safety (Long-Term):** Explore the possibility of migrating parts of Brackets to memory-safe languages (e.g., Rust) to mitigate memory-related vulnerabilities.
