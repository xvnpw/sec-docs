# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for adobe/brackets

## Mitigation Strategy: [Restrict Extension Installation Sources](./mitigation_strategies/restrict_extension_installation_sources.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Brackets to only allow extensions from the official Brackets Extension Registry (if accessible).**  If possible, configure Brackets settings or use command-line arguments to restrict extension installation sources to the official registry URL.
    2.  **Disable or remove the Extension Manager UI if feasible.** If the development workflow doesn't require frequent extension installations, explore options to disable or remove the Extension Manager UI within Brackets to prevent accidental browsing and installation of extensions. (Note: Check Brackets documentation for UI customization options).
    3.  **If external sources are absolutely necessary, maintain a curated list of approved extension sources.**  If extensions from outside the official registry are required, create and maintain a documented list of explicitly trusted and verified sources (e.g., specific GitHub organizations or websites). Only allow extensions from these curated sources.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Extension Installation via Brackets Extension Manager (High Severity):** Reduces the risk of developers being tricked into installing malicious extensions directly through the Brackets built-in Extension Manager or by browsing untrusted online sources linked within Brackets.
    *   **Vulnerable Extension Installation from Untrusted Sources (Medium Severity):** Mitigates the risk of installing extensions with known or unknown vulnerabilities from unofficial or unverified sources that are easily accessible through Brackets' extension features.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Extension Installation via Brackets Extension Manager:** High reduction. Significantly limits the attack vector of malicious extensions installed through Brackets' intended mechanisms.
    *   **Vulnerable Extension Installation from Untrusted Sources:** Medium reduction.  Effective if the official registry is still maintained and secure, and if the curated list of external sources is rigorously managed.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Brackets configuration to restrict sources, disabling Extension Manager UI (if possible), curated list of approved sources.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Extension Review and Auditing within Brackets](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_extension_review_and_auditing_within_brackets.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Mandate permission review within the Brackets Extension Manager before installation.**  Train developers to carefully examine the permissions requested by each extension *within the Brackets Extension Manager interface* before clicking "Install." Emphasize caution regarding extensions requesting broad permissions like file system or network access.
    2.  **Implement a process for reporting suspicious extensions found within the Brackets Extension Manager.**  Establish a clear channel for developers to report any extensions listed in the Brackets Extension Manager that appear suspicious, have unclear descriptions, or request unusual permissions.
    3.  **Conduct periodic reviews of installed extensions *within Brackets*.** Regularly use the Brackets Extension Manager to review the list of installed extensions on developer machines. Re-evaluate the necessity of each extension and check for any newly discovered information about extension vulnerabilities (even if updates are unlikely).
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Brackets Extensions (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents installation of extensions that could abuse their permissions within the Brackets environment to escalate privileges and access project files or system resources.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Brackets Extensions (Medium to High Severity):** Reduces the risk of extensions installed through Brackets exfiltrating project data or developer information via network access granted to the extension.
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerable Brackets Extensions (Medium Severity):** Audits within Brackets can help identify potentially risky extensions, even without updates, prompting mitigation actions like disabling them within Brackets.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Privilege Escalation via Brackets Extensions:** Medium to High reduction. Relies on developer vigilance and a clear reporting process.
    *   **Data Exfiltration via Brackets Extensions:** Medium to High reduction. Effective permission review is crucial within the Brackets workflow.
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerable Brackets Extensions:** Medium reduction. Audits within Brackets can raise awareness, but mitigation is limited by Brackets' EOL status.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Mandatory permission review process, reporting channel for suspicious extensions, scheduled periodic extension reviews using Brackets' Extension Manager.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Minimize Extension Usage in Brackets](./mitigation_strategies/minimize_extension_usage_in_brackets.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Promote using Brackets' core features instead of extensions whenever possible.** Encourage developers to leverage Brackets' built-in functionalities for code editing, debugging, and project management before seeking extensions for additional features.
    2.  **Establish a policy to justify the installation of each Brackets extension.** Require developers to provide a clear justification for installing any new extension in Brackets, explaining why it's necessary and how it enhances their workflow beyond Brackets' core capabilities.
    3.  **Regularly review and uninstall unused Brackets extensions.**  Periodically use the Brackets Extension Manager to identify and uninstall extensions that are no longer actively used or needed by developers.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface of Brackets (Medium Severity):** Reducing the number of extensions directly minimizes the potential attack surface of the Brackets application itself, as fewer extensions mean fewer potential points of vulnerability within Brackets.
    *   **Performance Issues within Brackets (Low Severity, Security-related):**  Excessive extensions can sometimes degrade Brackets' performance, which can indirectly impact security by making developers less efficient and potentially more prone to errors while using Brackets.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Increased Attack Surface of Brackets:** Medium reduction. Directly related to how effectively extension usage is minimized within Brackets.
    *   **Performance Issues within Brackets:** Low reduction (indirect security benefit within Brackets).
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Policy for justifying extensions, process for regular review and uninstallation of extensions within Brackets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Unnecessary Brackets Features (If Possible via Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/disable_unnecessary_brackets_features__if_possible_via_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Brackets configuration options for disabling features.** Explore Brackets' settings files (e.g., preferences files, configuration files) to identify any non-essential features that can be disabled without impacting core development workflows.
    2.  **Disable features like Live Preview if not consistently required.** If Live Preview or other network-related features within Brackets are not essential for the majority of development tasks, consider disabling them by default or only enabling them when explicitly needed.
    3.  **Document disabled features and their security rationale.**  Clearly document any Brackets features that are disabled for security reasons and communicate this to the development team to ensure understanding and prevent accidental re-enabling of these features.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Specific Brackets Features (Medium Severity):** Disabling unnecessary features reduces the attack surface by eliminating potential vulnerabilities within those specific features of Brackets itself. For example, disabling Live Preview can mitigate risks associated with browser-based vulnerabilities if Live Preview rendering has security flaws.
    *   **Unintended Network Exposure from Brackets Features (Low to Medium Severity):** Disabling network-related features within Brackets, if possible, can reduce the risk of unintended network connections or data leaks from Brackets processes.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Specific Brackets Features:** Medium reduction. Depends on the specific features disabled and their vulnerability potential.
    *   **Unintended Network Exposure from Brackets Features:** Low to Medium reduction. Effective if network features are indeed disabled and were a potential risk.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Review of Brackets configuration options, identification of disableable features, documentation of disabled features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Be Mindful of `.brackets.json` Files in Brackets Projects](./mitigation_strategies/be_mindful_of___brackets_json__files_in_brackets_projects.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Educate developers about the purpose and potential risks of `.brackets.json` files.** Ensure developers understand that `.brackets.json` files are project-specific configuration files for Brackets and that they should not contain sensitive information.
    2.  **Avoid storing sensitive data in `.brackets.json` files.**  Explicitly prohibit storing credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information directly within `.brackets.json` files in Brackets projects.
    3.  **Exercise caution when opening projects with `.brackets.json` files from untrusted sources in Brackets.**  When opening projects from unknown or untrusted sources in Brackets, be aware that `.brackets.json` files could potentially contain malicious configurations or attempt to exploit Brackets features. Review these files if there is any suspicion.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via `.brackets.json` (Low to Medium Severity):** Prevents accidental or intentional storage of sensitive information in `.brackets.json` files, reducing the risk of information disclosure if these files are exposed or compromised.
    *   **Potential Configuration-Based Attacks via `.brackets.json` (Low Severity):** Mitigates the risk of attackers crafting malicious `.brackets.json` files to exploit potential vulnerabilities in how Brackets parses or handles these configuration files (though direct exploitability might be limited).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure via `.brackets.json`:** Low to Medium reduction. Depends on the sensitivity of data potentially stored and the exposure risk of `.brackets.json` files.
    *   **Potential Configuration-Based Attacks via `.brackets.json`:** Low reduction.  Mitigation is preventative against potential, but possibly limited, attack vectors.
*   **Currently Implemented:** No
*   **Missing Implementation:** Developer education on `.brackets.json` risks, policy against storing sensitive data, awareness procedures for untrusted projects with `.brackets.json`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Live Preview in Brackets for Untrusted Code](./mitigation_strategies/disable_live_preview_in_brackets_for_untrusted_code.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish a policy to disable Live Preview by default when working with untrusted projects in Brackets.**  Implement a guideline that developers should always disable the Live Preview feature in Brackets when opening or working with code from sources that are not fully trusted.
    2.  **Provide clear instructions on how to disable Live Preview within Brackets.**  Ensure developers know how to easily disable Live Preview in Brackets through the user interface or settings.
    3.  **Reinforce the risks of using Live Preview with untrusted code.**  Educate developers about the potential security risks associated with Live Preview, particularly the possibility of executing malicious JavaScript or triggering browser-based vulnerabilities if the code being previewed is malicious.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Brackets Live Preview (Medium to High Severity):** Prevents potential XSS attacks that could occur if malicious JavaScript code within an untrusted project is executed within the browser context of Brackets' Live Preview feature.
    *   **Browser-Based Vulnerability Exploitation via Brackets Live Preview (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of triggering browser-based vulnerabilities through malicious code rendered by Brackets' Live Preview, potentially leading to code execution or other browser-related attacks.
