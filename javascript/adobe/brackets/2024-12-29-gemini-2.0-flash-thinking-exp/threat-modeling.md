### High and Critical Brackets Threats

This list details high and critical security threats directly involving the Brackets code editor.

*   **Threat:** Malicious Extension Installation
    *   **Description:** An attacker tricks a user into installing a malicious Brackets extension. This extension could then perform actions on behalf of the user within the Brackets environment or potentially interact with the underlying system if Brackets has sufficient privileges. The attacker might distribute the extension through unofficial channels or compromise legitimate extension repositories.
    *   **Impact:** Data exfiltration from open files or project directories, injection of malicious code into projects, unauthorized access to system resources if Brackets has those permissions, denial of service by crashing Brackets or consuming resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** Extension Manager, Extension APIs
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Only install extensions from trusted sources (official Brackets extension registry or verified developers).
        *   Review extension permissions before installation.
        *   Implement a process for vetting and approving extensions within an organization.
        *   Regularly review installed extensions and remove any that are no longer needed or appear suspicious.
        *   Consider using a sandboxed environment for Brackets if possible.

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Brackets Core Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability within the core Brackets application itself to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine. This could be triggered by opening a specially crafted file, interacting with a malicious website through Brackets' live preview feature, or exploiting a flaw in how Brackets handles specific protocols or data formats.
    *   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, including data theft, malware installation, and remote control of the affected machine.
    *   **Affected Component:** Potentially various core modules, including file handling, rendering engine (Chromium Embedded Framework), or Node.js integration.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Brackets updated to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Be cautious when opening files from untrusted sources.
        *   Exercise caution when using the live preview feature with untrusted websites.
        *   Consider running Brackets in a sandboxed environment with restricted permissions.

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via File Handling Vulnerability
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw in how Brackets handles file paths to access or modify files outside of the intended project directory. This could occur if Brackets doesn't properly sanitize or validate file paths provided by the user or through extensions.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive files on the user's system, modification or deletion of critical files, potential for escalating privileges if combined with other vulnerabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** File System API, file handling modules
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Brackets and its extensions properly sanitize and validate all file paths.
        *   Implement strict access controls and permissions for Brackets' file system operations.
        *   Avoid granting Brackets excessive file system permissions.

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Underlying Chromium/Node.js Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Brackets relies on the Chromium Embedded Framework (or similar) and Node.js. Vulnerabilities in these underlying technologies can be exploited through Brackets. An attacker might trigger these vulnerabilities by crafting specific content or interactions within the Brackets environment.
    *   **Impact:** RCE, sandbox escape (if Brackets is running in a sandbox), denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Chromium Embedded Framework, Node.js runtime
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Brackets updated, as updates often include patches for vulnerabilities in its underlying technologies.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Chromium and Node.js.
        *   Consider running Brackets in a more isolated environment.
