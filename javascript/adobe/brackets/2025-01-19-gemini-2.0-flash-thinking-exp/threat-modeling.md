# Threat Model Analysis for adobe/brackets

## Threat: [Malicious Extension Installation](./threats/malicious_extension_installation.md)

**Description:** An attacker could trick a developer into installing a malicious Brackets extension from the official registry or a third-party source. This could involve social engineering or exploiting vulnerabilities in the extension installation process. The malicious extension could then execute arbitrary code within the Brackets environment, potentially gaining access to project files, sensitive data, or even the developer's system.

**Impact:** Data breaches, code injection into projects, compromised developer workstations, potential for further attacks on internal systems.

**Affected Component:** Extension Manager, Node.js integration within extensions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Only install extensions from trusted developers and sources.
* Carefully review extension permissions before installation.
* Regularly review installed extensions and remove any that are no longer needed or seem suspicious.
* Implement a process for vetting extensions within the development team.
* Keep Brackets and its extensions updated to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Brackets Core Vulnerability Leading to File System Access](./threats/brackets_core_vulnerability_leading_to_file_system_access.md)

**Description:** A vulnerability within the core Brackets application itself (e.g., in its file handling, project management, or live preview features) could be exploited by an attacker. This could allow them to bypass intended access controls and read or write arbitrary files on the developer's file system, even outside the current project scope.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive source code, configuration files, credentials, or other confidential data; potential for modifying or deleting critical files.

**Affected Component:** Core Brackets application (specific module depending on the vulnerability, e.g., `filesystem`, `project`, `editor`).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep Brackets updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
* Follow security best practices for the operating system and user account running Brackets.
* Limit the privileges of the user account running Brackets.
* Be cautious when opening projects from untrusted sources.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle Attack on Brackets Updates](./threats/man-in-the-middle_attack_on_brackets_updates.md)

**Description:** If the update mechanism for Brackets is not properly secured (e.g., using HTTPS without proper certificate validation), an attacker performing a man-in-the-middle attack could intercept update requests and deliver a malicious version of Brackets to the developer.

**Impact:** Installation of a compromised version of Brackets, potentially leading to all the threats mentioned above.

**Affected Component:** Update mechanism, network communication.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure Brackets uses secure HTTPS connections for updates with proper certificate validation.
* Verify the integrity of downloaded updates (if possible).
* Rely on the official Brackets distribution channels for updates.
