# Attack Tree Analysis for adobe/brackets

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To compromise an application that uses the Brackets code editor by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within Brackets itself.

## Attack Tree Visualization

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities -> Execute Arbitrary JavaScript Code within Brackets Context](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_injection_vulnerabilities_-_execute_arbitrary_javascript_code_within_brackets_context.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages a vulnerability in Brackets' code or a Brackets API to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the Brackets application. This could involve exploiting flaws in how Brackets handles user input, processes data, or interacts with external resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Code Injection Vulnerabilities -> Execute Arbitrary Native Code via Node.js Integration](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_code_injection_vulnerabilities_-_execute_arbitrary_native_code_via_node_js_integration.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in the integration between Brackets and its underlying Node.js environment. This allows them to execute arbitrary commands directly on the host operating system, bypassing the security restrictions of the browser environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities -> Escape Brackets Sandbox (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_privilege_escalation_vulnerabilities_-_escape_brackets_sandbox__if_applicable_.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker identifies and exploits a vulnerability in the sandbox technology (likely Chromium's sandbox) that Brackets uses to isolate its processes. Successfully escaping the sandbox grants the attacker access to the underlying operating system and its resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Brackets Extension Vulnerabilities -> Execute Arbitrary Code via Extension Vulnerability](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_brackets_extension_vulnerabilities_-_execute_arbitrary_code_via_extension_vulnerability.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker targets a specific vulnerability within a Brackets extension that has been installed. By exploiting this flaw, they can execute malicious code within the context of that extension, potentially gaining access to Brackets' functionalities or the user's system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Install Malicious Extension -> Trick User into Installing Malicious Extension](./attack_tree_paths/install_malicious_extension_-_trick_user_into_installing_malicious_extension.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker uses social engineering tactics or other deceptive methods to convince a user to install a Brackets extension that is actually malicious. Once installed, the extension can perform actions as if it were a legitimate part of Brackets, potentially compromising the application or the user's system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Brackets' Local File System Access -> Read Sensitive Application Files -> Access Configuration Files](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_brackets'_local_file_system_access_-_read_sensitive_application_files_-_access_configuration_6421608a.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits Brackets' ability to access the local file system to read sensitive configuration files belonging to the application. These files might contain credentials, API keys, or other sensitive information that could be used for further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Brackets' Local File System Access -> Modify Application Files -> Inject Malicious Code into Application Files](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_brackets'_local_file_system_access_-_modify_application_files_-_inject_malicious_code_into_a_7af8eedc.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages Brackets' file writing capabilities to inject malicious code directly into the application's core files. This allows them to alter the application's behavior, introduce backdoors, or steal sensitive information.
