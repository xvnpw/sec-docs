# Attack Surface Analysis for adobe/brackets

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Brackets Extensions](./attack_surfaces/malicious_brackets_extensions.md)

**Description:** Third-party extensions can introduce vulnerabilities or malicious functionality.

**How Brackets Contributes:** Brackets' architecture allows for the installation and execution of extensions, expanding its capabilities but also its attack surface.

**Example:** A seemingly harmless extension could exfiltrate user data, inject malicious code into opened files, or perform unauthorized actions on the file system.

**Impact:** Data breach, code injection, arbitrary code execution, compromise of the development environment.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**  Thoroughly vet and review any extensions used in the development process. Consider using only well-established and reputable extensions. Implement security scanning for extensions if possible.
* **Users:** Be cautious when installing extensions. Only install extensions from trusted sources. Review extension permissions before installation. Regularly review and remove unused or suspicious extensions. Keep Brackets updated to benefit from any security fixes related to the extension system.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Brackets' Node.js Integration](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_brackets'_node_js_integration.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how Brackets utilizes Node.js can be exploited.

**How Brackets Contributes:** Brackets uses Node.js for backend tasks and interacting with the operating system. Vulnerabilities in the specific Node.js modules used *by Brackets* or in the way Brackets uses Node.js APIs can be exploited.

**Example:** A command injection vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system *through Brackets*. Path traversal vulnerabilities could allow access to sensitive files *via Brackets' file handling*.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, file system access, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:** Keep Brackets updated to benefit from security patches in the core application and its Node.js dependencies. Be mindful of how user input is used in conjunction with Node.js APIs *within Brackets*, especially for file system operations or command execution. Implement robust input validation and sanitization *within the Brackets application logic*.
* **Users:** Keep Brackets updated. Be cautious about opening projects from untrusted sources, as malicious project files could potentially exploit these vulnerabilities *within the Brackets environment*.

## Attack Surface: [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/chromium_embedded_framework__cef__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws in the underlying Chromium browser engine used by Brackets.

**How Brackets Contributes:** Brackets is built on CEF. Vulnerabilities in the specific version of Chromium used by Brackets directly impact the security of the application.

**Example:** A remote code execution vulnerability in the rendering engine could be triggered by opening a specially crafted file *within Brackets* or through the live preview feature.

**Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, denial of service, information disclosure.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**  Stay informed about security advisories for the specific version of CEF used by Brackets. Keep Brackets updated, as updates often include fixes for CEF vulnerabilities.
* **Users:** Keep Brackets updated. Be cautious about opening files from untrusted sources *within Brackets* or visiting untrusted websites through the live preview feature (if applicable).

## Attack Surface: [Local File System Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/local_file_system_access_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws allowing unauthorized access to the local file system.

**How Brackets Contributes:** As a code editor, Brackets inherently needs access to the file system. Vulnerabilities in how Brackets handles file paths and permissions can be exploited.

**Example:** A path traversal vulnerability could allow an attacker to read or write files outside of the intended project directory *through Brackets' file handling mechanisms*. Opening a specially crafted project file could trigger actions on arbitrary files *via Brackets' file processing*.

**Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, arbitrary code execution (by overwriting executable files).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers:**  Carefully sanitize and validate all user-provided file paths *within the Brackets application*. Avoid constructing file paths directly from user input *within Brackets' code*. Use secure file system APIs provided by Node.js and the operating system. Implement proper access controls within the application.
* **Users:** Be cautious about opening projects from untrusted sources *in Brackets*. Ensure that Brackets has only the necessary file system permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Brackets' Update Mechanism Compromise](./attack_surfaces/brackets'_update_mechanism_compromise.md)

**Description:**  The process of updating Brackets itself could be compromised.

**How Brackets Contributes:** Brackets has an auto-update mechanism. If this mechanism is not properly secured, attackers could potentially distribute malicious updates *for Brackets*.

**Example:** A man-in-the-middle attack could intercept the update process and replace a legitimate update with a malicious one *for Brackets*.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of user systems running the affected version of Brackets.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Developers (Brackets Team):** Implement secure update mechanisms, including using HTTPS for update downloads, signing update packages, and verifying signatures.
* **Users:** Ensure that your network connection is secure when Brackets is updating. Pay attention to any warnings or unusual behavior during the update process.
