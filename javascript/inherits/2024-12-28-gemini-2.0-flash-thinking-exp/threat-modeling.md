### High and Critical Threats Directly Involving `inherits`

This list details high and critical threats that directly involve the functionality of the `inherits` library.

* **Threat:** Prototype Pollution via Inherited Mutable Objects
    * **Description:** The `inherits` function establishes a prototype chain where subclasses inherit properties from superclasses. If a superclass defines a mutable object (like an array or a plain object) directly on its `prototype`, all subclasses and instances will share the *same* object. An attacker could modify this shared object through an instance of a subclass, and this modification will be visible to all other instances, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities. The core of this threat lies in how `inherits` sets up shared prototype properties.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Data Corruption:** Shared state across different parts of the application can be altered, leading to incorrect data and application logic failures.
        * **Logic Bypasses:** If inherited properties are used for access control, feature flags, or other critical logic, an attacker can manipulate them to bypass security checks or enable unintended functionalities.
        * **Remote Code Execution (Potentially):** In certain scenarios, manipulating prototype properties could lead to the execution of arbitrary code if the application uses these properties in a way that allows for it (though this is less direct and depends on the application's specific implementation).
    * **Affected Component:** The prototype chain established by the `inherits` function, specifically the shared prototype of the superclass.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Avoid Defining Mutable Objects Directly on Prototypes:**  Initialize mutable properties within the constructor of the superclass using `this`. This ensures each instance gets its own independent copy of the object.
        * **Defensive Programming:** Treat inherited properties with caution, especially if they are objects. Avoid directly modifying them unless the intention is to share state (which should be done with careful consideration).
        * **Consider Immutability:** If shared data is necessary, consider using immutable data structures or techniques to prevent accidental or malicious modifications.
