# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/pdf.js

## Attack Surface: [PDF Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/pdf_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in the logic pdf.js uses to interpret and process the structure of PDF files. These vulnerabilities are within the pdf.js parsing code itself.
*   **pdf.js Contribution:** pdf.js is *the* component responsible for parsing the complex PDF format. Bugs in its parsing algorithms are direct vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A maliciously crafted PDF with a deeply nested object structure causes a stack overflow in pdf.js during parsing, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution *within pdf.js*.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) if memory corruption is exploitable *within the pdf.js process*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on exploitability for RCE)

## Attack Surface: [Font Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/font_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how pdf.js processes and renders fonts embedded within PDF documents. These vulnerabilities are within pdf.js's font parsing and rendering code.
*   **pdf.js Contribution:** pdf.js must parse and render various font formats used in PDFs. Vulnerabilities in font handling *within pdf.js* can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A malicious PDF contains a crafted font file that, when parsed by pdf.js, triggers a buffer overflow *in pdf.js's font parsing routines*, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) *due to vulnerabilities in pdf.js font handling*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on exploitability for RCE)

## Attack Surface: [Image Handling Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/image_handling_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Flaws in how pdf.js processes and renders images embedded within PDF documents. These vulnerabilities are within pdf.js's image processing code or its use of image libraries.
*   **pdf.js Contribution:** pdf.js handles parsing and rendering various image formats embedded in PDFs. Vulnerabilities in image processing *within pdf.js or its image handling dependencies* can be exploited.
*   **Example:** A malicious PDF contains a crafted JPEG image that, when processed by pdf.js, triggers a memory corruption vulnerability in the image decoding library *used by pdf.js*, leading to a crash or potentially remote code execution.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) *due to image processing vulnerabilities triggered by pdf.js*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on exploitability for RCE)

## Attack Surface: [JavaScript in PDFs (If Enabled - CRITICAL)](./attack_surfaces/javascript_in_pdfs__if_enabled_-_critical_.md)

**Description:** Execution of JavaScript code embedded within PDF documents *due to misconfiguration or vulnerabilities in pdf.js that bypass the intended JavaScript disabling*.
*   **pdf.js Contribution:** While pdf.js *disables* JavaScript by default, misconfiguration *of pdf.js* or vulnerabilities *within pdf.js* could lead to its unintended execution.
*   **Example:** If JavaScript execution is accidentally enabled in *pdf.js configuration*, or a vulnerability in *pdf.js* bypasses the JavaScript disabling mechanism, a malicious PDF containing JavaScript can execute arbitrary code in the user's browser.
*   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Account Takeover, Data Theft, Full Compromise *due to arbitrary JavaScript execution enabled or bypassed via pdf.js*.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Attack Surface: [Outdated pdf.js Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_pdf_js_version.md)

**Description:** Using an old version of pdf.js that contains known security vulnerabilities *within pdf.js itself*.
*   **pdf.js Contribution:** Using an outdated version directly exposes the application to vulnerabilities that are present *in that specific version of pdf.js* and have been fixed in newer versions.
*   **Example:** An application uses an old version of pdf.js with a known buffer overflow vulnerability in PDF parsing *within pdf.js code*. An attacker exploits this vulnerability using a crafted PDF to gain remote code execution *by exploiting the known pdf.js vulnerability*.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, can range from DoS to RCE *based on the specific pdf.js vulnerability*.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the known vulnerabilities)
