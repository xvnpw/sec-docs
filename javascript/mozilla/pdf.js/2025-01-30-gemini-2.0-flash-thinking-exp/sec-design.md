# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a free and open-source JavaScript library for rendering PDF documents in web browsers.
  - Enable web developers to easily integrate PDF rendering capabilities into their web applications without relying on browser plugins.
  - Ensure accurate and performant rendering of PDF documents across different browsers and platforms.
  - Promote open web standards and accessibility by providing a standards-compliant PDF rendering solution.
  - Maintain a secure and reliable library to protect users from potential vulnerabilities in PDF documents.

- Most Important Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in pdf.js could be exploited by malicious actors to compromise users' browsers or systems when viewing PDF documents.
  - Rendering errors or inconsistencies could lead to misinterpretation of PDF content, potentially causing legal, financial, or reputational damage.
  - Performance issues or lack of browser compatibility could hinder user experience and adoption of pdf.js.
  - Dependence on community contributions and maintenance could lead to delays in addressing critical bugs or security issues if community support wanes.
  - Legal and compliance risks associated with handling and rendering potentially sensitive data contained within PDF documents, especially regarding privacy regulations.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Code reviews are likely conducted by Mozilla developers and community contributors as part of the pull request process. (Location: GitHub Pull Request process)
  - security control: Static code analysis tools and linters are likely used to identify potential code quality and security issues. (Location: Development process, potentially integrated into CI)
  - security control: Unit and integration tests are likely implemented to ensure the functionality and stability of the library, indirectly contributing to security by reducing bugs. (Location: Test suite within the repository)
  - security control: Vulnerability reporting process is in place, likely through Mozilla's security channels. (Location: Mozilla Security website and GitHub repository guidelines)
  - security control: Regular updates and patches are released to address identified vulnerabilities and bugs. (Location: GitHub releases and repository commit history)
  - accepted risk: Reliance on browser security model for isolation and sandboxing of JavaScript code.
  - accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by pdf.js.
  - accepted risk: Risk of undiscovered vulnerabilities in complex PDF parsing and rendering logic.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits by external security experts.
  - security control: Implement a robust Content Security Policy (CSP) for web applications embedding pdf.js to mitigate potential XSS attacks.
  - security control: Enhance input validation and sanitization for PDF document parsing to prevent injection attacks.
  - security control: Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for including pdf.js in web pages to ensure integrity and prevent tampering.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for pdf.js library itself, as it is a client-side library. Authentication might be relevant for systems that serve or manage PDF documents that use pdf.js for rendering.
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to pdf.js library. Authorization is relevant in the context of web applications using pdf.js to control access to PDF documents and functionalities.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Strictly validate and sanitize all input data related to PDF documents, including file headers, metadata, and content streams, to prevent injection attacks and parsing vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Implement robust error handling for invalid or malformed PDF documents to prevent unexpected behavior or crashes.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Properly handle encrypted PDF documents, ensuring secure decryption and rendering according to PDF standards.
    - Requirement: Utilize secure cryptographic libraries and best practices when implementing cryptographic operations within pdf.js, if any.
    - Requirement: Protect sensitive data within PDF documents from unauthorized access or modification during rendering and processing.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Secure and accurate rendering of PDF documents in web browsers.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the pdf.js library.
  - Protecting users from potential security vulnerabilities when viewing PDF documents using pdf.js.

- Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
  - PDF Document Content: Sensitivity varies greatly depending on the content of the PDF. PDFs can contain highly sensitive personal data, financial information, confidential business documents, or other sensitive information. The sensitivity level is determined by the content of each individual PDF document.
  - pdf.js Library Code: While the code is open source, its integrity and availability are important. Tampering with the code or making it unavailable could disrupt services relying on pdf.js and potentially introduce vulnerabilities. Sensitivity is moderate to high, as it's a widely used library.
  - User Data (indirectly): pdf.js itself does not directly collect user data. However, vulnerabilities in pdf.js could be exploited to access user data in the context of web applications embedding the library. Indirect sensitivity is high, as vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the process for handling and prioritizing security vulnerability reports for pdf.js?
