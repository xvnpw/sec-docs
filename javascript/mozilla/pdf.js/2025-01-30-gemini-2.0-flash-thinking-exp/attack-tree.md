## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit PDF Parsing Vulnerabilities -> 1.1. Trigger Memory Corruption](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_pdf_parsing_vulnerabilities_-_1_1__trigger_memory_corruption.md)

*   **Description:** This high-risk path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the pdf.js PDF parser that lead to memory corruption. Successful exploitation can result in arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.

    *   **1.1.1. Buffer Overflow in Parser (Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a malicious PDF file with overly long fields or deeply nested structures designed to overflow buffers during the parsing process.
        *   **Exploit:** The attacker creates a PDF that, when parsed by pdf.js, causes the parser to write data beyond the allocated buffer boundaries, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions. This can be used to inject and execute malicious code or cause a crash.

    *   **1.1.2. Heap Overflow in Object Handling (Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Creating a malicious PDF file with a large number of objects or complex object relationships intended to exhaust heap memory and trigger overflows during object handling.
        *   **Exploit:** The attacker crafts a PDF that forces pdf.js to allocate excessive memory on the heap for object management. By carefully structuring the PDF, the attacker can trigger a heap overflow, potentially overwriting critical data structures and gaining control of program execution.

    *   **1.1.3. Use-After-Free Vulnerability (Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Crafting a malicious PDF file that triggers incorrect memory management within pdf.js, leading to a situation where memory is freed and then subsequently accessed again.
        *   **Exploit:** The attacker creates a PDF that exploits timing or race conditions in pdf.js's memory management. This can lead to the use of memory that has already been freed, potentially containing attacker-controlled data. By manipulating the contents of the freed memory before it's reused, the attacker can achieve code execution or other malicious outcomes.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit JavaScript Vulnerabilities in pdf.js Code -> 2.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via PDF Content Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_javascript_vulnerabilities_in_pdf_js_code_-_2_1__cross-site_scripting__xss__via_pdf_conte_f8bfa8d4.md)

*   **Description:** This high-risk path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities in the JavaScript code of pdf.js that allow for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks through malicious PDF content. Successful XSS exploitation allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser when viewing the PDF.

    *   **2.1.1. XSS in Annotation Handling (Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Embedding malicious JavaScript code within PDF annotations, such as using JavaScript actions associated with annotations.
        *   **Exploit:** The attacker injects JavaScript code into PDF annotations. When pdf.js renders the PDF and processes these annotations, the malicious JavaScript is executed within the user's browser, allowing the attacker to perform actions like stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or defacing the application.

    *   **2.1.2. XSS in Form Field Rendering (Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into PDF form fields.
        *   **Exploit:** Similar to annotation XSS, the attacker embeds JavaScript within PDF form fields. When pdf.js renders the form and the user interacts with these fields (e.g., clicks or focuses on them), the injected JavaScript is executed, leading to client-side compromise.

    *   **2.1.3. XSS in SVG or other Embedded Content (Critical Node)**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Embedding malicious SVG or other content types within the PDF that can execute JavaScript when rendered by pdf.js.
        *   **Exploit:** The attacker embeds malicious content, such as SVG files containing JavaScript, within the PDF. When pdf.js renders this embedded content, the JavaScript within the SVG (or other vulnerable format) is executed in the browser, enabling XSS attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.2.3. Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./attack_tree_paths/1_2_3__denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Creating a highly complex or deeply nested PDF file that consumes excessive CPU or memory resources during parsing and rendering.
*   **Exploit:** The attacker crafts a PDF designed to be computationally expensive for pdf.js to process. This could involve deeply nested objects, extremely large files, or complex rendering instructions. When pdf.js attempts to parse and render this malicious PDF, it consumes excessive resources, leading to application slowdown, unresponsiveness, or complete crash, effectively denying service to legitimate users.
