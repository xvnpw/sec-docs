# Deep Analysis: Crafted Font Attack Path in PDF.js

## 1. Objective

This deep analysis aims to thoroughly examine the "Crafted Font" attack path within the context of a PDF.js-based application.  The primary objective is to understand the specific vulnerabilities, exploitation techniques, and potential impact associated with this attack vector, and to provide actionable recommendations for mitigation and prevention.  We will focus on identifying *how* a crafted font can lead to exploitation, not just *that* it can.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the following:

*   **Target Application:**  Applications utilizing the Mozilla PDF.js library for rendering PDF documents.  This includes web applications, browser extensions, and potentially desktop applications that embed PDF.js.
*   **Attack Vector:**  Maliciously crafted fonts embedded within PDF documents.  We will *not* cover attacks involving externally loaded fonts (e.g., from a CDN) unless they are directly related to the parsing of embedded fonts.
*   **Vulnerability Types:**  We will consider vulnerabilities within the font parsing engine of PDF.js, including (but not limited to):
    *   Buffer overflows/underflows
    *   Integer overflows/underflows
    *   Type confusion
    *   Use-after-free
    *   Out-of-bounds reads/writes
    *   Logic errors leading to incorrect state
*   **Exploitation Outcomes:**  We will consider the potential consequences of successful exploitation, including:
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE)
    *   Information Disclosure (memory leaks)
    *   Denial of Service (DoS)

## 3. Methodology

This analysis will employ a multi-faceted approach:

1.  **Vulnerability Research:**  We will review publicly available vulnerability databases (CVE, NVD, etc.), security advisories from Mozilla, and bug reports related to PDF.js and its font parsing components (especially OpenType and CFF parsing).  We will also examine past exploits and proof-of-concept (PoC) code.
2.  **Code Review (Targeted):**  We will perform a targeted code review of relevant sections of the PDF.js codebase, focusing on the font parsing logic.  This will involve identifying areas where crafted font data could potentially trigger vulnerabilities.  We will prioritize areas identified in vulnerability research.
3.  **Fuzzing (Conceptual):**  While we won't conduct live fuzzing as part of this *analysis document*, we will describe how fuzzing could be used to identify vulnerabilities in the font parsing engine.  This includes discussing appropriate fuzzing targets, input generation strategies, and crash analysis techniques.
4.  **Exploitation Scenario Analysis:**  We will develop realistic scenarios demonstrating how a crafted font vulnerability could be exploited in a real-world application.  This will include considering the attacker's capabilities and the user's interaction with the PDF.
5.  **Mitigation Recommendation:**  Based on the findings, we will provide specific, actionable recommendations for mitigating the risk of crafted font attacks.  This will include both short-term (e.g., configuration changes) and long-term (e.g., code hardening) solutions.

## 4. Deep Analysis of the "Crafted Font" Attack Path

**4.1. Attack Steps Breakdown and Vulnerability Analysis:**

Let's break down the provided attack steps and analyze each one in detail:

1.  **Attacker crafts a PDF with a malicious embedded font:**

    *   **Techniques:** The attacker would use tools to create or modify a font file (e.g., FontForge, custom scripts).  They would specifically target known vulnerabilities or weaknesses in font parsing libraries.  Common techniques include:
        *   **Malformed Table Entries:**  Manipulating the size, offset, or count fields in font tables (e.g., `glyf`, `loca`, `head`, `hhea`, `maxp`, `CFF `) to cause out-of-bounds reads or writes.
        *   **Integer Overflow/Underflow:**  Crafting values that, when processed by the font parser, result in integer overflows or underflows, leading to incorrect memory allocation or calculations.
        *   **Type Confusion:**  Exploiting inconsistencies in how different font data types are handled, potentially leading to the misinterpretation of data and unexpected behavior.
        *   **Invalid Glyph Data:**  Providing corrupted or malformed glyph data that triggers errors during rendering or processing.
        *   **Exploiting CFF (Compact Font Format) Specifics:** CFF, used in OpenType fonts, has its own set of potential vulnerabilities related to its indexing and data structures.  Attackers might craft malicious CFF operators or data streams.
    *   **Tools:** FontForge, AFDKO (Adobe Font Development Kit for OpenType), custom Python scripts (using libraries like `fontTools`), hex editors.

2.  **User opens the PDF:**

    *   **Context:** This could happen in a web browser (PDF.js is often used as the default PDF viewer), a dedicated PDF reader application that embeds PDF.js, or even a server-side process that uses PDF.js for document processing.  The user might open the PDF directly, or it might be embedded within a webpage.
    *   **Implicit Trust:** The user generally trusts that the PDF viewer will handle the document safely.  This is a critical point of vulnerability.

3.  **pdf.js attempts to parse the embedded font:**

    *   **Parsing Process:** PDF.js uses its own font parsing engine (it doesn't rely on the operating system's font rendering).  This engine reads the font data from the PDF, interprets the various font tables, and prepares the font for rendering.  Key components involved:
        *   **`src/core/fonts.js`:**  This file likely contains the core font parsing logic.
        *   **OpenType and CFF Parsers:**  Specific parsers for handling different font formats.
        *   **Glyph Rendering:**  Code responsible for converting the parsed font data into visual glyphs.
    *   **Vulnerable Areas:**  The most likely areas for vulnerabilities are within the parsing of complex font tables, especially those involving offsets, lengths, and indices.  Error handling is also crucial; a lack of proper error checking can lead to exploitable conditions.

4.  **A vulnerability in the font parsing engine is triggered:**

    *   **Example Vulnerability (Buffer Overflow):**  Let's imagine a hypothetical buffer overflow in the `glyf` table parser.  The `glyf` table contains the outlines of the glyphs.  If the attacker crafts a `glyf` table entry with a maliciously large `numberOfContours` value, and the parser doesn't properly validate this value against the allocated buffer size, a buffer overflow can occur when the parser attempts to read the contour data.
    *   **Example Vulnerability (Integer Overflow):**  An integer overflow could occur if the attacker manipulates the `numGlyphs` field in the `maxp` table and a related size calculation in the `loca` table.  If `numGlyphs` is very large, the calculation of the size of the `loca` table might overflow, leading to a smaller-than-expected allocation.  Subsequent writes to the `loca` table could then overflow the buffer.
    *   **Example Vulnerability (Use-After-Free):** A more complex scenario could involve a use-after-free vulnerability. If the font parser incorrectly manages memory during error handling (e.g., frees a font data structure but later attempts to access it), an attacker could potentially exploit this to gain control.

5.  **The vulnerability leads to an exploitable condition:**

    *   **Exploitation Techniques:**
        *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (ACE):**  The most severe outcome.  A buffer overflow or use-after-free could allow the attacker to overwrite critical data structures (e.g., function pointers, return addresses) and redirect execution to their own malicious code (shellcode).  This shellcode could then perform any action on the user's system.
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  An out-of-bounds read could allow the attacker to leak sensitive information from the application's memory, such as other parts of the PDF document, cookies, or even data from other applications.
        *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A crash caused by a buffer overflow or other error could simply make the application unusable, preventing the user from accessing the PDF or other functionality.
    *   **JavaScript Context:**  Since PDF.js is written in JavaScript, the exploitation would typically occur within the JavaScript engine's context.  This means the attacker would be limited by the sandbox provided by the browser or application.  However, "sandbox escapes" are possible, and even within the sandbox, the attacker could potentially steal data, modify the DOM, or perform other malicious actions.

**4.2. Fuzzing Strategy (Conceptual):**

Fuzzing is a powerful technique for discovering vulnerabilities in software that processes complex inputs. Here's how we could apply fuzzing to PDF.js's font parsing engine:

*   **Target:**  The primary target would be the functions responsible for parsing embedded fonts within PDF.js.  This includes functions that handle OpenType and CFF formats.
*   **Input Generation:**
    *   **Mutation-Based Fuzzing:**  Start with valid PDF files containing embedded fonts.  Use a fuzzer (e.g., AFL, libFuzzer, Honggfuzz) to randomly mutate the font data within these PDFs.  The fuzzer would modify bytes, bits, and words within the font tables, attempting to trigger unexpected behavior.
    *   **Grammar-Based Fuzzing:**  A more sophisticated approach would be to use a grammar-based fuzzer.  This requires defining a grammar that describes the structure of font files (e.g., using a tool like Peach Fuzzer).  The fuzzer would then generate font data that conforms to the grammar but contains variations and edge cases designed to test the parser's robustness.
*   **Instrumentation:**  The fuzzer would need to be instrumented to detect crashes, hangs, and other anomalous behavior.  This could involve using AddressSanitizer (ASan) or other memory error detection tools.
*   **Crash Analysis:**  When a crash is detected, the fuzzer would save the input that caused the crash.  This input would then be analyzed to determine the root cause of the vulnerability.  This often involves debugging the PDF.js code and examining the memory state at the time of the crash.

**4.3. Exploitation Scenario:**

1.  **Attacker's Goal:**  The attacker wants to steal sensitive information from users who view a particular PDF document.
2.  **Preparation:**  The attacker researches known vulnerabilities in PDF.js's font parsing engine or uses fuzzing to discover a new zero-day vulnerability.  They craft a PDF with a malicious embedded font that exploits this vulnerability.  The exploit is designed to leak memory contents.
3.  **Distribution:**  The attacker distributes the malicious PDF through various channels, such as email attachments, malicious websites, or compromised file-sharing platforms.
4.  **User Interaction:**  A user downloads and opens the PDF in a web browser that uses PDF.js as its default PDF viewer.
5.  **Exploitation:**  PDF.js attempts to parse the malicious font.  The vulnerability is triggered, causing an out-of-bounds read.  The leaked memory contents are sent to the attacker's server (e.g., via an XMLHttpRequest).
6.  **Impact:**  The attacker successfully steals sensitive information from the user's browser, potentially including cookies, session tokens, or other confidential data.

## 5. Mitigation Recommendations

**5.1. Short-Term Mitigations:**

*   **Update PDF.js:**  Ensure that the application is using the latest version of PDF.js.  Mozilla regularly releases security updates to address vulnerabilities.  This is the *most crucial* short-term mitigation.
*   **Disable Embedded Fonts (If Possible):**  If the application's functionality allows it, consider disabling the rendering of embedded fonts.  This would significantly reduce the attack surface.  This might be a configuration option within the application or a setting that can be controlled by the user.  *Note:* This may impact the visual fidelity of some PDFs.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  Implement a strict CSP to limit the resources that the application can load.  This can help prevent the exfiltration of data if an exploit is successful.  Specifically, restrict `font-src` to trusted sources (or even `self` if possible).
*   **Sandboxing:** If PDF.js is used in a server-side context, ensure it runs within a sandboxed environment (e.g., a container) to limit the impact of a successful exploit.

**5.2. Long-Term Mitigations:**

*   **Code Hardening:**  Perform regular security audits and code reviews of the PDF.js codebase, focusing on the font parsing engine.  Address any identified vulnerabilities promptly.
*   **Fuzzing Integration:**  Integrate fuzzing into the development lifecycle of PDF.js.  Regularly fuzz the font parsing code to proactively discover and fix vulnerabilities.
*   **Memory Safety:**  Consider using memory-safe languages or techniques (e.g., Rust) for critical components of PDF.js, such as the font parsing engine.  This can help prevent many common types of vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflows and use-after-free errors.
*   **WASM (WebAssembly):** Explore using WebAssembly for font parsing.  WASM provides a more secure and sandboxed environment than traditional JavaScript, which can make exploitation more difficult.  This could involve rewriting parts of the font parsing engine in a language like C or Rust and compiling it to WASM.
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Implement robust input sanitization and validation checks throughout the font parsing process.  Verify the size, offset, and type of all data read from the font tables.  Reject any input that does not conform to the expected format.
* **Compartmentalization:** Break down the font parsing process into smaller, isolated modules. This can limit the impact of a vulnerability in one module from affecting other parts of the system.

**5.3. Developer-Specific Recommendations:**

*   **Follow Secure Coding Practices:**  Adhere to secure coding guidelines for JavaScript and C/C++ (if used for WASM).  Pay close attention to memory management, input validation, and error handling.
*   **Use Static Analysis Tools:**  Employ static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint, SonarQube) to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   **Stay Informed:**  Keep up-to-date with the latest security research and vulnerabilities related to PDF.js and font parsing.  Subscribe to security mailing lists and follow relevant security researchers.
