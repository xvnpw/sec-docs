# Deep Analysis: Unsafe Function Use in pdf.js Applications

## 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

### 1.1 Objective

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to identify, understand, and mitigate the risks associated with the misuse of pdf.js API functions within a web application.  We aim to pinpoint specific scenarios where incorrect API usage could lead to vulnerabilities, and to provide concrete recommendations for secure implementation.  This is *not* a general security audit of pdf.js itself, but rather a focused examination of how *our application* interacts with it.

### 1.2 Scope

This analysis focuses exclusively on the "Unsafe Function Use" attack path within the broader attack tree for applications using pdf.js.  This includes:

*   **API Misuse:**  Incorrect parameter types, out-of-bounds values, improper handling of return values, ignoring error conditions, and violations of the documented API contract.
*   **Undocumented Behavior:**  Reliance on undocumented features or behaviors of pdf.js, which are subject to change without notice and may have unintended security consequences.
*   **Interaction with Application Logic:** How the application's own code handles data received from or passed to pdf.js, particularly concerning input validation, sanitization, and output encoding.
*   **Specific pdf.js versions:** We will focus on the currently used version of pdf.js and consider potential vulnerabilities that may have been addressed in later releases.  We will also consider the implications of upgrading.

This analysis *excludes*:

*   **Zero-day vulnerabilities in pdf.js itself:**  We assume that the pdf.js library is, in its intended usage, reasonably secure.  Our focus is on *our* misuse.
*   **Other attack vectors:**  We are not examining XSS, CSRF, or other vulnerabilities unrelated to the specific misuse of pdf.js APIs.
*   **PDF file parsing vulnerabilities:** While related, this analysis focuses on the *API usage*, not the parsing of malicious PDF files (which would be a separate branch of the attack tree).

### 1.3 Methodology

The analysis will employ the following methodologies:

1.  **Code Review:**  A thorough manual review of the application's codebase, focusing on all interactions with the pdf.js library.  This will involve:
    *   Identifying all calls to pdf.js functions.
    *   Examining the parameters passed to these functions.
    *   Analyzing how the return values are handled.
    *   Checking for error handling and exception management.
    *   Tracing data flow to and from pdf.js.
    *   Searching for any use of `eval`, `Function`, or other potentially dangerous JavaScript constructs in conjunction with pdf.js data.

2.  **Static Analysis:**  Utilizing static analysis tools (e.g., ESLint with security-focused plugins, SonarQube) to automatically detect potential API misuse patterns and code quality issues.  This will help identify potential problems that might be missed during manual review.

3.  **Dynamic Analysis (Fuzzing):**  Developing targeted fuzzing tests to provide pdf.js with unexpected or malformed inputs through the application's API usage.  This will help uncover edge cases and potential vulnerabilities that might not be apparent during static analysis.  This will be *highly* focused on the API interaction points, not general PDF fuzzing.

4.  **Documentation Review:**  Carefully reviewing the official pdf.js API documentation and examples to ensure that the application's usage aligns with the intended design and best practices.  This includes checking for deprecated functions and security recommendations.

5.  **Threat Modeling:**  Considering specific attack scenarios based on the identified potential misuses.  This will help prioritize remediation efforts.

6.  **Penetration Testing (Limited Scope):** After identifying potential vulnerabilities, we will perform limited-scope penetration testing to confirm their exploitability and assess their impact. This will be focused specifically on the identified API misuse scenarios.

## 2. Deep Analysis of "Unsafe Function Use"

This section details the specific analysis of the attack tree path, breaking down the attack steps and providing examples and mitigation strategies.

**Attack Tree Path:** [[Unsafe Function Use]]

**Description:** The application uses pdf.js API functions in a way that is not intended or documented, or in a way that is known to be unsafe.

**Why Critical/High-Risk:** This can create vulnerabilities even if pdf.js itself is bug-free.  The application's incorrect interaction with the library becomes the weak point.

**Attack Steps:**

1.  **The application uses a pdf.js API function incorrectly.**
2.  **The incorrect usage creates a vulnerability (e.g., allows injection of untrusted data).**
3.  **The attacker exploits this vulnerability.**

Let's examine these steps in more detail, with specific examples and mitigation strategies:

### 2.1 Step 1: Incorrect API Usage - Examples and Analysis

This is the core of the problem.  Here are several concrete examples of how pdf.js APIs can be misused, leading to vulnerabilities:

**Example 1:  Ignoring `getTextContent()` Errors**

*   **Scenario:** The application uses `page.getTextContent()` to extract text from a PDF page and then displays this text directly on a webpage without proper sanitization.  The application *does not* check for errors during the `getTextContent()` call.
*   **Vulnerability:** If `getTextContent()` fails (e.g., due to a malformed PDF or an internal error), it might return `null` or `undefined`, or it might throw an exception that is not caught.  If the application doesn't handle this, it might inadvertently expose internal error messages or even crash.  More critically, if a later version of pdf.js changes the error handling behavior, the application might become vulnerable.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Always check for errors:** Wrap the `getTextContent()` call in a `try...catch` block and handle any exceptions gracefully.
    *   **Validate the return value:**  Ensure that the returned value is a valid object and that the `items` array exists and contains expected data.
    *   **Sanitize the output:**  Before displaying the extracted text, sanitize it to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.  Use a dedicated HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) to remove any potentially malicious HTML tags or attributes.

**Example 2:  Using `page.render()` with Untrusted `canvas` Context**

*   **Scenario:** The application allows users to upload PDF files, and then renders a preview of the first page using `page.render()`.  The application creates a new `<canvas>` element dynamically and passes its 2D context to `page.render()`. However, the application doesn't properly isolate this canvas or restrict its dimensions.
*   **Vulnerability:** An attacker could upload a specially crafted PDF file designed to trigger excessive memory allocation or CPU usage during the rendering process.  This could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack, making the application unresponsive.  If the canvas is somehow exposed to other parts of the application, it might also be possible to manipulate its contents.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Limit Canvas Dimensions:**  Set maximum width and height attributes on the `<canvas>` element to prevent excessively large renderings.
    *   **Use a Web Worker:**  Render the PDF in a separate Web Worker to isolate the rendering process from the main thread.  This prevents the main thread from becoming blocked and improves responsiveness.  If the worker crashes due to a malicious PDF, it won't take down the entire application.
    *   **Set Timeouts:**  Implement timeouts for the rendering process to prevent it from running indefinitely.
    *   **Consider OffscreenCanvas:** If supported by the target browsers, use `OffscreenCanvas` for rendering in the Web Worker, which can further improve performance and isolation.

**Example 3:  Incorrectly Handling `getAnnotations()`**

*   **Scenario:** The application uses `page.getAnnotations()` to retrieve annotations from a PDF page and then processes these annotations.  The application assumes that all annotations have a specific type or structure.
*   **Vulnerability:**  An attacker could upload a PDF file with unexpected or malformed annotations.  If the application doesn't properly validate the annotation data, it could lead to errors, crashes, or even code injection vulnerabilities (if the annotation data is used in an unsafe way, such as being passed to `eval()`).
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   **Validate Annotation Types:**  Check the `subtype` property of each annotation to ensure that it is of an expected type.
    *   **Sanitize Annotation Data:**  Sanitize any data extracted from annotations before using it in the application.  This is particularly important for annotations that contain text or URLs.
    *   **Handle Unexpected Annotations Gracefully:**  Implement error handling to gracefully handle unexpected or malformed annotations.

**Example 4: Relying on Undocumented Behavior**

* **Scenario:** The application uses a feature of pdf.js that is not documented in the official API documentation. This might be discovered through reverse engineering or experimentation.
* **Vulnerability:** Undocumented features are not guaranteed to be stable or secure. They may change or be removed in future versions of pdf.js, breaking the application. They may also have unintended security consequences that are not known.
* **Mitigation:**
    * **Strictly adhere to the documented API:** Avoid using any features or behaviors that are not explicitly documented in the official pdf.js API documentation.
    * **Contribute to the project:** If a needed feature is missing, consider contributing to the pdf.js project to have it officially added and documented.

### 2.2 Step 2: Vulnerability Creation

The incorrect API usage creates a vulnerability.  This could be:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  If extracted text or annotation data is displayed without sanitization.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  If the rendering process consumes excessive resources.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  If error messages or internal data are exposed.
*   **Code Injection:**  In rare cases, if annotation data or other extracted information is used in an unsafe way (e.g., passed to `eval()`).

### 2.3 Step 3: Attacker Exploitation

The attacker exploits the vulnerability by:

*   **Uploading a malicious PDF file:**  This is the most common attack vector.
*   **Crafting a malicious URL:**  If the application fetches PDFs from external URLs, the attacker could provide a URL pointing to a malicious PDF.
*   **Manipulating existing PDFs:**  If the application allows users to modify existing PDFs, the attacker could inject malicious content.

## 3. Conclusion and Recommendations

The "Unsafe Function Use" attack path represents a significant risk to applications using pdf.js.  By carefully reviewing the application's code, using static and dynamic analysis tools, and adhering to the documented API, developers can significantly reduce this risk.

**Key Recommendations:**

*   **Thorough Code Review:**  Conduct a comprehensive code review of all interactions with pdf.js, paying close attention to error handling, input validation, and output sanitization.
*   **Static Analysis:**  Integrate static analysis tools into the development workflow to automatically detect potential API misuse.
*   **Fuzzing:**  Develop targeted fuzzing tests to exercise the application's pdf.js integration with unexpected inputs.
*   **Documentation Adherence:**  Strictly adhere to the official pdf.js API documentation and avoid using undocumented features.
*   **Regular Updates:**  Keep pdf.js updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches and bug fixes.
*   **Web Workers:** Use Web Workers to isolate the PDF rendering process and prevent DoS attacks.
*   **Sanitization:**  Always sanitize any data extracted from PDFs before using it in the application, especially before displaying it to the user.
* **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure that the application only requests the necessary permissions and data from the PDF.js API. Avoid requesting unnecessary access to PDF features.

By implementing these recommendations, the development team can significantly improve the security of the application and protect it from vulnerabilities arising from the unsafe use of pdf.js API functions.
