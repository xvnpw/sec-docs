# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mozilla/pdf.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep pdf.js Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_pdf_js_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Current Version:** Determine the currently used version of pdf.js in your project. This is usually found in your project's `package.json` file (if using npm/yarn) or a similar dependency management file.
    2.  **Establish Update Mechanism:** Implement an automated update process.  For npm/yarn projects, this typically involves:
        *   Using `npm update pdfjs-dist` (or the equivalent yarn command) regularly.
        *   Integrating a dependency management tool like Dependabot or Snyk. These tools automatically scan your dependencies for updates and known vulnerabilities, creating pull requests to update them.
    3.  **Monitor for Releases:** Subscribe to the pdf.js GitHub repository's release notifications (or use the dependency management tools mentioned above). This ensures you're immediately aware of new versions, especially security releases.
    4.  **Testing After Update:** After updating, thoroughly test your application's PDF rendering functionality to ensure no regressions were introduced by the update.  Automated testing is highly recommended.
    5.  **Rollback Plan:** Have a clear plan to revert to the previous version of pdf.js if a critical issue arises after an update.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE) (Critical):**  Exploits targeting known vulnerabilities in older pdf.js versions can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High):**  Vulnerabilities can allow attackers to inject malicious scripts into the context of your web application, potentially stealing user data or performing actions on their behalf.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium):**  Some vulnerabilities can cause pdf.js to crash or consume excessive resources, making the application unavailable.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low-Medium):**  Vulnerabilities might allow attackers to extract sensitive information from the PDF or the user's environment.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:**  Risk reduction: Very High (mitigates the most severe threat).
    *   **XSS:**  Risk reduction: High.
    *   **DoS:**  Risk reduction: Medium.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Partially Implemented.  `package.json` specifies `pdfjs-dist`, but automated updates (Dependabot/Snyk) are not yet configured. Manual updates are performed sporadically.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example: Automated update mechanism (Dependabot/Snyk) is missing.  Regular, scheduled testing after updates is not formalized. A rollback plan is not documented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Disable Potentially Dangerous Features](./mitigation_strategies/disable_potentially_dangerous_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Configuration Options:**  Examine the pdf.js API documentation (specifically the `getDocument` and related options) to understand all available configuration settings.
    2.  **Identify Unnecessary Features:** Determine which features are *not* essential for your application's core functionality.  Prioritize disabling:
        *   `enableXfa`: Set to `false` unless absolutely required for rendering specific PDF forms.
        *   `disableAutoFetch`: Set to `true` to prevent automatic fetching of external resources.
        *   `disableFontFace`: Set to `true` if custom font rendering is not needed.
        *   `isEvalSupported`: Set to `false` if possible (requires thorough testing).
        *   `disableRange`: Set to `true` to prevent partial content requests.
        *   `disableStream`: Set to `true` to disable streaming.
    3.  **Implement Configuration Changes:** Modify your application's code to explicitly set these options when initializing pdf.js.  For example:
        ```javascript
        pdfjsLib.getDocument({
            url: pdfUrl,
            enableXfa: false,
            disableAutoFetch: true,
            disableFontFace: true,
            isEvalSupported: false, // If possible
            disableRange: true,
            disableStream: true
        }).promise.then(function(pdf) {
            // ... your rendering code ...
        });
        ```
    4.  **Thorough Testing:**  After making configuration changes, rigorously test your application with a variety of PDF files to ensure that the necessary functionality is still working correctly and that no unexpected rendering issues occur.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **RCE (Critical):**  Disabling features like XFA and `eval()` reduces the attack surface for code execution vulnerabilities.
    *   **XSS (High):**  Limiting external resource fetching reduces the risk of injecting malicious scripts.
    *   **DoS (Medium):**  Disabling features like range requests and streaming can mitigate some DoS attacks.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low-Medium):**  Restricting external resource access reduces the potential for leaking information.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk reduction: Medium-High.
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: Medium.
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduction: Low-Medium.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Partially Implemented. `disableAutoFetch` is set to `true`. Other options are at their default values.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  `enableXfa`, `disableFontFace`, `isEvalSupported`, `disableRange`, and `disableStream` are not explicitly configured.  A comprehensive review of configuration options and their security implications has not been performed.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sandboxing (Web Workers)](./mitigation_strategies/sandboxing__web_workers_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Create a Web Worker:** Create a separate JavaScript file (e.g., `pdf-worker.js`) that will contain the pdf.js code.
    2.  **Load pdf.js in the Worker:**  Inside `pdf-worker.js`, import the pdf.js library.
    3.  **Message Passing:**  Establish a communication channel between your main application thread and the Web Worker using `postMessage` and `onmessage` event listeners.  The main thread sends the PDF data (or URL) to the worker, and the worker sends back the rendered data (e.g., page images, text content).
    4.  **Isolate Rendering:**  Ensure that all PDF parsing and rendering logic is executed *within* the Web Worker.  The main thread should only handle displaying the results received from the worker.
    5.  **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to catch and handle any errors that occur within the worker.  Communicate these errors back to the main thread appropriately.

    *Example:*

    **Main Thread (main.js):**

    ```javascript
    const worker = new Worker('pdf-worker.js');

    worker.onmessage = function(event) {
        if (event.data.error) {
            console.error("Worker Error:", event.data.error);
        } else {
            // Process rendered data (e.g., display image)
            console.log("Rendered Data:", event.data);
        }
    };

    // Load PDF data (e.g., from a file input)
    const pdfData = ...;

    worker.postMessage({ pdfData: pdfData });
    ```

    **Worker Thread (pdf-worker.js):**

    ```javascript
    importScripts('pdf.js'); // Or the appropriate path

    onmessage = function(event) {
        try {
            pdfjsLib.getDocument(event.data.pdfData).promise.then(function(pdf) {
                // ... Render PDF pages ...
                // Send rendered data back to main thread
                postMessage({ pageData: ... });
            });
        } catch (error) {
            postMessage({ error: error.message });
        }
    };
    ```

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **RCE (Critical):**  Contains the impact of RCE to the worker's context, preventing direct access to the main thread's DOM and resources.
    *   **XSS (High):**  Significantly reduces the risk of XSS by isolating the vulnerable code.
    *   **DoS (Medium):**  Can help mitigate DoS by allowing the main thread to remain responsive even if the worker crashes.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Low-Medium):**  Limits the scope of potential information leaks.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **RCE:** Risk reduction: Very High.
    *   **XSS:** Risk reduction: High.
    *   **DoS:** Risk reduction: Medium.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Risk reduction: Medium.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Example: Not Implemented.  pdf.js is loaded and executed directly in the main thread.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Example:  The entire Web Worker implementation is missing.  The application needs to be refactored to move PDF processing to a separate worker thread.
