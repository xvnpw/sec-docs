# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/pdf.js

## Threat: [Malicious PDF Exploiting Parser (Type Confusion)](./threats/malicious_pdf_exploiting_parser__type_confusion_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a PDF with malformed object streams or cross-reference tables. The attacker leverages a type confusion vulnerability where pdf.js incorrectly interprets the type of an object, leading to unexpected behavior. For example, the attacker might trick the parser into treating a string as a function pointer.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution within the pdf.js worker, potentially leading to data exfiltration or a browser sandbox escape.
    *   **pdf.js Component Affected:**
        *   `PDFParser` (in `src/core/parser.js`) - The core PDF parsing logic.
        *   `Lexer` (in `src/core/parser.js`) - Responsible for tokenizing the PDF data stream.
        *   `ObjectStream` (in `src/core/obj_stream.js`) - Handling of object streams.
        *   `XRef` (in `src/core/xref.js`) - Processing of cross-reference tables.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update pdf.js:** Apply the latest security updates to pdf.js.
        *   **Code Audits:** (For pdf.js developers) Regular code audits and fuzzing of the parsing components to identify and fix type confusion vulnerabilities.
        *   **Memory Safety:** (For pdf.js developers) Explore using memory-safe languages or techniques to reduce the impact of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious PDF Exploiting Font Parsing (Buffer Overflow)](./threats/malicious_pdf_exploiting_font_parsing__buffer_overflow_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker embeds a malformed font (e.g., OpenType, TrueType) within a PDF. The attacker exploits a buffer overflow vulnerability in the font parsing logic, where the font data exceeds the allocated buffer size, overwriting adjacent memory.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution within the pdf.js worker.
    *   **pdf.js Component Affected:**
        *   `FontLoader` (in `src/core/fonts.js`) - Responsible for loading and parsing fonts.
        *   `CFFFont` (in `src/core/cff_font.js`) - Handling of Compact Font Format (CFF) fonts.
        *    `OpenTypeFileBuilder` (in `src/core/fonts.js`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update pdf.js:** Apply security updates to pdf.js.
        *   **Fuzzing:** (For pdf.js developers) Fuzz the font parsing components with various malformed font files.

## Threat: [Malicious PDF Exploiting Image Decoding (Integer Overflow)](./threats/malicious_pdf_exploiting_image_decoding__integer_overflow_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker includes a maliciously crafted image (e.g., JPEG, JBIG2) within a PDF. The attacker exploits an integer overflow vulnerability in the image decoding logic, where calculations related to image dimensions or data sizes result in incorrect values, leading to memory corruption.
    *   **Impact:** Code execution.
    *   **pdf.js Component Affected:**
        *   `JpegStream` (in `src/core/jpg.js`) - Handling of JPEG images.
        *   `Jbig2Image` (in `src/core/jbig2.js`) - Handling of JBIG2 images.
        *   `ImageLoader` (in `src/core/image.js`)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Update pdf.js:** Apply security updates.
        *   **Input Validation:** (For pdf.js developers) Implement robust input validation to check image dimensions and data sizes before processing.
        *   **Safe Integer Arithmetic:** (For pdf.js developers) Use safe integer arithmetic libraries or techniques to prevent integer overflows.

## Threat: [JavaScript Execution in PDF (XSS)](./threats/javascript_execution_in_pdf__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** If JavaScript execution is enabled (not recommended), an attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code within a PDF. When the PDF is opened, the JavaScript code executes within the context of the pdf.js worker.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, data exfiltration.
    *   **pdf.js Component Affected:**
        *   `JSEvaluator` (if JavaScript is enabled) - Responsible for executing JavaScript code within the PDF.
        *   `AnnotationLayer` (if JavaScript actions are associated with annotations).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if JavaScript is enabled)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Disable JavaScript Execution (Strongly Recommended):** Set `disableJavaScript: true` in the pdf.js configuration. This is the default and most secure option.
        *    **Input Sanitization:** (If JavaScript is enabled) Sanitize any user-provided data that might be used in JavaScript code within the PDF.

## Threat: [Sandbox Escape via SharedArrayBuffer (if enabled)](./threats/sandbox_escape_via_sharedarraybuffer__if_enabled_.md)

* **Description:** If `SharedArrayBuffer` is enabled (which it may be for performance reasons, but introduces security risks), a vulnerability in pdf.js could be combined with a Spectre-style attack to read arbitrary memory from the parent process (the main browser thread).
    * **Impact:** Full browser compromise, access to cookies, local storage, and other sensitive data.
    * **pdf.js Component Affected:** Any component that uses `SharedArrayBuffer` for communication between the worker and the main thread. This is more of an architectural issue than a specific component.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical (if `SharedArrayBuffer` is enabled and a suitable vulnerability exists)
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Disable SharedArrayBuffer (if possible):** If `SharedArrayBuffer` is not strictly required, disable it to mitigate this risk.
        * **Careful Code Review:** (For pdf.js developers) Thoroughly review any code that uses `SharedArrayBuffer` to ensure it is not vulnerable to timing attacks or other exploits.
