## Attack Tree Path: [[[Vulnerability in PDF Parsing/Rendering]]](./attack_tree_paths/__vulnerability_in_pdf_parsingrendering__.md)

**Description:** This is the core area where vulnerabilities in pdf.js's handling of the PDF file format reside. The complexity of the PDF specification makes this a prime target.
**Why Critical/High-Risk:** This is the most common entry point for attacks, and successful exploitation often leads directly to code execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Malformed PDF]]](./attack_tree_paths/__malformed_pdf__.md)

**Description:** The attacker provides a PDF file that intentionally violates the PDF specification in ways designed to trigger bugs in the parsing or rendering process.
**Why Critical/High-Risk:** This is the broadest and most common attack vector. It encompasses many sub-categories of vulnerabilities.
**Attack Steps:**
1.  Attacker crafts a malformed PDF.
2.  User opens the PDF in the vulnerable application.
3.  pdf.js attempts to parse the malformed PDF.
4.  A bug in the parsing logic is triggered.
5.  The bug leads to a exploitable condition (e.g., buffer overflow, type confusion).

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Crafted Font]]](./attack_tree_paths/__crafted_font__.md)

**Description:** The malformed PDF contains a specially crafted font with corrupted data structures or tables.
**Why Critical/High-Risk:** Font parsing is a complex and historically vulnerable area.
**Attack Steps:**
1.  Attacker crafts a PDF with a malicious embedded font.
2.  User opens the PDF.
3.  pdf.js attempts to parse the embedded font.
4.  A vulnerability in the font parsing engine is triggered.
5.  The vulnerability leads to an exploitable condition.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Font Parsing Bug]]](./attack_tree_paths/__font_parsing_bug__.md)

**Description:** A specific, identified bug in the font parsing code of pdf.js is exploited.
**Why Critical/High-Risk:** This represents a known, exploitable vulnerability.
**Attack Steps:**
1.  Attacker identifies a known font parsing bug in pdf.js.
2.  Attacker crafts a PDF that specifically triggers this bug.
3.  User opens the PDF.
4.  The bug is triggered, leading to a predictable exploitable state.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Out-of-Bounds Read/Write]](./attack_tree_paths/_out-of-bounds_readwrite_.md)

**Description:** The parser attempts to access memory outside the allocated buffer for a PDF object, either reading from or writing to an invalid memory location.
**Why High-Risk:** Leads directly to memory corruption, which is a highly exploitable condition.
**Attack Steps:**
1.  Attacker crafts a PDF that causes the parser to calculate an incorrect offset or size.
2.  User opens the PDF.
3.  pdf.js attempts to access memory using the incorrect offset/size.
4.  An out-of-bounds read or write occurs.
5.  The attacker gains control over memory contents.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Memory Access (Read/Write)]]](./attack_tree_paths/__memory_access__readwrite___.md)

**Description:** The attacker gains the ability to read from or write to arbitrary memory locations within the application's address space.
**Why Critical/High-Risk:** This is a very powerful primitive that can be used to achieve code execution.
**Attack Steps:** (These steps follow from a successful out-of-bounds read/write)
1.  The out-of-bounds access allows the attacker to overwrite critical data (e.g., function pointers, object metadata).
2.  The attacker carefully crafts the overwritten data to redirect program execution.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Read/Write]]](./attack_tree_paths/__readwrite__.md)

**Description:** This is the direct consequence of gaining memory access.
**Why Critical:** This is the fundamental capability that allows for further exploitation.
**Attack Steps:** N/A - This is a state, not a series of steps.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Control Flow Hijack]]](./attack_tree_paths/__control_flow_hijack__.md)

**Description:** The attacker uses the read/write primitive to modify program data (e.g., function pointers, return addresses) to redirect execution to attacker-controlled code.
**Why Critical:** This is the final step in achieving arbitrary code execution.
**Attack Steps:**
1. Attacker uses memory access to overwrite a function pointer or return address.
2. The overwritten pointer/address now points to attacker-supplied shellcode.
3. When the overwritten function is called, or the function returns, execution jumps to the shellcode.

## Attack Tree Path: [[Vulnerability in JavaScript API Interaction]](./attack_tree_paths/_vulnerability_in_javascript_api_interaction_.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities introduced by *how the application* uses the pdf.js API, rather than vulnerabilities within pdf.js itself.
**Why High-Risk:** Even a secure library can be used insecurely.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[Unsafe Function Use]]](./attack_tree_paths/__unsafe_function_use__.md)

**Description:** The application uses pdf.js API functions in a way that is not intended or documented, or in a way that is known to be unsafe.
**Why Critical/High-Risk:** This can create vulnerabilities even if pdf.js itself is bug-free.
**Attack Steps:** (These steps are highly dependent on the specific unsafe function use)
1.  The application uses a pdf.js API function incorrectly.
2.  The incorrect usage creates a vulnerability (e.g., allows injection of untrusted data).
3.  The attacker exploits this vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [[[eval() related]]](./attack_tree_paths/__eval___related__.md)

**Description:** The application uses the `eval()` function (or similar functions like `Function()`) with data derived from a PDF, directly or indirectly.
**Why Critical/High-Risk:** `eval()` with untrusted data is a classic and extremely dangerous vulnerability, leading directly to code execution.
**Attack Steps:**
1.  The application extracts data from a PDF (e.g., form field values, JavaScript actions).
2.  This data is passed to `eval()` without proper sanitization or validation.
3.  The attacker crafts the PDF to include malicious JavaScript code in the relevant data.
4.  When `eval()` is called, the attacker's code is executed.
