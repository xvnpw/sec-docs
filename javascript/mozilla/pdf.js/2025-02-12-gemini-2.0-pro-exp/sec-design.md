# BUSINESS POSTURE

Business Priorities and Goals:

*   Provide a web-based, open-source PDF renderer that is widely accessible and compatible across different browsers and platforms.
*   Maintain high accuracy and fidelity in rendering PDF documents, ensuring that they appear as intended by the document creator.
*   Offer a performant and efficient PDF viewing experience, minimizing resource consumption and loading times.
*   Ensure the security and privacy of users by preventing potential vulnerabilities associated with PDF rendering.
*   Foster a community-driven development model, encouraging contributions and collaboration from external developers.
*   Maintain compatibility with the latest PDF specifications and features.
*   Provide a customizable and extensible platform for developers to integrate PDF rendering capabilities into their applications.

Most Important Business Risks:

*   Security vulnerabilities in the PDF parsing and rendering engine could expose users to malicious code execution or data breaches.
*   Incompatibility with certain PDF files or features could lead to rendering errors or incomplete display of documents.
*   Performance issues could result in slow loading times or excessive resource consumption, degrading the user experience.
*   Lack of community engagement or contributions could slow down development and innovation.
*   Failure to keep up with evolving PDF standards could lead to compatibility issues in the future.
*   Legal or licensing issues related to PDF specifications or third-party libraries could pose risks to the project.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: The project is written in JavaScript, which inherently benefits from the security features of modern web browsers, such as sandboxing and same-origin policy.
*   security control: The project undergoes regular code reviews and testing to identify and address potential security vulnerabilities. (Described in CONTRIBUTING.md and test/README.md)
*   security control: The project utilizes a continuous integration (CI) system to automate testing and ensure code quality. (Described in .github/workflows)
*   security control: The project has a security policy in place for reporting and handling vulnerabilities. (Described in SECURITY.md)
*   security control: The project uses a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. (Described in web/app.js)
*   security control: Input sanitization is performed to prevent injection vulnerabilities. (Described in various parts of the codebase, e.g., src/core/primitives.js)
*   security control: The project is open-source, allowing for public scrutiny and contributions to security improvements.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: The project relies on the security of the underlying browser environment and its handling of PDF data.
*   accepted risk: While efforts are made to ensure compatibility, there may be edge cases or rare PDF features that are not fully supported, potentially leading to rendering issues.
*   accepted risk: The project's performance may be affected by the complexity of the PDF document being rendered and the capabilities of the user's device.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Implement a robust fuzzing framework to proactively discover vulnerabilities in the PDF parsing and rendering engine.
*   security control: Regularly conduct penetration testing to identify and address potential attack vectors.
*   security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline.
*   security control: Consider using a memory-safe language or runtime environment for critical components of the PDF parsing engine to mitigate memory corruption vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Not directly applicable, as the project is a library for rendering PDFs and does not handle user authentication itself. Authentication would be the responsibility of the application integrating pdf.js.

*   Authorization:
    *   Not directly applicable, as the project is a library. Authorization would be handled by the integrating application.

*   Input Validation:
    *   The project must thoroughly validate and sanitize all input data, including PDF data streams, font data, and image data, to prevent injection vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.
    *   The project must handle malformed or corrupted PDF data gracefully, without crashing or exposing vulnerabilities.

*   Cryptography:
    *   If the project handles encrypted PDF documents, it must use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and protocols for decryption and signature verification.
    *   Cryptographic keys must be managed securely, following best practices for key generation, storage, and usage.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes to Protect:

*   **PDF Rendering:** The core functionality of pdf.js, ensuring accurate and reliable rendering of PDF documents.
*   **User Data Privacy:** Protecting user data from unauthorized access or disclosure, especially when handling sensitive PDF documents.
*   **Application Availability:** Ensuring that pdf.js is available and accessible to users when needed.
*   **Reputation:** Maintaining the reputation of pdf.js as a secure and reliable PDF rendering library.

Data to Protect and Sensitivity:

*   **PDF Document Content:** This can range from publicly available documents to highly sensitive information, such as financial records, medical records, or legal documents. Sensitivity varies greatly depending on the content.
