# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/pdf.js

## Attack Surface: [Malicious PDF Parsing](./attack_surfaces/malicious_pdf_parsing.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting vulnerabilities in how pdf.js parses and interprets the structure and content of PDF files.

**How pdf.js Contributes:** pdf.js is directly responsible for parsing the complex PDF format. Bugs or oversights in its parsing logic can lead to unexpected behavior or exploitable conditions.

**Example:** A specially crafted PDF with an invalid object definition could cause pdf.js to crash the browser tab or potentially lead to memory corruption.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (browser tab crash), potential Remote Code Execution (if memory corruption is exploitable), Information Disclosure (if parsing errors reveal sensitive data).

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep pdf.js updated to the latest version.
*   Consider using Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the capabilities of the rendered PDF content.
*   Implement robust error handling and logging around the PDF loading and rendering process.

## Attack Surface: [Exploiting JavaScript in PDFs](./attack_surfaces/exploiting_javascript_in_pdfs.md)

**Description:**  Malicious use of JavaScript embedded within PDF files, targeting vulnerabilities in pdf.js's JavaScript handling.

**How pdf.js Contributes:** pdf.js includes a JavaScript interpreter to execute JavaScript code embedded in PDFs. Vulnerabilities in this interpreter or the APIs it exposes can be exploited.

**Example:** A malicious PDF could contain JavaScript that attempts to access browser APIs in an unauthorized way, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep pdf.js updated.
*   Carefully review and configure pdf.js options related to JavaScript execution. Consider disabling JavaScript execution in PDFs if the functionality is not essential.
*   Implement strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Rendered Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_rendered_content.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in the rendering process of pdf.js that allow injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript into the displayed PDF content.

**How pdf.js Contributes:**  If pdf.js doesn't properly sanitize or escape content extracted from the PDF during the rendering process, it can lead to XSS.

**Example:** A specially crafted PDF could include text or annotations that, when rendered by pdf.js, inject malicious JavaScript into the application's DOM.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep pdf.js updated.
*   Ensure proper output encoding and sanitization of all content rendered by pdf.js.
*   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Information Leakage](./attack_surfaces/information_leakage.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities in pdf.js that could unintentionally expose sensitive information contained within the PDF or the user's environment.

**How pdf.js Contributes:**  Bugs in the rendering or processing logic might inadvertently reveal data that should be protected.

**Example:** A vulnerability could allow a malicious PDF to extract metadata or content from other parts of the browser's memory.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, potentially revealing sensitive data from the PDF or the user's browsing session.

**Risk Severity:** High.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep pdf.js updated.
*   Carefully review and test the application's integration with pdf.js to ensure no unintended data leakage occurs.
*   Consider the sensitivity of the data being displayed in PDFs and implement appropriate security measures.
