# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/pdf.js

## Threat: [Malicious JavaScript Execution within PDF](./threats/malicious_javascript_execution_within_pdf.md)

**Description:** An attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code within a PDF document. When `pdf.js` renders this PDF, the embedded script executes within the user's browser, potentially performing actions like stealing cookies, redirecting the user, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, leading to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the web application, or unauthorized actions on the user's behalf.

**Affected Component:** `pdf.js` JavaScript engine (specifically the part responsible for handling embedded JavaScript within PDF objects).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Configure `pdf.js` to disable JavaScript execution within PDF documents if the functionality is not strictly required.
* Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the capabilities of any JavaScript that might execute, even if unintended.
* Regularly update `pdf.js` to benefit from security patches that address potential JavaScript execution vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Heap Overflow/Buffer Overflow during PDF Parsing](./threats/heap_overflowbuffer_overflow_during_pdf_parsing.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a PDF file with specific structures or excessively large objects that cause `pdf.js`'s parsing logic to write beyond the allocated memory buffer. This can lead to crashes, denial of service, or potentially even remote code execution if exploited further.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) for the user's browser or the web application. In severe cases, it could lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the attacker can control the overflowed data.

**Affected Component:** `pdf.js` PDF parsing module (components responsible for interpreting the PDF file structure and object data).

**Risk Severity:** High (potential for RCE if exploitable) to Medium (more likely leading to DoS).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep `pdf.js` updated to the latest stable version, as these often include fixes for memory management vulnerabilities.
* Implement resource limits on the client-side (if feasible) to prevent excessive memory consumption during PDF processing.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities in PDF.js](./threats/exploitation_of_known_vulnerabilities_in_pdf_js.md)

**Description:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities in specific versions of `pdf.js` to compromise the user's browser or the web application. This often involves crafting specific PDF files that trigger these vulnerabilities.

**Impact:** Can range from Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Denial of Service (DoS) to Remote Code Execution (RCE), depending on the nature of the exploited vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Risk Severity:** Can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Crucially, keep `pdf.js` updated to the latest stable version.** This is the primary defense against known vulnerabilities.
* Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for `pdf.js` to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
