## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit PDF Parsing/Rendering Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_pdf_parsingrendering_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious PDF files designed to exploit flaws in how PDF.js parses and renders the PDF structure and its content.

**Potential Impact:** This can lead to code execution, denial of service, information leakage, or cross-site scripting.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all PDF files.
*   Regularly update PDF.js to the latest version to patch known vulnerabilities.
*   Implement memory safety measures and bounds checking in PDF.js (development team responsibility).
*   Consider sandboxing the PDF rendering process.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Trigger Code Execution via Malformed PDF [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__trigger_code_execution_via_malformed_pdf__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, integer overflows, or type confusion within the PDF parsing logic by providing a specially crafted PDF.

**Potential Impact:**  Allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the user's browser context, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or further attacks.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   Implement robust memory safety practices in PDF.js (development team responsibility).
*   Use safe integer arithmetic and bounds checking in size calculations (development team responsibility).
*   Implement strict type checking and validation during object processing (development team responsibility).
*   Fuzz testing of PDF.js with a wide range of malformed PDFs (development team responsibility).

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Trigger Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Rendered Content [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__trigger_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_rendered_content__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into the PDF content that is then rendered and executed by PDF.js in the user's browser.

**Potential Impact:** Allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting users, or performing actions on their behalf.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **[CRITICAL] Inject Malicious JavaScript through PDF Content [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Embedding JavaScript within PDF elements (e.g., annotations, form fields, embedded scripts) that is not properly sanitized by PDF.js and is executed upon rendering.
    *   **Potential Impact:** Full compromise of the user's session and potential for further attacks.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust output encoding and sanitization of all rendered PDF content before displaying it in the application.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed.
        *   Disable or sandbox potentially risky PDF features like JavaScript execution if not strictly necessary.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerabilities in PDF.js JavaScript Code [HIGH-RISK PATH (if outdated)]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_vulnerabilities_in_pdf_js_javascript_code__high-risk_path__if_outdated__.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting known security vulnerabilities present in specific versions of the PDF.js library.

**Potential Impact:**  Can lead to code execution, denial of service, or other security breaches depending on the specific vulnerability.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Known Security Vulnerabilities in PDF.js Library [HIGH-RISK PATH (if outdated)]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Publicly known vulnerabilities in older versions of PDF.js are exploited using readily available exploit code.
    *   **Potential Impact:**  Critical vulnerabilities can allow for full application compromise or user account takeover.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Crucially, regularly update PDF.js to the latest stable version.**
        *   Subscribe to security advisories for PDF.js to be aware of new vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for promptly patching or updating the library when vulnerabilities are disclosed.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Application Integration Weaknesses [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_application_integration_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in how the application integrates and uses the PDF.js library, rather than flaws within PDF.js itself.

**Potential Impact:** Can lead to various security issues, including XSS, information disclosure, or unauthorized access.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

*   **[CRITICAL] Insecure PDF Loading Mechanism [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **[CRITICAL] Load PDF from Untrusted Source Without Validation [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Loading and processing PDF files from untrusted or user-controlled sources without proper validation, allowing malicious PDFs to be processed.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Exposes the application to all the vulnerabilities present in malicious PDF files.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Always validate the source and integrity of PDFs before loading them.**
            *   Use secure protocols (HTTPS) for fetching PDFs.
            *   Implement server-side validation of uploaded PDFs.
*   **[CRITICAL] Improper Handling of Rendered Output [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
    *   **[CRITICAL] Display Rendered Content Without Proper Sanitization [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Displaying the output generated by PDF.js directly in the application without proper encoding or sanitization, allowing embedded malicious scripts to execute.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, and other malicious activities.
        *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
            *   **Implement robust output encoding and sanitization of all rendered PDF content before displaying it in the application.**
            *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities.
            *   Avoid directly embedding the rendered PDF content; consider using iframes with appropriate security attributes (sandbox).
