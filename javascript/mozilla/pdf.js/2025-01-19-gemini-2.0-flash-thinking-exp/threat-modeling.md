# Threat Model Analysis for mozilla/pdf.js

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via JavaScript in PDF](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_javascript_in_pdf.md)

**Description:** An attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code within a PDF file. If PDF.js has vulnerabilities in its handling of embedded JavaScript or its security sandbox, this code could be executed within the user's browser with the privileges of the web application. The attacker could potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the user's session and potentially their account within the application. The attacker could gain unauthorized access to sensitive data or perform malicious actions.

**Affected Component:** `Sandbox` module (if a sandbox is implemented), `Scripting` module (handling JavaScript execution).

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure PDF.js is configured to disable or strictly control the execution of embedded JavaScript.
* Keep PDF.js updated to the latest version, as RCE vulnerabilities are often prioritized for patching.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through PDF Content Rendering](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_pdf_content_rendering.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a PDF file containing malicious HTML or JavaScript that, when rendered by PDF.js, is injected into the application's DOM without proper sanitization. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the user's browser within the application's context. The attacker might achieve this through specially crafted text, annotations, or form fields within the PDF.

**Impact:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser within the application's context. This could lead to stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or performing actions on their behalf.

**Affected Component:** `Rendering` module, specifically the components responsible for handling text, annotations, and form fields.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Ensure PDF.js properly sanitizes or encodes any user-controlled content from the PDF before rendering it in the DOM.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.
* Keep PDF.js updated to benefit from any security fixes related to rendering vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Memory Corruption Vulnerabilities](./threats/memory_corruption_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Bugs within the PDF.js codebase, particularly in memory management, could be triggered by specific, malformed PDF structures. An attacker could craft a PDF designed to exploit these vulnerabilities, potentially leading to crashes or, in more severe cases, the ability to execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Can range from denial of service (browser tab crash) to potential remote code execution if the memory corruption is exploitable.

**Affected Component:** Core modules involved in parsing and rendering, including `Parser`, `Rendering`, and potentially lower-level memory management within the JavaScript engine.

**Risk Severity:** High (if exploitable for RCE)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Keep PDF.js updated to the latest version, as memory corruption bugs are often addressed in security updates.
* Rely on the browser's security features and sandboxing to mitigate the impact of memory corruption vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Using Outdated or Vulnerable Versions of PDF.js](./threats/using_outdated_or_vulnerable_versions_of_pdf_js.md)

**Description:** If the application uses an outdated version of PDF.js, it will be vulnerable to any security flaws that have been discovered and patched in later versions. Attackers can target known vulnerabilities in older versions of the library.

**Impact:** The application becomes susceptible to various attacks depending on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version of PDF.js. This could include RCE or XSS.

**Affected Component:** The entire PDF.js library.

**Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the vulnerabilities present in the outdated version, can be Critical.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a process for regularly updating third-party libraries, including PDF.js.
* Monitor security advisories and release notes for PDF.js to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.
