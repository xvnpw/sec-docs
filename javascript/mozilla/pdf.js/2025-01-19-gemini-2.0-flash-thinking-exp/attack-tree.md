## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via PDF.js Exploitation (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_pdf_js_exploitation__critical_node_.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access or control over the application or its data by exploiting weaknesses in how it uses PDF.js.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit PDF Parsing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pdf_parsing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to leverage flaws in how PDF.js interprets the structure of a PDF file. This can lead to unexpected behavior, crashes, or even memory corruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Parsing Vulnerability in PDF.js (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_parsing_vulnerability_in_pdf_js__critical_node_.md)

This is the specific action of causing PDF.js to encounter a flaw in its parsing logic by providing a specially crafted PDF.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion__high_risk_.md)

Attackers craft a PDF with an excessive amount of nested objects, metadata, or other resource-intensive elements. When PDF.js attempts to parse this file, it consumes excessive resources (CPU, memory), leading to the browser or application becoming unresponsive or crashing.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit PDF Rendering Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_pdf_rendering_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

Attackers aim to leverage flaws in how PDF.js displays the content of a PDF. This can lead to the execution of malicious code or other unintended actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Trigger Rendering Vulnerability in PDF.js (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/trigger_rendering_vulnerability_in_pdf_js__critical_node_.md)

This is the specific action of causing PDF.js to encounter a flaw in its rendering logic by providing a specially crafted PDF.

## Attack Tree Path: [JavaScript Injection via PDF (HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/javascript_injection_via_pdf__high_risk__critical_node_.md)

Attackers embed malicious JavaScript code within a PDF file. When PDF.js renders the PDF, this embedded script executes within the user's browser context. This can lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), allowing the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

## Attack Tree Path: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Rendering Issues (HIGH RISK)](./attack_tree_paths/denial_of_service__dos__via_rendering_issues__high_risk_.md)

Attackers craft a PDF with complex graphics, intricate rendering instructions, or other elements that overwhelm the browser's rendering engine. This can cause the browser tab or the entire browser to freeze or crash.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Application Integration with PDF.js (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_application_integration_with_pdf_js__critical_node_.md)

Attackers target weaknesses in how the application itself uses the PDF.js library. This means the vulnerability lies in the application's code that interacts with PDF.js, rather than in PDF.js itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weaknesses in Application's PDF.js Integration (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weaknesses_in_application's_pdf_js_integration__critical_node_.md)

This is the specific action of leveraging flaws in the application's code that handles PDF files or interacts with the PDF.js library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via PDF Content (HIGH RISK, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_pdf_content__high_risk__critical_node_.md)

The application extracts content from a PDF (e.g., text, metadata) and displays it on a web page without proper sanitization. An attacker can embed malicious JavaScript code within the PDF content. When the application displays this unsanitized content, the malicious script executes in the user's browser, allowing for actions like session hijacking or defacement.
