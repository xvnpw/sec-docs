# Attack Surface Analysis for mozilla/pdf.js

## Attack Surface: [Malformed PDF Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/malformed_pdf_exploitation.md)

**Description:** Crafted PDF files with invalid or unexpected structures can trigger vulnerabilities in the pdf.js parsing engine.

**How pdf.js Contributes:** pdf.js is responsible for parsing and interpreting the complex structure of PDF files. Errors in *its* parsing logic can be exploited.

**Example:** A PDF with a deeply nested object structure causing a stack overflow in *pdf.js's* parsing process, leading to a browser crash.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS) by crashing the browser tab or the entire browser. In some cases, it could potentially lead to memory corruption vulnerabilities within the browser due to flaws in *pdf.js*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep pdf.js Updated:** Regularly update to the latest version to benefit from bug fixes and security patches in *pdf.js's* parsing logic.

## Attack Surface: [Embedded JavaScript Exploitation](./attack_surfaces/embedded_javascript_exploitation.md)

**Description:** PDF files can contain embedded JavaScript code. If pdf.js doesn't handle this code securely, malicious scripts can be executed within the user's browser *by pdf.js*.

**How pdf.js Contributes:** pdf.js has the capability to execute JavaScript embedded within PDF documents. Vulnerabilities in *how pdf.js handles this execution* can be exploited.

**Example:** A PDF containing JavaScript that *pdf.js* executes, which then steals cookies or session tokens and sends them to an attacker's server.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to information disclosure, session hijacking, or other malicious actions performed in the user's browser context *due to the execution of malicious scripts by pdf.js*.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Disable JavaScript Execution (If Possible):** If the application's functionality allows, consider disabling JavaScript execution within *pdf.js* through its configuration options.
* **Keep pdf.js Updated:** Ensure *pdf.js* is up-to-date to benefit from security fixes related to *its* JavaScript handling.

## Attack Surface: [Exploitation of Specific PDF Features](./attack_surfaces/exploitation_of_specific_pdf_features.md)

**Description:** Certain features within the PDF specification (e.g., JBIG2 or JPEG2000 decoding) have historically been targets for vulnerabilities. Flaws in *pdf.js's* implementation of these features can be exploited.

**How pdf.js Contributes:** pdf.js needs to implement and process these various PDF features to render the document correctly. Vulnerabilities can exist in *the code within pdf.js* responsible for handling these specific features.

**Example:** A PDF leveraging a buffer overflow vulnerability in *pdf.js's* JBIG2 decoding implementation to cause a crash or potentially execute arbitrary code.

**Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially leading to memory corruption or even remote code execution in the browser's context (though less likely with modern browser sandboxing) due to vulnerabilities within *pdf.js*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep pdf.js Updated:** Regularly update *pdf.js* to patch known vulnerabilities in *its* specific feature implementations.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side XSS in pdf.js UI](./attack_surfaces/client-side_xss_in_pdf_js_ui.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the user interface components of pdf.js itself could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute within the user's browser when viewing a PDF *through the pdf.js viewer*.

**How pdf.js Contributes:** pdf.js provides a built-in viewer UI. If *this UI within pdf.js* doesn't properly sanitize or escape user-controlled data (e.g., filenames, document properties), it can be vulnerable to XSS.

**Example:** A crafted PDF filename containing malicious JavaScript that gets executed when the filename is displayed in *the pdf.js viewer*.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, or other malicious actions within the context of the web application *due to vulnerabilities in the pdf.js UI*.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep pdf.js Updated:** Ensure *pdf.js* is updated to benefit from security fixes in *its* UI components.
* **Careful Integration:** If customizing or extending the *pdf.js* UI, ensure proper input sanitization and output encoding in *your custom code*.
