# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for mozilla/pdf.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit PDF Feature Usage (pdf.js Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/limit_pdf_feature_usage__pdf_js_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Review your application's PDF functionality requirements. Determine if features like JavaScript execution within PDFs are truly necessary for your use case.
    *   Step 2:  Utilize pdf.js configuration options to disable or restrict potentially risky features.
    *   Step 3:  Specifically, set the `disableJavaScript` option to `true` within the `PDFViewerApplicationOptions` or when initializing `pdf.js` if JavaScript execution inside PDFs is not required. This is a key pdf.js configuration setting.
    *   Step 4:  If other features like form handling or annotation are not essential, avoid using the corresponding pdf.js APIs and components in your application code. While direct configuration for disabling all form handling in pdf.js might be less granular, limiting your application's interaction with form-related APIs reduces risk.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via PDF JavaScript** - Severity: High. Disabling JavaScript execution in pdf.js directly prevents malicious JavaScript embedded in PDFs from running and potentially causing XSS attacks.
    *   **PDF Form Exploitation (Reduced)** - Severity: Medium. While not fully disabling forms, limiting feature usage reduces the attack surface related to potential vulnerabilities in pdf.js form handling logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via PDF JavaScript**: High risk reduction (if JavaScript is disabled). Eliminates a major attack vector directly related to pdf.js's JavaScript execution capability.
    *   **PDF Form Exploitation (Reduced)**: Medium risk reduction.  Indirectly reduces risk by limiting reliance on potentially complex pdf.js form features.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - `disableJavaScript` is currently set to `false` (default) in the pdf.js configuration used by the application.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Configuration of `disableJavaScript: true` in the `PDFViewerApplicationOptions` within the application's pdf.js initialization code.  A review of form handling usage in the application code is also needed to ensure minimal reliance on these features.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Isolate PDF Rendering (Web Workers with pdf.js)](./mitigation_strategies/isolate_pdf_rendering__web_workers_with_pdf_js_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Configure pdf.js to operate within a dedicated Web Worker. pdf.js is designed to be compatible with Web Workers.
    *   Step 2:  Modify your application's JavaScript to initialize and interact with pdf.js through the Web Worker API provided by browsers.
    *   Step 3: Ensure that the core pdf.js library and PDF loading/rendering logic are executed within the Web Worker context, offloading processing from the main thread.
    *   Step 4:  Use message passing to communicate between the main application thread and the pdf.js Web Worker for tasks like loading PDFs, requesting pages, and receiving rendering results. This is the standard way to interact with pdf.js in a worker.
    *   Step 5:  Minimize the data transferred between the main thread and the worker to only essential information for rendering and user interaction.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion due to pdf.js processing** - Severity: Medium. Running pdf.js in a Web Worker prevents resource-intensive PDF processing from blocking the main application thread, improving responsiveness and resilience to DoS attacks targeting pdf.js.
    *   **Performance Impact of pdf.js Processing on UI** - Severity: Low to Medium. Offloading pdf.js processing to a worker thread ensures smoother UI performance, even during heavy PDF operations.
    *   **Limited Scope of Vulnerability Exploitation in pdf.js** - Severity: Low to Medium. If a vulnerability is exploited within pdf.js running in a worker, the impact is potentially contained within the worker's isolated environment, limiting damage to the main application context.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) - Resource Exhaustion due to pdf.js processing**: Medium risk reduction. Improves application stability and responsiveness when handling potentially malicious or resource-intensive PDFs processed by pdf.js.
    *   **Performance Impact of pdf.js Processing on UI**: Medium risk reduction. Enhances user experience by preventing UI freezes caused by pdf.js operations.
    *   **Limited Scope of Vulnerability Exploitation in pdf.js**: Low to Medium risk reduction. Provides a degree of sandboxing for pdf.js execution, although not a complete security boundary.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - pdf.js is currently initialized and runs within the main application thread.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Refactor the application's JavaScript code to initialize and utilize pdf.js within a Web Worker. This involves significant code changes to manage asynchronous communication and data transfer between the main thread and the pdf.js worker.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update pdf.js Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_pdf_js_library.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1:  Establish a routine for monitoring pdf.js releases and security advisories specifically from Mozilla (the maintainers of pdf.js).
    *   Step 2:  Subscribe to pdf.js release channels (e.g., GitHub releases, Mozilla security announcements) to receive notifications about new versions and security patches.
    *   Step 3:  Periodically check for newer versions of pdf.js on the official GitHub repository or through your package manager (e.g., npm if using npm for pdf.js).
    *   Step 4:  When a new pdf.js version is released, especially if it includes security fixes or vulnerability patches, prioritize updating the pdf.js library in your application.
    *   Step 5:  After updating pdf.js, conduct thorough testing of the application's PDF functionality to ensure compatibility with the new version and to catch any potential regressions introduced by the update.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known pdf.js Vulnerabilities** - Severity: High. Using an outdated version of pdf.js exposes the application to publicly known security vulnerabilities that have been fixed in newer releases of pdf.js.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known pdf.js Vulnerabilities**: High risk reduction.  Proactively mitigates the risk of exploitation by addressing known vulnerabilities in pdf.js as soon as patches are available.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Dependency updates are performed periodically, but a dedicated process for tracking and prioritizing pdf.js security updates is not fully established.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement a formal process for monitoring pdf.js releases and security advisories. Integrate pdf.js update checks into the regular security maintenance schedule and prioritize updates, especially those addressing security concerns.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Limits for pdf.js Operations (Timeouts)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_limits_for_pdf_js_operations__timeouts_.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Implement timeout mechanisms specifically for time-consuming pdf.js operations, primarily PDF parsing and rendering processes.
    *   Step 2:  Set appropriate timeout durations for these operations based on the expected complexity of PDFs your application handles and the desired performance characteristics. Consider the typical time taken for pdf.js to process legitimate PDFs.
    *   Step 3:  Integrate timeout logic into your application code that interacts with pdf.js. For example, when initiating PDF loading using `pdfjsLib.getDocument()`, implement a timeout around the promise resolution.
    *   Step 4:  If a timeout occurs during pdf.js processing, gracefully terminate the operation.
    *   Step 5:  Inform the user that the PDF could not be processed within the allowed time, suggesting potential issues with the PDF or system resources.
    *   Step 6:  Log timeout events, including details about the PDF being processed (if available), for monitoring and potential investigation of DoS attempts or problematic PDFs.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion through pdf.js** - Severity: Medium. Timeouts prevent maliciously crafted PDFs designed to cause excessive processing times in pdf.js from consuming server resources indefinitely and leading to DoS.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion through pdf.js**: Medium risk reduction.  Reduces the application's vulnerability to DoS attacks that exploit pdf.js's processing capabilities to exhaust resources.

*   **Currently Implemented:** No - Explicit timeout mechanisms are not currently implemented around pdf.js operations within the application.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  Implement timeout logic in the application code that calls pdf.js functions, particularly for PDF loading and rendering.  Determine suitable timeout values through performance testing and analysis of typical PDF processing times.
