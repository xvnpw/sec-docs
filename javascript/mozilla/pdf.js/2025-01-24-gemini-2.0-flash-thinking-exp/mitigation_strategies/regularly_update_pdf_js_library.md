3.  **Implement Automated Dependency Checks:**  Utilize package manager tools and CI/CD integration to automate the process of checking for outdated pdf.js versions.
4.  **Define Prioritization Criteria:**  Establish clear criteria for prioritizing pdf.js updates, with security fixes being the highest priority. Document these criteria and communicate them to the development team.
5.  **Enhance Testing Procedures:**  Ensure that testing procedures adequately cover PDF functionality and regression testing after pdf.js updates. Automate testing where possible.

#### 2.6. Alternative/Complementary Strategies (Briefly):

While regularly updating pdf.js is the most direct and effective mitigation for known vulnerabilities in the library itself, other complementary strategies can enhance the overall security posture:

*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):**  CSP can help mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities within pdf.js (or elsewhere in the application) by restricting the sources from which the browser can load resources.
*   **Input Sanitization and Validation (PDF Content):** While pdf.js handles PDF rendering, if the application processes or interacts with data *within* the PDF (e.g., form data, annotations), input sanitization and validation of this data can be important to prevent other types of attacks.
*   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can provide a layer of defense against various web attacks, including some that might target vulnerabilities in PDF rendering, although it's less effective against direct library vulnerabilities compared to updating the library itself.
*   **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Periodic security audits and penetration testing can help identify vulnerabilities in the application, including those related to pdf.js usage, and validate the effectiveness of mitigation strategies.

**However, it's crucial to emphasize that these are *complementary* strategies.  They do not replace the necessity of regularly updating pdf.js.  Updating the library remains the primary and most effective defense against known vulnerabilities in pdf.js.**
