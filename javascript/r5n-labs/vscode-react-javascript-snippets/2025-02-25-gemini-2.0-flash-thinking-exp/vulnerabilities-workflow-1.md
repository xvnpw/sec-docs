It seems you have provided headers for vulnerability lists, but the lists themselves are empty or contain a message indicating "No vulnerabilities found".

To proceed, please provide the actual lists of vulnerabilities you want me to combine.  Each list should contain information about vulnerabilities, ideally structured in a way that allows me to extract the following for each vulnerability:

*   **Vulnerability Name**
*   **Description** (step-by-step trigger)
*   **Impact**
*   **Vulnerability Rank** (low, medium, high, critical)
*   **Currently Implemented Mitigations**
*   **Missing Mitigations**
*   **Preconditions**
*   **Source Code Analysis** (step-by-step code walkthrough)
*   **Security Test Case** (step-by-step test for external attacker)

Once you provide these lists, I will:

1.  **Combine** all the vulnerabilities from the three lists.
2.  **Remove duplicates** based on vulnerability name and description (if necessary, we can refine duplicate detection criteria if needed).
3.  **Format** the combined and deduplicated list in markdown as you requested, with a main paragraph and subparagraphs for each vulnerability, including all the details you specified (name, description, impact, rank, mitigations, preconditions, source code analysis, security test case).

**Please provide the three lists of vulnerabilities so I can process them for you.**
