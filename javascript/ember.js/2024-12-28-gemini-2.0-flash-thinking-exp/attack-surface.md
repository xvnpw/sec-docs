Here's the updated list of key attack surfaces directly involving Ember.js, with high and critical severity:

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection**
    *   **Description:**  An attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
    *   **How Ember.js Contributes:**  Ember's templating engine (Handlebars) can render unescaped user-provided data if developers use the triple-mustache syntax `{{{variable}}}` or bypass default escaping mechanisms in custom helpers. Dynamically constructing template strings based on user input also increases this risk.
    *   **Example:**  A comment form allows users to enter their name. The template uses `{{{comment.userName}}}` to display the name. If a user enters `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` as their name, this script will execute when other users view the comment.
    *   **Impact:**  Account takeover, redirection to malicious sites, data theft, defacement of the website.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Always use the double-mustache syntax `{{variable}}` for displaying user-provided data.** This ensures automatic HTML escaping.
        *   **Be extremely cautious when using the triple-mustache syntax `{{{variable}}}`.** Only use it for trusted, pre-sanitized content.
        *   **Sanitize user input on the server-side before storing it.**
        *   **Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers** to restrict the sources from which the browser is permitted to load resources.
        *   **Regularly audit templates and custom helpers** for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

*   **DOM-Based Cross-Site Scripting (DOM-Based XSS)**
    *   **Description:**  The vulnerability occurs in the client-side script itself, where malicious data modifies the DOM, leading to script execution.
    *   **How Ember.js Contributes:**  Manipulating the DOM directly using Ember's APIs (e.g., `Ember.set`, accessing `element.innerHTML` without sanitization) based on user-controlled data can introduce DOM-based XSS. Incorrectly handling URLs or other user input within component attributes or bindings can also lead to this.
    *   **Example:** A component receives a URL as an attribute. The component uses `this.element.querySelector('a').href = this.url;`. If `this.url` is `javascript:alert('XSS')`, clicking the link will execute the script.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to reflected XSS, including account takeover, redirection, and data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid direct DOM manipulation as much as possible.** Rely on Ember's data binding and template rendering.
        *   **If direct DOM manipulation is necessary, carefully sanitize user-provided data before using it.** Use browser APIs like `textContent` instead of `innerHTML` when possible.
        *   **Validate and sanitize URLs** before using them in `href` attributes or other contexts.
        *   **Use secure coding practices** when working with client-side JavaScript.

*   **Client-Side Routing Manipulation & Unauthorized Access**
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the application's client-side routing to access unintended parts of the application or trigger unexpected behavior.
    *   **How Ember.js Contributes:** Ember's router manages client-side navigation. If route guards or authorization checks are not implemented correctly or are bypassed due to vulnerabilities in the routing logic, attackers can gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Example:** An application has a route `/admin` protected by an authentication check in the `beforeModel` hook. If there's a flaw in the guard logic or a way to navigate to `/admin` without triggering the guard, an unauthenticated user could access the admin panel.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data, unauthorized modification of data, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Implement robust authentication and authorization checks in route guards (e.g., `beforeModel`, `afterModel`).**
        *   **Ensure all protected routes have appropriate guards.**
        *   **Avoid relying solely on client-side checks for security.** Implement server-side authorization as well.
        *   **Regularly review routing configurations and guard logic.**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data in Client-Side Code or Build Artifacts**
    *   **Description:**  Sensitive information, such as API keys, secrets, or internal implementation details, is exposed in the client-side code or build artifacts.
    *   **How Ember.js Contributes:**  Developers might inadvertently embed API keys or other secrets directly in Ember components or configuration files. Source maps, if not properly managed in production, can reveal the application's source code.
    *   **Example:** An API key is hardcoded in an Ember service file. This key is then visible in the browser's developer tools or in the deployed JavaScript bundle.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to backend services, data breaches, compromise of user accounts.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Never hardcode sensitive information in client-side code.**
        *   **Use environment variables or secure configuration management systems to store and access secrets.**
        *   **Ensure source maps are not deployed to production environments.** If needed for debugging, use secure methods for accessing them.
        *   **Minimize the amount of sensitive logic implemented on the client-side.**
        *   **Implement proper access controls and authentication on backend APIs.**
