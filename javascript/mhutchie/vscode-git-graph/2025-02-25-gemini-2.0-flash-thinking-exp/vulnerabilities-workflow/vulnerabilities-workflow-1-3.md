- Vulnerability name: Command Injection in `askpass.sh` via Unsanitized Arguments

- Description:
  1. The `askpass.sh` script is used by the Git Graph extension to handle Git authentication when credentials are required.
  2. This script executes a command by constructing it from environment variables and arguments passed to the script itself, specifically using the line: `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" $*`.
  3. The vulnerability lies in the use of unquoted `$*`, which passes all arguments to the script directly to the constructed command without proper sanitization or quoting.
  4. If an attacker can find a way to inject malicious arguments that are passed to `askpass.sh` by the Git Graph extension, they can inject arbitrary shell commands.
  5. When `askpass.sh` is executed by Git (through the extension), these injected commands will be executed on the user's system with the privileges of the user running Visual Studio Code.

- Impact:
  - Arbitrary command execution on the user's system.
  - An attacker could potentially gain full control of the user's machine, steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

- Vulnerability rank: High

- Currently implemented mitigations:
  - None. The `askpass.sh` script, as provided, does not implement any input sanitization or output encoding to prevent command injection.

- Missing mitigations:
  - The primary missing mitigation is to properly sanitize or quote the arguments passed to `askpass.sh`.
  - The script should avoid using unquoted `$*`. If passing arguments is necessary, it should be done securely, for example, by carefully constructing an array of arguments and quoting each element when used in the command execution.
  - The Git Graph extension should ensure that it does not pass unsanitized or attacker-controlled input as arguments to the `askpass.sh` script. Input validation and sanitization should be implemented in the extension wherever user-provided data is incorporated into Git commands or related scripts.

- Preconditions:
  - An attacker needs to find a vulnerability within the Git Graph extension that allows them to control or influence the arguments that are eventually passed to the `askpass.sh` script when it is invoked by Git for authentication purposes. This could potentially involve manipulating Git commands constructed by the extension or exploiting any input handling flaws.
  - The user must be using Git Graph in an environment where Git might require authentication and is configured to use an external `askpass` script, which is the default behavior of Git Graph by providing `askpass.sh`.

- Source code analysis:
  1. File: `/code/src/askpass/askpass.sh`
  2. Line 3: `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" $*`
  3. The script constructs a command using variables `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE`, `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE`, and `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN`, which are expected to be set by the Git Graph extension itself and are likely safe.
  4. However, the use of unquoted `$*` is a significant security risk. `$*` expands to all arguments passed to the `askpass.sh` script. If these arguments are not properly sanitized by the calling application (Git Graph extension in this context), and if an attacker can somehow influence these arguments, they can inject arbitrary shell commands.
  5. For example, if an attacker could control the arguments and inject `-- echo 'pwned'`, the executed command might become:
     ```sh
     VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="..." VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE="..." VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN="..." -- echo 'pwned'
     ```
     Depending on how the rest of the command is structured and parsed, `-- echo 'pwned'` could be interpreted as additional options or commands, leading to unintended execution.

- Security test case:
  1. **Prerequisites:**
     - Set up a local Git repository that requires authentication for remote operations (e.g., using HTTP authentication to a dummy server, or SSH to a controlled server).
     - Configure Git to use the `askpass.sh` script provided by Git Graph as the `GIT_ASKPASS` program. This can be done by setting the `GIT_ASKPASS` environment variable to the absolute path of `askpass.sh`.
  2. **Exploitation attempt:**
     - Identify a scenario within the Git Graph extension where user-controlled input might be incorporated into a Git command that triggers the `askpass.sh` script. This step requires deeper knowledge of the Git Graph extension's codebase, which is not fully provided. For the sake of this test case, let's assume there is a way to influence a Git command, perhaps through a custom remote URL or branch name that gets processed by the extension and passed down to Git operations.
     - Craft a malicious input that, when processed by the Git Graph extension and passed as an argument to `askpass.sh`, will execute a command. A simple test is to attempt to create a file. Let's assume we can inject arguments into the `askpass.sh` call. Try to craft an input that would result in `askpass.sh` being called with an argument like `-- "$(touch /tmp/pwned_file)"`.
  3. **Trigger the vulnerable operation:**
     - In Git Graph, perform the Git operation that you suspect is vulnerable and will trigger the `askpass.sh` script with your malicious input. This could be a fetch, pull, push, or any operation that might require authentication.
  4. **Verify command execution:**
     - After triggering the operation, check if the injected command was executed. In our example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned_file` was created. If the file exists, it confirms that command injection was successful.
  5. **Refinement (if initial attempt fails):**
     - If the initial attempt fails, further analyze the Git Graph extension's behavior to understand how it constructs Git commands and calls `askpass.sh`.
     - Experiment with different injection techniques and payloads to bypass any potential input filtering or escaping that might be present in the extension (though none is evident in `askpass.sh` itself).
