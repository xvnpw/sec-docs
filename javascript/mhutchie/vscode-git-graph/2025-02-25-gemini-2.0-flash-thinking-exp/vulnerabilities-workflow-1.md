### Combined Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: **TOCTOU vulnerability in askpass.sh leading to local file read**
- Description:
    1. The `askpass.sh` script uses `mktemp` to generate a temporary file name but does not create the file securely using `-p` option to specify a directory.
    2. The script then constructs a command to execute a Node.js script, passing the temporary file path as an argument.
    3. Before the Node.js script accesses the temporary file, a threat actor with local file system access can replace the temporary file with a symbolic link to a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    4. When the Node.js script attempts to read from the temporary file path, it will instead read the content of the file pointed to by the symbolic link (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    5. The `askpass.sh` script then outputs the content of this sensitive file via `cat $VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE`.
    6. This can lead to a local file read vulnerability, potentially exposing sensitive information to the threat actor.
- Impact: A threat actor can potentially read arbitrary local files on the system where the `askpass.sh` script is executed. This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information such as configuration files, credentials, or other user data.
- Vulnerability Rank: high
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: No mitigations are implemented in the provided `askpass.sh` script.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Securely create temporary files using `mktemp -p` to specify a secure directory for temporary file creation, mitigating TOCTOU vulnerabilities.
    - Ensure the Node.js script handles the temporary file securely and does not rely on insecure file operations based on the filename.
    - Consider alternative secure inter-process communication methods instead of temporary files for passing sensitive information.
- Preconditions:
    - The threat actor must be able to trigger a Git command within the Git Graph extension that requires authentication and invokes the `askpass.sh` script.
    - The threat actor must have local file system access to replace the temporary file created by `mktemp` with a symbolic link before it is accessed by the Node.js script. This might be possible in shared hosting environments or containerized environments where the attacker has some level of filesystem manipulation capability.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **`src/askpass/askpass.sh`**:
        ```sh
        #!/bin/sh
        VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE=`mktemp`
        VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" $*
        cat $VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE
        rm $VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE
        ```
        - Line 2: `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE=`mktemp`` - This line uses `mktemp` to generate a temporary file name. However, it does not use the `-p` option to specify a secure directory, nor does it create the file securely. This makes it vulnerable to TOCTOU attacks.
        - Line 3: `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" $*` - This line executes a Node.js script, passing the temporary file path as the first argument. If the Node.js script is designed to read credentials from this file based on the provided path, it becomes vulnerable if the file is replaced with a symlink.
        - Line 4: `cat $VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE` - This line reads the content of the temporary file (or the file pointed to by the symlink if a TOCTOU attack was successful) and outputs it.
        - Line 5: `rm $VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE` - This line attempts to delete the temporary file (or symlink).

        **Visualization:**

        ```
        [askpass.sh starts]
            |
            |--- mktemp -> /tmp/tmpfile.XXXXXX  (Vulnerable: Insecure temp file creation)
            |
            |--- Node.js script is executed with "/tmp/tmpfile.XXXXXX" as argument
            |
        [Attacker replaces /tmp/tmpfile.XXXXXX with symlink to /etc/passwd] (TOCTOU window)
            |
            |--- Node.js script tries to read from "/tmp/tmpfile.XXXXXX" (resolves to /etc/passwd)
            |
            |--- cat /tmp/tmpfile.XXXXXX (outputs content of /etc/passwd) (Vulnerability: Local File Read)
            |
        [askpass.sh ends]
        ```

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Prerequisites:**
        - Set up a local Git repository that requires authentication (e.g., using HTTP authentication).
        - Ensure you have write access to a temporary directory where `mktemp` typically creates files (e.g., `/tmp`).
        - You need to be able to execute commands as the user that runs the VSCode extension and `askpass.sh`.
    2. **Steps:**
        - Identify the temporary directory used by `mktemp` on your system (usually `/tmp` or `/var/tmp`).
        - Modify the `askpass.sh` script temporarily to output the generated temporary file path to a known location (e.g., a file in `/tmp/`). Add `echo "TEMP_FILE=$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE" >> /tmp/askpass_temp_file_path.log` after line 2 in `askpass.sh`.
        - Trigger a Git command in VSCode Git Graph that will invoke the `askpass.sh` script (e.g., try to fetch from the authenticated repository).
        - Check the `/tmp/askpass_temp_file_path.log` file to get the generated temporary file path, let's say it is `/tmp/tmpfile.XXXXXX`.
        - Before the Git authentication prompt appears or shortly after triggering the Git command, in a separate terminal, replace the temporary file with a symbolic link to `/etc/passwd`: `rm /tmp/tmpfile.XXXXXX && ln -s /etc/passwd /tmp/tmpfile.XXXXXX`.
        - Enter any dummy credentials in the Git authentication prompt in VSCode Git Graph to proceed with the `askpass.sh` execution.
        - Observe the output of the Git Graph extension or check the logs. If the vulnerability is triggered, the content of `/etc/passwd` might be displayed or logged, instead of the expected authentication input.
    3. **Expected Result:** The content of `/etc/passwd` (or another targeted sensitive file) is leaked, demonstrating a local file read vulnerability due to the TOCTOU issue in `askpass.sh`.

- Vulnerability Name: **Command Injection in `askpass.sh` via Unsanitized Arguments**
- Description:
    1. The `askpass.sh` script is invoked by Git (and thus potentially by the Git Graph extension) to handle user credentials when required for Git operations.
    2. The script constructs a command line by concatenating environment variables and the arguments passed to it. Critically, it uses unquoted `$*` to expand these arguments in the command:
       ```sh
       VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" $*
       ```
    3. This unquoted expansion of `$*` is vulnerable because it allows for shell command injection. If an attacker can control or influence the arguments passed to `askpass.sh`, they can inject arbitrary shell commands.
    4. By crafting a malicious prompt (e.g., by manipulating a remote repository URL or through a man-in-the-middle attack), an attacker can inject shell metacharacters (like semicolons, backticks, etc.) into the arguments passed to `askpass.sh`.
    5. When `askpass.sh` executes the command line with the injected malicious arguments, the shell will interpret these metacharacters, leading to the execution of attacker-controlled commands with the privileges of the user running the Git Graph extension and VS Code.

- Impact: Successful command injection allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the user's system with the privileges of the user running the Git Graph extension. This can lead to:
    - **Full system compromise:** Attackers can gain complete control over the user's machine.
    - **Data exfiltration:** Sensitive data can be stolen from the user's system.
    - **Malware installation:** The attacker can install malware, backdoors, or other malicious software.
    - **Integrity loss:** System configurations and files can be modified, leading to a loss of system integrity.
- Vulnerability Rank: critical
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - There are no implemented mitigations within the `askpass.sh` script itself.
    - The script relies entirely on the assumption that the input arguments (prompt strings and other parameters) are benign and safe, which is not a secure assumption when dealing with external or potentially compromised sources.
    - Environment variables `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE` and `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN` are also assumed to be safe paths, but no validation is performed on them within the script.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - **Use `"$@"` for argument expansion:** The most critical missing mitigation is to replace the unquoted `$*` with the properly quoted `"$@"` in the command construction. `"$@"` expands to each positional parameter as a separate word, but crucially, it preserves the argument boundaries and prevents word splitting and interpretation of shell metacharacters within arguments.
    - **Input Sanitization and Validation:** Any input received from external sources, including Git prompts or environment variables, should be rigorously validated and sanitized before being used in command execution. This could involve escaping shell metacharacters or using safer APIs to construct commands.
    - **Secure Command Construction:**  Refactor the command invocation to avoid relying on shell interpretation of strings. Consider using programming language APIs or wrapper functions that allow for safe construction of commands, where arguments are passed as distinct parameters rather than as part of a single shell string.
- Preconditions:
    - **Influence over Prompt Content:** An attacker must be able to influence the content of the prompt argument that is passed to the `askpass.sh` script. This can be achieved by:
        - Manipulating remote repository configurations (e.g., crafting a malicious URL that, when Git attempts to authenticate, generates a prompt containing malicious code).
        - Performing a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the Git client's credential request, allowing modification of the prompt string sent by the server.
    - **`askpass.sh` in Use:** The Git Graph extension must be configured (or by default, is configured) to use the provided `askpass.sh` script as the helper for Git credential prompts. This is typically the case when the extension is used in environments where graphical password prompts are not readily available or desired.
- Source Code Analysis:
    1. **Temporary File Creation:**
       ```sh
       VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE=`mktemp`
       ```
       A temporary file is created to serve as a pipe for communication with the Node.js script.
    2. **Vulnerable Command Execution:**
       ```sh
       VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" $*
       ```
       This line constructs and executes the command. The vulnerability lies in the unquoted `$*`.  Let's break down how this leads to command injection:
        - `$*` expands to all arguments passed to `askpass.sh`, separated by spaces. Without quotes, the shell performs word splitting and pathname expansion on these arguments.
        - If an argument contains shell metacharacters like `;`, `|`, `&`, `$(...)`, `` `...`` `, etc., the shell will interpret them. For example, a semicolon (`;`) acts as a command separator.
        - If an attacker provides an argument like `"prompt ; malicious_command"`, the unquoted `$*` will expand to `prompt ; malicious_command`. The command line then becomes effectively:
          ```sh
          VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="..." "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" prompt ; malicious_command
          ```
        - The shell executes this as two separate commands:
            1. `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="..." "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" prompt` (the intended, but now malformed command)
            2. `malicious_command` (the attacker-injected command)
    3. **Output and Cleanup:**
       ```sh
       cat $VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE
       rm $VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE
       ```
       These lines are executed after the potentially injected commands.

- Security Test Case:
    1. **Preparation:**
        - **Environment Setup:** Set up a test environment where you can control the execution of `askpass.sh`. You may need to set environment variables `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE` and `VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN` to point to a safe Node.js executable and a dummy Node.js script for testing purposes (or the actual ones if testing in a controlled non-production environment).
        - **Git Configuration:** Ensure Git is configured to use `askpass.sh` as the askpass helper. This can be done by setting the `GIT_ASKPASS` environment variable to the absolute path of the `askpass.sh` script for testing.
    2. **Execution with Command Injection Payload:**
        - **Direct Execution Test:**  Execute `askpass.sh` directly from the command line, simulating a malicious prompt argument. Use a payload that will clearly indicate successful command injection, such as creating a file in `/tmp`.
          ```sh
          ./askpass.sh "Prompt Text; touch /tmp/INJECTION_SUCCESSFUL"
          ```
        - **Simulate Git Trigger (if possible):** If you can simulate the Git Graph extension's invocation of `askpass.sh` with a controlled prompt, do so. This might involve crafting a specific Git command or scenario within the extension that leads to `askpass.sh` being called with a manipulated prompt.  (This step might require more in-depth knowledge of how Git Graph constructs Git commands and prompts).
    3. **Observation and Verification:**
        - **Check for Injected Command Execution:** After running the test command(s), check if the injected command has been executed. In the example above, verify if the file `/tmp/INJECTION_SUCCESSFUL` has been created.
        - **Examine Output/Logs:** Monitor the output of the `askpass.sh` script and any relevant system logs for signs of the injected command being executed.
    4. **Remediation Test:**
        - **Apply Mitigation:** Modify `askpass.sh` by replacing `$*` with `"$@"` on line 3:
          ```sh
          VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE="$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_PIPE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_NODE" "$VSCODE_GIT_GRAPH_ASKPASS_MAIN" "$@"
          ```
        - **Re-run Test:** Re-execute the same security test case as in step 2 with the modified script.
        - **Verify Fix:** Confirm that the injected command is no longer executed, and the vulnerability is mitigated. The test should now treat the entire input as a single prompt argument, without interpreting shell metacharacters within it.

This combined list provides a comprehensive overview of the identified vulnerabilities in `askpass.sh`, including detailed descriptions, impact assessments, mitigation strategies, and test cases to verify the presence and remediation of these security issues.
