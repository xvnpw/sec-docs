# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Enable developers to use the latest JavaScript language features across different environments (browsers, Node.js, etc.).
  - Maintain compatibility and stability for existing JavaScript codebases.
  - Provide a flexible and extensible platform for JavaScript transformation through plugins and presets.
  - Foster a strong and active open-source community around Babel.
- Business Risks:
  - Risk of introducing vulnerabilities in the Babel compiler that could affect a vast number of JavaScript projects relying on it.
  - Risk of supply chain attacks through compromised dependencies or build processes.
  - Risk of performance regressions impacting developer productivity and application performance.
  - Risk of compatibility issues leading to broken applications and developer frustration.
  - Risk of reputational damage if Babel is perceived as unreliable or insecure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open source code review by a large community. Implemented on GitHub through pull requests and issue tracking.
  - security control: Dependency scanning using automated tools. Implemented through GitHub dependency graph and potentially integrated into CI.
  - security control: Regular updates to dependencies. Implemented through automated dependency update tools and manual updates by maintainers.
  - security control: Code linters and static analysis tools used during development. Implemented in developer environments and potentially in CI pipelines.
- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities might be discovered and publicly disclosed before a patch is available due to the open-source nature of the project.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on community contributions may introduce potential security flaws if contributions are not thoroughly reviewed.
  - accepted risk: Complexity of JavaScript language and transformations increases the attack surface and potential for subtle vulnerabilities.
- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement a formal security vulnerability disclosure and response process.
  - security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing, especially for core compiler components.
  - security control: Integrate fuzzing into CI pipelines to automatically detect parsing and transformation vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generation as part of the build process to improve supply chain transparency.
  - security control: Enforce stricter code review processes with a focus on security considerations.
- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not directly applicable to the core Babel compiler functionality. Authentication might be relevant for any associated web services or infrastructure (e.g., website, documentation).
  - Authorization: Not directly applicable to the core Babel compiler functionality. Authorization might be relevant for access control to any associated web services or infrastructure.
  - Input Validation: Critical for Babel compiler. Babel must robustly validate and sanitize input JavaScript code to prevent code injection, denial-of-service, or other vulnerabilities during parsing and transformation. Input validation should be implemented at various stages of the compilation process, especially when handling user-provided code or configuration.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core Babel compiler functionality. Cryptography might be relevant for secure communication if Babel project involves web services or secure storage of sensitive data (e.g., API keys for integrations, though unlikely in this project).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - Compiling JavaScript code accurately and reliably.
  - Distributing Babel packages securely through npm registry.
  - Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Babel website and documentation.
- Data Sensitivity:
  - JavaScript Code: Medium to High sensitivity. While Babel is open source, the JavaScript code it processes can be proprietary and contain sensitive logic. Vulnerabilities in Babel could lead to exposure or manipulation of this code.
  - Babel Source Code: Publicly available, but integrity is crucial. Tampering with the source code could introduce vulnerabilities affecting millions of users.
  - Website Content: Low to Medium sensitivity. Website content is mostly public documentation, but compromise could damage reputation and potentially be used for phishing or malware distribution.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - What is the process for handling security vulnerability reports? Is there a dedicated security team or contact?
  - Are there any specific security compliance requirements that Babel needs to adhere to?
  - What is the frequency of security audits and penetration testing for Babel?
  - Are there any plans to implement SBOM generation for Babel packages?
- Assumptions:
  - Babel project prioritizes developer experience and compatibility.
  - Security is a significant concern for the Babel project due to its widespread use.
  - Babel relies heavily on the open-source community for contributions and security reviews.
  - npm registry is the primary distribution channel for Babel packages.
  - The Babel website is primarily for documentation and community information and does not handle sensitive user data.
