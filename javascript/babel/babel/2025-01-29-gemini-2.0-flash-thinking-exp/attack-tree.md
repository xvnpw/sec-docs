## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Babel Core](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_babel_core.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Babel Core:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a security vulnerability directly within Babel's core JavaScript code.
    *   **Impact:**  Direct code execution during the build process, potentially leading to full application compromise, code injection, or denial of service.
    *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update Babel, monitor security advisories, and consider static analysis of Babel's code (though less practical for application teams).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Babel's Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_babel's_dependencies.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Babel's Dependencies:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting a known vulnerability in one of Babel's dependencies. Babel's usage of the dependency triggers the vulnerable code path.
    *   **Impact:**  Depends on the dependency vulnerability, but could range from code execution during build to information disclosure or denial of service.
    *   **Mitigation:** Regularly update Babel and its dependencies, use dependency scanning tools, and monitor dependency vulnerability databases.

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise via Malicious Babel Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_via_malicious_babel_plugins.md)

*   **Compromise via Malicious Babel Plugins:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Introducing and utilizing a Babel plugin that contains malicious code.
    *   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts as plugins execute arbitrary code during the build:
        *   **Code Injection:** Injecting malicious JavaScript (XSS, backdoors) or other content into the compiled application output.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Stealing sensitive information like environment variables, build configurations, or source code and sending it to an attacker.
        *   **Build Process Modification:** Altering the build output in subtle or significant ways, introducing backdoors or vulnerabilities.
        *   **Supply Chain Poisoning (indirectly):** If the malicious plugin is widely used, it can poison the supply chain for other projects.
    *   **Mitigation:** Rigorous plugin vetting, code review, author reputation checks, community feedback analysis, plugin integrity checks, plugin approval processes, and regular plugin audits.

## Attack Tree Path: [Introduce Malicious Babel Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/introduce_malicious_babel_plugin.md)

*   **Introduce Malicious Babel Plugin:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** The initial step of getting a malicious plugin into the application's build process. This can be achieved through:
        *   **Supply Chain Attack on Plugin Repository:** Compromising a plugin author's account or directly injecting malicious code into an existing popular plugin on package registries like npm.
        *   **Creating and Promoting a Malicious Plugin:** Developing a plugin with malicious intent and promoting it through social engineering, SEO manipulation, or package name squatting to trick developers into using it.
        *   **Social Engineering to Install Malicious Plugin:** Directly tricking developers into installing a malicious plugin through phishing, misleading documentation, or other social engineering tactics.
    *   **Impact:** Sets the stage for all plugin-based attacks described above.
    *   **Mitigation:** Focus on secure plugin sourcing, developer awareness training against social engineering, and strong package management practices.

## Attack Tree Path: [Configuration Vulnerabilities in Babel](./attack_tree_paths/configuration_vulnerabilities_in_babel.md)

*   **Configuration Vulnerabilities in Babel:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Misconfiguring Babel settings in a way that introduces vulnerabilities or exposes sensitive information. Specifically, unintentionally exposing sensitive information within Babel configuration files.
    *   **Impact:** Information disclosure if sensitive data is exposed in configuration. Potentially unexpected or less secure application behavior in specific, less likely scenarios.
    *   **Mitigation:** Follow Babel's best practices for configuration, avoid storing secrets in configuration files, use environment variables or secure configuration management, and implement configuration validation.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Babel Ecosystem](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attacks_targeting_babel_ecosystem.md)

*   **Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Babel Ecosystem:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Compromising the broader Babel ecosystem, including Babel itself and its dependencies on package registries. This involves:
        *   **Compromise Babel Package on Registry:** Gaining control of the Babel package on npm (or similar registry) and injecting malicious code directly into the core Babel packages.
        *   **Compromise Babel Dependencies on Registry:** Compromising maintainer accounts or injecting malicious code into dependencies of Babel on package registries.
    *   **Impact:** Extremely widespread impact if successful, as many applications rely on Babel. Can lead to code execution in build processes across numerous projects, supply chain poisoning on a massive scale.
    *   **Mitigation:**  Robust package management practices, using package lock files, Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools, considering private package registries or mirroring, and verifying package signatures and checksums.  For Babel maintainers and registry operators, strong account security and package integrity measures are crucial.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Babel Core Path](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_babel_core_path.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Babel Core Path:**  This path describes exploiting a vulnerability directly in Babel's core code by crafting malicious JavaScript input that triggers the vulnerability during compilation. The input is typically indirect, coming from files processed by Babel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Babel's Dependencies Path](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_babel's_dependencies_path.md)

*   **Exploit Vulnerabilities in Babel's Dependencies Path:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within Babel's dependencies.  Attackers identify vulnerable dependencies and then craft attacks that leverage Babel's use of these dependencies to trigger the vulnerability.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Plugin Introduction and Execution Path](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_plugin_introduction_and_execution_path.md)

*   **Malicious Plugin Introduction and Execution Path:** This is a broad path encompassing various ways to introduce a malicious Babel plugin and then exploit its execution during the build process to achieve malicious goals like code injection, data exfiltration, or build process modification.  It includes sub-paths for different plugin introduction methods (supply chain attacks, malicious plugin creation, social engineering) and different malicious actions performed by the plugin.

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Compromise and Execution Path](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_compromise_and_execution_path.md)

*   **Supply Chain Compromise and Execution Path:** This path describes a large-scale supply chain attack where either Babel itself or its dependencies are compromised at the package registry level.  When applications download these compromised packages, the malicious code is introduced into their build process and potentially their runtime environment (indirectly through build artifacts).
