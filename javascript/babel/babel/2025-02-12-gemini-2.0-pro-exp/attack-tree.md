## Attack Tree Path: [1. Compromise Babel Configuration [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/1__compromise_babel_configuration__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This is the root of a major attack path.  Gaining control over Babel's configuration allows an attacker to dictate how code is transformed, opening the door to code execution.
*   **Why Critical:** Babel's configuration is the central control point for its behavior.  Compromising it gives the attacker significant leverage.

## Attack Tree Path: [1a. Inject Malicious `.babelrc` / `.babelrc.js` / `babel.config.js` / `package.json` (`babel` key):](./attack_tree_paths/1a__inject_malicious___babelrc_____babelrc_js____babel_config_js____package_json____babel__key_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker modifies a Babel configuration file to include malicious settings or load a malicious plugin.
*   **Methods:**
    *   Direct file modification (if the attacker has write access to the file system).
    *   Exploiting a vulnerability that allows writing to arbitrary files.
    *   Social engineering (tricking a developer into committing a malicious configuration).

## Attack Tree Path: [1a1. RCE via Malicious Plugin [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/1a1__rce_via_malicious_plugin__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker injects a configuration that loads a malicious plugin (either one they control or a known vulnerable one).  This plugin executes arbitrary code during the transformation process.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on server/build system security and file permissions)
*   **Impact:** Very High (Full code execution on the server or potentially the client)
*   **Effort:** Medium (Requires access to modify configuration files)
*   **Skill Level:** Medium (Understanding of Babel configuration and plugin mechanisms)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (File integrity monitoring can detect changes, but the attacker might try to be stealthy)

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Babel Plugin Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_babel_plugin_vulnerabilities__critical_.md)

*   **Description:** This branch focuses on vulnerabilities within the plugins that Babel uses.  Plugins are often third-party code and can be a weak point.
*   **Why Critical:** Plugins extend Babel's functionality, but they also expand the attack surface.  A vulnerability in a plugin can be as dangerous as a vulnerability in Babel itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [2a. Exploit Known Plugin Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/2a__exploit_known_plugin_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker leverages publicly known vulnerabilities (often with published exploits) in specific Babel plugins.
*   **Methods:**
    *   Using publicly available exploit code (e.g., from Exploit-DB, Metasploit).
    *   Crafting custom exploits based on vulnerability descriptions (CVEs).

## Attack Tree Path: [2a1, 2a2. CVE-XXXX, CVE-YYYY:](./attack_tree_paths/2a1__2a2__cve-xxxx__cve-yyyy.md)

*   Represent specific, known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Depends on plugin popularity, vulnerability severity, and patch status)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (Depends on the specific vulnerability – could range from DoS to RCE)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Exploits for known vulnerabilities are often publicly available)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (Script kiddie to moderate skill – using existing exploits is easier than finding new ones)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Low (Vulnerability scanners can detect known issues)

## Attack Tree Path: [2c. Supply Chain Attack on Babel Plugin [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/2c__supply_chain_attack_on_babel_plugin__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker compromises the plugin's distribution channel, injecting malicious code before it reaches the user.
*   **Methods:**
    *   Compromising the plugin's source code repository (e.g., GitHub).
    *   Compromising the package manager registry (e.g., npm).
    *   Publishing a malicious plugin with a similar name (typosquatting).
    *   Social engineering the plugin maintainer.

## Attack Tree Path: [2c1. Compromise Plugin Repo:](./attack_tree_paths/2c1__compromise_plugin_repo.md)

*    **Description:** Gain access to plugin source code and inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [2c1a. Typosquatting [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/2c1a__typosquatting__high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker publishes a malicious package with a name very similar to a legitimate, popular Babel plugin (e.g., `bable-loader` instead of `babel-loader`).  Users might accidentally install the malicious package.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (Relatively easy to do, success depends on user error)
    *   **Impact:** High (Can compromise any project that installs the malicious package)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Creating and publishing a package is straightforward)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic knowledge of package management)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires careful examination of package names and vigilance)

## Attack Tree Path: [2c1b. Social Engineering:](./attack_tree_paths/2c1b__social_engineering.md)

*   **Description:** Trick plugin maintainer into accepting malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [2c2. Publish Malicious Plugin to NPM/etc. [HIGH RISK]:](./attack_tree_paths/2c2__publish_malicious_plugin_to_npmetc___high_risk_.md)

*   **Description:** The attacker creates and publishes a completely new, malicious plugin to a package manager.  This is different from typosquatting, as it doesn't rely on mimicking an existing package.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low (Package managers have some security measures, but a determined attacker can still succeed)
    *   **Impact:** Very High (Can compromise any project that installs the malicious plugin)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Creating and publishing a package is relatively easy)
    *   **Skill Level:** Low (Basic knowledge of package management)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Requires monitoring for new or suspicious packages and analyzing their behavior)
