## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities were identified in the Python Indent VS Code extension that meet the specified criteria for inclusion.

**Reasoning:**

After reviewing the provided files, which consist primarily of documentation, configuration files, and CI setup, the core source code of the Python Indent extension (specifically the Rust/WASM parsing logic and the Typescript/Javascript extension code) is not included.  Therefore, a detailed source code analysis to identify exploitable vulnerabilities by an external attacker against a publicly available instance is not possible based on the provided information.

The available files describe the extension's functionality and features, but do not expose any code that can be directly analyzed for vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker.

The nature of the extension, which focuses on code indentation within a local editor environment, inherently limits the potential for high-rank vulnerabilities accessible to external attackers. Any potential vulnerabilities would likely be triggered by a user opening and editing a specially crafted Python file within their local VS Code environment with the extension installed. Such scenarios fall outside the scope of an *external attacker* exploiting a *publicly available instance*.

Given the constraints outlined in the instructions (excluding DoS, vulnerabilities caused by insecure usage within project files, and missing documentation, and focusing on high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by external attackers), and the absence of analyzable source code, no high-rank vulnerabilities could be identified based solely on the provided PROJECT FILES.

It is important to re-emphasize that this conclusion is limited to the *provided files*. A comprehensive security audit necessitating the identification of high-rank vulnerabilities would require access to and thorough analysis of the complete source code of the Python Indent extension, particularly the Rust parsing logic, which is not included in the project files provided.
