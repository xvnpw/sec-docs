- **Vulnerability Name:** Unsafe WebAssembly Input Handling in Python Parser

  - **Description:**  
    The extension’s core logic for determining proper Python indentation was recently migrated from TypeScript to Rust and is now exposed via a WebAssembly (WASM) module (see CHANGELOG version 1.19.0 and Cargo.toml). When the user presses Enter, the extension parses the Python code (up to the current cursor position) to determine correct indentation. An attacker could craft a malicious Python file (for example, by publishing a repository that a victim later opens) containing extremely deep nesting or specifically repeated patterns that push the boundaries of “normal” input size or complexity. If this input is passed unchecked into the WASM module—and if, for any reason (such as use of unchecked arithmetic in an unsafe block) the WASM routines do not enforce strict input validation—then the malicious payload could trigger an edge-case (like an integer overflow or a miscalculation in buffer handling). This unexpected behavior in the WASM boundary might result in memory corruption and offer a path toward arbitrary code execution within the VS Code extension’s process.
    
    *Step-by-step attack outline:*  
    1. An attacker publishes a GitHub repository (or otherwise distributes a file) containing a Python file with extremely deep or complex nested structures.  
    2. A victim, unaware of the embedded malicious structure, opens the repository or file in VS Code with the Python Indent extension enabled.  
    3. The user’s act of editing (for example, pressing Enter at a point in the file) triggers the extension’s indentation logic, which forwards the unsanitized input to the WASM parser.  
    4. The specially crafted input causes the WASM module to process data beyond its safe operational parameters, ultimately triggering a bug that could be exploited for arbitrary code execution.

  - **Impact:**  
    Exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the VS Code extension’s process. Since VS Code often has access to sensitive project data and carries privileges in the development environment, such a vulnerability could lead to a broad compromise of the editor session and potentially the underlying system.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**  
    - The WASM module is written in Rust, which normally enforces memory safety via its type system and borrow checking.  
    - Integration with WebAssembly via `wasm-bindgen` places the parser in a sandboxed environment relative to the host VS Code process.  
    - The extension avoids processing when multiple cursors exist, reducing unpredictable input handling in certain scenarios.
      
  - **Missing Mitigations:**  
    - There is no explicit validation or enforcement of limits on the length, depth, or complexity of the Python code snippet passed to the WASM parser.  
    - The parser does not appear to implement defensive checks (such as input size thresholds or complexity checks) before processing — a gap that could allow adversarial input to reach any unchecked arithmetic (or unsafe code blocks, if any) present in the module.  
    - Comprehensive error handling for edge-case arithmetic operations (e.g., integer overflows) prior to entering the unsafe regions is not evident from the provided documentation and configuration files.

  - **Preconditions:**  
    - The attacker must be able to influence the content of a Python file that a victim will later open (for example, by hosting a malicious public repository or providing a manipulated file).  
    - The victim must have the Python Indent extension active in an environment that permits untrusted workspaces (a configuration noted as acceptable in the CHANGELOG).

  - **Source Code Analysis:**  
    - **Step 1:** The CHANGELOG indicates that the main indentation parsing logic was migrated from TypeScript to Rust (v1.19.0), and it is now exposed via WebAssembly.  
    - **Step 2:** The Cargo.toml file shows dependencies on libraries such as `regex` and `wasm-bindgen`. Although these Rust libraries are designed for safety, there is no indication that input length or complexity is being validated before processing.  
    - **Step 3:** The absence of visible input validation routines in configuration or developer documentation suggests that the parser accepts the raw Python snippet (up to the cursor).  
    - **Step 4:** If any internal routines make unchecked assumptions about input size or nesting (for example, using unsafe blocks for performance-sensitive operations), a maliciously crafted Python file with unusually deep nesting or repetition could force the parser into an edge-case, potentially impacting memory boundaries.
    
  - **Security Test Case:**  
    1. **Setup:**  
       - Prepare a Python file that contains an extremely deep nesting structure. For example, generate a file with hundreds or thousands of levels of nested brackets:
         ```python
         # Example snippet (conceptual)
         a = [ [ [ [ [ ...  # Continue nesting deeply
         ```
       - Ensure that this file is accessible (for instance, hosted in a public GitHub repository or provided directly to a test system).
    2. **Execution:**  
       - Open the maliciously crafted Python file in VS Code with the Python Indent extension installed and active.  
       - Navigate to a location in the file where the nesting depth is high and place the cursor appropriately.  
       - Press `Enter` to trigger the extension’s indentation logic.
    3. **Observation:**  
       - Monitor the extension’s behavior: look for abnormal delays, crashes, or error logs that suggest unexpected memory behavior or arithmetic errors in the WASM module.
       - In a controlled debugging environment, verify whether any exceptions or panic messages occur that could indicate a breach of internal safety checks.
    4. **Confirmation:**  
       - If the extension exhibits behavior consistent with unsafe memory access or crashes (without the expected graceful handling), this confirms that the WASM input handling may be vulnerable to crafted inputs.
