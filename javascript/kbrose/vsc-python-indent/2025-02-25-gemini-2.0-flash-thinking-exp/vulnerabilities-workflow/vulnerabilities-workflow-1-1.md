## Vulnerability List

There are no high-rank vulnerabilities identified in the provided project files that are exploitable by an external attacker.

After reviewing the provided files, which primarily consist of documentation, configuration files, and CI setup, there is no source code available to analyze for potential vulnerabilities. The description of the extension suggests it modifies code indentation based on parsing Python code. While there could theoretically be vulnerabilities in the parsing logic or interaction with the VS Code API, without access to the source code (specifically, the Rust code in `src/lib.rs` and the extension's JavaScript/TypeScript code, along with `package.json`), it is impossible to identify and describe any concrete high-rank vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker.

The provided files do not reveal any mechanisms by which an external attacker could directly interact with the extension in a way that would trigger a high-severity security issue. The extension operates within the context of the VS Code editor and modifies the user's code formatting, which is primarily a functional aspect rather than a security-sensitive one.

Therefore, based on the provided information, there are no identifiable vulnerabilities that meet the criteria of being high-rank, exploitable by an external attacker, and introduced by the project itself.

It's important to note that this analysis is limited by the absence of the extension's source code. A thorough security audit would require examining the source code, especially the Rust parsing logic and the VS Code extension API interactions.
