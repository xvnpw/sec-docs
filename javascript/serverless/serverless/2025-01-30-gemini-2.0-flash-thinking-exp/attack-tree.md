## Attack Tree Path: [1. [CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Serverless Application](./attack_tree_paths/1___critical_node__compromise_serverless_application.md)

* **Description:** The root goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access to application data, functionality, or underlying infrastructure.
* **Mitigation:** Implement comprehensive security measures across all areas outlined in the attack tree.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Function Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/2___high_risk_path__exploit_function_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Targeting vulnerabilities within the serverless function code itself. This is a primary attack vector as functions are the application's core logic.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Code Injection Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting flaws in input handling to inject malicious code (SQL, Command, etc.).
        - **SQL Injection (if interacting with SQL DB):** Injecting malicious SQL queries to manipulate or extract database data.
        - **Mitigation:** Input validation, parameterized queries/ORMs, least privilege database access.
    - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Authentication/Authorization Bypass:** Circumventing security checks to gain unauthorized access to functions or data.
        - **Mitigation:** Robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, secure session management, thorough testing.
    - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Data Validation Errors:** Exploiting insufficient input validation to cause unexpected behavior or security breaches.
        - **Mitigation:** Strict input validation and sanitization on all function inputs.
    - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Logic Errors leading to unintended data access/modification:** Exploiting flaws in the application's business logic to manipulate data or gain unauthorized access.
        - **Mitigation:** Secure coding practices, thorough testing, code reviews, secure design principles.
    - **[CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and packages used by functions.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploiting known vulnerabilities in function dependencies (libraries, packages):** Using publicly known vulnerabilities in outdated or unpatched dependencies.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Outdated or unpatched dependencies:**  Failing to keep dependencies up-to-date with security patches.
        - **Mitigation:** Dependency scanning tools, dependency management, software composition analysis, regular updates, vendor security advisories.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Serverless Configuration & Deployment Issues](./attack_tree_paths/3___critical_node___high_risk_path__exploit_serverless_configuration_&_deployment_issues.md)

* **Description:** Targeting misconfigurations in the serverless environment setup and deployment process. This is serverless-specific and a major source of risk.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    - **[CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Overly Permissive IAM Roles & Policies:** Exploiting overly broad permissions granted to serverless functions and resources.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Function Role with excessive permissions (e.g., `*` resource access):** Functions granted more permissions than necessary, allowing access to unintended resources.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Resource Policies (e.g., S3 bucket policies allowing public access):** Resource policies that are too permissive, exposing data to unauthorized access.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Lack of Least Privilege principle applied to function roles:** Systemic failure to apply least privilege, increasing the attack surface.
        - **Mitigation:** Principle of least privilege, IAM policy reviews, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), policy validation tools.
    - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure API Gateway Configuration:** Exploiting misconfigurations in the API Gateway that exposes functions.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Missing or weak authentication/authorization on API endpoints:** Lack of proper authentication or authorization on API endpoints, allowing unauthorized access.
        - **Mitigation:** Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms (API keys, OAuth 2.0, JWT), API Gateway security audits.
    - **[CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH] Exposed Environment Variables & Secrets Management Issues:** Improper handling of secrets in environment variables.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Secrets (API keys, database credentials) stored directly in environment variables:** Storing sensitive credentials directly in environment variables, making them easily accessible.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Lack of proper secret rotation and management:** Failure to rotate secrets regularly, increasing the risk of compromise over time.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure storage or transmission of secrets during deployment:**  Secrets exposed during the deployment process.
        - **Mitigation:** Secrets management solutions (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.), secret rotation policies, secure secret injection, avoid hardcoding secrets.
    - Serverless.yml Misconfigurations
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Incorrect resource definitions leading to unintended access (e.g., public S3 buckets):** Misconfigurations in `serverless.yml` leading to unintended public exposure of resources.
        - **Mitigation:** Serverless.yml reviews, configuration validation, Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
    - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Deployment Pipeline:** Compromising the deployment pipeline to inject malicious code.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Compromised CI/CD pipeline leading to malicious code injection during deployment:** Attackers gaining control of the CI/CD pipeline to inject malicious code.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Lack of integrity checks on deployment artifacts:** Absence of checks to ensure the integrity of deployed code.
        - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure storage of deployment credentials:**  Compromised deployment credentials allowing unauthorized deployments.
        - **Mitigation:** Secure CI/CD pipeline, code signing & integrity checks, secure credential management, pipeline auditing.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. [HIGH RISK PATH] Metadata Service Exploitation (Cloud Instance Metadata)](./attack_tree_paths/4___high_risk_path__metadata_service_exploitation__cloud_instance_metadata_.md)

* **Description:** Exploiting the cloud instance metadata service, accessible by serverless functions, to retrieve sensitive information like temporary credentials.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Accessing instance metadata to retrieve temporary credentials:** Functions accessing the metadata service to obtain temporary credentials associated with their execution role.
    - **[HIGH RISK PATH] Using SSRF to access metadata service and gain unauthorized access:** Exploiting Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities within functions to access the metadata service.
    - **Mitigation:** Disable metadata access if not needed, network segmentation, metadata service protection, avoid logging metadata.
