# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Serverless Framework is an open-source tool designed to simplify the development, deployment, and management of serverless applications. Its primary business goal is to accelerate the adoption of serverless computing by providing a unified and streamlined experience across different cloud providers.

Business priorities and goals:
- Accelerate serverless adoption: Lower the barrier to entry for developers to build and deploy serverless applications.
- Multi-cloud support: Provide a consistent experience across major cloud providers, reducing vendor lock-in.
- Developer productivity: Enhance developer efficiency by automating infrastructure provisioning and deployment processes.
- Community growth and ecosystem expansion: Foster a vibrant community and plugin ecosystem to extend the framework's capabilities.

Most important business risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the framework itself could lead to widespread security issues in applications deployed using it.
- Lack of trust in the open-source project and its maintainers could hinder adoption, especially in security-conscious organizations.
- Incompatibility issues with evolving cloud provider platforms could disrupt user workflows and damage the framework's reputation.
- Dependence on community plugins introduces risks related to plugin quality, security, and maintainability.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:
- security control: Open-source project with public code repository on GitHub, allowing for community review and scrutiny. (Implemented: GitHub Repository)
- security control: Dependency management using package managers (npm/yarn), enabling vulnerability scanning of dependencies. (Implemented: package.json, yarn.lock/package-lock.json)
- security control: Code review process for contributions through pull requests. (Implemented: GitHub Pull Request workflow)
- security control: Security testing as part of development and release process (Assumption, details not explicitly provided in the repository but standard practice for mature projects). (Implemented: Development and Release Pipelines - assumed)

Accepted risks:
- accepted risk: Reliance on third-party plugins, which may have their own security vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Security vulnerabilities inherent in serverless platforms themselves are outside the framework's direct control.
- accepted risk: Potential for misconfiguration by users leading to insecure deployments.

Recommended security controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline for the framework itself.
- security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure and response process.
- security control: Provide security best practices documentation and examples for users deploying serverless applications.
- security control: Implement dependency scanning and update process for project dependencies.

Security requirements:
- Authentication:
    - Requirement: The framework itself does not handle user authentication for deployed applications. Authentication is the responsibility of the deployed application and the chosen cloud provider's services (e.g., API Gateway authentication, Lambda authorizers).
    - Requirement: For the Serverless Framework CLI and backend services (if any), secure authentication mechanisms should be in place for administrative tasks and access control. (Assumption: CLI access is primarily local, but remote management or future backend services might require authentication).
- Authorization:
    - Requirement: The framework should enforce authorization controls to ensure that users can only manage resources they are authorized to access within their cloud provider accounts. This is primarily managed by the cloud provider's IAM (Identity and Access Management) and the credentials configured for the Serverless Framework.
    - Requirement: Internally, within the framework's codebase, appropriate authorization checks should be in place to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.
- Input Validation:
    - Requirement: The framework must rigorously validate all inputs, including configuration files (serverless.yml), command-line arguments, and plugin inputs, to prevent injection attacks and other input-related vulnerabilities.
    - Requirement: Error messages should be informative for debugging but avoid revealing sensitive information.
- Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Sensitive data, such as API keys or secrets used for deployment, should be handled securely. The framework should encourage or enforce the use of secure secret management practices (e.g., environment variables, cloud provider secret management services).
    - Requirement: If the framework stores any sensitive data (configuration, state), it should be encrypted at rest and in transit. (Assumption: Framework primarily interacts with cloud provider APIs and doesn't store sensitive data persistently itself, but configuration files might contain sensitive information).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business processes we are trying to protect:
- Development and deployment of serverless applications by users.
- Integrity and availability of the Serverless Framework as a tool.
- Trust in the Serverless Framework project and its maintainers.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:
- Serverless Framework source code: High sensitivity - compromise could lead to widespread vulnerabilities.
- Cloud provider credentials used by the framework (indirectly through user configurations): High sensitivity - compromise could lead to unauthorized access to cloud resources.
- User configurations (serverless.yml): Medium sensitivity - may contain sensitive information about application architecture and deployment details.
- Build artifacts and published packages: Medium sensitivity - integrity is important to prevent supply chain attacks.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What is the vulnerability disclosure and response process for the Serverless Framework?
- Are there regular penetration testing or security audits conducted on the framework?
- What specific SAST and dependency scanning tools are used in the CI/CD pipeline?
- How are cloud provider credentials securely managed and handled by the framework?
- Is there a formal security champion or team responsible for the security of the Serverless Framework project?

Assumptions:
- Assumption: The Serverless Framework project follows secure software development lifecycle best practices.
- Assumption: Security testing is integrated into the development and release process.
- Assumption: The CI/CD pipeline for the Serverless Framework includes security checks like SAST and dependency scanning.
- Assumption: Cloud provider credentials are handled by users securely and the framework relies on secure credential management practices provided by cloud providers and operating systems.
- Assumption: Package registries used for distributing the Serverless Framework have their own security measures in place (e.g., package signing).
