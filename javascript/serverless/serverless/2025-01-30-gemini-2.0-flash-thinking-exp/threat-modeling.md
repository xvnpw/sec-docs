# Threat Model Analysis for serverless/serverless

## Threat: [Over-Privileged Function Roles](./threats/over-privileged_function_roles.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker exploits a compromised function with excessive IAM permissions. They can then access and manipulate resources beyond the function's intended scope, such as databases, storage, or other services. This can be achieved through code vulnerabilities within the function or compromised credentials.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data modification, unauthorized access to resources, service disruption, privilege escalation within the cloud environment.
*   **Affected Component:** Function IAM Role, Function Execution Environment
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Apply the Principle of Least Privilege when defining IAM roles.
    *   Create granular IAM policies specific to each function's needs.
    *   Regularly review and audit function IAM roles.
    *   Utilize IAM policy validation tools during deployment.

## Threat: [Event Injection/Manipulation](./threats/event_injectionmanipulation.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker injects malicious or manipulated events into the event source that triggers the function. This can bypass security controls, alter function behavior, or lead to unauthorized actions. For example, manipulating messages in a queue or API requests.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, data manipulation, unauthorized actions, bypass of security controls, business logic compromise.
*   **Affected Component:** Event Source, Function Code, Event Data
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Rigorous input validation and sanitization within the function code.
    *   Implement event signature verification if possible.
    *   Securely configure event sources and restrict access.
    *   Use message queues with access control and encryption.

## Threat: [Insecure Deployment Pipelines](./threats/insecure_deployment_pipelines.md)

*   **Description:** Attacker compromises the CI/CD pipeline used to deploy serverless applications. They can inject malicious code, configurations, or backdoors into functions during the deployment process. This can be achieved by compromising pipeline credentials or exploiting vulnerabilities in pipeline tools.
*   **Impact:** Full compromise of deployed application, backdoors, malicious code injection, data breach, service disruption.
*   **Affected Component:** CI/CD Pipeline, Deployment Process, Serverless Framework Configuration
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement secure CI/CD practices (access control, code signing, vulnerability scanning).
    *   Secure infrastructure-as-code configurations (e.g., `serverless.yml`).
    *   Use immutable deployments.
    *   Regularly audit and monitor the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   Implement multi-factor authentication for pipeline access.

## Threat: [Misconfigured Serverless.yml](./threats/misconfigured_serverless_yml.md)

*   **Description:** Incorrect or insecure configurations in the `serverless.yml` file (or equivalent) lead to vulnerabilities. Examples include overly permissive IAM roles defined in the configuration, publicly accessible functions due to incorrect API Gateway settings, or insecure resource configurations.
*   **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access, denial of service, privilege escalation, insecure resource deployment.
*   **Affected Component:** `serverless.yml` configuration, Serverless Framework Deployment
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement configuration validation and linting for `serverless.yml`.
    *   Use Policy-as-Code to enforce security policies in configuration.
    *   Conduct code reviews of `serverless.yml` files.
    *   Utilize secure configuration templates and best practices.

## Threat: [Secrets Management in Serverless.yml or Code](./threats/secrets_management_in_serverless_yml_or_code.md)

*   **Description:** Hardcoding secrets (API keys, database credentials) directly in `serverless.yml` or function code exposes them if the code repository or deployment artifacts are compromised. Attackers can extract these secrets and gain unauthorized access to dependent services or data.
*   **Impact:** Credential compromise, unauthorized access to dependent services, data breach, privilege escalation.
*   **Affected Component:** `serverless.yml` configuration, Function Code, Secrets Management
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Utilize dedicated secrets management services (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.).
    *   Store secrets as environment variables (securely managed).
    *   Never hardcode secrets in code or configuration files.
    *   Implement secret rotation and access control.

## Threat: [Vendor Service Vulnerabilities](./threats/vendor_service_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in the underlying serverless platform or managed services provided by the cloud vendor are exploited by attackers. This is outside of the direct control of the application developer but can impact the application's security.
*   **Impact:** Platform-wide vulnerabilities, service disruption, data breach, unauthorized access, depending on the vendor vulnerability.
*   **Affected Component:** Cloud Vendor Platform, Managed Services (e.g., Lambda, API Gateway)
*   **Risk Severity:** Variable (High to Critical depending on vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Stay updated on vendor security advisories and apply patches promptly.
    *   Review vendor security documentation and certifications.
    *   Implement robust application-level security controls as defense in depth.
    *   Consider multi-cloud strategy for critical applications (complex).

## Threat: [Malicious Serverless Framework Plugins](./threats/malicious_serverless_framework_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Using untrusted or malicious Serverless Framework plugins introduces vulnerabilities or backdoors into the serverless application. Attackers can distribute malicious plugins to compromise applications during deployment or runtime.
*   **Impact:** Backdoors in deployed applications, malicious code injection, compromised deployments, data breach, unauthorized access.
*   **Affected Component:** Serverless Framework Plugins, Deployment Process, Function Code
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully vet and audit Serverless Framework plugins before use.
    *   Use plugins from reputable sources and with active community support.
    *   Perform dependency scanning for plugins.
    *   Implement plugin whitelisting or blacklisting if possible.
