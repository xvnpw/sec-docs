# Attack Surface Analysis for serverless/serverless

## Attack Surface: [Over-Permissive Function Roles (IAM)](./attack_surfaces/over-permissive_function_roles__iam_.md)

*   **Description:** Serverless functions require IAM roles to access cloud resources. Granting excessive permissions to these roles violates the principle of least privilege and expands the potential damage from a compromised function.
*   **Serverless Contribution:** Serverless functions are often short-lived and numerous, making IAM management at scale more complex. The ease of deploying functions can lead to developers quickly granting broad permissions without careful consideration, increasing the risk of over-permissive roles.  The ephemeral nature of functions also means that a compromised function with over-permissions can be quickly replaced with a new instance, maintaining the vulnerability if the IAM role is not corrected.
*   **Example:** A serverless function designed to read from a specific S3 bucket is granted `s3:*` permissions. If this function is compromised through a code vulnerability, an attacker could potentially delete or modify any S3 bucket in the account, not just the intended one.
*   **Impact:**  Account compromise, data breaches, unauthorized resource access, lateral movement within the cloud environment.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant functions only the minimum necessary permissions required for their specific tasks.
    *   **Fine-Grained IAM Policies:** Utilize specific resource ARNs and actions in IAM policies to restrict access to only necessary resources and operations.
    *   **Regular IAM Policy Reviews:** Periodically review and audit function IAM roles to ensure they remain aligned with the principle of least privilege and remove any unnecessary permissions.
    *   **IAM Policy Validation Tools:** Use tools to validate IAM policies and identify overly permissive statements before deployment.
    *   **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) for IAM:** Manage IAM roles and policies through IaC (like Serverless Framework's `iamRoleStatements`) to ensure consistency, version control, and reviewability.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerable Dependencies in Function Code](./attack_surfaces/vulnerable_dependencies_in_function_code.md)

*   **Description:** Serverless functions rely on third-party libraries and dependencies. Using outdated or vulnerable dependencies introduces known security flaws that attackers can exploit.
*   **Serverless Contribution:** The rapid development cycles and often smaller, focused nature of serverless functions can sometimes lead to less rigorous dependency management compared to larger applications.  The ease of deployment can also accelerate the deployment of vulnerable code.  The "packaged and deployed" nature of serverless functions can also make it harder to retrospectively patch vulnerabilities in deployed functions if dependency management is not robust.
*   **Example:** A Node.js serverless function uses an outdated version of a popular library with a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious request that triggers the vulnerable code path, gaining control of the function's execution environment.
*   **Impact:** Code execution, data breaches, denial of service, function compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools in the CI/CD pipeline to identify known vulnerabilities in function dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Management Tools:** Utilize package managers (like npm, pip, maven) and dependency lock files to ensure consistent and reproducible builds and track dependencies.
    *   **Regular Dependency Updates:** Keep function dependencies up-to-date with the latest security patches and versions.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Integrate SCA tools into the development process to continuously monitor and manage open-source components and their vulnerabilities.
    *   **Minimal Dependencies:**  Reduce the number of dependencies used in functions to minimize the attack surface and simplify dependency management.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Serverless Deployment Pipelines](./attack_surfaces/insecure_serverless_deployment_pipelines.md)

*   **Description:** Compromised CI/CD pipelines used to deploy serverless applications can be exploited to inject malicious code, alter configurations, or gain unauthorized access to cloud resources.
*   **Serverless Contribution:** Serverless deployments are often highly automated and rely heavily on CI/CD pipelines. This makes the security of the deployment pipeline a critical control point.  If the pipeline is compromised, the entire serverless application and its underlying infrastructure can be at risk. The speed and automation of serverless deployments mean that compromised pipelines can rapidly deploy malicious changes across a large number of functions.
*   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD system used to deploy a serverless application. They modify the deployment script to inject malicious code into the function package or alter the `serverless.yml` configuration to grant themselves administrative access. When the pipeline runs, the compromised code or configuration is deployed to production.
*   **Impact:** Code injection, backdoors, data breaches, unauthorized access, complete application compromise, supply chain attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High** to **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure CI/CD Infrastructure:** Harden the CI/CD infrastructure itself, including access controls, vulnerability scanning, and regular security audits.
    *   **Pipeline Security Best Practices:** Implement security best practices for CI/CD pipelines, such as code signing, artifact verification, and least privilege for pipeline roles.
    *   **Secrets Management in Pipelines:** Securely manage secrets used within the CI/CD pipeline, avoiding hardcoding credentials in scripts or configuration.
    *   **Pipeline Auditing and Monitoring:** Implement logging and monitoring for CI/CD pipeline activities to detect and respond to suspicious actions.
    *   **Immutable Infrastructure for Pipelines:**  Use immutable infrastructure principles for pipeline components to reduce the risk of persistent compromises.
