# Threat Model Analysis for serverless/serverless

## Threat: [Insecure Deployment Practices (Serverless Framework Configuration Exposure)](./threats/insecure_deployment_practices__serverless_framework_configuration_exposure_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure Deployment Practices (Serverless Framework Configuration Exposure)
    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive configuration data (like API keys embedded in environment variables within `serverless.yml` or deployment credentials used by the Serverless Framework) if these files are stored insecurely in version control or if the CI/CD pipeline using the Serverless Framework is compromised. This allows them to deploy malicious code or modify the application's infrastructure through the Serverless Framework.
    *   **Impact:** Deployment of malicious code, unauthorized modification of infrastructure managed by the Serverless Framework, potential for complete application takeover, exposure of sensitive credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:** `serverless.yml`, `.serverless` directory, CI/CD pipeline configurations utilizing the Serverless Framework CLI.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in `serverless.yml`. Utilize secure secret management solutions provided by the cloud provider and reference them within the Serverless Framework configuration.
        *   Secure the CI/CD pipeline used for Serverless Framework deployments by implementing access controls, using secure credential management for deployment keys, and performing regular security audits.
        *   Store `serverless.yml` and related configuration files in private repositories with appropriate access controls.
        *   Avoid committing sensitive environment variables directly to version control. Utilize environment variable injection during deployment.
        *   Implement code review processes for changes to `serverless.yml` and deployment scripts.

## Threat: [Misconfigured API Gateway Authorization (Defined via Serverless Framework)](./threats/misconfigured_api_gateway_authorization__defined_via_serverless_framework_.md)

*   **Threat:** Misconfigured API Gateway Authorization (Defined via Serverless Framework)
    *   **Description:** An attacker bypasses authentication or authorization checks on API Gateway endpoints defined within the `serverless.yml` if the authorization configuration is incorrect or missing. This allows unauthorized access to the underlying serverless functions and the resources they manage, potentially exploiting vulnerabilities in those functions.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality exposed through API Gateway, potential for data breaches or manipulation, abuse of resources leading to financial loss.
    *   **Affected Component:** `functions[*].events.http.authorizer` configuration in `serverless.yml`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API Gateway endpoints defined in `serverless.yml` (e.g., API keys, JWT authorizers, IAM authorizers).
        *   Carefully configure the `authorizer` section for each HTTP event in `serverless.yml`.
        *   Use the principle of least privilege when defining API Gateway resource policies, even when using Serverless Framework's integration.
        *   Regularly review and test API Gateway configurations defined in `serverless.yml`.
        *   Enforce HTTPS for all API endpoints defined through the Serverless Framework.

## Threat: [Compromised Serverless Framework Plugins](./threats/compromised_serverless_framework_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Serverless Framework Plugins
    *   **Description:** An attacker utilizes a vulnerable or malicious Serverless Framework plugin that has been added to the project's dependencies (e.g., in `package.json`). This plugin, when executed during the Serverless Framework deployment process, could perform malicious actions such as injecting code, modifying infrastructure, or exfiltrating sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution within the deployment environment, unauthorized modification of infrastructure managed by the Serverless Framework, exposure of sensitive credentials or application data.
    *   **Affected Component:** `plugins` section in `serverless.yml`, `package.json` dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly vet and audit all Serverless Framework plugins before adding them to the project.
        *   Only use plugins from trusted sources with active maintenance and a good security reputation.
        *   Keep Serverless Framework plugins up-to-date with the latest versions and security patches.
        *   Consider using tools to scan plugin dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement a process for reviewing and approving plugin additions.

## Threat: [Serverless Framework Vulnerabilities](./threats/serverless_framework_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Serverless Framework Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a security vulnerability within the Serverless Framework itself. This could involve flaws in how the framework parses configuration files, interacts with cloud provider APIs, or handles deployment processes. Successful exploitation could allow for unauthorized access or control over deployed resources.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to or modification of cloud resources managed by the Serverless Framework, potential for remote code execution within the deployment environment, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** The Serverless Framework CLI and its core modules.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the Serverless Framework CLI updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor the Serverless Framework project for security advisories and updates.
        *   Follow security best practices when configuring and using the Serverless Framework.
        *   Report any suspected vulnerabilities in the Serverless Framework to the project maintainers.
