# Attack Tree Analysis for serverless/serverless

Objective: Gain unauthorized access to application data, resources, or functionality by exploiting serverless-specific vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   OR - Exploit Serverless Framework Vulnerabilities
    *   AND - Exploit Framework Configuration Vulnerabilities

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serverless Framework Vulnerabilities - Exploit Framework Configuration Vulnerabilities - Exploit vulnerabilities in the framework's handling of environment variables or secrets management.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serverless_framework_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_framework_configuration_vulnerabilities_-_exp_4d0e5c1f.md)

Exploit vulnerabilities in the framework's handling of environment variables or secrets management. **(CRITICAL NODE)**

*   Attackers exploit weaknesses in how the serverless framework manages environment variables or secrets. This could involve retrieving secrets stored insecurely in environment variables, exploiting vulnerabilities in the framework's secrets management integration, or gaining access to the underlying storage mechanism for secrets. Successful exploitation allows attackers to access sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, or encryption keys, leading to significant compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serverless Framework Vulnerabilities - Exploit Framework's Interaction with Cloud Provider - Exploit misconfigurations in the cloud provider setup orchestrated by the framework (e.g., overly permissive IAM roles).](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serverless_framework_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_framework's_interaction_with_cloud_provider_-_3f06f68c.md)

Exploit misconfigurations in the cloud provider setup orchestrated by the framework (e.g., overly permissive IAM roles). **(CRITICAL NODE, Part of HIGH-RISK PATH)**

*   Attackers leverage misconfigurations in the cloud provider resources created and managed by the serverless framework. A common example is overly permissive IAM roles assigned to Lambda functions. If a function has excessive permissions, an attacker who compromises that function (through other vulnerabilities) can then perform actions they shouldn't be able to, such as accessing sensitive data in other services or modifying infrastructure. This is a critical node because it directly grants attackers broad access within the cloud environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serverless Deployment Process Vulnerabilities - Compromise CI/CD Pipeline - Inject malicious code into the deployment package during the build process.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serverless_deployment_process_vulnerabilities_-_compromise_cicd_pipeline_-_inject_malicious__ed29d08e.md)

Inject malicious code into the deployment package during the build process.

*   **Compromise CI/CD Pipeline (CRITICAL NODE within HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   **Inject malicious code into the deployment package during the build process:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline and modifies the build process to include malicious code within the application's deployment package. This code will then be deployed along with the legitimate application code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serverless Deployment Process Vulnerabilities - Compromise CI/CD Pipeline - Modify the `serverless.yml` or other configuration files within the CI/CD pipeline.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serverless_deployment_process_vulnerabilities_-_compromise_cicd_pipeline_-_modify_the__serve_3d7ae23b.md)

Modify the `serverless.yml` or other configuration files within the CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Compromise CI/CD Pipeline (CRITICAL NODE within HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   **Modify the `serverless.yml` or other configuration files within the CI/CD pipeline:** Attackers alter the serverless configuration files within the CI/CD pipeline to introduce vulnerabilities. This could involve changing function handlers, adding new functions with malicious intent, or modifying resource configurations to be less secure.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Serverless Deployment Process Vulnerabilities - Compromise CI/CD Pipeline - Steal deployment credentials used by the CI/CD pipeline.](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_serverless_deployment_process_vulnerabilities_-_compromise_cicd_pipeline_-_steal_deployment__df813d08.md)

Steal deployment credentials used by the CI/CD pipeline. **(CRITICAL NODE within HIGH-RISK PATH)**

*   **Compromise CI/CD Pipeline (CRITICAL NODE within HIGH-RISK PATH):**
    *   **Steal deployment credentials used by the CI/CD pipeline (CRITICAL NODE within HIGH-RISK PATH):** Attackers obtain the credentials used by the CI/CD pipeline to deploy the application. With these credentials, they can directly deploy malicious versions of the application or make unauthorized changes to the cloud infrastructure.
