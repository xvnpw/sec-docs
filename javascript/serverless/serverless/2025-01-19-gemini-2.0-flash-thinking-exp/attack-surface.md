# Attack Surface Analysis for serverless/serverless

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Function Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/insecure_function_dependencies.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Function Dependencies**
    *   Description: Serverless functions often rely on external libraries and packages. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the function's execution environment.
    *   How Serverless Contributes: The ease of adding dependencies in serverless functions can lead to developers including numerous packages without thorough vetting or regular updates. The ephemeral nature of functions can also make dependency management and patching more challenging.
    *   Example: A serverless function uses an outdated version of a popular npm package with a known remote code execution vulnerability. An attacker can trigger the function with crafted input that exploits this vulnerability.
    *   Impact: Code execution within the function's environment, potentially leading to data breaches, unauthorized access to other resources, or denial of service.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Implement dependency scanning and vulnerability analysis tools in the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   Regularly update function dependencies to their latest secure versions.
        *   Utilize dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent dependency versions.
        *   Consider using minimal base images for function deployments to reduce the attack surface.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured IAM Roles and Permissions](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_iam_roles_and_permissions.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Misconfigured IAM Roles and Permissions**
    *   Description: Serverless functions require specific permissions to access other cloud resources. Overly permissive or incorrectly configured IAM roles can grant attackers excessive privileges.
    *   How Serverless Contributes: The fine-grained nature of serverless architectures often involves numerous functions with individual IAM roles. Managing these roles and adhering to the principle of least privilege can be complex and error-prone.
    *   Example: A serverless function responsible for processing user data is granted `AdministratorAccess` to the entire AWS account. An attacker compromising this function could gain full control over the cloud environment.
    *   Impact: Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, ability to modify or delete infrastructure, and potential financial loss.
    *   Risk Severity: Critical
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when granting IAM permissions to serverless functions.
        *   Use infrastructure-as-code (IaC) tools to define and manage IAM roles consistently.
        *   Regularly review and audit IAM roles and permissions associated with serverless functions.
        *   Utilize tools that help visualize and analyze IAM policies.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Secrets Management](./attack_surfaces/insecure_secrets_management.md)

*   **Attack Surface: Insecure Secrets Management**
    *   Description: Serverless functions often need access to sensitive information like database credentials or API keys. Storing these secrets insecurely increases the risk of exposure.
    *   How Serverless Contributes: The stateless nature of serverless functions discourages storing secrets directly within the function code. However, developers might resort to insecure methods like environment variables or hardcoding if proper secret management isn't implemented.
    *   Example: Database credentials for a serverless function are stored as plain text environment variables. An attacker gaining access to the function's environment (e.g., through a code vulnerability) can easily retrieve these credentials.
    *   Impact: Data breaches, unauthorized access to backend systems, and potential compromise of other services.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Utilize managed secrets management services provided by the cloud provider (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
        *   Encrypt secrets at rest and in transit.
        *   Implement proper access controls for secret management services.
        *   Avoid storing secrets directly in code or environment variables.

## Attack Surface: [API Gateway Misconfigurations](./attack_surfaces/api_gateway_misconfigurations.md)

*   **Attack Surface: API Gateway Misconfigurations**
    *   Description: API Gateway acts as the entry point for many serverless applications. Misconfigurations can expose backend functions to unauthorized access or attacks.
    *   How Serverless Contributes: API Gateway is a central component in many serverless architectures. Incorrectly configured authentication, authorization, or request validation can directly expose the underlying functions.
    *   Example: An API Gateway endpoint is configured without any authentication or authorization, allowing anyone on the internet to invoke the associated serverless function.
    *   Impact: Unauthorized access to backend functionality, data breaches, denial of service, and potential financial loss due to resource consumption.
    *   Risk Severity: High
    *   Mitigation Strategies:
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (e.g., API keys, OAuth 2.0) on API Gateway endpoints.
        *   Enforce request validation to prevent malformed or malicious requests from reaching backend functions.
        *   Configure appropriate rate limiting and throttling to prevent abuse.
        *   Regularly review and audit API Gateway configurations.
