# Threat Model Analysis for serverless/serverless

## Threat: [Unauthorized Function Invocation (Direct Invocation)](./threats/unauthorized_function_invocation__direct_invocation_.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Function Invocation (Direct Invocation)

    *   **Description:** An attacker directly invokes a Lambda function (or equivalent) using the cloud provider's API or SDK, bypassing authentication/authorization at the API Gateway (or other entry points). The attacker might discover the function's ARN (or equivalent) through information leakage or guessing.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker executes the function with its permissions, potentially accessing sensitive data, modifying resources, or triggering unintended actions. Bypasses intended business logic and security controls.
    *   **Affected Component:** The individual serverless function (e.g., AWS Lambda, Azure Function, Google Cloud Function).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Function-level authorization: Implement authorization checks *within* the function code (e.g., validating JWTs, checking API keys, using IAM conditions).
        *   Disable direct invocation: If the function is *only* meant to be triggered through a specific entry point, disable direct invocation at the cloud provider level.
        *   IAM conditions: Restrict function invocation to specific sources (e.g., the API Gateway's ARN) using IAM policy conditions.
        *   Monitor invocation sources: Use cloud provider monitoring (e.g., CloudTrail) to detect and alert on direct function invocations.

## Threat: [Malicious Event Payload Injection](./threats/malicious_event_payload_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Event Payload Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious event payload mimicking a legitimate event (e.g., S3 event, SNS message). This payload is injected into the event source, triggering the function with unexpected/harmful data. The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the event source or leverage misconfigurations.
    *   **Impact:** The function processes the malicious payload, potentially leading to data corruption, unauthorized data access, denial of service, or execution of arbitrary code within the function's context.
    *   **Affected Component:** The serverless function and the event source (e.g., S3 bucket, SNS topic, DynamoDB table).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Strict input validation: Implement rigorous input validation *within the function* to check the structure, format, and content of the event payload against a predefined schema. Reject unexpected data.
        *   Event source validation: Where possible, validate the authenticity of the event source. Use digital signatures or MACs if supported.
        *   Least privilege: Ensure the function's IAM role has only the minimum necessary permissions.
        *   Sanitize inputs: Sanitize event data before using it in operations (especially database queries or external API calls).

## Threat: [Dependency Hijacking](./threats/dependency_hijacking.md)

*   **Threat:** Dependency Hijacking

    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises a third-party library used by the serverless function. This could involve publishing a malicious version of a legitimate package, compromising a private repository, or exploiting vulnerabilities in the dependency management process.
    *   **Impact:** The compromised dependency executes malicious code within the function's context, potentially granting the attacker access to sensitive data, resources, or the ability to perform unauthorized actions.
    *   **Affected Component:** The serverless function and its dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to scan dependencies for known vulnerabilities before deployment.
        *   Dependency pinning: Pin dependencies to specific, known-good versions. Avoid using version ranges that could pull in malicious updates.
        *   Private package repositories: Consider using a private package repository to control the source of your dependencies.
        *   Regular dependency updates: Keep dependencies up to date, but *carefully* review changes and test thoroughly.
        *   Vulnerability scanning in CI/CD: Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning into your CI/CD pipeline.

## Threat: [Overly Permissive IAM Role](./threats/overly_permissive_iam_role.md)

*   **Threat:** Overly Permissive IAM Role

    *   **Description:** The serverless function's IAM role (or equivalent) is granted excessive permissions, allowing the function to access resources or perform actions not strictly necessary for its functionality.
    *   **Impact:** If the function is compromised, the attacker can leverage the overly permissive IAM role to gain access to other cloud resources, potentially escalating privileges and causing significant damage.
    *   **Affected Component:** The serverless function and its associated IAM role.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Principle of least privilege: Grant the function's IAM role *only* the minimum necessary permissions. Avoid wildcard permissions (*).
        *   IAM Access Analyzer: Use cloud provider tools like AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify overly permissive roles.
        *   Regular IAM audits: Regularly review and audit IAM roles to ensure they adhere to the principle of least privilege.
        *   Fine-grained permissions: Use fine-grained permissions to specify exactly which resources and actions the function can access.
        *   IAM policy conditions: Use IAM policy conditions to further restrict access based on specific criteria.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering via `serverless.yml`](./threats/configuration_tampering_via__serverless_yml_.md)

* **Threat:** Configuration Tampering via `serverless.yml`

    *   **Description:** An attacker gains access to the source code repository and modifies the `serverless.yml` file. They could change function configurations, resource allocations, or security settings (IAM roles, event source mappings).
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can deploy a modified version of the application with altered behavior, potentially introducing vulnerabilities, granting excessive permissions, or redirecting traffic. This can lead to data breaches, denial of service, or complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** The entire Serverless Framework deployment, including functions, resources, and configurations.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Code reviews: Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes to the `serverless.yml` file.
        *   Git hooks: Use Git hooks (pre-commit, pre-push) to enforce security checks.
        *   CI/CD pipeline: Use a CI/CD pipeline to automate deployments and enforce security checks before deployment, including static analysis of the `serverless.yml` file.
        *   Infrastructure as Code (IaC) security scanning: Use IaC security scanning tools.
        *   Secrets management: Store sensitive configuration values in a secrets manager and reference them in the `serverless.yml` file. *Never* hardcode secrets.
        *   Version control: Use a robust version control system (e.g., Git).

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_logs.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Exposure in Logs

    *   **Description:** The serverless function inadvertently logs sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, personally identifiable information (PII), or internal system details, to the cloud provider's logging service.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker with access to the logs can gain access to sensitive information, potentially leading to further attacks or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** The serverless function and the cloud provider's logging service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Log sanitization: Implement robust log sanitization practices *within the function code* to prevent sensitive data from being logged.
        *   Secrets management: Store sensitive data in a dedicated secrets manager and retrieve them securely at runtime. *Never* hardcode secrets.
        *   Log access control: Implement strict access control policies for your cloud provider's logging service.
        *   Log monitoring and alerting: Monitor logs for suspicious patterns or potential data leaks.
        *   Log encryption: Encrypt logs at rest and in transit.
