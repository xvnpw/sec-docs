# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for serverless/serverless

## Mitigation Strategy: [Granular IAM Roles per Function (Serverless-Specific Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/granular_iam_roles_per_function__serverless-specific_focus_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Granular IAM Roles per Function (Serverless-Specific Focus)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Function-Level Granularity:**  The core of this strategy is to leverage the Serverless Framework's ability to define IAM roles *at the function level*.  This is *not* a general security practice; it's a specific capability enabled by serverless platforms and frameworks.
    2.  **`serverless.yml` Configuration:**  Utilize the `provider.iam.role.statements` (AWS) or equivalent configurations (Azure Functions, Google Cloud Functions) within your `serverless.yml` file.  Define *separate* IAM role configurations for *each* individual function.
    3.  **Minimal Permissions (Function-Specific):**  Within each function's role definition, specify *only* the permissions required for *that specific function's* interaction with other cloud resources.  Avoid wildcard permissions (`*`).  Use resource-level permissions whenever possible (e.g., specify the exact S3 bucket and key prefix).
    4.  **Leverage Serverless Framework Variables:** Use Serverless Framework variables (e.g., `${self:service}`, `${opt:stage}`) to dynamically construct resource ARNs and avoid hardcoding values. This makes your configuration more maintainable and portable across stages.
    5.  **Automated Validation (Serverless-Specific):**  Implement pre-deployment checks *specifically designed for serverless IAM roles*.  These checks should analyze the `serverless.yml` file and the generated CloudFormation template (or equivalent) to ensure that:
        *   Each function has a dedicated role.
        *   Roles adhere to the principle of least privilege.
        *   No overly permissive policies are used.
        *   Resource ARNs are correctly constructed.
    6. **IAM Access Analyzer Integration:** Use tools like AWS IAM Access Analyzer, integrated with your CI/CD pipeline, to identify unused permissions *specifically within the context of your serverless application*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Over-Privileged Functions (Serverless-Specific, Severity: High):**  Directly addresses the common serverless anti-pattern of using a single, overly permissive IAM role for all functions.
    *   **Credential Exposure (Impact Amplified in Serverless, Severity: High):**  Minimizes the damage if a function's credentials (which are often short-lived in serverless) are compromised.
    *   **Lateral Movement (Serverless Context, Severity: High):**  Limits an attacker's ability to move laterally within your serverless application if one function is compromised.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Over-Privileged Functions:** Risk reduction: High.  Fundamental to serverless security.
    *   **Credential Exposure:** Risk reduction: High.  Limits the blast radius.
    *   **Lateral Movement:** Risk reduction: High.  Contains the attacker's access.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented. IAM roles are defined in `serverless.yml`, but some functions share roles. Automated validation is missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated roles for *all* functions.
    *   Automated IAM role validation in CI/CD (serverless-specific checks).
    *   IAM Access Analyzer integration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Concurrency and Timeout Limits (Serverless-Specific Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/concurrency_and_timeout_limits__serverless-specific_focus_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Concurrency and Timeout Limits (Serverless-Specific Focus)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`serverless.yml` Configuration:**  Utilize the `provider.timeout` and `functions.<functionName>.reservedConcurrency` (AWS) or equivalent settings (Azure, Google Cloud) within your `serverless.yml` file.  These settings are *specific to serverless function configuration*.
    2.  **Function-Specific Timeouts:**  Set a `timeout` value for *each* function, representing the maximum execution time in seconds.  This should be slightly longer than the expected maximum execution time, but not excessively long.
    3.  **Function-Specific Concurrency:**  Set `reservedConcurrency` for functions that need to be protected from resource exhaustion or that have specific scaling requirements.  This limits the number of concurrent executions of that function.
    4.  **Cold Start Considerations:**  When setting timeouts, consider the potential impact of cold starts.  If cold starts are frequent and significantly increase execution time, you may need to adjust timeouts accordingly or use provisioned concurrency.
    5.  **Monitoring and Adjustment (Serverless-Specific Metrics):**  Monitor serverless-specific metrics like `Invocations`, `Errors`, `Throttles`, and `Duration` (using CloudWatch or equivalent) to fine-tune timeouts and concurrency limits.  These metrics are unique to the serverless execution model.
    6. **API Gateway Integration:** If your functions are triggered by API Gateway, configure request timeouts and throttling limits *within API Gateway* to provide an additional layer of protection. This is a serverless-specific integration.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Serverless-Specific, Severity: Medium):**  Mitigates DoS attacks that attempt to exhaust function execution resources or trigger excessive billing (pay-per-use model).
    *   **Resource Exhaustion (Serverless-Specific, Severity: Medium):**  Prevents a single function from consuming all available concurrent executions, ensuring that other functions can be invoked.
    *   **Cost Overruns (Serverless-Specific, Severity: Low):**  Helps control costs by preventing runaway function executions and excessive scaling.
    *   **Cascading Failures (Serverless Context, Severity: Medium):** Prevents a single failing function from consuming all resources and causing other functions to fail.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Risk reduction: Medium.  Essential for managing serverless resource consumption.
    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Risk reduction: Medium.  Ensures fair resource allocation.
    *   **Cost Overruns:** Risk reduction: Low.  Directly impacts billing in a pay-per-use model.
    *   **Cascading Failures:** Risk reduction: Medium. Improves overall application resilience.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Timeouts are set for all functions in `serverless.yml`. Concurrency limits are not consistently set.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Concurrency limits for all functions.
    *   Regular review and adjustment based on serverless-specific metrics.
    *   API Gateway integration for throttling.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Function Event-Data Injection (Serverless-Specific Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/function_event-data_injection__serverless-specific_focus_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Function Event-Data Injection (Serverless-Specific Focus)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Event Source Awareness:**  Understand the specific event sources that trigger your serverless functions (e.g., API Gateway, S3, DynamoDB Streams, SNS, SQS).  Each event source has a different structure and potential attack vectors.
    2.  **Schema Validation (Event-Specific):**  Define *strict* input schemas that are *tailored to the specific event source*.  For example, if your function is triggered by an S3 event, validate the `s3` object structure within the event.  If it's an API Gateway event, validate the `body`, `headers`, and `queryStringParameters`.
    3.  **Serverless Framework Integration:**  Leverage the Serverless Framework's features for defining event sources and handling input.  For example, use the `events` section in `serverless.yml` to define API Gateway request validators (AWS).
    4.  **Input Sanitization (Context-Aware):**  Sanitize input data *based on how it will be used*.  If the data will be used in a database query, use parameterized queries (prepared statements).  If it will be displayed in a web browser, use output encoding.  The sanitization technique must be appropriate for the specific context.
    5.  **Event Source Validation (where possible):** If the cloud provider offers mechanisms to validate the event source itself (e.g., verifying the signature of an SNS message), implement these checks.
    6. **Test with Real Event Payloads:** Use realistic event payloads (obtained from the cloud provider's documentation or by logging actual events) to test your input validation and sanitization logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Injection Attacks (Serverless-Specific Vectors, Severity: High):**  Addresses injection attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in how functions process event data.  This is highly specific to the serverless event-driven model.
    *   **Data Corruption (Event-Driven Context, Severity: Medium):**  Prevents malformed event data from corrupting data stores or causing unexpected behavior.
    *   **Business Logic Bypass (Severity: Medium):** Prevents attackers from manipulating event data to bypass intended application logic.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Injection Attacks:** Risk reduction: High.  Crucial for preventing code execution and data breaches.
    *   **Data Corruption:** Risk reduction: Medium.  Maintains data integrity.
    *   **Business Logic Bypass:** Risk reduction: Medium. Protects application workflow.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Basic input validation on API Gateway requests, but not comprehensive or event-source specific.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formal input schemas tailored to each event source.
    *   Consistent sanitization based on data usage context.
    *   Event source validation.
    *   Testing with realistic event payloads.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Cold Start Mitigation (Serverless-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/cold_start_mitigation__serverless-specific_.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Cold Start Mitigation (Serverless-Specific)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Provisioned Concurrency (if supported):**  Utilize provisioned concurrency (AWS Lambda) or equivalent features (Azure Functions Premium, Google Cloud Functions minimum instances) to keep a specified number of function instances "warm" and ready to handle requests. This is a *serverless-specific* feature. Configure this in `serverless.yml`:
        ```yaml
        functions:
          myFunction:
            handler: handler.myFunction
            provisionedConcurrency: 5
        ```
    2.  **Function Warm-up (Plugin or Custom):**  Implement a "warm-up" mechanism to periodically invoke your functions and keep them warm.  This can be done using:
        *   **Serverless Framework Plugins:**  Use a plugin like `serverless-plugin-warmup`.
        *   **Custom Scheduled Events:**  Create a scheduled CloudWatch Event (or equivalent) that triggers a lightweight "ping" function that invokes your other functions.
    3.  **Code Optimization (Serverless Context):**  Optimize your function's code and dependencies to *minimize initialization time*.  This is particularly important for serverless functions due to the cold start penalty.  Strategies include:
        *   **Minimize Dependencies:**  Reduce the number and size of your function's dependencies.
        *   **Lazy Loading:**  Load dependencies only when they are needed.
        *   **Code Splitting:**  Split your code into smaller modules that can be loaded independently.
        *   **Language Choice:** Consider using languages with faster startup times (e.g., Go, Node.js) if cold starts are a critical concern.
    4. **VPC Configuration (if applicable):** If your functions are in a VPC, be aware that VPC-enabled functions can have significantly longer cold starts. Optimize VPC configuration (e.g., use dedicated subnets, minimize the number of security groups) to reduce this impact.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Timing Attacks (Severity: Low, but context-dependent):**  While not a primary security concern, cold starts can, in *very specific circumstances*, be exploited in timing attacks.  Mitigating cold starts reduces this (already low) risk.
    *   **Performance Degradation (Severity: Variable):** Cold starts directly impact the user experience. While not a direct security threat, poor performance can lead to user frustration and abandonment, which can have business consequences.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS - Indirect) (Severity: Low):** While not a direct DoS vector, very frequent cold starts *could* contribute to resource exhaustion under extreme load, making the system more vulnerable.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Timing Attacks:** Risk reduction: Low.
    *   **Performance Degradation:** Risk reduction: Variable (depends on application requirements).
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS - Indirect):** Risk reduction: Low.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   No specific cold start mitigation is implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Provisioned concurrency or a warm-up mechanism.
    *   Code optimization focused on reducing cold start time.
    *   VPC configuration review (if applicable).
