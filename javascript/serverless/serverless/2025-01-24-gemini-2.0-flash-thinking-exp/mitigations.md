# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for serverless/serverless

## Mitigation Strategy: [1. Function-Level Isolation and Least Privilege (Serverless Framework IAM Configuration)](./mitigation_strategies/1__function-level_isolation_and_least_privilege__serverless_framework_iam_configuration_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Function-Level Isolation and Least Privilege enforced through Serverless Framework IAM Role configuration in `serverless.yml`.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define IAM Roles in `serverless.yml`:**  Within your `serverless.yml` file, for each function, define a dedicated IAM role using the `iamRoleStatements` property.
    2.  **Specify Least Privilege Policies:**  Within each `iamRoleStatements` block, meticulously define IAM policies that grant only the minimum necessary permissions for the function to access required AWS resources. Use specific resource ARNs whenever possible to restrict access to particular resources.
    3.  **Apply Roles to Functions:** Serverless Framework automatically applies these defined IAM roles to the deployed functions during deployment.
    4.  **Regularly Review `serverless.yml`:** Periodically review your `serverless.yml` file, specifically the `iamRoleStatements` for each function, to ensure policies remain aligned with the principle of least privilege and no unnecessary permissions have been added.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Lateral Movement (High Severity):**  Compromise of one function is contained, preventing easy access to other parts of the application due to restricted IAM permissions defined via Serverless Framework.
    *   **Data Breaches (High Severity):** Reduced scope of data breaches as compromised functions have limited access to data based on IAM policies configured in `serverless.yml`.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (Medium Severity):** Makes privilege escalation harder as function permissions are tightly controlled through Serverless Framework's IAM configuration.

*   **Impact:** **High Impact.** Serverless Framework's IAM configuration is the primary mechanism for enforcing function-level isolation and significantly reduces the blast radius of security incidents.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   `iamRoleStatements` are used in `serverless.yml` to define IAM roles for functions.
    *   Basic least privilege is applied through `serverless.yml`, but policies can be more granular.
    *   Implemented in: `serverless.yml` configuration for all functions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Granular Resource ARNs in `serverless.yml`:**  `serverless.yml` configurations should be updated to use specific resource ARNs in `iamRoleStatements` instead of wildcard resources where feasible.
    *   **Automated IAM Policy Audits (related to `serverless.yml`):**  No automated checks to validate `serverless.yml` IAM policies against best practices or least privilege principles. This could be integrated into CI/CD pipeline, checking the `serverless.yml` configuration.

## Mitigation Strategy: [2. Event Source Security Configuration (Serverless Framework `events` Section)](./mitigation_strategies/2__event_source_security_configuration__serverless_framework__events__section_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Event Source Configuration using Serverless Framework's `events` section in `serverless.yml`.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Event Sources in `serverless.yml`:** Utilize the `events` section within your `serverless.yml` file to define event sources that trigger your functions (e.g., `http` for API Gateway, `sqs`, `s3`).
    2.  **Enforce Authentication and Authorization (API Gateway):** When using `http` events for API Gateway, configure authentication and authorization directly within the `events` section of `serverless.yml`. Use options like API Keys, IAM authorizers, or custom authorizers.
    3.  **Secure Queue/Bucket Policies (SQS, S3):** For event sources like SQS or S3, ensure that the corresponding queue or bucket policies are securely configured outside of `serverless.yml` (using AWS console or CLI/SDK).  Serverless Framework deploys functions that *react* to these events, but the security of the event source itself is configured separately. However, ensure your `serverless.yml` IAM roles grant functions *only* the necessary permissions to interact with these secured event sources.
    4.  **Review `events` Configuration:** Regularly review the `events` section in `serverless.yml` to ensure event sources are correctly configured and secured, especially authentication and authorization for API Gateway endpoints.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access to Functions (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized invocation of serverless functions, especially through API Gateway, by enforcing authentication and authorization configured via Serverless Framework.
    *   **Event Injection (Medium Severity):** Secure event source configuration (though configured outside `serverless.yml` for SQS/S3 policies) combined with input validation in functions reduces the risk of malicious event injection. Serverless Framework helps by deploying functions that are triggered by *intended* and hopefully secured event sources.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) (Medium Severity):** Rate limiting and throttling (configured in API Gateway, often defined via Serverless Framework `http` events) can mitigate DoS attempts at the API Gateway level.

*   **Impact:** **Medium to High Impact.** Serverless Framework facilitates the configuration of secure event sources, particularly API Gateway, which is a critical entry point for many serverless applications.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   API Gateway `http` events are used in `serverless.yml`.
    *   Basic authorization might be in place for some API endpoints, but not consistently enforced across all.
    *   Implemented in: `serverless.yml` configuration for API Gateway functions.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Consistent API Gateway Authorization in `serverless.yml`:**  Enforce authentication and authorization for all relevant API Gateway endpoints defined in `serverless.yml`.
    *   **Documentation and Best Practices for Event Source Security (related to Serverless Framework projects):**  Lack of clear documentation and guidelines within the project on how to securely configure event sources in conjunction with Serverless Framework deployments.

## Mitigation Strategy: [3. Serverless Framework Configuration Security (`serverless.yml` Security)](./mitigation_strategies/3__serverless_framework_configuration_security___serverless_yml__security_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Serverless Framework Configuration, focusing on `serverless.yml` and related files.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Hardcoding Secrets in `serverless.yml`:** Never hardcode sensitive information like API keys, database passwords, or encryption keys directly within `serverless.yml` or any other configuration files committed to version control.
    2.  **Utilize Environment Variables in `serverless.yml`:** Use environment variables within `serverless.yml` to manage configuration values that might vary across environments (development, staging, production).  While environment variables are better than hardcoding, they are still not ideal for highly sensitive secrets.
    3.  **Reference Secrets Management Services (Indirectly via IAM):**  While `serverless.yml` doesn't directly integrate with secrets managers, ensure that the IAM roles defined in `serverless.yml` (see Mitigation Strategy 1) grant functions permissions to access secrets from services like AWS Secrets Manager. Functions then retrieve secrets at runtime.
    4.  **Secure `serverless.yml` File Access:** Restrict access to the `serverless.yml` file and related configuration files to authorized personnel only. Protect your version control system where `serverless.yml` is stored.
    5.  **Regularly Review `serverless.yml` for Security Best Practices:** Periodically review your `serverless.yml` configuration to ensure it adheres to security best practices, including IAM role definitions, event source configurations, and avoidance of hardcoded secrets.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Secrets in Configuration Files (High Severity):** Prevents accidental exposure of secrets if `serverless.yml` or related files are compromised or accidentally leaked.
    *   **Unauthorized Access due to Misconfiguration (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of misconfigurations in `serverless.yml` leading to security vulnerabilities, such as overly permissive IAM roles or insecure event source setups.

*   **Impact:** **Medium Impact.** Securing Serverless Framework configuration, especially `serverless.yml`, is crucial for preventing accidental exposure of sensitive information and ensuring secure deployments.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Environment variables are used in `serverless.yml` for some configuration values.
    *   Secrets are sometimes still managed as environment variables, not dedicated secrets managers.
    *   Implemented in: `serverless.yml` configuration practices.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Strict No-Hardcoding Policy for `serverless.yml`:**  Formalize and enforce a strict policy against hardcoding secrets in `serverless.yml` and related files.
    *   **Guidance on Secrets Management Integration (related to `serverless.yml` IAM):**  Provide clearer guidance and examples within the project on how to use Serverless Framework IAM roles to enable functions to access secrets from dedicated secrets management services.
    *   **Automated Checks for `serverless.yml` Security:**  Implement automated checks (linters, security scanners) to analyze `serverless.yml` for potential security misconfigurations and hardcoded secrets.

## Mitigation Strategy: [4. Serverless Framework and Plugin Updates](./mitigation_strategies/4__serverless_framework_and_plugin_updates.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Serverless Framework and Plugins.
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Serverless Framework Releases:** Stay informed about new releases and security updates for the Serverless Framework (https://github.com/serverless/serverless).
    2.  **Regularly Update Serverless Framework CLI:**  Update your Serverless Framework CLI installation to the latest stable version. Use package managers like `npm` or `pip` to update.
    3.  **Update Serverless Framework Plugins:**  If you are using Serverless Framework plugins, regularly check for updates and security advisories for those plugins. Update plugins to their latest versions.
    4.  **Test After Updates:** After updating Serverless Framework or plugins, thoroughly test your serverless application deployments to ensure compatibility and no regressions are introduced.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Serverless Framework Vulnerabilities (Medium to High Severity):**  Reduces the risk of attackers exploiting known vulnerabilities in the Serverless Framework itself or its plugins.
    *   **Security Bugs in Deployment Process (Medium Severity):** Updates often include bug fixes that might address security-related issues in the deployment process managed by Serverless Framework.

*   **Impact:** **Medium Impact.** Keeping Serverless Framework and plugins up-to-date is a fundamental security practice to patch known vulnerabilities and maintain a secure deployment pipeline.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented.
    *   Serverless Framework CLI is updated occasionally, but not on a strict schedule.
    *   Plugin updates are less frequent and often reactive rather than proactive.
    *   Implemented in: Ad-hoc updates by developers.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Scheduled Serverless Framework and Plugin Updates:**  Establish a scheduled process for regularly checking for and applying updates to Serverless Framework and plugins.
    *   **Automated Update Notifications:** Set up notifications or alerts to be informed about new Serverless Framework and plugin releases, especially security-related releases.
    *   **Testing Process for Updates:**  Define a clear testing process to be followed after updating Serverless Framework or plugins to ensure deployments remain stable and secure.
