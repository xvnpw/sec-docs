# Threat Model Analysis for serverless/serverless

## Threat: [Overly Permissive IAM Roles (Serverless Framework Configuration)](./threats/overly_permissive_iam_roles__serverless_framework_configuration_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit overly permissive IAM roles defined within the `serverless.yml` file to access or modify AWS resources beyond the intended scope of the serverless application. This could involve reading sensitive data from databases or storage, modifying critical configurations, or even escalating privileges within the AWS account. The Serverless Framework is directly involved in creating and managing these roles based on the configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized resource access and modification, potential privilege escalation, and service disruption.
    *   **Affected Component:** `provider.iamRoleStatements` in `serverless.yml`, IAM roles created by the Serverless Framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Apply the principle of least privilege when defining IAM roles in `serverless.yml`. Grant only the necessary permissions for each function.
        *   Use more granular resource ARNs in IAM policies within `serverless.yml` to restrict access to specific resources.
        *   Regularly review and audit IAM roles and policies defined in the `serverless.yml`.
        *   Utilize tools like AWS IAM Access Analyzer to identify overly permissive policies generated by the framework.
        *   Consider using custom IAM roles and referencing them in `serverless.yml` for more granular control.

## Threat: [Insecure Serverless.yml Configuration](./threats/insecure_serverless_yml_configuration.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit misconfigurations directly within the `serverless.yml` file to gain unauthorized access or disrupt the application. This might involve exploiting exposed environment variables containing sensitive data, manipulating API Gateway configurations defined in `serverless.yml` for unauthorized access, or leveraging insecure resource policies set within the framework's configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information (credentials, API keys), unauthorized access to API endpoints managed by the framework, potential for denial-of-service attacks, and infrastructure manipulation orchestrated through the framework.
    *   **Affected Component:** `serverless.yml` file, specifically `environment`, `functions.events.http`, and `resources` sections managed by the Serverless Framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in environment variables within `serverless.yml`. Use secure parameter stores (e.g., AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store or Secrets Manager) and reference them.
        *   Carefully configure API Gateway endpoints with appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms directly within the `serverless.yml` configuration.
        *   Review resource policies defined in `serverless.yml` to ensure they are not overly permissive and align with the principle of least privilege.
        *   Use linting and security scanning tools specifically designed to analyze `serverless.yml` for potential misconfigurations before deployment.
        *   Implement version control for `serverless.yml` and track changes to the framework's configuration.

## Threat: [Compromised Deployment Credentials (Used by Serverless Framework)](./threats/compromised_deployment_credentials__used_by_serverless_framework_.md)

*   **Description:** If the AWS credentials used by the Serverless Framework for deploying the application are compromised, an attacker can leverage the framework to deploy malicious code, modify existing functions, or gain control over the entire serverless application infrastructure managed by the framework.
    *   **Impact:** Complete compromise of the serverless application, including data breaches, service disruption, and potential financial loss, all facilitated through the Serverless Framework's deployment capabilities.
    *   **Affected Component:** AWS access keys and secret keys used by the Serverless Framework (often configured through environment variables or AWS CLI profiles used by the framework).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Securely manage AWS credentials used by the Serverless Framework. Avoid storing them directly in code or configuration files.
        *   Utilize IAM roles for EC2 instances or CI/CD systems that deploy the serverless application using the framework, rather than long-lived access keys.
        *   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for AWS accounts used for deploying the application with the Serverless Framework.
        *   Regularly rotate access keys used by the framework if IAM roles are not feasible.
        *   Monitor AWS CloudTrail logs for suspicious activity related to credential usage by the Serverless Framework.

## Threat: [Insecure Plugin Usage (Serverless Framework)](./threats/insecure_plugin_usage__serverless_framework_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities in third-party Serverless Framework plugins to inject malicious code during the deployment process managed by the framework or gain unauthorized access to the deployment pipeline orchestrated by the Serverless Framework.
    *   **Impact:** Introduction of vulnerabilities into the deployed application through the framework, potential for backdoors injected during deployment, and compromise of the deployment pipeline managed by the Serverless Framework.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugins defined in `serverless.yml` under the `plugins` section, and the plugin code itself, which extends the Serverless Framework's functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully evaluate the security and trustworthiness of Serverless Framework plugins before incorporating them into the `serverless.yml`.
        *   Keep plugins up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities that could be exploited during the framework's operation.
        *   Review the plugin's source code if possible to understand its functionality and potential security implications within the Serverless Framework context.
        *   Limit the number of plugins used to reduce the attack surface of the Serverless Framework deployment process.
        *   Monitor plugin updates and security advisories related to the Serverless Framework ecosystem.

## Threat: [API Gateway Configuration Exploits (Defined in Serverless Framework)](./threats/api_gateway_configuration_exploits__defined_in_serverless_framework_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers could exploit misconfigurations in the API Gateway setup as defined within the `serverless.yml` file. This includes missing authentication definitions, overly broad CORS policies configured through the framework, or insecure request/response transformations specified in the framework's configuration.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to API endpoints managed by the Serverless Framework, data breaches through exposed APIs, cross-site scripting vulnerabilities introduced by misconfigured CORS, and potential for man-in-the-middle attacks on API traffic managed by the framework.
    *   **Affected Component:** `functions.events.http` section in `serverless.yml`, the API Gateway resources created and managed by the Serverless Framework.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Enforce authentication and authorization for all API endpoints directly within the `serverless.yml` configuration.
        *   Configure CORS policies restrictively in `serverless.yml` to allow only trusted origins for API access managed by the framework.
        *   Carefully review request and response transformations defined in `serverless.yml` to avoid introducing vulnerabilities into the API flow managed by the framework.
        *   Utilize API keys or other security mechanisms for rate limiting and access control, configurable within the Serverless Framework's API Gateway definitions.
