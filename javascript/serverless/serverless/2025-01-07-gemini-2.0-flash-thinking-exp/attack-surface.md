# Attack Surface Analysis for serverless/serverless

## Attack Surface: [Environment Variable Injection](./attack_surfaces/environment_variable_injection.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Environment Variable Injection
    *   **Description:** Serverless functions often rely on environment variables for configuration. If these variables are not properly secured or if the application logic doesn't sanitize their input, attackers can inject malicious values to alter application behavior or gain access to sensitive information.
    *   **How Serverless Contributes:** The widespread use of environment variables for configuration in serverless environments increases the attack surface if not handled securely.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the deployment pipeline or a related system and modifies an environment variable containing a database connection string, replacing it with a malicious one to redirect data.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to resources, code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store sensitive information securely using dedicated secrets management services (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault).
        *   Avoid storing sensitive data directly in environment variables.
        *   Sanitize and validate any input read from environment variables.
        *   Implement strong access controls for managing environment variables.

## Attack Surface: [Overly Permissive IAM Roles](./attack_surfaces/overly_permissive_iam_roles.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Overly Permissive IAM Roles
    *   **Description:** Granting serverless functions or other resources excessive permissions through IAM roles can allow attackers to perform actions beyond their intended scope if a function is compromised.
    *   **How Serverless Contributes:** The fine-grained permission model of cloud providers, while powerful, can be complex to configure correctly, leading to over-permissioning of individual functions.
    *   **Example:** A Lambda function responsible for processing user uploads is granted `s3:*` permissions on an entire S3 bucket instead of just the specific prefix it needs. If this function is compromised, an attacker could delete or modify any object in the bucket.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized resource access, privilege escalation, service disruption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when assigning IAM roles.
        *   Grant only the necessary permissions required for the function to perform its intended tasks.
        *   Regularly review and audit IAM roles to identify and remove unnecessary permissions.
        *   Use tools and policies to enforce least privilege.

## Attack Surface: [Misconfigured API Gateway Authorization](./attack_surfaces/misconfigured_api_gateway_authorization.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Misconfigured API Gateway Authorization
    *   **Description:** Improperly configured authorization mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, IAM roles) on API Gateway endpoints can allow unauthorized access to backend serverless functions.
    *   **How Serverless Contributes:** API Gateway acts as a critical entry point for many serverless applications, and its security configuration directly protects the backend functions.
    *   **Example:** An API endpoint intended for authenticated users is configured with an "OPEN" authorization, allowing anyone to access it without authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, potential for abuse and resource consumption.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms on API Gateway endpoints.
        *   Use appropriate authorizers (e.g., IAM, custom authorizers, Cognito) based on the application's requirements.
        *   Regularly review and test API Gateway authorization configurations.
        *   Enforce the principle of least privilege for API access.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Serverless Framework Configuration (`serverless.yml`)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_serverless_framework_configuration___serverless_yml__.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Insecure Serverless Framework Configuration (`serverless.yml`)
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities can arise from insecure configurations within the `serverless.yml` file, such as storing secrets directly in the file or defining overly permissive resource policies.
    *   **How Serverless Contributes:** The `serverless.yml` file defines the infrastructure and configuration of the serverless application, making its security critical to the deployment.
    *   **Example:** Database credentials are hardcoded within the `serverless.yml` file and committed to a public repository.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive credentials, misconfiguration of resources leading to vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Never store sensitive information directly in the `serverless.yml` file.
        *   Use environment variables or dedicated secrets management services for sensitive data.
        *   Carefully review and understand the implications of all configurations within `serverless.yml`.
        *   Use infrastructure-as-code best practices, including version control and secure storage of configuration files.
