## Serverless Application Threat Model - Focused on High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes

**Objective:** Compromise the serverless application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Serverless framework or its associated infrastructure.

**Attacker's Goal:** Gain Unauthorized Access or Control of the Application and its Resources.

**Sub-Tree with High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

* Compromise Serverless Application
    * Exploit Serverless Framework Specific Vulnerabilities
        * **Compromise a Dependency of the Serverless Framework**
            * ***Inject Malicious Code into a Popular Plugin***
    * Exploit Underlying Cloud Provider Infrastructure (Specific to Serverless Context)
        * Exploit IAM Misconfigurations for Serverless Functions
            * ***Gain Access to Over-Permissive IAM Roles Used by Functions***
        * Exploit API Gateway Vulnerabilities (Entry Point for Serverless)
            * ***Bypass Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms at API Gateway***
    * Exploit Serverless Function Specific Vulnerabilities
        * Exploit Code Vulnerabilities within Serverless Functions
            * ***Injection Attacks (SQL, Command, NoSQL) within Function Code***
        * Exploit Environment Variable Exposure in Serverless Functions
            * **Access Sensitive Information Stored in Environment Variables**
    * Exploit Deployment Process Vulnerabilities (Specific to Serverless Deployment)
        * Compromise CI/CD Pipeline for Serverless Deployments
            * **Inject Malicious Code During Serverless Function Build or Deployment**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise a Dependency of the Serverless Framework:**
    * Description: Attackers target the dependencies of the Serverless framework itself.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Misconfigure `serverless.yml` for Privilege Escalation:**
    * Description: Incorrectly defined IAM roles or resource policies within `serverless.yml` can grant excessive permissions to the deployed functions.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Access Sensitive Information Stored in Environment Variables:**
    * Description: If environment variables are not properly secured, attackers might be able to access sensitive data like API keys or database credentials.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Low
    * Skill Level: Beginner
    * Detection Difficulty: Low

* **Inject Malicious Code During Serverless Function Build or Deployment:**
    * Description: Attackers can inject malicious code into the application during the build or deployment process.
    * Likelihood: Low to Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Inject Malicious Code into a Popular Plugin:**
    * Description: Compromising a popular plugin allows attackers to inject malicious code that gets executed during deployment or even within the deployed functions.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Gain Access to Over-Permissive IAM Roles Used by Functions:**
    * Description: If functions have overly broad permissions, attackers can leverage compromised functions to access other cloud resources.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Low to Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Bypass Authentication/Authorization Mechanisms at API Gateway:**
    * Description: Exploiting flaws in the API Gateway's authentication or authorization configuration can allow unauthorized access to backend functions.
    * Likelihood: Medium
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Medium
    * Skill Level: Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium

* **Injection Attacks (SQL, Command, NoSQL) within Function Code:**
    * Description: If functions process user input without proper sanitization, injection attacks are possible.
    * Likelihood: Medium to High
    * Impact: High
    * Effort: Low to Medium
    * Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate
    * Detection Difficulty: Medium
