# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for hakimel/reveal.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Reveal.js Library](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_reveal_js_library.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Regularly Update Reveal.js Library
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Monitor Reveal.js Releases:**  Actively monitor the official reveal.js GitHub repository ([https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)) for new releases and security advisories. Subscribe to release notifications or check the repository's "Releases" page regularly.
    2.  **Review Release Notes for Security Fixes:** When a new version of reveal.js is released, carefully examine the release notes and changelog. Prioritize updates that include security patches or address reported vulnerabilities in reveal.js itself.
    3.  **Test Updates with Your Presentations:** Before deploying updates to your production environment, thoroughly test the new reveal.js version with a representative set of your presentations in a staging or testing environment. Ensure that the update doesn't introduce any regressions or break existing presentation functionality.
    4.  **Apply Updates Promptly:** Once testing is successful, apply the reveal.js update to your production application as quickly as possible, especially if the update addresses known security vulnerabilities. This might involve updating your project's dependencies (e.g., via npm, yarn, or direct file replacement).
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Reveal.js Vulnerabilities (High Severity):** Outdated reveal.js versions may contain publicly known security vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to perform actions like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Remote Code Execution (RCE), or information disclosure within your presentations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exploitation of Known Reveal.js Vulnerabilities (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of attackers exploiting known weaknesses in the reveal.js library itself.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Dependency updates are performed periodically, but specific monitoring for reveal.js releases and security advisories is not consistently prioritized.
    *   *Location:* General dependency update process exists in the project's maintenance schedule.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Dedicated process for monitoring reveal.js releases and security advisories.
    *   Formalized procedure for reviewing reveal.js release notes specifically for security implications.
    *   Automated alerts or notifications for new reveal.js releases.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Reveal.js CDN Resources](./mitigation_strategies/implement_subresource_integrity__sri__for_reveal_js_cdn_resources.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Reveal.js CDN Resources
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate SRI Hashes for Reveal.js Files:** For each reveal.js file (JavaScript, CSS, plugin files) loaded from a Content Delivery Network (CDN), generate a Subresource Integrity (SRI) hash. Use tools like `openssl` or online SRI hash generators to calculate these hashes (e.g., `openssl dgst -sha384 reveal.js.min.js`).
    2.  **Add `integrity` Attributes to Reveal.js Tags:** In your HTML where you include reveal.js files from a CDN using `<script>` and `<link>` tags, add the `integrity` attribute. Set the value of the `integrity` attribute to the generated SRI hash, prefixed with the hash algorithm (e.g., `integrity="sha384-HASH_VALUE"`).
    3.  **Include `crossorigin="anonymous"` Attribute:**  Alongside the `integrity` attribute, also include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute for CDN resources. This is often necessary for SRI to function correctly with CDN resources due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) requirements.
    4.  **Verify SRI Implementation in Browser:** After deploying these changes, use your browser's developer console to check for any SRI-related errors when loading reveal.js resources. Correct implementation should load the resources without errors.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromise of Reveal.js CDN (High Severity):** If the CDN hosting reveal.js files is compromised by an attacker, they could inject malicious code into the reveal.js library files served from the CDN. SRI ensures that the browser only executes reveal.js files that match the expected hash, preventing execution of tampered files even if they come from the legitimate CDN URL. This mitigates supply chain attacks targeting the reveal.js delivery infrastructure.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromise of Reveal.js CDN (High Impact):** Effectively prevents the browser from executing compromised reveal.js files served from a CDN, significantly reducing the impact of a CDN compromise.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. SRI is used for the core reveal.js CSS and JavaScript files loaded from CDN in the main HTML template.
    *   *Location:*  SRI attributes are present on `<link>` and `<script>` tags for core reveal.js files in the base HTML template.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   SRI implementation for reveal.js plugins and any other reveal.js related assets (like themes, if loaded from CDN).
    *   Automated process to update SRI hashes whenever reveal.js or plugin versions are updated to ensure hashes remain valid.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Provided Content Rendered in Reveal.js Presentations](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-provided_content_rendered_in_reveal_js_presentations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User-Provided Content Rendered in Reveal.js Presentations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Content in Reveal.js:** Pinpoint all locations where user-provided content is dynamically inserted into reveal.js presentations. This could be through a CMS, API, or any mechanism where users can influence the content of slides, notes, or other parts of the presentation rendered by reveal.js.
    2.  **Implement Server-Side Sanitization:**  Perform HTML sanitization on the server-side *before* the content is sent to the browser and rendered by reveal.js. This is crucial to prevent bypassing client-side sanitization attempts.
    3.  **Use a Robust HTML Sanitization Library:** Integrate a well-vetted and actively maintained HTML sanitization library in your backend language (e.g., DOMPurify for JavaScript backends, Bleach for Python, HTML Purifier for PHP). Avoid relying on manual or regex-based sanitization, which are often error-prone.
    4.  **Configure Sanitization Allowlist for Reveal.js:** Configure the sanitization library to allow only a safe and necessary subset of HTML tags, attributes, and CSS styles required for formatting reveal.js presentations. Be restrictive and only permit elements that are essential for presentation content. Disallow potentially dangerous elements and attributes like `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `onload`, `style` attributes (unless strictly controlled), and event handlers.
    5.  **Thoroughly Test Sanitization with Reveal.js Context:** Test the sanitization implementation extensively with various inputs, including those specifically designed to bypass sanitization in the context of reveal.js rendering. Ensure that the sanitization effectively removes or escapes malicious code while preserving the intended formatting and functionality of reveal.js presentations.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Reveal.js Presentations (High Severity):** If user-provided content is not properly sanitized before being rendered within reveal.js, attackers can inject malicious scripts into presentations. When other users view these presentations, the injected scripts can execute in their browsers, leading to XSS attacks. This can result in session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the presentation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Reveal.js Presentations (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities arising from user-generated content within reveal.js presentations, protecting users from malicious scripts.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Basic HTML escaping is applied to user-provided content before rendering in reveal.js, but a dedicated HTML sanitization library with a strict allowlist is not used.
    *   *Location:* Backend API endpoint processing presentation content applies basic escaping.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Integration of a dedicated HTML sanitization library (like DOMPurify or Bleach) for sanitizing content specifically for reveal.js rendering.
    *   Configuration of a strict allowlist of HTML tags, attributes, and styles permitted for reveal.js presentations within the sanitization library.
    *   Regular review and updates of the sanitization allowlist to address new XSS vectors and ensure it remains aligned with reveal.js functionality.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) Tailored for Reveal.js](./mitigation_strategies/implement_content_security_policy__csp__tailored_for_reveal_js.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) Tailored for Reveal.js
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Define a Reveal.js-Focused CSP:** Create a Content Security Policy (CSP) header specifically designed for your application's use of reveal.js. This policy should restrict resource loading to only trusted sources necessary for reveal.js and your application to function correctly.
    2.  **Restrict `script-src` for Reveal.js:**  Configure the `script-src` directive to control JavaScript sources. At a minimum, include `'self'` to allow scripts from your application's origin. If you load reveal.js or its plugins from CDNs, whitelist those specific CDN origins in `script-src` (e.g., `script-src 'self' cdnjs.cloudflare.com`). Use `'nonce'` or `'strict-dynamic'` for inline scripts if absolutely necessary, but prefer externalizing scripts.
    3.  **Restrict `style-src` for Reveal.js Styling:** Configure the `style-src` directive to control CSS sources. Include `'self'` and whitelist any CDN origins used for reveal.js themes or styles (e.g., `style-src 'self' fonts.googleapis.com`).
    4.  **Control Plugin and External Resource Loading:** If you use reveal.js plugins or load external resources within presentations (images, videos, etc.), configure CSP directives like `img-src`, `media-src`, `font-src`, `connect-src`, and `frame-src` to restrict the sources of these resources to trusted origins. Be particularly careful with `frame-src` if you embed external iframes in reveal.js slides.
    5.  **Use `report-uri` or `report-to` for CSP Violations:** Configure the `report-uri` or `report-to` directives in your CSP to receive reports of CSP violations. This allows you to monitor your CSP's effectiveness and identify potential policy breaches or misconfigurations related to reveal.js resource loading.
    6.  **Deploy CSP Header in Application Responses:** Implement the CSP by setting the `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP header in your server's responses for pages that render reveal.js presentations.
    7.  **Test and Refine CSP with Reveal.js Functionality:** Thoroughly test your CSP to ensure it doesn't inadvertently block necessary resources for reveal.js to function correctly, including plugins, themes, and any external content you intend to display in presentations. Start with a report-only CSP (`Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only`) to test and refine your policy before enforcing it.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Reveal.js Context (High Severity):** CSP acts as a strong defense-in-depth mechanism against XSS attacks within reveal.js presentations. Even if other XSS prevention measures fail, a properly configured CSP can prevent the browser from executing injected malicious scripts by restricting script sources and other resource loading.
    *   **Data Injection and Exfiltration (Medium Severity):** CSP can limit the sources from which data can be loaded and to which data can be sent, mitigating certain data injection and exfiltration attempts that might be relevant in the context of reveal.js applications.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Reveal.js Context (High Impact):** Provides a significant layer of security against XSS attacks targeting reveal.js applications, even if other defenses are bypassed.
    *   **Data Injection and Exfiltration (Medium Impact):** Offers some protection against data-related attacks within the reveal.js application.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Not Implemented. CSP is not currently configured for the application serving reveal.js presentations.
    *   *Location:* No CSP headers are set in the application's server configuration or response headers for pages displaying reveal.js presentations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Definition and implementation of a Content Security Policy header specifically tailored for the reveal.js application.
    *   Configuration of `script-src`, `style-src`, `img-src`, `frame-src`, and other relevant CSP directives to control resource loading for reveal.js and its dependencies.
    *   Setup of CSP reporting (using `report-uri` or `report-to`) to monitor policy violations in the reveal.js application.
    *   Testing and refinement of the CSP to ensure it is effective for reveal.js security without breaking presentation functionality.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Carefully Vet and Audit Reveal.js Plugins](./mitigation_strategies/carefully_vet_and_audit_reveal_js_plugins.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Carefully Vet and Audit Reveal.js Plugins
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Plugin Usage in Reveal.js:**  Reduce the attack surface by only using reveal.js plugins that are strictly necessary for your application's required presentation features. Avoid adding plugins for non-essential or rarely used functionalities.
    2.  **Prioritize Official and Reputable Plugins:** When selecting reveal.js plugins, prioritize using official plugins maintained by the reveal.js core team or plugins from well-known and reputable developers or organizations within the reveal.js community.
    3.  **Review Plugin Source Code for Security:** Before integrating any third-party reveal.js plugin, especially those from less established sources, review the plugin's source code. Look for any potentially malicious or insecure code patterns. Understand what the plugin does and how it interacts with reveal.js and your application.
    4.  **Check Plugin Maintenance and Updates:** Choose plugins that are actively maintained and regularly updated. Check the plugin's GitHub repository or source for recent commits, issue activity, and release history. Actively maintained plugins are more likely to receive security updates and bug fixes.
    5.  **Consider Security Audits for Critical Plugins:** For highly sensitive applications or when using plugins from less trusted sources, consider performing a more in-depth security audit or penetration testing of the plugin code to identify potential vulnerabilities before deployment.
    6.  **Regularly Update Reveal.js Plugins:** Keep all reveal.js plugins updated to their latest versions. Plugin updates often include security fixes and bug patches. Monitor plugin repositories or maintainers for announcements of new releases and security advisories.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Reveal.js Plugin Code (High Severity):** A compromised or intentionally malicious reveal.js plugin could contain code that steals user data, performs unauthorized actions within the presentation context, or introduces vulnerabilities like XSS or Remote Code Execution (RCE) that can affect the security of your reveal.js application and users.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Reveal.js Plugin Code (Medium Severity):** Even plugins developed with good intentions can contain security vulnerabilities if they are not developed with security best practices in mind or if vulnerabilities are discovered later. Outdated or poorly maintained plugins are more likely to have unpatched vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Plugins (Medium Severity):** If a plugin's repository or distribution channel is compromised, attackers could inject malicious code into plugin updates, affecting applications that use the compromised plugin version.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Reveal.js Plugin Code (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of incorporating intentionally malicious code into your reveal.js application through plugins.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Reveal.js Plugin Code (Medium Impact):** Reduces the risk of using plugins with known or undiscovered security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Supply Chain Attacks via Plugins (Medium Impact):** Offers some protection against plugin-related supply chain attacks by promoting careful plugin selection, source code review, and update management.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. Plugins are generally selected based on required features, but a formal security vetting process or routine code audits are not performed for reveal.js plugins.
    *   *Location:* Plugin selection is primarily driven by functional requirements and ease of integration.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Formalized plugin vetting process that includes security assessment as a key criterion for reveal.js plugin selection.
    *   Routine source code review or security audits of reveal.js plugins, especially for newly added or less trusted plugins.
    *   Documentation of plugin vetting decisions and any security assessments performed.
    *   Process for tracking plugin updates and security advisories.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control `allow-scripts` Attribute for Iframes in Reveal.js Presentations](./mitigation_strategies/control__allow-scripts__attribute_for_iframes_in_reveal_js_presentations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control `allow-scripts` Attribute for Iframes in Reveal.js Presentations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Iframe Usage in Reveal.js:** Reduce the reliance on iframes within reveal.js presentations if possible. Consider alternative ways to embed content that don't involve iframes, especially for untrusted or less critical content.
    2.  **Avoid `allow-scripts` in Reveal.js Iframes by Default:** When using iframes in reveal.js slides, avoid using the `allow-scripts` attribute unless absolutely necessary for the intended functionality of the embedded content. If the embedded content does not require JavaScript execution, do not enable scripts.
    3.  **Utilize `sandbox` Attribute for Reveal.js Iframes:** Instead of `allow-scripts`, use the `sandbox` attribute to restrict the capabilities of iframes embedded in reveal.js presentations. The `sandbox` attribute, when used without any values (e.g., `<iframe sandbox>`), applies a very restrictive sandbox, disabling scripts, forms, and other potentially risky features.
    4.  **Apply Restrictive `sandbox` Values if `allow-scripts` is Required:** If you must use `allow-scripts` for iframes in reveal.js, combine it with a carefully chosen set of restrictive `sandbox` attribute values. Avoid using `allow-scripts` alone or with overly permissive `sandbox` configurations. Consider using combinations like `sandbox="allow-forms allow-popups allow-same-origin"` to limit iframe capabilities while enabling specific features. *Never* use `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin"` if embedding untrusted content, as this can be highly dangerous.
    5.  **Only Use `allow-scripts` for Trusted Sources in Reveal.js Iframes:**  Reserve the use of `allow-scripts` (even with `sandbox`) for iframes that embed content from highly trusted sources that you fully control and have verified to be safe.
    6.  **Regularly Review Iframe Configurations in Reveal.js Presentations:** Periodically review all iframes used in your reveal.js presentations and assess whether the `allow-scripts` attribute is still necessary. Verify that `sandbox` attributes are appropriately configured to minimize the iframe's capabilities and potential security risks.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Iframes in Reveal.js (High Severity):** If `allow-scripts` is used carelessly in iframes embedded in reveal.js presentations, especially when embedding untrusted content, attackers can inject malicious scripts that execute within the iframe's context. This can lead to XSS attacks that compromise the main reveal.js presentation or the user's session.
    *   **Clickjacking via Iframes in Reveal.js (Medium Severity):** Improperly configured iframes in reveal.js presentations can be exploited for clickjacking attacks. While `sandbox` can help mitigate this, careful iframe configuration is essential.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Iframes in Reveal.js (High Impact):** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities originating from embedded iframe content within reveal.js presentations.
    *   **Clickjacking via Iframes in Reveal.js (Medium Impact):** Offers some protection against clickjacking attacks related to iframes embedded in reveal.js, especially when combined with other clickjacking prevention measures.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Partially Implemented. `sandbox` attributes are used for some iframes in reveal.js presentations, particularly for video embeds, but consistent control and review of `allow-scripts` usage across all iframes is lacking.
    *   *Location:* Iframes for embedding external videos in reveal.js slides generally have `sandbox` attributes, but iframes used for other types of content might not be as consistently secured.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Systematic review of all iframe usage within reveal.js presentations to identify and minimize `allow-scripts` usage.
    *   Establishment of a clear policy to avoid `allow-scripts` in reveal.js iframes unless absolutely necessary and with strong justification.
    *   Default application of restrictive `sandbox` attributes to all iframes embedded in reveal.js presentations.
    *   Regular audits of iframe configurations in reveal.js presentations to ensure they remain securely configured and minimize potential risks.
