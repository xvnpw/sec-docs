### High and Critical Reveal.js Specific Threats

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown/HTML Content
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within Markdown or HTML content that is rendered by reveal.js. This occurs because reveal.js processes and displays user-provided content, and without proper sanitization, malicious scripts can be embedded within the presentation. The attacker might embed `<script>` tags or use HTML attributes like `onload` with malicious JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view the presentation. This could lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the presentation.
    *   **Affected Component:** reveal.js core rendering logic for HTML/Markdown slides. Specifically, the parts responsible for parsing and displaying Markdown and HTML content.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for user-provided content *before* rendering with reveal.js.
        *   Utilize a security-focused Markdown parser that mitigates XSS risks.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources and to prevent inline script execution.

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Configuration Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate reveal.js configuration options if the application dynamically generates the configuration based on user input or URL parameters without proper sanitization. For example, if a URL parameter directly influences a configuration setting that allows embedding HTML or executing JavaScript.
    *   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, similar to the previous XSS threat.
    *   **Affected Component:** reveal.js initialization and configuration module.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid dynamically generating reveal.js configuration based on untrusted user input.
        *   If dynamic configuration is necessary, strictly validate and sanitize all user-provided data before using it in the configuration.
        *   Define the reveal.js configuration in a secure manner, preferably server-side or within trusted client-side code.

*   **Threat:** Inclusion of Malicious External Resources
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject links to malicious external resources (images, videos, iframes) within the presentation content that reveal.js then attempts to load. This occurs because reveal.js, by design, allows embedding external content. The attacker might link to websites hosting malware or phishing pages.
    *   **Impact:**  Loading malicious content in the user's browser, potentially leading to drive-by downloads, exposing users to phishing attacks within iframes, or triggering other browser-based exploits.
    *   **Affected Component:** reveal.js core rendering logic for handling `<img>`, `<video>`, and `<iframe>` tags within slides.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement a whitelist of allowed external domains for embedded resources.
        *   Consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) for critical external resources to ensure their integrity.
        *   Scan uploaded media files for malware before making them available in presentations.

*   **Threat:** Vulnerabilities in Reveal.js Plugins
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit security vulnerabilities present in third-party or custom reveal.js plugins. These vulnerabilities are directly within the code and functionality of the plugins used by reveal.js. These vulnerabilities could range from XSS to more severe issues depending on the plugin's functionality.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution, information disclosure, or other malicious actions within the context of the presentation.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Specific reveal.js plugins being used.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the plugin and vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit all plugins before using them.
        *   Keep plugins updated to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege when developing custom plugins, minimizing their access to sensitive data or functionalities.
