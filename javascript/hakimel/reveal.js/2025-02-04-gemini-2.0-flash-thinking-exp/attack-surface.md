# Attack Surface Analysis for hakimel/reveal.js

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Markdown Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_markdown_injection.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts are injected through Markdown syntax within reveal.js slides, executing in a user's browser when the presentation is viewed.
*   **Reveal.js Contribution:** The reveal.js Markdown plugin renders Markdown content directly to HTML. Without proper sanitization of user-provided Markdown, malicious code can be injected and executed.
*   **Example:** Injecting `[Malicious Link](javascript:alert('XSS'))` in Markdown content. When rendered by reveal.js, clicking the link executes JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sanitize Markdown Input:**  Always sanitize user-supplied Markdown content *before* it is processed by reveal.js. Utilize a robust Markdown parser and sanitizer library to remove or escape potentially harmful HTML and JavaScript.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit script execution and resource loading, reducing the impact of successful XSS.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via HTML Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_html_injection.md)

*   **Description:**  Malicious scripts are injected directly within HTML code embedded in reveal.js slides, leading to script execution in the user's browser.
*   **Reveal.js Contribution:** reveal.js allows direct embedding of HTML within slides. If user-provided HTML is not sanitized, attackers can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript.
*   **Example:** Injecting `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` within a slide. When reveal.js renders this, the `onerror` event executes JavaScript.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sanitize HTML Input:** Sanitize all user-provided HTML content *before* rendering it with reveal.js. Employ a dedicated HTML sanitizer library to remove or escape dangerous HTML tags and attributes, especially event handlers.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control script sources and execution, mitigating XSS risks.

## Attack Surface: [Plugin Vulnerabilities (XSS in Reveal.js Plugins)](./attack_surfaces/plugin_vulnerabilities__xss_in_reveal_js_plugins_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities within reveal.js plugins allow attackers to inject and execute malicious scripts through the plugin's functionality.
*   **Reveal.js Contribution:** Reveal.js's plugin architecture enables extending functionality, but plugins, if vulnerable, can introduce XSS. Plugins often handle dynamic content or user input.
*   **Example:** A vulnerable chart plugin in reveal.js might fail to sanitize user-provided data used in chart labels, allowing XSS injection.
*   **Impact:** Account compromise, session hijacking, data theft, website defacement, potentially broader impact depending on plugin privileges.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Security Audits:** Regularly audit and review the code of reveal.js plugins for security vulnerabilities, focusing on input handling and rendering logic.
    *   **Use Trusted Plugins:**  Prioritize using well-maintained reveal.js plugins from reputable sources. Check for known vulnerabilities and security updates.
    *   **Keep Plugins Updated:** Ensure reveal.js plugins are updated to the latest versions to patch known security flaws.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Reveal.js Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_reveal_js_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers introduce intentionally malicious reveal.js plugins to compromise the application or user systems.
*   **Reveal.js Contribution:** Reveal.js loads plugins as external JavaScript files. If the application allows loading plugins from untrusted sources, malicious plugins can be introduced and executed within the reveal.js context.
*   **Example:** A user uploads a plugin that appears to add a feature but also contains code to steal credentials or inject malware when loaded by reveal.js.
*   **Impact:** Full application compromise, data theft, malware distribution, user system compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Plugin Whitelisting:**  Strictly control the sources from which reveal.js plugins are loaded. Implement a whitelist of trusted plugin sources or pre-approved plugins.
    *   **Plugin Code Review:** If custom or externally sourced plugins are used, mandate a thorough code review process before deployment to identify and prevent malicious code.

## Attack Surface: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Outdated Reveal.js Core and Libraries)](./attack_surfaces/dependency_vulnerabilities__outdated_reveal_js_core_and_libraries_.md)

*   **Description:** Using outdated versions of the reveal.js core framework or its underlying JavaScript dependencies that contain known security vulnerabilities.
*   **Reveal.js Contribution:**  Reveal.js, like any software, relies on its core code and external libraries. Outdated versions can contain publicly known and exploitable vulnerabilities.
*   **Example:** A known XSS or other vulnerability exists in a specific older version of reveal.js. An application using this outdated version becomes vulnerable to exploitation.
*   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, impacts can range from XSS to Remote Code Execution (RCE), potentially leading to full application compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Reveal.js Updates:** Keep the reveal.js core framework and all its dependencies updated to the latest stable versions. Monitor security advisories and apply patches promptly.
    *   **Dependency Scanning:** Implement automated dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in reveal.js and its dependencies. Integrate these scans into the development and deployment pipeline.
