# Threat Model Analysis for hakimel/reveal.js

## Threat: [Markdown/HTML Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/markdownhtml_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Threat:** Markdown/HTML Injection XSS
*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code by crafting malicious Markdown or HTML content. This is possible if the application allows user-controlled content to be embedded into the presentation without proper sanitization.
    *   **How:** The attacker leverages reveal.js's Markdown or HTML rendering capabilities to include `<script>` tags or event handlers containing malicious JavaScript. When a user views the presentation, this injected script executes in their browser.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Consequences:** Successful XSS can lead to session hijacking (stealing session cookies), data theft (accessing sensitive information within the application context), defacement of the presentation, or redirection to malicious websites.
*   **Affected Reveal.js Component:**
    *   **Component:** Markdown and HTML parsing and rendering within `reveal.js core`. Specifically, the parts responsible for processing slide content.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Sanitize User Input:**  Strictly sanitize all user-provided content before rendering it in reveal.js. Use a robust HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify, Bleach) on the server-side or client-side before passing content to reveal.js.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.). This can significantly reduce the impact of XSS even if it occurs. Configure CSP headers to disallow `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` for script sources.
    *   **Input Validation:** Validate user input to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain unexpected or malicious characters.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Reveal.js Core or Plugins](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_reveal_js_core_or_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** XSS in Reveal.js Core or Plugins
*   **Description:**
    *   **Attacker Action:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability directly present in the reveal.js core JavaScript code or in a third-party plugin used with reveal.js.
    *   **How:** Attackers discover and exploit security flaws (e.g., improper handling of user input, DOM manipulation vulnerabilities) within the reveal.js codebase or its plugins. They craft specific inputs or conditions to trigger these vulnerabilities, leading to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Consequences:** Similar to Markdown/HTML injection XSS, this can result in session hijacking, data theft, defacement, or redirection to malicious websites, affecting users viewing presentations using the vulnerable reveal.js version or plugin.
*   **Affected Reveal.js Component:**
    *   **Component:** `reveal.js core` JavaScript files (e.g., `reveal.js`, modules within `reveal.js`) and any third-party plugins used (e.g., plugin JavaScript files).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Keep Reveal.js and Plugins Updated:** Regularly update reveal.js and all plugins to the latest versions. Security vulnerabilities are often patched in newer releases. Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for reveal.js and its plugins.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) for reveal.js and plugin files loaded from CDNs. SRI ensures that the browser only executes scripts and styles that match a known cryptographic hash, preventing the execution of compromised or tampered files if a CDN is compromised.
    *   **Plugin Vetting and Auditing:** Carefully vet and audit any third-party plugins before using them in production. Choose plugins from reputable sources with active maintenance and security records. Consider performing security audits or code reviews of plugins, especially if they handle user input or sensitive data.
