            *   **Vulnerability scanning:** Implement automated vulnerability scanning to identify outdated versions and known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Monitor security advisories:** Subscribe to security advisories and CVE databases related to Reveal.js and its dependencies.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Vulnerability in Dependency:**
        *   **Description:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in libraries that Reveal.js depends on (e.g., `marked`, `highlight.js`).
        *   **How it works:** Similar to exploiting Reveal.js vulnerabilities, but targets its dependencies. Vulnerabilities in dependencies can be less obvious and easily overlooked.
        *   **Potential Impact:**  Impact depends on the dependency vulnerability, but can also lead to XSS, RCE, or other forms of compromise.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to continuously monitor and manage dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
            *   **Regularly update dependencies:** Keep dependencies updated to patched versions.
            *   **Dependency auditing:** Periodically audit dependencies for security issues and unnecessary inclusions.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH RISK PATH] Abuse Reveal.js Features for Malicious Purposes**](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__abuse_reveal_js_features_for_malicious_purposes.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  Exploiting features of Reveal.js like Markdown and HTML rendering, and plugin functionality to inject malicious content or scripts.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Reveal.js Features**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Injecting malicious JavaScript code into Reveal.js presentations that gets executed in users' browsers.

            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Markdown Injection leading to XSS**
                *   **Critical Nodes:**
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Application Uses Reveal.js Markdown Feature:** The application utilizes Reveal.js's Markdown parsing capability.
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Attacker Controls Markdown Content:** The attacker can influence or directly provide the Markdown content that is rendered by Reveal.js.
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious JavaScript within Markdown:** The attacker crafts malicious Markdown content containing JavaScript (e.g., using `<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>` or similar techniques).
                *   **How it works:** If the application uses Reveal.js's Markdown feature and allows user-provided Markdown content without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript within the Markdown. When Reveal.js renders this Markdown, the malicious script executes in the user's browser.
                *   **Potential Impact:** XSS can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, data theft, website defacement, and malware distribution.
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   **Secure Markdown Parser:** Use a secure and well-maintained Markdown parser library.
                    *   **Strict Sanitization:** Sanitize user-provided Markdown content before rendering it with Reveal.js. Remove or encode potentially harmful HTML tags and JavaScript.
                    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS by limiting the actions malicious scripts can perform.

            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] HTML Injection leading to XSS**
                *   **Critical Nodes:**
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Application Allows Raw HTML in Reveal.js Content:** The application permits the inclusion of raw HTML within Reveal.js presentations.
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Attacker Controls HTML Content:** The attacker can influence or directly provide the HTML content used in Reveal.js.
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious JavaScript within HTML:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code directly within the HTML (e.g., using `<script>alert(1)</script>`).
                *   **How it works:** If the application allows raw HTML input into Reveal.js presentations, especially from untrusted sources, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript directly within the HTML.
                *   **Potential Impact:** Similar to Markdown XSS, HTML injection XSS can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, data theft, website defacement, and malware distribution.
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   **Avoid Raw HTML Input:**  Prefer structured data formats like Markdown and sanitize them. Minimize or eliminate the allowance of raw HTML input, especially from untrusted sources.
                    *   **HTML Sanitization:** If raw HTML is necessary, use a robust HTML sanitization library to remove or neutralize potentially harmful HTML elements and attributes, especially JavaScript.
                    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to further limit the impact of any successful XSS.

            *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Plugin Vulnerabilities leading to XSS**
                *   **Critical Nodes:**
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Application Uses Reveal.js Plugins:** The application utilizes Reveal.js plugins to extend functionality.
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerability Exists in a Plugin:** A security vulnerability (e.g., XSS, insecure code) exists within a Reveal.js plugin being used.
                    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Plugin Vulnerability to Inject Malicious JavaScript:** Attackers exploit the plugin vulnerability to inject and execute malicious JavaScript.
                *   **How it works:** Reveal.js plugins, especially third-party ones, might contain vulnerabilities. If the application uses a vulnerable plugin, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to inject malicious scripts.
                *   **Potential Impact:** XSS through plugin vulnerabilities can have the same severe consequences as other XSS attacks.
                *   **Mitigation:**
                    *   **Careful Plugin Selection:**  Choose plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
                    *   **Plugin Vetting and Auditing:**  Thoroughly vet and, if possible, security audit plugins before using them, especially for critical applications.
                    *   **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
                    *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Only use necessary plugins and avoid using plugins with excessive permissions or from untrusted sources.

    *   **Content Injection/Defacement**
        *   **Critical Node:**
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Application Allows User-Provided Content in Reveal.js Presentations:** The application allows users to contribute or modify content within Reveal.js presentations.
        *   **How it works:** If user-provided content is not properly validated and sanitized, attackers can inject malicious or unwanted content into presentations. This can range from defacement to spreading misinformation.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Website defacement, misinformation campaigns, reputational damage, and potentially phishing attacks.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Strict Content Validation:** Implement strict validation for all user-provided content to ensure it conforms to expected formats and does not contain malicious or unwanted elements.
            *   **Content Sanitization:** Sanitize user-provided content to remove or neutralize potentially harmful elements, even if not directly script-based.
            *   **Content Review and Moderation:** Implement content review and moderation processes, especially for publicly accessible presentations, to prevent the spread of malicious or inappropriate content.

## Attack Tree Path: [**[HIGH RISK PATH] Exploit Insecure Configuration or Integration of Reveal.js**](./attack_tree_paths/_high_risk_path__exploit_insecure_configuration_or_integration_of_reveal_js.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting weaknesses arising from insecure configuration of CSP, improper handling of sensitive data within presentations, or insecure storage of presentation files.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Content Security Policy (CSP)**
        *   **Critical Nodes:**
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] CSP is Misconfigured:** The Content Security Policy implemented by the application is weak or misconfigured (e.g., overly permissive `script-src`, use of `unsafe-inline` or `unsafe-eval`).
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Weak CSP to Inject and Execute Malicious Scripts:** Attackers leverage the misconfigured CSP to bypass its intended security restrictions and successfully inject and execute malicious scripts.
        *   **How it works:** A poorly configured CSP can fail to prevent XSS attacks. For example, allowing `unsafe-inline` or overly broad `script-src` directives can make it easier for attackers to bypass CSP and execute injected scripts.
        *   **Potential Impact:** CSP bypass effectively negates the security benefits of CSP, leading to full XSS vulnerability with all its potential impacts.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Strict CSP Configuration:** Implement a strict and properly configured CSP. Avoid `unsafe-inline`, `unsafe-eval`, and overly permissive `script-src` directives.
            *   **CSP Reporting:** Enable CSP reporting to monitor for violations and identify potential misconfigurations or attack attempts.
            *   **Regular CSP Review:** Regularly review and update CSP directives to ensure they remain effective and aligned with application needs.
            *   **CSP Testing:** Thoroughly test CSP implementation to ensure it effectively blocks common XSS attack vectors.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Exposing Sensitive Information in Presentation Content**
        *   **Critical Nodes:**
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Developers Unintentionally Include Sensitive Data in Reveal.js Presentations:** Developers inadvertently embed sensitive information (API keys, internal URLs, credentials, PII) directly into Reveal.js presentation files.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Presentation is Accessible to Unauthorized Users:** Presentations containing sensitive data are accessible to users who should not have access.
        *   **How it works:** Sensitive data might be accidentally hardcoded into presentation files (Markdown, HTML, JavaScript). If these presentations are accessible to unauthorized users, the sensitive information is exposed.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access to internal systems, credential compromise, and privacy violations.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Sensitive Data Review:** Conduct thorough reviews of presentation content before deployment to ensure no sensitive information is inadvertently included.
            *   **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Measures:** Implement DLP tools or processes to automatically detect and prevent the inclusion of sensitive data in presentations.
            *   **Access Control:** Implement robust access controls to restrict access to presentations containing sensitive information to only authorized users.
            *   **Secure Storage:** Store presentation files securely and avoid storing sensitive data directly within them if possible. Use secure configuration management or environment variables for sensitive settings.

    *   **[HIGH RISK PATH] Insecure Handling of Presentation Files**
        *   **Critical Nodes:**
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Presentation Files are Stored Insecurely:** Presentation files (Markdown, HTML, images, etc.) are stored in a publicly accessible location or with weak file permissions.
            *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Attacker Gains Access to Presentation Files and Modifies or Extracts Sensitive Information:** Attackers gain unauthorized access to presentation files and can modify them (defacement, content injection) or extract sensitive information if present.
        *   **How it works:** If presentation files are stored insecurely (e.g., on a publicly accessible web server directory without proper access controls or with weak file permissions), attackers can directly access and manipulate these files.
        *   **Potential Impact:** Data breaches (if sensitive data is in files), website defacement, content injection, and potential for further attacks if attackers can modify application logic through presentation files.
        *   **Mitigation:**
            *   **Secure File Storage:** Store presentation files in a secure location with appropriate access controls. Ensure that only authorized users and processes can access and modify these files.
            *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Apply the principle of least privilege to file permissions, granting only necessary access to users and processes.
            *   **Access Control Lists (ACLs):** Use ACLs to define granular access permissions for presentation files.
            *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits of file storage configurations and permissions to identify and rectify any insecure settings.
