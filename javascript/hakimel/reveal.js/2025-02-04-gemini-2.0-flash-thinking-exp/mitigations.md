## Mitigation Strategy: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Reveal.js Assets](./mitigation_strategies/subresource_integrity__sri__for_reveal_js_assets.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Subresource Integrity (SRI) for Reveal.js Assets
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Generate SRI Hashes for Reveal.js Files:** For all reveal.js JavaScript and CSS files loaded from Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) or external sources, generate Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes. Tools and online generators are available for this purpose.
    2.  **Implement SRI Attributes in HTML:** In the HTML code where you include reveal.js and its assets (like CSS themes, plugins from CDNs), add the `integrity` attribute to the `<script>` and `<link>` tags. Set the value of the `integrity` attribute to the generated SRI hash, prefixed with the hash algorithm (e.g., `sha384-`).
    3.  **Include `crossorigin="anonymous"` for CDN Resources:** When loading reveal.js assets from CDNs, also include the `crossorigin="anonymous"` attribute in the `<script>` and `<link>` tags. This is necessary for CORS to allow integrity checks for cross-origin resources.
    4.  **Update SRI Hashes on Reveal.js Updates:** Whenever you update the reveal.js library or any of its assets loaded via CDN, regenerate the SRI hashes for the new versions and update them in your HTML.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Compromised Reveal.js CDN (Medium to High Severity):** If the CDN hosting reveal.js or its assets is compromised by an attacker, they could replace the legitimate reveal.js files with malicious versions. SRI prevents the browser from executing these compromised files.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Reveal.js Delivery (Medium Severity):** In a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, an attacker could intercept the network traffic and inject malicious code into the reveal.js files being delivered to the user's browser. SRI helps ensure the integrity of the files during transit.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Compromised Reveal.js CDN:** High Risk Reduction - Prevents execution of malicious reveal.js code even if the CDN is compromised, protecting users from potential attacks.
    *   **Man-in-the-Middle Attacks on Reveal.js Delivery:** Medium Risk Reduction - Significantly reduces the risk of MITM attacks affecting reveal.js integrity during delivery.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** SRI is currently implemented only for the core reveal.js JavaScript file loaded from a CDN.
    *   **Location:** Implemented in the base HTML template used for creating reveal.js presentations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **SRI for all Reveal.js Assets:** Extend SRI implementation to cover all reveal.js CSS files (themes), plugin JavaScript files, and any other reveal.js related assets loaded from CDNs or external sources.
    *   **Automated SRI Hash Generation in Build Process:** Integrate SRI hash generation into the build or deployment process to automatically update SRI hashes whenever reveal.js or its assets are updated, ensuring hashes are always current.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Review and Harden Reveal.js Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/review_and_harden_reveal_js_configuration.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Review and Harden Reveal.js Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Audit Reveal.js Configuration Options:** Carefully review all reveal.js configuration options used in your presentations. Understand the security implications of each option. Refer to the [reveal.js documentation](https://revealjs.com/config/) for details on each configuration setting.
    2.  **Disable Unnecessary Features:** Disable any reveal.js features or functionalities that are not essential for your presentations and could potentially introduce security risks if misconfigured or exploited. For example, if you don't need external links in slides, consider if configurations related to link handling can be tightened.
    3.  **Restrict `controls` and `progress` if not needed:** If the presentation is meant for embedded use or automated display and user interaction is not required, disable `controls` and `progress` options to remove interactive elements that could be manipulated.
    4.  **Secure `keyboard` and `mousewheel` interactions:** If keyboard or mousewheel navigation is not necessary, disable these options to reduce potential attack vectors related to user input handling within reveal.js.
    5.  **Limit or Disable `previewLinks`:** If previewing links in slides is not required, disable or carefully configure the `previewLinks` option. Unrestricted previewing of external links could potentially be abused for phishing or other attacks.
    6.  **Sanitize or Restrict User-Provided Configuration (if applicable):** If users are allowed to provide any reveal.js configuration settings (e.g., through URL parameters or a CMS), rigorously validate and sanitize these inputs to prevent malicious configurations that could compromise security or functionality.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Misconfiguration Exploitation (Medium Severity):**  Insecure or default reveal.js configurations can sometimes be exploited by attackers to alter presentation behavior in unintended ways or potentially bypass security controls.
    *   **Abuse of Interactive Features (Low to Medium Severity):** Unnecessary interactive features in reveal.js, if not properly secured, could potentially be abused in certain attack scenarios (though less likely in typical reveal.js usage).
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Misconfiguration Exploitation:** Medium Risk Reduction - Reduces the attack surface by ensuring reveal.js is configured securely and unnecessary features are disabled.
    *   **Abuse of Interactive Features:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Minimizes potential risks associated with interactive elements of reveal.js by disabling or restricting them when not required.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Basic configuration review is done during presentation creation, but a formal security hardening checklist for reveal.js configuration is not in place.
    *   **Location:** Configuration settings are typically within the HTML or JavaScript files of individual presentations.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal Security Configuration Checklist:** Create a security checklist specifically for reveal.js configuration options, outlining recommended secure settings and options to disable for different use cases.
    *   **Automated Configuration Review:**  Explore tools or scripts that can automatically scan reveal.js configuration files and flag potentially insecure or non-recommended settings.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Reveal.js Plugin and Theme Selection](./mitigation_strategies/secure_reveal_js_plugin_and_theme_selection.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Reveal.js Plugin and Theme Selection
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use Plugins and Themes from Trusted Sources:** When selecting reveal.js plugins and themes, prioritize using those from the official reveal.js repository, well-known and reputable developers, or verified sources. Avoid using plugins or themes from unknown or untrusted origins.
    2.  **Evaluate Plugin/Theme Security Posture:** Before incorporating any third-party plugin or theme, conduct a basic security evaluation. Check for:
        *   **Active Maintenance:** Is the plugin/theme actively maintained and updated? Regularly updated plugins are more likely to have security vulnerabilities addressed promptly.
        *   **Code Review (if possible):** If the source code is available, perform a basic code review or use static analysis tools to look for potential security issues (e.g., obvious XSS vulnerabilities, insecure coding practices).
        *   **Community Feedback:** Check for community feedback or security reports related to the plugin/theme.
    3.  **Keep Plugins and Themes Updated:** Just like reveal.js itself, ensure that any plugins and themes you use are also kept updated to their latest versions. Monitor for updates and security advisories related to these plugins and themes.
    4.  **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Only use plugins that are strictly necessary for your presentation requirements. Reducing the number of plugins minimizes the potential attack surface and the risk of vulnerabilities introduced by third-party code.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Reveal.js Plugins/Themes (Medium to High Severity):** Third-party reveal.js plugins and themes might contain security vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, code injection) that could be exploited to compromise presentations or user browsers.
    *   **Malicious Plugins/Themes (Medium to High Severity):**  Maliciously crafted plugins or themes from untrusted sources could intentionally introduce backdoors, malware, or other malicious code into your presentations.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Reveal.js Plugins/Themes:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of introducing vulnerabilities through third-party plugins and themes by careful selection and regular updates.
    *   **Malicious Plugins/Themes:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Minimizes the risk of using intentionally malicious plugins or themes by emphasizing trusted sources and security evaluation.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Developers are generally advised to use official or well-known plugins, but there is no formal process for security evaluation or tracking plugin updates.
    *   **Location:** Plugin and theme selection is typically decided during presentation development.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Plugin/Theme Security Vetting Process:** Implement a formal process for vetting and approving reveal.js plugins and themes before they are used in projects, including basic security checks and source verification.
    *   **Plugin/Theme Update Tracking:** Establish a system to track the plugins and themes used in different presentations and monitor for updates and security advisories related to them.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Control External Content Loading in Reveal.js](./mitigation_strategies/control_external_content_loading_in_reveal_js.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Control External Content Loading in Reveal.js
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize External Content:** Reduce the reliance on external content (images, videos, iframes, external links) within reveal.js presentations as much as possible. Host necessary assets locally whenever feasible.
    2.  **Restrict External Content Sources:** If external content is necessary, restrict the sources from which reveal.js is allowed to load content. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) directives (e.g., `img-src`, `media-src`, `frame-src`) to whitelist only trusted domains for external resources.
    3.  **Validate and Sanitize External URLs:** If reveal.js presentations include external links (e.g., in slides or through plugins), validate and sanitize these URLs to prevent open redirects or malicious links. Ensure links point to intended and trusted destinations.
    4.  **Be Cautious with `<iframe>` Embeds:** Exercise caution when embedding external content using `<iframe>` tags in reveal.js slides. Iframes can introduce security risks if the embedded content is from untrusted sources. Use `sandbox` attributes on `<iframe>` tags to restrict the capabilities of embedded content.
    5.  **Review Reveal.js Configuration for External Resources:** Review reveal.js configuration options related to external resources and ensure they are configured securely. For example, if using plugins that fetch external data, verify the security of data fetching mechanisms.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Loading Malicious External Content (Medium to High Severity):** If reveal.js is allowed to load content from arbitrary external sources, attackers could potentially inject malicious content (e.g., through compromised external websites or open redirects) into presentations.
    *   **Open Redirects via External Links (Low to Medium Severity):** Unvalidated external links in reveal.js presentations could be abused for phishing or redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **XSS via Embedded Iframes (Medium Severity):** Embedding iframes from untrusted sources can introduce XSS vulnerabilities if the embedded content is malicious or vulnerable.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Loading Malicious External Content:** Medium to High Risk Reduction - Reduces the risk of loading malicious content by restricting external sources and using CSP.
    *   **Open Redirects via External Links:** Low to Medium Risk Reduction - Minimizes the risk of open redirects by validating and sanitizing external URLs.
    *   **XSS via Embedded Iframes:** Medium Risk Reduction - Mitigates XSS risks from iframes by using `sandbox` attributes and restricting iframe sources.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially Implemented:** Developers are generally advised to host assets locally, but there are no strict controls or automated checks in place for external content loading in reveal.js presentations.
    *   **Location:** External content loading practices are usually determined during presentation development.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **CSP Enforcement for External Resources:** Implement and enforce Content Security Policy (CSP) directives to strictly control the sources from which reveal.js presentations can load external resources.
    *   **Automated External Link Validation:** Integrate automated tools or scripts to validate external URLs in reveal.js presentations during the build or deployment process to detect and flag potentially malicious or open redirect links.
    *   **Iframe Sandboxing Policy:** Establish a clear policy and guidelines for using iframes in reveal.js presentations, emphasizing the use of `sandbox` attributes and restricting iframe sources to trusted domains.

By focusing on these reveal.js-specific mitigation strategies, you can directly address security risks introduced by the library itself and create more secure web applications utilizing reveal.js for presentations. Remember to tailor these strategies to your specific application context and continuously review and update them as needed.
