# Attack Tree Analysis for hakimel/reveal.js

Objective: Compromise Application Using reveal.js

## Attack Tree Visualization

*   **Compromise Application Using reveal.js** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
    *   **Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in reveal.js** **[CRITICAL NODE]**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks** **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
            *   **DOM-Based XSS** **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                *   **Inject Malicious Content via Slide Content** **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                    *   **Crafted Markdown/HTML in Slides** **[CRITICAL NODE]** **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                        *   [Actionable Insight] Sanitize and validate user-provided Markdown/HTML slide content. Use CSP to restrict inline scripts and styles. **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                            *   Likelihood: Medium - Common vulnerability if input not sanitized. **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                            *   Impact: High - Full client-side compromise, session hijacking, data theft, redirection. **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                            *   Effort: Low - Readily available XSS payloads and tools. **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                            *   Skill Level: Beginner/Intermediate - Basic understanding of HTML/JS and XSS. **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
                            *   Detection Difficulty: Medium - Can be detected by security scanners and CSP reporting, but subtle DOM-XSS can be missed. **[HIGH RISK PATH]**
