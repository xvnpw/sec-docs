# Attack Surface Analysis for hakimel/reveal.js

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Script Injection via Markdown/HTML Content](./attack_surfaces/client-side_script_injection_via_markdownhtml_content.md)

Description:  Malicious JavaScript code is injected into presentation content (Markdown or HTML) and executed in a user's browser when viewing the presentation.
Reveal.js Contribution: Reveal.js's core functionality is rendering Markdown and HTML into interactive slides. This rendering process, if not handled securely, directly enables the execution of injected scripts.
Example: A user crafts a Markdown slide containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. If the application directly renders this Markdown using reveal.js without sanitization, the alert will execute in the browser of anyone viewing the presentation.
Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection, defacement, unauthorized actions.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Developers:
    *   Input Sanitization:  Sanitize all user-provided Markdown and HTML content on the server-side *before* rendering it with reveal.js. Use a robust HTML sanitizer library (e.g., DOMPurify, Bleach).
    *   Output Encoding: Encode output to prevent interpretation of HTML entities as code.
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be loaded and restrict inline script execution.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Reveal.js Configuration and Plugins](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_reveal_js_configuration_and_plugins.md)

Description: Malicious JavaScript is injected through reveal.js configuration options or vulnerable plugins.
Reveal.js Contribution: Reveal.js's architecture allows for extensive configuration and plugin loading to customize presentation behavior.  Insecure handling of configuration or loading untrusted plugins directly introduces XSS risks within the reveal.js rendering context.
Example: An attacker manipulates a URL parameter that controls reveal.js configuration, injecting malicious JavaScript into a configuration option like `postMessageTemplate`. When reveal.js processes this configuration, the injected script executes. Or, loading a malicious reveal.js plugin from an untrusted source that contains XSS vulnerabilities.
Impact: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), similar to content injection, leading to session hijacking, data theft, etc.
Risk Severity: High
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Developers:
    *   Configuration Control: Avoid dynamically generating reveal.js configuration based on user input. If necessary, strictly validate and sanitize input.
    *   Plugin Vetting: Thoroughly vet and audit all reveal.js plugins, especially from third-party sources. Use plugins from trusted and reputable sources.
    *   CSP: Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/client-side_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

Description: Vulnerabilities in reveal.js's client-side JavaScript dependencies are exploited.
Reveal.js Contribution: Reveal.js relies on various JavaScript libraries to function.  If these dependencies have vulnerabilities, and reveal.js bundles or relies on them, it indirectly contributes to the attack surface by including vulnerable code in the application.
Example: Reveal.js bundles or depends on an older version of a library with a known XSS vulnerability. An attacker exploits this vulnerability through a crafted presentation that triggers the vulnerable code path in the dependency.
Impact:  XSS, potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE) in specific scenarios, Denial of Service (DoS), depending on the dependency vulnerability.
Risk Severity: High (if critical vulnerabilities are present in dependencies)
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Developers:
    *   Dependency Updates: Regularly update reveal.js and all its client-side dependencies to the latest versions.
    *   Dependency Management: Use dependency management tools (e.g., npm, yarn) to track and manage dependencies.
    *   SCA Tools: Utilize Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Reveal.js Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_reveal_js_version.md)

Description: Using an outdated version of reveal.js with known vulnerabilities.
Reveal.js Contribution:  Using an old version *directly* exposes the application to vulnerabilities that are specific to reveal.js and have been patched in newer versions. The vulnerability exists *within* the reveal.js codebase itself.
Example: A known XSS vulnerability exists in reveal.js version 4.x. An application using version 4.x is vulnerable until upgraded.
Impact: Exploitation of known vulnerabilities *in reveal.js*, potentially XSS, and other issues.
Risk Severity: High (if critical vulnerabilities are present in the outdated version)
Mitigation Strategies:
*   Developers:
    *   Regular Updates: Regularly update reveal.js to the latest stable version.
    *   Security Advisories: Subscribe to security advisories and release notes for reveal.js.
    *   Version Control: Track reveal.js version and update regularly as part of maintenance.
