# Threat Model Analysis for hakimel/reveal.js

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Execution](./threats/malicious_plugin_execution.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Execution
    *   **Description:** An attacker convinces a presentation author to install a malicious reveal.js plugin, or exploits a vulnerability in a legitimate plugin to inject malicious code. The attacker's code could then steal data, manipulate the presentation, or attack the viewer's browser.  This is a *direct* threat because reveal.js's plugin system is the attack vector.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data breach (presentation content, speaker notes).
        *   Presentation defacement or manipulation.
        *   Client-side attacks (XSS, drive-by downloads).
        *   Loss of user trust.
    *   **Affected Component:** Plugin system (`Reveal.registerPlugin`, plugin loading mechanism).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Plugin Vetting:** Only install plugins from trusted sources (official reveal.js plugins, reputable developers).  Carefully review plugin code before installation.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the capabilities of plugins (e.g., restrict network access, prevent inline script execution).  This is crucial for mitigating malicious plugin actions.
        *   **Sandboxing:** If possible, run plugins in a sandboxed environment (e.g., using iframes with the `sandbox` attribute) to limit their access to the main presentation context.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Configure plugins with the minimum necessary permissions.

## Threat: [`postMessage` API Exploitation](./threats/_postmessage__api_exploitation.md)

*   **Threat:** `postMessage` API Exploitation
    *   **Description:** If reveal.js or a plugin uses the `postMessage` API insecurely, an attacker could send crafted messages to the presentation, potentially triggering unintended actions or exploiting vulnerabilities in the message handling logic. This is a direct threat if reveal.js's *own* use of `postMessage`, or a plugin's use facilitated *by* reveal.js, is flawed.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Presentation manipulation.
        *   Data leakage.
        *   Execution of arbitrary code (if the message handler is vulnerable).
    *   **Affected Component:** Any component (core reveal.js or plugins) that uses the `postMessage` API (e.g., `window.postMessage`, `message` event listeners).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if `postMessage` is used, and used insecurely)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Origin Validation:** Always validate the `origin` property of incoming `postMessage` events.  Only process messages from trusted origins. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Data Validation:** Sanitize and validate the `data` property of incoming messages.  Do not blindly trust the content of the message.
        *   **Specific Target Origin:** When sending messages, use a specific target origin (rather than `*`) to prevent the message from being intercepted by other applications.
        *   **Code Review:** Carefully review any code (especially within reveal.js or its plugins) that uses `postMessage` to ensure it is implemented securely.

## Threat: [Multiplexing Control Hijack](./threats/multiplexing_control_hijack.md)

*   **Threat:** Multiplexing Control Hijack
    *   **Description:** If the reveal.js multiplexing feature is used, an attacker gains access to the master presentation or the multiplexing secret, allowing them to control the presentation displayed to other viewers. This is a *direct* threat because it targets a specific reveal.js feature.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Presentation hijacking.
        *   Display of unauthorized content.
        *   Disruption of the presentation.
    *   **Affected Component:** Multiplexing feature (socket.io communication, master/client roles).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (if multiplexing is used)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strong Secret:** Use a strong, randomly generated secret for the multiplexing feature. This is the most important mitigation.
        *   **Access Control:** Restrict access to the master presentation. Only authorized users should be able to control it.
        *   **Network Security:** Ensure the network used for multiplexing is secure (e.g., a private network, VPN).
        *   **HTTPS:** Serve both the master and client presentations over HTTPS.
