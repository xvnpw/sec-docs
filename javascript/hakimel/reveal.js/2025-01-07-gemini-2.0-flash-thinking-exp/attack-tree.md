## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Presentation Content for Malicious Purposes](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_presentation_content_for_malicious_purposes.md)

**Description:** An attacker aims to inject malicious content into the presentation to harm users or the application. This can involve executing arbitrary code or displaying misleading information.
**Attack Vectors within this Path:**
* **Inject Malicious Client-Side Code (XSS):**
    * **Description:** The attacker attempts to inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the victim's browser when they view the presentation. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or redirection to malicious sites.
    * **Inject Malicious Code via Markdown/HTML Content:**
        * **Description:** Reveal.js renders content written in Markdown or HTML. If the application allows users to provide this content without proper sanitization, an attacker can inject `<script>` tags or other malicious HTML elements.
        * **Exploit Lack of Sanitization in User-Provided Content:**
            * **Description:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided Markdown or HTML content before rendering it in the presentation. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts.
    * **Inject Malicious Code via Plugin Vulnerabilities:**
        * **Description:** Third-party Reveal.js plugins might contain security vulnerabilities that allow for code injection.
        * **Exploit Security Flaws in Third-Party Reveal.js Plugins:**
            * **Description:** Attackers exploit known or zero-day vulnerabilities in third-party Reveal.js plugins to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin's Access to Browser APIs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin's_access_to_browser_apis.md)

**Description:** A vulnerable or malicious plugin leverages its access to browser APIs to perform unauthorized actions or access sensitive data.
**Attack Vectors within this Node:**
* **Leverage Plugin Permissions to Access Sensitive Data or Perform Actions:**
    * **Description:** A compromised or malicious plugin uses its granted permissions to access sensitive browser data (like cookies, local storage), make unauthorized network requests, or interact with other browser functionalities in a harmful way.

## Attack Tree Path: [Identify and Exploit CVEs in Libraries Used by Reveal.js](./attack_tree_paths/identify_and_exploit_cves_in_libraries_used_by_reveal_js.md)

**Description:** Attackers identify and exploit known vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures - CVEs) in the JavaScript libraries that Reveal.js depends on.
**Attack Vectors within this Node:**
* **Identify and Exploit CVEs in Libraries Used by Reveal.js:**
    * **Description:** Attackers use publicly available information about known vulnerabilities in Reveal.js's dependencies to craft exploits that can compromise the application. This often involves targeting outdated versions of these libraries.
