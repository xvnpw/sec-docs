# Threat Model Analysis for hakimel/reveal.js

## Threat: [Malicious Script Injection via Slide Content (XSS)](./threats/malicious_script_injection_via_slide_content__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code directly into the presentation content (e.g., within Markdown slides, HTML fragments, or via a compromised data source feeding the presentation). This code is then executed in the victim's browser when they view the presentation. The attacker might steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious site, or perform actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the presentation, potential for further attacks against the user's system.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Reveal.js Core Rendering Engine` (specifically the part responsible for processing and displaying slide content).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

## Threat: [Exploitation of Vulnerable Reveal.js Plugins](./threats/exploitation_of_vulnerable_reveal_js_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability within a reveal.js plugin being used by the application. This could involve sending specially crafted input to the plugin or leveraging a flaw in the plugin's logic to execute arbitrary code or gain unauthorized access.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the plugin's functionality and the nature of the vulnerability, the impact could range from minor presentation errors to full compromise of the user's browser or even the server in some scenarios.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Specific `Reveal.js Plugin(s)` that are vulnerable.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities in Reveal.js or its Plugins](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities_in_reveal_js_or_its_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Reveal.js or its plugins rely on other JavaScript libraries. If these dependencies have known security vulnerabilities, an attacker could exploit them through the reveal.js application.
    *   **Impact:** The impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency. It could range from information disclosure to remote code execution.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Reveal.js Core` and `Reveal.js Plugins` (indirectly, through their dependencies).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

## Threat: [Cross-Site Script Inclusion (XSSI) via Publicly Hosted Reveal.js](./threats/cross-site_script_inclusion__xssi__via_publicly_hosted_reveal_js.md)

*   **Description:** If the application relies on a publicly hosted version of reveal.js (e.g., from a CDN), an attacker could potentially compromise that CDN or inject malicious code into the hosted files, affecting all applications using that version.
    *   **Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications using the affected CDN version of reveal.js, potentially leading to data theft, account compromise, or malware distribution.
    *   **Affected Component:** `Reveal.js Core Files` (if hosted on a compromised CDN).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
