# Attack Surface Analysis for hakimel/reveal.js

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Slide Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_slide_content.md)

**Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into the presentation content (slides).

**How reveal.js Contributes:** reveal.js renders user-provided Markdown or HTML content directly into the Document Object Model (DOM). If this content is not properly sanitized, it can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

**Example:** A user creates a slide with the following Markdown: `` `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS!')">` ``. When this slide is rendered, the JavaScript `alert('XSS!')` will execute.

**Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, defacement of the presentation, or other malicious actions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:**
    * **Strict Input Sanitization:**  Thoroughly sanitize all user-provided slide content before rendering it with reveal.js. Use a robust HTML sanitizer library specifically designed to prevent XSS.
    * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
    * **Avoid Direct HTML Input:** If possible, limit user input to Markdown and ensure the Markdown parser used by reveal.js (or any custom implementation) is secure and up-to-date.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in reveal.js Plugins](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_reveal_js_plugins.md)

**Description:** Security flaws exist within third-party or custom reveal.js plugins.

**How reveal.js Contributes:** reveal.js provides a plugin architecture that allows extending its functionality. If these plugins contain vulnerabilities, they can introduce security risks to the application.

**Example:** A vulnerable plugin might allow arbitrary file access or contain an XSS vulnerability within its own code.

**Impact:**  Depending on the plugin vulnerability, the impact can range from XSS to arbitrary code execution on the client-side, potentially compromising user data or the user's system.

**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the plugin vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:**
    * **Careful Plugin Selection:** Only use reputable and well-maintained reveal.js plugins. Research plugins for known vulnerabilities before integrating them.
    * **Regular Plugin Updates:** Keep all reveal.js plugins updated to the latest versions to patch known security flaws.
    * **Security Audits for Custom Plugins:** If developing custom reveal.js plugins, conduct thorough security reviews and penetration testing.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure plugins only have the necessary permissions and access to resources.

## Attack Surface: [Serving Compromised reveal.js Files](./attack_surfaces/serving_compromised_reveal_js_files.md)

**Description:** The reveal.js library files themselves are compromised and contain malicious code.

**How reveal.js Contributes:** If the application serves reveal.js from a third-party Content Delivery Network (CDN) or if the files on the server are compromised, malicious code within the reveal.js library can be executed in the user's browser.

**Example:** An attacker gains access to the server and modifies the `reveal.js` or related JavaScript files to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact:**  Full compromise of the client-side application, leading to data theft, session hijacking, redirection, and other malicious activities.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**

* **Developers:**
    * **Verify File Integrity:** Implement mechanisms to verify the integrity of reveal.js files (e.g., using checksums or Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes when loading from a CDN).
    * **Secure Server Infrastructure:** Implement robust security measures to protect the server where reveal.js files are hosted.
    * **Use Reputable CDNs:** If using a CDN, choose a reputable provider with strong security practices.
    * **Consider Self-Hosting:** For greater control, consider self-hosting reveal.js files from your own secure infrastructure.
