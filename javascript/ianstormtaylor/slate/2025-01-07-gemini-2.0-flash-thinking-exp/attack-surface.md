# Attack Surface Analysis for ianstormtaylor/slate

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Crafted Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_crafted_content.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into the editor's content, which are then executed when the content is rendered by other users.
    *   **How Slate Contributes:** Slate's parsing and rendering of user-provided content, including text nodes, marks, and inline/block nodes, might not sufficiently sanitize or escape potentially malicious input. If Slate interprets and renders injected script tags or event handlers, it contributes directly to this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** A user enters the text `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">` into the Slate editor. When this content is displayed to another user, the `onerror` event triggers, executing the JavaScript `alert('XSS')`.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser, leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization:** Implement robust server-side or client-side sanitization of content submitted through the Slate editor *before* storing it. Use a library specifically designed for HTML sanitization, configured to remove or escape potentially dangerous tags and attributes.
        *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:** When rendering content from Slate, ensure proper output encoding based on the context (e.g., HTML escaping when rendering in HTML). This prevents browsers from interpreting injected code as executable.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to control the resources the browser is allowed to load, significantly reducing the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [HTML Injection](./attack_surfaces/html_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious HTML tags and attributes into the editor's content, leading to unintended behavior or security issues when rendered.
    *   **How Slate Contributes:** Slate's data model and rendering process might allow the inclusion of HTML elements that, while not directly executing scripts, can still cause harm, such as embedding iframes to external malicious sites or manipulating the page's structure.
    *   **Example:** A user enters `<iframe src="https://malicious.example.com"></iframe>` into the Slate editor. When this content is displayed, the iframe loads content from the attacker's site, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious activities.
    *   **Impact:** Redirection to malicious websites, content spoofing, clickjacking, or disruption of the application's layout.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Input Sanitization (as above):**  Sanitize input to remove or neutralize potentially harmful HTML tags and attributes.
        *   **Allowlisting Safe HTML Tags:** If certain HTML elements are necessary for functionality, implement a strict allowlist of permitted tags and attributes. Reject or strip any elements not on the allowlist.
        *   **CSP (as above):** Can help mitigate the impact of injected iframes by controlling where the application can load resources from.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on Paste](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__on_paste.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious scripts are injected into the editor by pasting content from an external source that contains malicious code.
    *   **How Slate Contributes:** If Slate doesn't properly sanitize content pasted from the clipboard, it can introduce XSS vulnerabilities. The browser's paste event provides access to the clipboard content, and if Slate directly renders this without sanitization, it's vulnerable.
    *   **Example:** An attacker copies text containing `<script>alert('Pasted XSS')</script>` from a malicious website and pastes it into the Slate editor. If not sanitized, this script will execute when the content is rendered.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize Pasted Content:** Implement sanitization specifically for content being pasted into the editor. Intercept the paste event and process the clipboard data to remove or escape potentially malicious scripts and HTML.
        *   **User Awareness:** Educate users about the risks of pasting content from untrusted sources.
