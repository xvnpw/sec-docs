## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Deserialization Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:** This branch represents a significant attack surface due to the way Slate.js handles document data in JSON format.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Default Deserializer [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_default_deserializer__high_risk__{critical}.md)

    *   **Unsafe Default Deserializer [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}:**
        *   **Description:** This occurs if Slate.js (or a commonly used plugin) uses a default deserializer that doesn't properly sanitize or validate incoming JSON data.  This allows an attacker to potentially inject malicious code or data structures.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Input to Deserializer [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_input_to_deserializer__high_risk__{critical}.md)

    *   **Malicious Input to Deserializer [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}:**
        *   **Description:** Even with a custom deserializer, if the validation logic is flawed or incomplete, an attacker can craft a malicious JSON payload that bypasses the checks and triggers unintended behavior, potentially leading to code execution.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [3rd-Party Dependency (Deserialization) {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/3rd-party_dependency__deserialization__{critical}.md)

    *   **3rd-Party Dependency (Deserialization) {CRITICAL}:**
        *   **Description:** If the deserialization process relies on a vulnerable third-party library, an attacker could exploit that library to achieve code execution or other malicious outcomes.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High (Arbitrary Code Execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Plugin/Custom Code Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/plugincustom_code_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **Plugin/Custom Code Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]:** This branch represents the most likely attack vector, as plugins and custom code are often less rigorously reviewed than the core library.

## Attack Tree Path: [Unsafe Plugin Implementation [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}](./attack_tree_paths/unsafe_plugin_implementation__high_risk__{critical}.md)

    *   **Unsafe Plugin Implementation [HIGH RISK] {CRITICAL}:**
        *   **Description:** A plugin (either third-party or developed in-house) might contain vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if it renders HTML without proper sanitization, or even arbitrary code execution if it uses unsafe functions like `eval`.
        *   **Likelihood:** High
        *   **Impact:** High (XSS, Arbitrary Code Execution)
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
