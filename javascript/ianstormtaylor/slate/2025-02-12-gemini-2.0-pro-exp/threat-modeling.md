# Threat Model Analysis for ianstormtaylor/slate

## Threat: [Malicious Document Structure Injection](./threats/malicious_document_structure_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Document Structure Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload representing a Slate document. This isn't about typical XSS; it's about manipulating the *structure* of the document (node types, nesting, attributes) in ways that are valid according to Slate's core logic but violate the application's *intended* schema.  The attacker might submit this directly to the server (bypassing client-side validation) or inject it into the client-side editor (e.g., via a compromised plugin).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data corruption on the server.
        *   Unexpected application behavior, potentially leading to crashes or logic errors.
        *   Bypassing of server-side validation that relies on assumptions about document structure.
        *   Potential for triggering vulnerabilities in server-side processing (e.g., excessive recursion).
        *   *Could* lead to XSS if the server renders content unsafely, but the primary attack is structural.
    *   **Affected Slate Component:**
        *   `Editor` object (client-side): The core editor instance.
        *   Data serialization/deserialization logic (client and server).
        *   Custom plugins (if any) that interact with the document structure.
        *   Server-side processing logic that handles Slate data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on server-side handling).
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Server-Side Schema Validation:** The server *must* validate the incoming Slate JSON against a predefined, strict schema. Define allowed node types, attributes, nesting, etc. Do *not* rely on client-side validation. Use a robust JSON schema validation library.
        *   **Input Sanitization (Server-Side):** Sanitize the *content* of individual nodes (especially text nodes) to prevent malicious HTML/JS from being embedded *within* valid nodes. Crucial if the server renders the content.
        *   **Limit Node Depth and Complexity (Client and Server):** Enforce limits on nesting depth and overall complexity. Mitigates resource exhaustion and reduces the attack surface.
        *   **Whitelisting, Not Blacklisting:** Define what is *allowed*, not what is *disallowed*.
        *   **Regular Expression for Text Nodes:** Use regex to validate text node content, allowing only safe characters.

## Threat: [Malicious Plugin Injection](./threats/malicious_plugin_injection.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Plugin Injection

    *   **Description:** An attacker injects a malicious Slate plugin into the editor. This could be through:
        *   A compromised dependency (e.g., a malicious npm package).
        *   A supply chain attack.
        *   A vulnerability allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution (used to load the plugin).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Arbitrary modification of document content.
        *   Data exfiltration (sending content to an attacker-controlled server).
        *   Keylogging or user input monitoring.
        *   Execution of arbitrary JavaScript, leading to further attacks.
    *   **Affected Slate Component:**
        *   `Editor.use()` (or equivalent plugin registration).
        *   The entire plugin ecosystem.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Carefully Vet Dependencies:** Thoroughly review all plugins and dependencies for vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit`. Prefer well-maintained plugins.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Use a strict CSP to limit script sources, preventing unauthorized plugin execution. *Critical* defense.
        *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI to ensure plugin files haven't been tampered with. Protects against compromised CDNs or MITM attacks.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Audit the codebase, including Slate integration and custom plugins.
        *   **Minimize Plugin Usage:** Only use essential plugins.
        *   **Code Signing (Advanced):** Consider code signing (complex in a web environment).

## Threat: [Data Leakage Through Custom Plugins](./threats/data_leakage_through_custom_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Data Leakage Through Custom Plugins

    *   **Description:** A poorly written or malicious custom Slate plugin leaks sensitive data:
        *   Draft content.
        *   User metadata.
        *   Data from other parts of the application.
        *   Internal application state.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of confidential information, violating privacy or leading to further attacks.
    *   **Affected Slate Component:**
        *   Custom plugins.
        *   `Editor` object (plugin interaction).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Code Review:** Rigorously review custom plugin code, focusing on data handling, external communication, and access to sensitive info.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Plugins should only access necessary data. Avoid broad access.
        *   **Input Validation and Output Encoding:** Validate data received by the plugin and encode data sent out.
        *   **Sandboxing (if possible):** Explore sandboxing to isolate plugins (challenging in browsers, but iframes with `postMessage` might be possible).
        *   **Data Minimization:** Store and process only the minimum necessary data.

## Threat: [Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)](./threats/resource_exhaustion__denial_of_service_.md)

*   **Threat:** Resource Exhaustion (Denial of Service)

    *   **Description:** An attacker crafts a document to consume excessive resources:
        *   Huge number of nodes.
        *   Deeply nested structures.
        *   Large amounts of text.
        *   Custom plugins with expensive operations.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Client-side: Unresponsive editor, browser tab crash, device unusable.
        *   Server-side: Server crash (memory exhaustion, CPU overload), DoS for all users.
    *   **Affected Slate Component:**
        *   `Editor` object (client-side).
        *   Serialization/deserialization logic (client and server).
        *   Custom plugins (if resource-intensive).
        *   Server-side processing.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Limit Document Size/Complexity (Client and Server):** Strict limits on node count, nesting depth, and size. Implement *both* client-side and server-side.
        *   **Rate Limiting (Server-Side):** Limit API requests handling Slate data.
        *   **Timeout Mechanisms (Server-Side):** Timeouts for server-side processing.
        *   **Resource Monitoring (Server-Side):** Monitor CPU/memory, alert on exhaustion.
        *   **Plugin Resource Limits (Client-Side - Difficult):** Ideally, limit plugin resource usage (challenging in browsers).
