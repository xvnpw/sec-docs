# Attack Surface Analysis for ianstormtaylor/slate

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Custom Elements/Attributes](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_custom_elementsattributes.md)

*   *Description:* Injection of malicious scripts through improperly handled custom elements and attributes defined within Slate.
    *   *Slate's Contribution:* Slate's core feature of allowing custom elements and attributes provides a direct pathway for XSS if not rigorously controlled.  The flexibility, while powerful, increases the attack surface.
    *   *Example:* An attacker creates a custom element named `<my-widget>` with an attribute `data-url` intended to load an image.  Instead of a URL, they inject `javascript:alert('XSS')` into the `data-url` attribute.  If the application doesn't sanitize this attribute, the script will execute.
    *   *Impact:* Client-side code execution, session hijacking, data theft, defacement, phishing.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **Critical**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Strict Whitelisting:** Define a strict whitelist of allowed custom elements and attributes.  Reject anything not explicitly on the whitelist.
        *   **Robust Sanitization:** Use a battle-tested HTML sanitization library (e.g., DOMPurify) *specifically configured* for Slate's data model.  Sanitize *both* on input and before rendering.  Do *not* rely solely on Slate's built-in escaping.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed.
        *   **Output Encoding:** Encode all user-provided data before rendering it in the DOM, even within custom elements.
        *   **Regular Expression Validation:** Use well-crafted regular expressions to validate the format of attribute values (e.g., ensuring a `data-url` attribute actually contains a valid URL).

## Attack Surface: [XSS via Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/xss_via_plugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   *Description:* Exploitation of vulnerabilities within third-party or custom Slate plugins to inject malicious code.
    *   *Slate's Contribution:* Slate's plugin architecture, while enabling extensibility, introduces a significant attack surface.  Each plugin is a potential point of failure.
    *   *Example:* A poorly written "image gallery" plugin fails to sanitize image URLs or alt text.  An attacker uploads an image with an `alt` attribute containing a malicious script: `<img src="x" alt="innocent image" onerror="alert('XSS')">`.
    *   *Impact:* Client-side code execution, session hijacking, data theft, defacement, phishing.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Plugin Vetting:** Thoroughly review the code of all third-party plugins before integration.  Prioritize well-maintained and reputable plugins.
        *   **Code Review (Custom Plugins):** Conduct rigorous code reviews of all custom-built plugins, focusing on input handling and sanitization.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Grant plugins only the minimum necessary permissions within the Slate editor.
        *   **Regular Updates:** Keep all plugins updated to their latest versions to patch security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Sandboxing (If Feasible):** Explore options for sandboxing plugin execution to limit their impact on the main application.

## Attack Surface: [Data Model Manipulation (JSON Injection)](./attack_surfaces/data_model_manipulation__json_injection_.md)

*   *Description:* Direct modification of the underlying JSON data model representing the Slate document to inject malicious content or corrupt the document structure.
    *   *Slate's Contribution:* Slate's reliance on a JSON data model means that any vulnerability allowing direct manipulation of this JSON bypasses typical input validation.
    *   *Example:* An attacker compromises an API endpoint used to save the Slate document.  They modify the JSON payload to include a malicious script within a text node: `{"type": "paragraph", "children": [{"text": "<script>alert('XSS')</script>"}]}`.
    *   *Impact:* XSS, data corruption, denial of service.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Schema Validation:** Implement strict schema validation to ensure the JSON data model conforms to expected types and structures.  Reject any invalid JSON.
        *   **Input Validation (API Level):** Treat the JSON data received from any source (API, import, etc.) as untrusted input.  Validate it thoroughly before processing.
        *   **Integrity Checks:** Use cryptographic hashing (e.g., SHA-256) to verify the integrity of the JSON data model, especially if it's stored or transmitted.
        *   **Sanitization (Post-Deserialization):** Even after deserializing the JSON, sanitize the resulting Slate nodes before rendering.

## Attack Surface: [XSS via `insertData` and Clipboard Handling](./attack_surfaces/xss_via__insertdata__and_clipboard_handling.md)

*   *Description:* Injection of malicious code through pasted content that is not properly sanitized.
    *   *Slate's Contribution:* Slate's `insertData` method and clipboard handling are inherently vulnerable to XSS if pasted content is not rigorously cleaned.
    *   *Example:* A user copies malicious HTML from a compromised website and pastes it into the Slate editor.  The HTML contains inline event handlers (e.g., `onload`, `onerror`) that execute JavaScript.
    *   *Impact:* Client-side code execution, session hijacking, data theft.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High**
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Aggressive Sanitization:** Use a robust HTML sanitizer (e.g., DOMPurify) configured to remove *all* potentially dangerous elements and attributes from pasted content.
        *   **Plain Text Preference:** Whenever possible, encourage or enforce plain text pasting to minimize the risk.
        *   **Custom Paste Handling:** Implement custom paste handling logic that intercepts the paste event and performs thorough sanitization before inserting the content into the Slate editor.
        *   **Cross-Browser Testing:** Test clipboard handling across different browsers and operating systems, as their behavior can vary.

## Attack Surface: [Operational Transformation (OT) Vulnerabilities (Collaborative Editing)](./attack_surfaces/operational_transformation__ot__vulnerabilities__collaborative_editing_.md)

*   *Description:* Exploitation of flaws in the Operational Transformation (OT) implementation used for collaborative editing to corrupt the document or inject malicious content.
    *   *Slate's Contribution:* If collaborative editing is implemented using Slate and an OT library, vulnerabilities in the OT logic or its integration with Slate can be exploited.
    *   *Example:* An attacker sends malformed OT operations that bypass validation checks and introduce inconsistencies or inject malicious scripts into the document.
    *   *Impact:* Data corruption, XSS, denial of service.
    *   *Risk Severity:* **High** (if collaborative editing is used)
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   **Vetted OT Library:** Use a well-established and thoroughly tested OT library (e.g., ShareDB, Yjs).
        *   **Operation Validation:** Implement rigorous validation of all incoming OT operations on the server-side before applying them to the document.
        *   **Secure Communication:** Use a secure communication channel (e.g., WebSockets over TLS) for transmitting OT operations.
        *   **Centralized Authority:** Consider using a centralized server to manage and validate all OT operations, preventing direct client-to-client manipulation.
        * **Conflict Resolution:** Implement robust and secure conflict resolution mechanisms.
