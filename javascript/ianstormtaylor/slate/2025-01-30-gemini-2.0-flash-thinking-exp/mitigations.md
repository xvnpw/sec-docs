# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for ianstormtaylor/slate

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Content Sanitization](./mitigation_strategies/strict_content_sanitization.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Choose a robust HTML Sanitization Library:** Select a well-vetted and actively maintained library like DOMPurify or similar, suitable for your application's language.
2.  **Configure Allowlists and Denylists:** Define strict allowlists for HTML tags, attributes, and CSS properties permitted in Slate user-generated content. Denylist potentially dangerous elements. Tailor lists to application features.
3.  **Client-Side Sanitization (Pre-rendering):** Implement sanitization in the frontend before rendering previews in Slate editor. Provides immediate feedback and prevents basic XSS.
4.  **Server-Side Sanitization (Pre-storage):**  Crucially, perform sanitization on the server-side *before* storing any Slate content in the database. Primary defense against persistent XSS in Slate data.
5.  **Output Sanitization (Pre-display):** Sanitize Slate content again when displaying it in different contexts, especially if display context has different security needs.
6.  **Regular Library Updates:** Keep the sanitization library updated to benefit from security patches and new vulnerability detections relevant to Slate content.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts into Slate content, leading to execution in other users' browsers, session hijacking, data theft, etc.

**Impact:**

*   **XSS - High Severity:** Significantly reduces XSS risk within Slate editor content by neutralizing malicious HTML and JavaScript.

**Currently Implemented:** [Describe if content sanitization is currently implemented for Slate content in your project and where (e.g., "Client-side using library X in Slate editor", "Server-side using library Y on Slate content save"). If not implemented, state "Not Implemented"]

**Missing Implementation:** [Describe where content sanitization is missing for Slate content (e.g., "Server-side sanitization for Slate content not yet implemented", "Output sanitization missing for Slate content in specific display areas"). If fully implemented, state "No missing implementation"]

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Custom HTML and Raw Text Nodes in Slate](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_custom_html_and_raw_text_nodes_in_slate.md)

2.  **Strict Validation for Custom HTML in Slate:** If custom HTML nodes are unavoidable in Slate, implement rigorous validation on both client and server sides. Verify HTML structure and content conform to a strict schema for Slate content.
3.  **Enhanced Sanitization for Custom HTML in Slate:** Apply a more aggressive sanitization policy specifically to custom HTML nodes in Slate, potentially using a stricter allowlist or denylist.
4.  **Secure Rendering of Raw Text in Slate:** When rendering raw text nodes within Slate, ensure proper output encoding. Escape HTML entities to prevent interpretation as HTML tags.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - High Severity:** Prevents bypassing sanitization in Slate through custom HTML or improperly handled raw text nodes.
