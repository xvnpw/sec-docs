# BUSINESS POSTURE

Slate is a framework for building rich text editors. Its primary business goal is to provide developers with a highly customizable and flexible tool to create rich text editing experiences in web applications.

Business priorities for projects using Slate would likely include:

- Enhancing user experience by providing rich text editing capabilities.
- Enabling content creation and management within applications.
- Customizing editor functionality to meet specific application needs.
- Ensuring the editor is performant and reliable.
- Maintaining compatibility and ease of integration with existing web application frameworks.

Most important business risks that need to be addressed:

- Data loss or corruption due to editor instability or bugs.
- Security vulnerabilities in the editor leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other attacks.
- Performance issues impacting user experience and application responsiveness.
- Compatibility issues with different browsers or devices.
- Difficulty in customizing or extending the editor to meet evolving business requirements.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing security controls:

- security control: As a front-end library, Slate's security relies heavily on the security practices of the applications that integrate it.
- security control: Input validation and sanitization are expected to be implemented by the developers using Slate to handle the editor's output.
- security control: Dependency management using `npm` or `yarn` helps in managing third-party library vulnerabilities.

Accepted risks:

- accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies used by Slate.
- accepted risk: Misuse of Slate by developers leading to insecure configurations or integrations.
- accepted risk: Client-side vulnerabilities inherent in JavaScript-based applications.

Recommended security controls:

- recommended security control: Implement automated security scanning of dependencies to identify and address known vulnerabilities.
- recommended security control: Provide clear guidelines and best practices for developers on secure integration and usage of Slate, especially regarding output sanitization and handling user-generated content.
- recommended security control: Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing of applications using Slate to identify and remediate potential vulnerabilities.

Security requirements:

- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Slate itself, as it's a front-end library. Authentication is handled by the applications using Slate.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to Slate itself. Authorization is handled by the applications using Slate to control access to content and editor functionalities.
- Input validation: Crucial for applications using Slate. Developers must sanitize and validate the output from Slate before storing or displaying it to prevent XSS and other injection attacks. This should be implemented in the application backend and potentially on the frontend as well for immediate feedback.
- Cryptography: Not directly applicable to Slate itself in terms of encrypting editor content within Slate. However, applications using Slate might need to encrypt data at rest or in transit, which is handled outside of Slate's scope. If sensitive data is handled within the editor, consider client-side encryption before sending data to the backend.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment architecture: Client-side library integration.

Slate is primarily a front-end library, so its deployment is centered around being included in web applications. The typical deployment model is to include Slate as a dependency in a web application project, bundle it with the application's frontend code, and deploy the application to a web server or CDN.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical business process we are trying to protect:

- Content creation and management within web applications. Disruption or compromise of this process can impact user productivity, data integrity, and application functionality.

Data we are trying to protect and their sensitivity:

- Content created by users using the Slate editor. Sensitivity depends on the application context. It can range from public blog posts to sensitive internal documents.
- User input data within the editor. This data is generally considered user-generated content and its sensitivity depends on the application and user context.

Data sensitivity levels can be categorized as:

- Public: Content intended for public consumption (e.g., blog posts, public documentation). Low sensitivity.
- Internal: Content intended for internal use within an organization (e.g., internal wikis, documentation). Medium sensitivity.
- Confidential: Sensitive content that requires strict access control (e.g., financial reports, personal data). High sensitivity.

The risk assessment should be tailored to the specific application using Slate and the sensitivity of the data it handles. For applications handling sensitive data, more stringent security controls are required.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

- What type of applications will be using Slate? (e.g., public facing websites, internal tools, applications handling sensitive data).
- What is the sensitivity of the data that will be created and managed using Slate in target applications?
- What are the specific security requirements and compliance standards that the applications using Slate must adhere to?
- Are there any existing security policies or guidelines within the organization that need to be considered?
- What is the risk appetite of the organization regarding the use of third-party libraries like Slate?

Assumptions:

- Assumption: Slate will be integrated into web applications that handle user-generated content.
- Assumption: Developers integrating Slate are responsible for implementing necessary security controls in their applications, especially input validation and output sanitization.
- Assumption: The build and deployment processes for applications using Slate will follow standard web application development practices.
- Assumption: Security is a shared responsibility between the Slate library itself and the applications that integrate it.
- Assumption: The primary security concerns are related to client-side vulnerabilities, especially XSS, and supply chain security of dependencies.
