## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side XSS through Inadequate Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_xss_through_inadequate_sanitization.md)

**Path:** Compromise Application Using Slate Weaknesses -> Client-Side Exploitation -> Inject Malicious Content -> Inject Malicious Scripts (XSS) -> Exploit Inadequate Sanitization/Encoding of Slate Output
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the Slate editor.
        * The application fails to properly sanitize or encode this malicious code before rendering it in a web page.
        * When a user views the page, the malicious script executes in their browser.
        * This can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Known Slate Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_slate_vulnerabilities.md)

**Path:** Compromise Application Using Slate Weaknesses -> Client-Side Exploitation -> Trigger Known Slate Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Publicly Disclosed CVEs or Bugs
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Attacker identifies a publicly known vulnerability (CVE) in the specific version of Slate used by the application.
        * The attacker crafts an exploit that leverages this vulnerability.
        * The exploit is delivered to the user's browser, potentially through manipulated Slate content or by other means.
        * Successful exploitation can lead to various impacts depending on the vulnerability, including arbitrary code execution on the client-side.

## Attack Tree Path: [Bypassing Server-Side Sanitization](./attack_tree_paths/bypassing_server-side_sanitization.md)

**Path:** Compromise Application Using Slate Weaknesses -> Server-Side Exploitation -> Bypass Server-Side Sanitization -> Craft Payloads that Evade Sanitization Filters
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Attacker crafts malicious Slate content designed to bypass the server-side sanitization filters.
        * This might involve using encoding techniques (e.g., HTML entities, URL encoding), obfuscation, or exploiting weaknesses in the sanitization logic (e.g., regular expression vulnerabilities).
        * If successful, the unsanitized malicious content is processed by the server, potentially leading to further attacks like data injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Injection through Slate Content](./attack_tree_paths/data_injection_through_slate_content.md)

**Path:** Compromise Application Using Slate Weaknesses -> Server-Side Exploitation -> Exploit Server-Side Processing of Slate Data -> Data Injection through Slate Content
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * Attacker injects malicious data within the Slate content that is intended to be processed by the server (e.g., SQL code, NoSQL queries, OS commands).
        * The application fails to properly sanitize or parameterize this data before using it in database queries or other server-side operations.
        * This can lead to SQL injection, NoSQL injection, or command injection vulnerabilities, allowing the attacker to manipulate or extract data from the database or execute arbitrary commands on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Server-Side Processing Involves Deserialization)](./attack_tree_paths/deserialization_vulnerabilities__if_server-side_processing_involves_deserialization_.md)

**Path:** Compromise Application Using Slate Weaknesses -> Server-Side Exploitation -> Exploit Server-Side Processing of Slate Data -> Deserialization Vulnerabilities (If Server-Side Processing Involves Deserialization)
    * **Attack Vectors:**
        * If the application server-side processes involve deserializing Slate data (e.g., converting a JSON representation of Slate content back into objects), an attacker can inject malicious payloads within the serialized data.
        * When the server deserializes this data, the malicious payload can be executed, potentially leading to remote code execution on the server. This often relies on vulnerabilities in the deserialization libraries used.
