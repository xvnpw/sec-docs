Threat Model: Application Using json-server - High-Risk Sub-tree

Objective: Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses in its use of json-server, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or disruption of service.

Sub-tree:

Compromise Application Using json-server [CRITICAL NODE]
└── OR
    ├── Manipulate Data
    │   └── AND
    │       └── Exploit Lack of Authorization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
    │           └── Modify Data in Resources Without Authentication [HIGH RISK PATH]
    └── Gain Unauthorized Access [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
        └── AND
            ├── Exploit Lack of Authentication [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]
            │   └── Access API Endpoints Without Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]

                └── Access Resources Without Proper Authorization Checks [HIGH RISK PATH]

Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:

Compromise Application Using json-server [CRITICAL NODE]:
* This is the root goal. Success at any of the child nodes leads to achieving this goal.

Manipulate Data:
* Exploit Lack of Authorization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:
    * This critical node represents the fundamental flaw in json-server's default configuration where no authorization checks are in place.
    * Modify Data in Resources Without Authentication [HIGH RISK PATH]:
        * Likelihood: High (default json-server behavior)
        * Impact: High (data corruption, unauthorized changes)
        * Effort: Very Low
        * Skill Level: Very Low
        * Detection Difficulty: Low (difficult to distinguish from legitimate changes without audit logs)
        * Attackers can directly modify data in the `db.json` file through API requests without needing any credentials. This is a direct consequence of the lack of authorization and authentication.

Gain Unauthorized Access [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:
* This critical node represents the attacker successfully gaining access to the application's resources without proper authorization.

    * Exploit Lack of Authentication [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:
        * This critical node highlights the absence of any authentication mechanism in default json-server.
        * Access API Endpoints Without Credentials [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Likelihood: High (default json-server behavior)
            * Impact: Medium-High (access to potentially sensitive data)
            * Effort: Very Low
            * Skill Level: Very Low
            * Detection Difficulty: Low (difficult to distinguish from legitimate access without authentication)
            * Attackers can freely access all API endpoints and retrieve data without providing any credentials. This is the most direct consequence of the lack of authentication.

    * Exploit Lack of Authorization [CRITICAL NODE] [HIGH RISK PATH]:
        * This critical node emphasizes the lack of access controls beyond basic authentication (which is also missing by default).
        * Access Resources Without Proper Authorization Checks [HIGH RISK PATH]:
            * Likelihood: Medium-High (if consuming app doesn't enforce authorization)
            * Impact: Medium-High (access to resources they shouldn't have)
            * Effort: Very Low
            * Skill Level: Very Low
            * Detection Difficulty: Low (difficult to distinguish from legitimate access without authorization checks)
            * Attackers can access and potentially modify resources they shouldn't have access to, bypassing any authorization logic implemented in the consuming application (if any).
