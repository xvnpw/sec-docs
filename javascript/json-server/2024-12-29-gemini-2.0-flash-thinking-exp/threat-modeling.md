Here's the updated threat list focusing on high and critical threats directly involving `json-server`:

*   **Threat:** Data Injection via API
    *   **Description:** An attacker sends malicious JSON data through POST, PUT, or PATCH requests directly to `json-server` endpoints. This data could contain unexpected characters, excessively long strings, or nested structures designed to overwhelm `json-server` itself or corrupt the `db.json` file.
    *   **Impact:** Data corruption in the `db.json` file, potential for denial of service if `json-server` struggles to process the malicious data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High

*   **Threat:** Path Traversal via Database File Configuration
    *   **Description:** If the path to the `db.json` file is configurable via `json-server`'s command-line arguments (e.g., `--watch`, `--routes`) and not properly sanitized, an attacker might be able to manipulate the path to access or modify files outside the intended directory.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive files on the server, potential for arbitrary file modification or deletion, leading to application compromise or denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Lack of Authentication and Authorization leading to Unauthorized Data Access/Modification
    *   **Description:** By default, `json-server` provides an open API without any built-in authentication or authorization mechanisms. An attacker can directly access, create, update, and delete data in the `db.json` file without any credentials via `json-server`'s API endpoints.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data stored in `db.json`, data breaches, data manipulation or deletion by malicious actors.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical

*   **Threat:** Middleware Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** `json-server` allows the use of custom middleware. Vulnerabilities in this middleware code, directly interacting with `json-server`'s request/response cycle, can introduce security risks.
    *   **Impact:** Wide range of potential impacts depending on the vulnerability in the middleware, including arbitrary code execution on the server running `json-server`, or bypassing intended security controls within `json-server`.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical, assuming direct impact on `json-server`)

*   **Threat:** Accidental Exposure in Production
    *   **Description:**  `json-server` is running directly in a production environment, exposing its inherently insecure API to the public internet without any additional security measures.
    *   **Impact:** Significant security risks due to the lack of built-in security features in `json-server`, leading to potential data breaches and application compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
