# Threat Model Analysis for expressjs/body-parser

## Threat: [Large JSON Payload Denial of Service](./threats/large_json_payload_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large JSON payload to the server. The `body-parser` middleware attempts to parse this large payload, consuming significant server resources (CPU and memory). This can lead to the server becoming unresponsive or crashing, effectively denying service to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Denial of service, server downtime, resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** `json()` middleware, specifically the underlying JSON parsing logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use the `limit` option in the `json()` middleware to restrict the maximum size of accepted JSON payloads.
* Implement request rate limiting to prevent a single attacker from sending a large number of requests with large payloads.

## Threat: [Large URL-encoded Payload Denial of Service](./threats/large_url-encoded_payload_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** Similar to the large JSON payload attack, an attacker sends an extremely large URL-encoded payload. Parsing this large amount of data can consume significant server resources, leading to denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, server downtime, resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** `urlencoded()` middleware, specifically the logic for parsing URL-encoded data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use the `limit` option in the `urlencoded()` middleware to restrict the maximum size of accepted URL-encoded payloads.
* Implement request rate limiting.

## Threat: [Prototype Pollution via Malicious JSON](./threats/prototype_pollution_via_malicious_json.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a specific JSON payload designed to manipulate the `Object.prototype` or other built-in prototypes. If the underlying JSON parsing logic within `body-parser` (or its direct dependencies) is vulnerable, this could allow the attacker to inject properties into all JavaScript objects, potentially leading to application-wide vulnerabilities, code execution, or bypassing security checks.

**Impact:** Critical security vulnerabilities, potential remote code execution, data manipulation.

**Affected Component:** `json()` middleware, specifically the underlying JSON parsing logic.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Keep `body-parser` and its direct dependencies up-to-date.** This is the most crucial mitigation.
* Be cautious when handling data parsed by `body-parser` and avoid directly using object properties without validation.

## Threat: [Large Raw or Text Payload Denial of Service](./threats/large_raw_or_text_payload_denial_of_service.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends an extremely large raw or text payload. Processing excessively large payloads can lead to resource exhaustion and denial of service.

**Impact:** Denial of service, server downtime, resource exhaustion.

**Affected Component:** `raw()` and `text()` middleware, specifically the logic for reading and buffering the raw or text data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Use the `limit` option in the `raw()` and `text()` middleware to restrict the maximum size of accepted payloads.
* Implement request rate limiting.
