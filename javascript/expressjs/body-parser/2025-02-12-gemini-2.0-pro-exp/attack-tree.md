## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application via body-parser (DoS) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_via_body-parser__dos___critical_.md)

**Description:** This is the root of the sub-tree, representing the attacker's refined objective: to cause a Denial of Service. It's marked as critical because all other high-risk paths lead to this outcome.
**Attack Vectors:** This node itself doesn't have specific attack vectors; it's the *result* of the attacks on the child nodes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Cause Denial of Service (DoS) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/cause_denial_of_service__dos___high_risk_.md)

**Description:** This branch represents the overall strategy of causing a DoS. It's high-risk because DoS attacks are relatively easy to attempt and have a significant impact on application availability.
**Attack Vectors:** This node encompasses the various ways an attacker can achieve a DoS, primarily through resource exhaustion.

## Attack Tree Path: [Resource Exhaustion (CPU, Memory, Disk) [CRITICAL]](./attack_tree_paths/resource_exhaustion__cpu__memory__disk___critical_.md)

**Description:** This node represents the core mechanism of the DoS attacks. It's critical because preventing resource exhaustion is the key to mitigating the high-risk paths.
**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **CPU Exhaustion:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends requests designed to consume excessive CPU cycles, making the server unresponsive to legitimate requests.
        *   **Example:** Sending a URL-encoded request with a very large number of keys.
    *   **Memory Exhaustion:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends requests that consume large amounts of memory, potentially leading to the server crashing or becoming unresponsive.
        *   **Example:** Sending a very large raw or text request body, or a specially crafted JSON payload designed to trigger an inflation attack.
    *   **Disk Exhaustion:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends requests that cause the server to write excessive data to disk, filling up the storage and potentially causing the application to fail.
        *   **Example:** While less directly related to `body-parser`, if the application writes the parsed body to disk without limits, this could be exploited.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse URL-Encoded Parser [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_url-encoded_parser__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` parser.
**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Large Number of Keys:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends a request with an extremely large number of keys in the URL-encoded body.
        *   **Impact:** CPU exhaustion.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use the `parameterLimit` option in `body-parser`'s `urlencoded` middleware to limit the number of allowed parameters. Set a reasonable `limit` on the request body size.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Raw Parser [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_raw_parser__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting the raw request body parser.
**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Large Body:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends a very large raw request body.
        *   **Impact:** Memory exhaustion.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use the `limit` option in `body-parser`'s `raw` middleware to restrict the size of the raw body.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Text Parser [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_text_parser__high_risk_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting the plain text request body parser.
**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Large Body:**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends a very large text request body.
        *   **Impact:** Memory exhaustion.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use the `limit` option in `body-parser`'s `text` middleware to restrict the size of the text body.

## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse JSON Parser (inflate, etc.) [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_json_parser__inflate__etc____high_risk_.md)

**Description:** This path focuses on exploiting the JSON request body parser, specifically targeting inflation vulnerabilities.
**Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Inflation Attacks (e.g., "Billion Laughs"):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker sends a specially crafted JSON payload (like the "Billion Laughs" attack, which uses entity expansion) or deeply nested JSON object.
        *   **Impact:** Memory exhaustion.
        *   **Mitigation:** Use the `limit` option in `body-parser`'s `json` middleware to restrict the size of the JSON body. Implement input validation after parsing.
