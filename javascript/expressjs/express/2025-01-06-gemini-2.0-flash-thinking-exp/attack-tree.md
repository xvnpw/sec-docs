## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities.md)

*   This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses within the middleware layer of the Express.js application. Middleware functions handle requests before they reach route handlers, making them a critical point for security.

    *   **Unhandled Middleware Errors [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers send requests designed to trigger errors within middleware functions that are not properly handled. This can lead to application crashes and denial of service.
        *   **Consequences:**  Service disruption, potential data loss if errors occur during sensitive operations.

    *   **Insecure or Vulnerable Middleware [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
        *   This path involves exploiting vulnerabilities in either third-party middleware packages or custom-built middleware.

            *   **Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Middleware [CRITICAL NODE]:**
                *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers leverage publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the middleware packages used by the application.
                *   **Consequences:**  Remote code execution, data breaches, or other impacts depending on the specific vulnerability.

            *   **Abuse Misconfigured or Insecure Custom Middleware [HIGH-RISK PATH]:**
