# Threat Model Analysis for expressjs/express

## Threat: [Route Parameter Pollution](./threats/route_parameter_pollution.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates URL parameters or query strings to inject unexpected values, potentially altering the application's logic or accessing unintended data. This exploits Express.js's routing mechanism by introducing unexpected input through the request.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, privilege escalation, data manipulation, or unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Component:** `express.Router` (the routing mechanism within Express.js).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization for all route parameters.
* Avoid directly using request parameters in sensitive operations without explicit checks.
* Use a defined schema for expected parameters and reject requests that don't conform.

## Threat: [Wildcard Route Abuse](./threats/wildcard_route_abuse.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits overly permissive wildcard routes (e.g., `/*`) to bypass intended access controls or access unintended resources. This leverages Express.js's routing order and matching logic to access routes that should be protected.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, bypassing authentication or authorization mechanisms.

**Affected Component:** `express.Router` (specifically, the matching logic for wildcard routes).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using overly broad wildcard routes if possible.
* Place more specific routes before more general or wildcard routes in the route definition order.
* Ensure proper authentication and authorization middleware is applied to all relevant routes, including those potentially matched by wildcards.

## Threat: [Incorrect Middleware Execution Order](./threats/incorrect_middleware_execution_order.md)

**Description:** An attacker leverages the order in which middleware functions are executed to bypass security checks or manipulate the request/response lifecycle. This directly exploits how Express.js manages and executes its middleware pipeline.

**Impact:** Bypassing security controls (authentication, authorization), data manipulation, or unexpected application behavior.

**Affected Component:** The Express.js middleware pipeline and the order in which `app.use()` is called.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully plan and document the intended execution order of middleware.
* Ensure security-related middleware (authentication, authorization, sanitization) is registered and executed *before* route handlers that perform sensitive operations.

## Threat: [Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware](./threats/malicious_or_vulnerable_middleware.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in third-party or custom middleware used within the Express.js application. While the vulnerability might not be in Express's core, the framework's reliance on middleware makes it a direct point of impact. Malicious middleware could be intentionally designed to compromise the application via the Express.js request/response flow.

**Impact:** Remote code execution, data exfiltration, denial of service, or complete application compromise, depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Component:** Any third-party or custom middleware used with `app.use()`.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly vet all third-party middleware for security vulnerabilities before using them.
* Regularly update middleware dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities.
* Implement secure coding practices for custom middleware.

## Threat: [Insecure Cookie Settings](./threats/insecure_cookie_settings.md)

**Description:** An attacker can exploit improperly configured cookie settings to perform attacks like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This directly involves how Express.js allows setting cookie attributes.

**Impact:** Session hijacking, unauthorized access, CSRF attacks leading to unintended actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected Component:** Express.js's response object methods for setting cookies (e.g., `res.cookie()`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always set the `HttpOnly` flag for session cookies and other sensitive cookies.
* Set the `Secure` flag to ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
* Consider using the `SameSite` attribute to mitigate CSRF attacks.
