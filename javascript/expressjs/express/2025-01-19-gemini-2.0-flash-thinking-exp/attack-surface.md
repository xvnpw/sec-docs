# Attack Surface Analysis for expressjs/express

## Attack Surface: [Improperly Configured Routes](./attack_surfaces/improperly_configured_routes.md)

*   **Description:**  Routes are defined in a way that allows access to unintended functionalities or data. This can include overly broad wildcards, missing authentication checks, or incorrect HTTP method handling.
*   **How Express Contributes:** Express.js's routing mechanism relies on developers defining routes. Incorrect or overly permissive route definitions directly create this attack surface.
*   **Example:** A route defined as `/admin/*` without proper authentication allows anyone to access any path under `/admin/`.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, administrative functionalities, or unintended application behavior.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement proper authentication and authorization middleware for sensitive routes.
    *   Use specific route paths instead of broad wildcards where possible.
    *   Enforce specific HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on routes.
    *   Regularly review and audit route configurations.

## Attack Surface: [Request Body Parsing Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/request_body_parsing_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Vulnerabilities arising from how Express.js parses the request body, often through middleware like `body-parser`. This can include denial-of-service through large payloads.
*   **How Express Contributes:** Express.js relies on middleware to parse request bodies. Misconfigurations or vulnerabilities in these middleware components directly contribute to this attack surface.
*   **Example:** Sending an extremely large JSON payload to an endpoint using `body-parser` without size limits, potentially crashing the server.
*   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS).
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Set appropriate size limits for request bodies in body-parsing middleware.
    *   Carefully evaluate and choose body-parsing middleware, keeping them updated.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_middleware.md)

*   **Description:**  Using third-party or custom middleware that contains security vulnerabilities or is intentionally malicious.
*   **How Express Contributes:** Express.js's middleware architecture allows developers to extend its functionality. Introducing vulnerable or malicious middleware directly expands the attack surface.
*   **Example:** Using an outdated version of a popular middleware package with a known remote code execution vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including remote code execution, data breaches.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Thoroughly vet and audit all third-party middleware before using them.
    *   Keep all middleware dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement security reviews for custom middleware.
    *   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.

## Attack Surface: [Static File Serving Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/static_file_serving_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Misconfiguration of the `express.static` middleware leading to the exposure of sensitive files or directory traversal vulnerabilities.
*   **How Express Contributes:** Express.js provides the `express.static` middleware for serving static files. Incorrect configuration of this middleware creates this attack surface.
*   **Example:**  Accidentally serving the `.env` file containing API keys through a poorly configured `express.static` setup.
*   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive configuration files, source code, or other confidential data.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully define the root directory for `express.static` to only include intended public assets.
    *   Avoid serving sensitive directories or files using `express.static`.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) (if using templating engines)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_template_injection__ssti___if_using_templating_engines_.md)

*   **Description:**  If using a templating engine (like Pug, EJS, Handlebars), unsanitized user input embedded directly into templates can allow attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server.
*   **How Express Contributes:** Express.js integrates with various templating engines. The framework itself doesn't introduce the vulnerability, but its use with vulnerable templating practices creates the attack surface.
*   **Example:**  Rendering user-provided data directly into an EJS template like `<%- userInput %>` without proper escaping, allowing the execution of JavaScript code.
*   **Impact:** Remote Code Execution (RCE), full compromise of the server.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Always sanitize and escape user-provided data before embedding it in templates.
    *   Use templating engines with auto-escaping features enabled by default.
    *   Avoid using "unsafe" or "unescaped" rendering functions unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
