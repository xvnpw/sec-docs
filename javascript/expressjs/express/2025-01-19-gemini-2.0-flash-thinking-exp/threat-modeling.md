# Threat Model Analysis for expressjs/express

## Threat: [Path Traversal via Route Parameters](./threats/path_traversal_via_route_parameters.md)

**Description:** An attacker manipulates route parameters to access files or directories outside the intended scope. They might craft a request with a parameter like `../../../../etc/passwd` to read sensitive system files.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential information disclosure, and in some cases, the ability to execute arbitrary code if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** `express.Router` (specifically how route parameters are defined and handled).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation and sanitization on all route parameters.
* Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.
* Utilize path manipulation libraries that offer built-in security checks (e.g., `path.resolve`, `path.join`).
* Implement proper access controls and permissions on the file system.

## Threat: [Route Hijacking due to Middleware Ordering](./threats/route_hijacking_due_to_middleware_ordering.md)

**Description:** An attacker can bypass security checks or access protected resources by exploiting the order of middleware execution. For example, if an authentication middleware is placed after a middleware serving static files, they might access protected static assets without authentication.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to resources, bypassing authentication and authorization mechanisms, potentially leading to data breaches or manipulation.

**Affected Component:** The Express application's middleware stack (`app.use`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Carefully plan and document the order of middleware functions.
* Ensure authentication and authorization middleware are placed early in the request processing pipeline, before any route handlers or other potentially vulnerable middleware.
* Regularly review and audit the middleware stack.

## Threat: [Path Traversal when Serving Static Files](./threats/path_traversal_when_serving_static_files.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts a request to access files outside the designated static directory when using `express.static()`. For example, if the static directory is `/public`, an attacker might try to access `/public/../server.js`.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, potential information disclosure, and in some cases, the ability to execute arbitrary code if combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Affected Component:** `express.static()` middleware.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Explicitly define the root directory for static files using the first argument of `express.static()`.
* Avoid using user-provided input to construct paths for static file serving.
* Consider using a reverse proxy or CDN to serve static assets, which can provide additional security layers.
