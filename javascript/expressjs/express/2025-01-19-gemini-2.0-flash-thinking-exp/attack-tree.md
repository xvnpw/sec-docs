# Attack Tree Analysis for expressjs/express

Objective: To compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Express.js framework itself.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Routing Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_routing_vulnerabilities__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target weaknesses in how the application defines and handles routes.
    * **Potential Exploits:**
        * **Route Parameter Pollution:** Injecting malicious parameters to overwrite existing ones or bypass security checks.
        * **Route Hijacking/Shadowing:** Crafting requests to target unintended route handlers due to overlapping or ambiguous route definitions.
        * **Missing or Insecure Route Handlers:** Exploiting routes without proper handling or with default handlers lacking input validation or authorization.
    * **Impact:** Can lead to unauthorized access to functionalities, data manipulation, or bypassing security controls.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target vulnerabilities within the middleware components used by the application.
    * **Potential Exploits:**
        * **Middleware Bypass:** Identifying conditions to skip security middleware and crafting requests to bypass these checks.
        * **Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware (CRITICAL NODE):** Exploiting known vulnerabilities in third-party or custom middleware to gain access or execute malicious code.
    * **Impact:** Bypassing security controls, remote code execution, data breaches, or complete application takeover.

## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious or Vulnerable Middleware (Contained within Exploit Middleware Vulnerabilities - HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_or_vulnerable_middleware__contained_within_exploit_middleware_vulnerabilities_-_high-risk__2fae2dde.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers specifically target vulnerabilities within the code of middleware components.
    * **Potential Exploits:**
        * Identifying known vulnerabilities in third-party or custom middleware.
        * Exploiting these vulnerabilities to gain unauthorized access or execute malicious code.
    * **Impact:** Remote code execution, data breaches, privilege escalation, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Express Itself (HIGH-RISK PATH, CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_express_itself__high-risk_path__critical_node_.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers target inherent security flaws within the Express.js framework code.
    * **Potential Exploits:**
        * Identifying known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Express.js being used.
        * Exploiting these vulnerabilities using publicly available exploits or custom-developed exploits.
    * **Impact:** Complete application compromise, remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service affecting the core framework functionality.
