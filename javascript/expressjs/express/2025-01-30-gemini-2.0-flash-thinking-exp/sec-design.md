# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a minimal, flexible, and performant web application framework for Node.js.
  - Enable developers to quickly build and deploy web applications and APIs.
  - Maintain a large and active community to support and extend the framework.
  - Ensure the framework is easy to learn and use, promoting developer productivity.
  - Remain open-source and freely available to encourage widespread adoption.
- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities in the framework could lead to widespread application security issues for users.
  - Lack of maintenance or community support could lead to the framework becoming outdated and less secure.
  - Breaking changes in new versions could disrupt existing applications and developer workflows.
  - Negative publicity from security incidents or critical bugs could damage the framework's reputation and adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
  - security control: Open Source Code - publicly accessible source code on GitHub allows for community review and identification of potential vulnerabilities. Implemented: GitHub Repository.
  - security control: Community Contributions - relies on community contributions for bug fixes, security patches, and feature development. Implemented: GitHub pull requests and issue tracking.
  - security control: npm Ecosystem - leverages the security features of the npm registry for package distribution and dependency management. Implemented: npm registry.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on Community Security - security relies heavily on the vigilance and contributions of the open-source community.
  - accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities - potential vulnerabilities in dependencies used by Express.js need to be monitored and addressed.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Automated Security Scanning - Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dependency Scanning in the CI/CD pipeline to identify potential vulnerabilities early in the development process.
  - security control: Regular Security Audits - Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to identify and address potential weaknesses in the framework.
  - security control: Security Vulnerability Disclosure Policy - Establish a clear and public security vulnerability disclosure policy to guide users and security researchers on how to report vulnerabilities responsibly.
  - security control: Security Champions - Designate security champions within the development team to promote security awareness and best practices.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication:
    - Requirement: Express.js itself does not enforce authentication, but it should provide mechanisms and guidance for developers to easily integrate authentication middleware.
    - Existing Control: Middleware ecosystem (e.g., Passport.js) provides authentication solutions.
  - Authorization:
    - Requirement: Express.js should provide mechanisms and guidance for developers to implement authorization controls to protect resources based on user roles and permissions.
    - Existing Control: Middleware ecosystem (e.g., express-jwt, express-acl) provides authorization solutions.
  - Input Validation:
    - Requirement: Express.js should encourage and facilitate input validation to prevent common vulnerabilities like injection attacks.
    - Existing Control: Middleware ecosystem (e.g., express-validator) provides input validation solutions. Framework documentation and examples should emphasize input validation best practices.
  - Cryptography:
    - Requirement: Express.js itself does not handle cryptography directly for application data, but it relies on Node.js crypto library and should provide guidance on using cryptography securely when needed in applications built with Express.js.
    - Existing Control: Node.js crypto library is available. Guidance in documentation and examples should promote secure cryptographic practices.
