## Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: 1.2.1 Prototype Pollution via `req.query`, `req.body`, etc. (RCE)

### 1. Define Objective, Scope, and Methodology

**Objective:**

The primary objective of this deep analysis is to thoroughly understand the mechanics of prototype pollution vulnerabilities within an Express.js application, specifically focusing on how an attacker can exploit `req.query` and `req.body` to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE).  We aim to identify common vulnerable code patterns, demonstrate the exploitation process, and provide concrete, actionable recommendations for prevention and remediation.  This analysis will inform secure coding practices and improve the overall security posture of the application.

**Scope:**

This analysis focuses exclusively on the attack vector described in the attack tree path:  Prototype Pollution via `req.query` and `req.body` in an Express.js application.  We will consider:

*   **Vulnerable Code Patterns:**  Examples of how Express.js applications might be susceptible to this attack.
*   **Exploitation Techniques:**  Step-by-step demonstration of how an attacker could craft malicious input to trigger prototype pollution and achieve RCE.
*   **Impact Analysis:**  Detailed explanation of the potential consequences of a successful attack, including data breaches, system compromise, and denial of service.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**  Specific, actionable recommendations for preventing and remediating this vulnerability, including code examples and library recommendations.
*   **Detection Methods:** Techniques for identifying potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities in existing code.

We will *not* cover:

*   Other types of prototype pollution vulnerabilities (e.g., those arising from third-party libraries, unless directly related to the handling of `req.query` or `req.body`).
*   Other attack vectors against Express.js applications (e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL injection).
*   General security best practices unrelated to prototype pollution.

**Methodology:**

This analysis will employ a combination of the following methods:

1.  **Code Review:**  Examination of hypothetical and real-world (open-source) Express.js code snippets to identify vulnerable patterns.
2.  **Vulnerability Research:**  Review of existing literature, vulnerability databases (CVEs), and security advisories related to prototype pollution in JavaScript and Node.js.
3.  **Proof-of-Concept (PoC) Development:**  Creation of simple, controlled Express.js applications and corresponding exploit payloads to demonstrate the vulnerability and its impact.  This will be done in a safe, isolated environment.
4.  **Static Analysis:**  Discussion of how static analysis tools *could* potentially be used to detect this vulnerability (though limitations will be noted).
5.  **Dynamic Analysis:** Discussion of how dynamic analysis and fuzzing *could* be used to detect this vulnerability.

### 2. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 2.1 Vulnerable Code Patterns

Prototype pollution vulnerabilities in Express.js often arise from the combination of:

*   **Unsafe Object Merging/Cloning:**  Using functions like `Object.assign()`, `_.merge()` (from Lodash), or custom recursive merging functions without proper sanitization.
*   **Direct Use of User Input:**  Directly using `req.query` or `req.body` (or parts thereof) as input to these unsafe merging functions.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:**  Failing to validate the structure and content of user-supplied data before processing it.

Here are some common vulnerable code patterns:

**Example 1: Unsafe Object.assign()**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json()); // For parsing application/json

app.post('/update-profile', (req, res) => {
  const userProfile = { name: 'Default User', settings: { theme: 'light' } };
  Object.assign(userProfile, req.body); // Vulnerable!

  // ... later use of userProfile ...
  if (userProfile.settings.isAdmin) {
    // Grant admin privileges - potentially dangerous if polluted
  }

  res.json(userProfile);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

An attacker could send a POST request with the following body:

```json
{
  "__proto__": {
    "isAdmin": true
  }
}
```

This would pollute the global `Object.prototype`, setting `isAdmin` to `true` for *all* objects, potentially granting the attacker administrative privileges.

**Example 2: Unsafe Recursive Merge (Custom Function)**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.urlencoded({ extended: true })); // For parsing application/x-www-form-urlencoded

function merge(target, source) {
  for (const key in source) {
    if (typeof source[key] === 'object' && source[key] !== null && !Array.isArray(source[key])) {
      if (typeof target[key] === 'object' && target[key] !== null && !Array.isArray(target[key])) {
        merge(target[key], source[key]);
      } else {
        target[key] = {};
        merge(target[key], source[key]);
      }
    } else {
      target[key] = source[key];
    }
  }
  return target;
}

app.post('/config', (req, res) => {
  const defaultConfig = { logging: { level: 'info' } };
  const userConfig = req.body; // Vulnerable!
  const finalConfig = merge(defaultConfig, userConfig);

  // ... later use of finalConfig ...
  if (finalConfig.logging.level === 'debug') {
    // Log sensitive information
  }

  res.json(finalConfig);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

An attacker could send a POST request with the following body (URL-encoded):

```
__proto__[polluted]=true
```

This would pollute the global `Object.prototype`, adding a `polluted` property with the value `true` to all objects.  While this example doesn't directly lead to RCE, it demonstrates the core vulnerability.  A more sophisticated payload could target properties used in critical code paths.

**Example 3:  Indirect Prototype Pollution leading to RCE (using a hypothetical library)**

Let's assume a hypothetical library `executeCode` that takes an object as input and, based on a property `command`, executes arbitrary code:

```javascript
// Hypothetical vulnerable library
function executeCode(options) {
  if (options.command) {
    eval(options.command); // Extremely dangerous!
  }
}

const express = require('express');
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post('/run', (req, res) => {
  const config = {};
  Object.assign(config, req.body); // Vulnerable!
  executeCode(config); // Indirectly vulnerable due to prototype pollution
  res.send('OK');
});

app.listen(3000);
```

An attacker could send:

```json
{
  "__proto__": {
    "command": "require('child_process').execSync('rm -rf /')"
  }
}
```

This would pollute the prototype, and *any* subsequent object creation (including `config` in this case) would inherit the `command` property.  `executeCode` would then execute the malicious command, leading to RCE.  This highlights how prototype pollution can have cascading effects, even if the direct usage of `req.body` doesn't seem immediately dangerous.

#### 2.2 Exploitation Techniques

The exploitation process generally involves these steps:

1.  **Identify Vulnerable Endpoint:**  The attacker needs to find an endpoint that accepts user input (via `req.query` or `req.body`) and uses it in an unsafe way (as described in the vulnerable code patterns).
2.  **Craft Malicious Payload:**  The attacker crafts a JSON or URL-encoded payload that includes the `__proto__` property (or `constructor.prototype` in some cases) to inject malicious properties into the object prototype.
3.  **Send Request:**  The attacker sends an HTTP request (usually POST or PUT, but GET can be used with `req.query`) to the vulnerable endpoint with the crafted payload.
4.  **Trigger Vulnerable Code:**  The application processes the request, and the unsafe object manipulation (e.g., `Object.assign()`) pollutes the prototype.
5.  **Achieve Desired Effect (RCE):**  Subsequent code execution within the application uses the polluted prototype, leading to the attacker's desired outcome.  This often involves targeting properties that control program flow or access sensitive resources.  For RCE, the attacker aims to inject code that will be executed by the server (e.g., using `eval`, `Function`, `child_process.exec`, etc.).

#### 2.3 Impact Analysis

The impact of a successful prototype pollution attack leading to RCE is extremely severe:

*   **Complete System Compromise:**  The attacker gains full control over the server, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands, access and modify files, install malware, and pivot to other systems on the network.
*   **Data Breach:**  The attacker can steal sensitive data stored on the server, including user credentials, database contents, API keys, and other confidential information.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The attacker can disrupt the application's functionality by deleting files, shutting down services, or overloading the server.
*   **Reputational Damage:**  A successful attack can severely damage the reputation of the organization responsible for the application.
*   **Legal and Financial Consequences:**  Data breaches can lead to lawsuits, fines, and other legal and financial penalties.

#### 2.4 Mitigation Strategies

The most effective mitigation is to prevent prototype pollution from occurring in the first place.  Here are several strategies:

1.  **Strict Input Validation and Sanitization:**
    *   **Use a Validation Library:**  Employ a robust validation library like Joi, express-validator, or validator.js.  Define schemas that explicitly specify the expected data types, formats, and allowed values for all user input.
    *   **Whitelist, Not Blacklist:**  Define what is *allowed* rather than trying to block specific malicious inputs.  Blacklisting is often incomplete and easily bypassed.
    *   **Validate Nested Objects:**  Pay close attention to nested objects and arrays.  Ensure that the validation library recursively checks the structure and content of these nested elements.
    *   **Sanitize Input:**  After validation, sanitize the input to remove any potentially harmful characters or sequences.

    ```javascript
    const Joi = require('joi');
    const express = require('express');
    const app = express();
    app.use(express.json());

    const profileSchema = Joi.object({
      name: Joi.string().alphanum().min(3).max(30).required(),
      settings: Joi.object({
        theme: Joi.string().valid('light', 'dark').default('light'),
      }).required(),
    });

    app.post('/update-profile', (req, res) => {
      const { error, value } = profileSchema.validate(req.body);

      if (error) {
        return res.status(400).json({ error: error.details[0].message });
      }

      const userProfile = { name: 'Default User', settings: { theme: 'light' } };
      Object.assign(userProfile, value); // Safe because 'value' is validated

      // ...
      res.json(userProfile);
    });

    app.listen(3000);
    ```

2.  **Avoid Unsafe Object Manipulation:**
    *   **Create New Objects:**  Instead of modifying existing objects directly, create new objects with the desired properties.  This avoids unintended side effects.
    *   **Use Safe Alternatives:**  If you need to merge objects, use libraries or techniques that are specifically designed to prevent prototype pollution.  For example, you could use a deep cloning function that explicitly avoids copying the `__proto__` property.

    ```javascript
    // Safer alternative to Object.assign() for simple cases
    const newObject = { ...existingObject, ...validatedInput };
    ```

3.  **Use Object.create(null):**
    *   Create objects without a prototype using `Object.create(null)`. These objects are immune to prototype pollution because they don't inherit from `Object.prototype`.

    ```javascript
    const config = Object.create(null);
    config.setting1 = 'value1'; // Safe, no prototype to pollute
    ```

4.  **Freeze the Prototype:**
    *   Use `Object.freeze(Object.prototype)` to prevent modifications to the global `Object.prototype`. This is a drastic measure and should be done *very* early in the application's lifecycle, before any third-party libraries are loaded.  It can break libraries that rely on modifying the prototype.

    ```javascript
    Object.freeze(Object.prototype);
    ```

5.  **Use a Dedicated Library:**
    *   Consider using libraries specifically designed to mitigate prototype pollution, such as `safe-obj-assign` or similar packages. These libraries provide safer alternatives to common object manipulation functions.

6. **Disable `__proto__` (Node.js specific):**
    * Node.js allows disabling access to `__proto__` via the `--disable-proto=delete` or `--disable-proto=throw` command-line flags. This is a strong mitigation, but may break compatibility with some older libraries.

#### 2.5 Detection Methods

Detecting prototype pollution vulnerabilities can be challenging, but several techniques can help:

1.  **Manual Code Review:**  Carefully examine the code for the vulnerable patterns described earlier.  Pay close attention to how user input is handled and how objects are created and modified.
2.  **Static Analysis Tools:**  Some static analysis tools *may* be able to detect potential prototype pollution vulnerabilities.  However, these tools often have limitations and may produce false positives or false negatives.  Look for tools that specifically mention prototype pollution detection capabilities.  Tools like ESLint with security plugins can be helpful.
3.  **Dynamic Analysis and Fuzzing:**  Dynamic analysis tools and fuzzers can be used to send a wide range of inputs to the application and observe its behavior.  By sending payloads designed to trigger prototype pollution, you can potentially identify vulnerabilities that are difficult to find through static analysis.
4.  **Runtime Monitoring:**  Monitor the application's behavior in a production or staging environment.  Look for unexpected errors or changes in object properties that might indicate a prototype pollution attack.
5. **Security Audits:** Engage a third-party security firm to conduct a thorough security audit of the application.

#### 2.6 Conclusion

Prototype pollution via `req.query` and `req.body` in Express.js applications is a serious vulnerability that can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).  By understanding the underlying mechanisms, vulnerable code patterns, and exploitation techniques, developers can take proactive steps to prevent and mitigate this risk.  Strict input validation, safe object manipulation practices, and the use of appropriate security libraries are crucial for building secure Express.js applications.  Regular security audits and ongoing vigilance are essential for maintaining a strong security posture.
