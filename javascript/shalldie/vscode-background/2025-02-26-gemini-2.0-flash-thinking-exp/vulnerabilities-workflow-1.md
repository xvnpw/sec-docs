### Vulnerability List

#### 1. VS Code Instability due to File Modification Errors

- **Vulnerability name:** VS Code Instability due to File Modification Errors
- **Description:** The vscode-background extension operates by directly modifying core VS Code JavaScript files to inject code responsible for rendering background images. This modification process involves reading the original VS Code file, appending or inserting code snippets, and then writing the modified content back to the file. If this process encounters errors, such as due to file permission issues, concurrent file access by other processes (including VS Code itself during updates or multiple instances running), or if the patching logic within the extension is not robust enough to handle variations in VS Code file structure across different versions, it can lead to corruption of the VS Code core files. Such corruption can manifest as VS Code instability, crashes, unexpected errors, or broken functionality.
- **Impact:** High. Corruption of core VS Code files can lead to significant instability, including crashes and unpredictable behavior of the IDE. This can result in loss of unsaved work if crashes occur, user frustration, and potentially require users to reinstall VS Code or manually repair the corrupted files to restore normal operation.
- **Vulnerability rank:** High
- **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    - The changelog for version 2.0.3 mentions "fix: add patch lockfile for multiple instances (添加了文件锁应对多实例同时写入)". This suggests an attempt to prevent concurrent write issues by implementing a file locking mechanism, although the robustness and effectiveness of this lock are not detailed in the provided files.
    - The documentation includes a "How to uninstall" section, which provides steps to remove the background images, and a section on "VSCode crashes" with manual steps to revert changes by editing the modified `workbench.desktop.main.js` file and removing the injected code block. These are reactive measures, not preventative mitigations for the file modification errors themselves.
- **Missing mitigations:**
    - **Robust Error Handling**: The extension lacks detailed error handling during the critical file patching and unpatching processes. This includes catching file system errors (like permission issues, read-only file systems), errors during file reading/writing, and failures in the code injection logic.
    - **Rollback Mechanism**: In case of a patching failure, the extension should implement an automatic rollback mechanism to revert any changes made to the VS Code files, ensuring that VS Code remains in a functional state even if the background image injection fails.
    - **Pre-patch File Backup**: Before modifying any VS Code core file, the extension should create a backup of the original file. This backup can be used for easy rollback in case of errors during patching or when uninstalling the extension, ensuring a clean removal of changes.
    - **Integrity Checks**: Before applying patches, the extension could perform integrity checks on the target VS Code file to verify its expected structure and compatibility with the patching logic. This can help prevent patching failures due to unexpected file changes, especially after VS Code updates.
    - **Automated Recovery/Repair**: The extension could include an automated recovery or repair mechanism that detects if VS Code files are corrupted due to patching errors and attempts to restore them from backups or re-patch them correctly.
    - **Comprehensive Testing**:  More rigorous testing across different VS Code versions, operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux), and installation scenarios (including VS Code updates during extension activity and concurrent VS Code instances) is needed to identify and fix potential file modification issues.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The user must install and activate the vscode-background extension in VS Code.
    - The extension must attempt to modify a core VS Code JavaScript file (e.g., `workbench.desktop.main.js`) upon activation or configuration change to inject the background image code.
    - Conditions that can trigger the vulnerability include:
        - File system permissions preventing write access to VS Code core files.
        - VS Code updating itself in the background while the extension is patching files.
        - Multiple instances of VS Code running and the extension attempting to patch files concurrently, even with the attempted lockfile mitigation, race conditions might still exist.
        - Structural changes in VS Code core files across different versions that are not accounted for in the extension's patching logic.
- **Source code analysis:**
    - **File Modification Process (Conceptual)**: Based on the description, the extension likely performs the following steps when activated or when configurations are changed:
        1. **Locate Target File**: Determine the path to the core VS Code JavaScript file that needs modification (e.g., `workbench.desktop.main.js`). This path might be dynamically determined based on the operating system and VS Code installation directory.
        2. **Read File Content**: Read the entire content of the target JavaScript file into memory.
        3. **Inject Code Snippet**: Identify the location within the file where the background image injection code needs to be inserted. This might involve searching for specific markers or code patterns in the file content. Construct the JavaScript code snippet that adds the background image functionality (likely manipulating CSS or DOM elements). Insert this code snippet into the file content at the identified location.
        4. **Write Modified File**: Write the modified content back to the target JavaScript file, overwriting the original content.
    - **Potential Vulnerability Points**:
        - **File Path Resolution**: Incorrectly resolving the path to the target VS Code file can lead to modifying the wrong file or failing to modify any file, potentially causing errors or unexpected behavior.
        - **File Locking (Insufficient)**: While a lockfile is mentioned, its implementation details are unknown. If the locking mechanism is not correctly implemented or if there are race conditions in acquiring or releasing the lock, concurrent modification issues can still occur.
        - **Code Injection Logic**: If the logic for injecting the code snippet is brittle and relies on specific code structures within the VS Code file, updates to VS Code might break this logic. For example, if the extension searches for a specific line number or string to insert code after, and that line number or string changes in a VS Code update, the injection might fail or insert code in the wrong place, potentially causing JavaScript errors or VS Code malfunction.
        - **Error Handling (Lack of)**: If any step in the process (file reading, code injection, file writing) fails, the extension might not have proper error handling to detect and recover from these failures. This can leave VS Code in a corrupted state without the user being informed or provided with recovery options.
        - **Permissions Issues**: If the user does not have write permissions to the VS Code installation directory or the specific target file, the file writing operation will fail, potentially leading to errors and an inconsistent state.
- **Security test case:**
    1. **Setup**: Install the vscode-background extension. Note the current version of VS Code.
    2. **Simulate VS Code Update (Concurrent Modification)**:
        a. Activate the extension to apply background images.
        b. While VS Code is running with the background extension active, initiate a VS Code update (if possible through the VS Code UI, or by manually triggering an update process if such a mechanism exists for VS Code extensions or core updates). Alternatively, simulate concurrent access by attempting to install or update another extension while vscode-background is active.
    3. **Observe VS Code Behavior**:
        a. After the simulated update/concurrent access attempt, observe VS Code for stability. Check for:
            - Crashes: Does VS Code crash immediately or after some interaction?
            - Errors: Are there any error messages displayed in VS Code, either in the UI or in the developer console (Help -> Toggle Developer Tools)?
            - Broken Functionality: Is VS Code behaving erratically? Are menus, editor functionalities, or other core features working as expected?
            - Background Images: Are the background images still applied correctly, or are they broken, missing, or causing visual glitches?
        b. Examine VS Code logs: Check VS Code's log files (if any are readily accessible) for error messages related to file access, JavaScript errors, or extension loading failures.
    4. **Uninstall and Re-test**:
        a. Uninstall the vscode-background extension through the VS Code extension panel.
        b. Restart VS Code completely.
        c. Observe if VS Code returns to a stable state after uninstall. If VS Code is still unstable or shows errors after uninstall, it indicates that the unpatching process might have failed to fully revert the changes, leaving VS Code in a corrupted state.
    5. **Verification of File Corruption**:
        a. If VS Code shows instability or errors, manually navigate to the directory where VS Code core files are located (e.g., `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Microsoft VS Code\resources\app\out\vs\workbench` on Windows, or similar paths on macOS/Linux as mentioned in `common-issues.md`).
        b. Examine the modified JavaScript file (e.g., `workbench.desktop.main.js`). Check if the file content appears corrupted, contains unexpected code fragments, or if the injected code is malformed or incomplete.
    6. **Expected Outcome**: A successful test case would be one where, after simulating a VS Code update or concurrent access while the extension is active, VS Code becomes unstable, crashes, or shows errors, and/or if uninstalling the extension does not fully restore VS Code to a stable state, indicating file modification errors.

#### 2. Insecure Modification of VS Code Core Files Leading to Arbitrary Code Injection

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Modification of VS Code Core Files Leading to Arbitrary Code Injection
- **Description:**
    - The extension “patches” VS Code’s core JavaScript file (by inserting code between markers such as “// vscode-background‑start” and “// vscode-background‑end”) to implement background image features.
    - If an attacker is able to influence the extension configuration (for example, by supplying a malicious payload within the “background.editor” settings), the unsanitized input may be injected verbatim into the core file.
    - An external attacker controlling a publicly accessible instance (such as a code‑server deployment) could craft configuration values that “break out” of the intended string context and execute malicious code when VS Code loads the modified file.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary code execution is achieved with the privileges of the VS Code process, potentially compromising the entire host system and affecting all users.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The changelog indicates that a patch lockfile mechanism has been introduced to handle concurrent modifications and that there is some protocol verification for image URLs.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - No robust sanitization or integrity verification is performed on user‑supplied configuration inputs (such as custom image URLs or CSS style values).
    - There is no cryptographic checksum or other mechanism to verify that the modifications to the VS Code core file remain within known, trusted boundaries.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The extension is installed on an instance (for example, code-server) that is publicly accessible or otherwise allows remote configuration modifications.
    - The attacker has a means to influence or alter the extension’s configuration (e.g., through a compromised settings file or administrative interface).
- **Source Code Analysis (Hypothetical):**
    - The extension locates the target VS Code JavaScript file and identifies markers (e.g., “// vscode-background‑start” … “// vscode-background‑end”).
    - It then reads a JSON configuration (from settings.json) that includes properties such as “background.editor.images” and “background.editor.style” and inserts these values into the JS file without rigorous sanitization.
    - For example, a crafted image URL value like:
      ` "images": [ "https://attacker.com/malicious.png');alert('Injected');//" ] `
      when inserted into a code segment, would break out of the intended string context and execute the injected alert (or more harmful payload).
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. Deploy the extension on a publicly accessible code‑server instance of VS Code.
    2. Modify the settings (for example, in settings.json) to include a specially crafted payload in the “background.editor” configuration—such as in the “images” array—to break out of the expected context and inject JavaScript code.
    3. Trigger the extension’s patch process (this may require restarting VS Code or invoking the quick command that re‑injects the background code).
    4. Observe whether the malicious payload is injected into the JS file and—upon re‑load—executes (e.g., via an alert, network request, or other observable side effect).
    5. Verify that the payload runs in the context of the VS Code process, confirming arbitrary code execution.

#### 3. CSS Injection via Custom Background Styles

- **Vulnerability Name:** CSS Injection via Custom Background Styles
- **Description**:
    1. An attacker crafts malicious CSS code.
    2. The attacker convinces a victim user to add this malicious CSS code into the `style` or `styles` settings within the `background.editor`, `background.fullscreen`, `background.sidebar`, or `background.panel` configurations in their VS Code `settings.json`. This could be achieved by sharing a malicious settings file or by socially engineering the user to manually input the malicious CSS.
    3. The vscode-background extension applies this user-provided CSS directly to the background image elements in the VS Code UI without proper sanitization or validation.
    4. The injected CSS manipulates the VS Code UI, potentially leading to UI redressing (clickjacking), information disclosure, or in the worst case, client-side code execution if VS Code's rendering engine has vulnerabilities exploitable through CSS.
- **Impact**: High. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    - Perform UI redressing or clickjacking attacks, tricking users into unintended actions.
    - Disclose sensitive information by manipulating the UI to reveal data or by exfiltrating data using CSS injection techniques.
    - Potentially achieve client-side code execution if vulnerabilities exist in VS Code's rendering engine that can be triggered via crafted CSS.
- **Vulnerability Rank**: High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations**: None. Based on the provided documentation, there is no indication of any input validation or sanitization being performed on the user-provided CSS styles before applying them to the VS Code UI.
- **Missing Mitigations**:
    - **Input Validation and Sanitization**: Implement robust input validation and sanitization for all CSS style properties and values provided by users in the extension's settings. This should include:
        -  Limiting allowed CSS properties to a safe subset necessary for background styling.
        -  Sanitizing CSS values to prevent injection of arbitrary code or malicious CSS constructs (e.g., `javascript:` URLs, expressions, etc.).
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Implement a strict Content Security Policy for the background image elements to restrict the capabilities of any injected CSS. This could include directives to:
        -  Disallow inline styles (`unsafe-inline`).
        -  Restrict the sources from which stylesheets can be loaded (`style-src`).
    - **Principle of Least Privilege**: Re-evaluate the necessity of directly injecting user-provided CSS into the core VS Code UI. Explore alternative, safer methods for customizing background styles that minimize the risk of injection vulnerabilities. If direct CSS injection is unavoidable, ensure it is done in the most secure way possible with all necessary sanitization and security headers in place.
- **Preconditions**:
    - The victim user must have the vscode-background extension installed and enabled.
    - The attacker needs to be able to influence the victim user's VS Code settings, either by:
        -  Social engineering the user into manually adding malicious CSS to their `settings.json`.
        -  Tricking the user into importing a malicious configuration file that includes the malicious CSS.
- **Source Code Analysis**:
    - The provided files do not include the extension's source code. Therefore, a direct code analysis to pinpoint the vulnerable code is not possible with the given information.
    - However, based on the documentation, specifically the README files in different languages, it is clear that the extension allows users to define custom CSS styles for background images through the `style` and `styles` settings.
    - The documentation explicitly refers to MDN CSS references, suggesting that the extension intends to apply these user-provided CSS styles directly as CSS properties to the background elements.
    - In the absence of any documented or implemented sanitization or validation mechanisms, it is highly probable that the extension directly injects these user-provided CSS styles into the VS Code UI, making it vulnerable to CSS injection attacks.
- **Security Test Case**:
    1. **Setup**: Install the vscode-background extension in VS Code.
    2. **Configuration**: Open VS Code settings (`settings.json`) and add the following configuration block to the JSON file:
    ```json
    {
        "background.editor": {
            "useFront": true,
            "style": {
                "background-image": "url('https://via.placeholder.com/150/000000/FFFFFF?text=ClickMe')",
                "background-size": "cover",
                "opacity": 0.9,
                "pointer-events": "auto !important", /* Make background interactive */
                "z-index": 9999999,                  /* Ensure overlay on top */
                "width": "100vw",
                "height": "100vh",
                "position": "fixed",
                "top": 0,
                "left": 0,
                "cursor": "pointer",
                "content": 'Fake Login!',          /* Example of UI manipulation */
                "display": "flex",
                "justify-content": "center",
                "align-items": "center",
                "font-size": "2em",
                "color": "red",                     /* Make text prominent */
                "background-color": "rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)" /* Semi-transparent background */
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    3. **Execution**: Save the `settings.json` file. VS Code will apply the new settings.
    4. **Verification**: Observe that the background image now overlays the editor content, is interactive (cursor changes on hover), and displays "Fake Login!" prominently. This demonstrates successful CSS injection, allowing for UI manipulation. A more sophisticated attacker could use this to create a fake login prompt, overlay legitimate UI elements, or perform other malicious actions.
    5. **Further Exploitation (Optional)**:  Experiment with more advanced CSS injection techniques to attempt information extraction or trigger potential vulnerabilities in VS Code's rendering engine. For example, try to use CSS selectors to read text content from the editor or other parts of the UI.
