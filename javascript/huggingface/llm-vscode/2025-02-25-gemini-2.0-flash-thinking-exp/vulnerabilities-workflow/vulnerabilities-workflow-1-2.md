- **Vulnerability Name:** Lack of Integrity Verification for External Binary Artifacts in CI/CD Pipeline
  **Description:**
  The release workflow (in `.github/workflows/release.yml`) downloads the `llm-ls` binary artifact from the upstream repository using the third‐party action `robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10` without performing any integrity verification. The process is as follows:
  1. The workflow pulls a gzipped binary file (named `llm-ls-${{ matrix.target }}.gz`) from the upstream repository “huggingface/llm-ls” for a fixed version (using the environment variable `LLM_LS_VERSION`).
  2. It immediately unzips the file with a `gunzip -c` command and sets executable permissions.
  3. The binary is then packaged into the VSCode extension using `npx vsce package` and eventually published via the associated publish steps.
  An attacker who can compromise or substitute the upstream release artifact could replace the expected binary with a malicious one. Since there is no cryptographic checksum or digital signature verification, the build process will happily package and publish the tampered binary.

  **Impact:**
  If exploited, the attacker could cause the VSCode extension to include a malicious binary. Once end users install or update the extension, this could lead to remote code execution on their machines, potential data exfiltration, or full system compromise under the permissions of the affected user.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The workflow pins the binary download to a fixed version using `LLM_LS_VERSION`.
  - The download action is version-pinned (using `robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10`) to limit unexpected changes.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no integrity check (e.g. checksum or digital signature verification) for the downloaded binary artifact.
  - No mechanism exists to verify that the binary has not been tampered with before it’s unzipped, made executable, and packaged.
  - There is also no integration with a trusted dependency system to audit and verify the authenticity of external artifacts.

  **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to compromise the upstream release artifact (for example, by exploiting a weakness in the upstream repository or intercepting the artifact download).
  - The CI/CD runner must pull in the tampered asset during an automated build triggered on a branch matching `release/**`.

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `release.yml`, the step
    ```
    - uses: robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10
      with:
        repository: "huggingface/llm-ls"
        tag: ${{ env.LLM_LS_VERSION }}
        fileName: "llm-ls-${{ matrix.target }}.gz"
    ```
    downloads the binary artifact with no subsequent validation.
  - Immediately after, the workflow unzips the file using commands such as:
    ```
    run: mkdir server && gunzip -c llm-ls-${{ matrix.target }}.gz  > server/llm-ls && chmod +x server/llm-ls
    ```
    and then packages it with `npx vsce package`.
  - Throughout these steps there is no cryptographic check or signature verification to ensure the binary is authentic and unmodified.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a controlled testing environment (or a staging branch), modify the release workflow so that the download step pulls a deliberately altered (but benign for testing) gzipped file instead of the genuine binary.
  2. Trigger the workflow by pushing a commit to a branch matching `release/**`.
  3. Observe that the workflow downloads and unzips the provided gz file without failing any integrity checks.
  4. Verify that the resulting packaged VSIX file contains the altered (maliciously substituted) binary.
  5. Conclude that because no integrity verification is in place, the build process is susceptible to binary substitution attacks.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Use of Third-Party GitHub Actions in CI/CD Pipeline
  **Description:**
  The project’s CI/CD pipeline (primarily in `.github/workflows/release.yml`) relies on multiple third-party GitHub Actions to perform key steps such as checking out the repository, setting up Node.js, downloading external artifacts, and uploading build artifacts. For example, actions such as `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4`, and especially `robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10` are used. Although version tags (like `v1.10` or `v4`) are specified, these tags are not pinned to a specific commit hash. This means that if any of these external actions are compromised or if a malicious update is pushed to the tagged version, the compromised code would automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

  **Impact:**
  A compromised GitHub Action in the pipeline could lead to several severe outcomes, including:
  - Injection of malicious code into the build process (such as downloading a tampered binary).
  - Exfiltration of CI/CD secrets or credentials (for example, the `MARKETPLACE_TOKEN` or `OPENVSX_TOKEN` used later in the workflow).
  - The publication of a malicious VSCode extension to the public, affecting all users who install the extension and potentially leading to remote code execution on their systems.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The workflows use published version tags (e.g. `@v1.10` and `@v4`) for third-party actions, which provides some control over unintended changes compared to using a “latest” tag.

  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - The project does not pin these actions to specific commit SHAs, leaving a window for an attacker to push a malicious update under the same tag.
  - There is no additional integrity verification (such as verifying checksums or digital signatures) for the actions.
  - No monitored process or additional auditing step is in place to detect if any of these actions have been altered maliciously.

  **Preconditions:**
  - An attacker must compromise or influence one of the third-party actions (for example, by exploiting vulnerabilities in the action’s repository or gaining unauthorized write access).
  - The compromised action must be used during a CI/CD run before maintainers notice and update the pinned tag to a secure version.

  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `release.yml`, several steps invoke external actions without commit-specific pinning:
    - The checkout is performed using `actions/checkout@v4`.
    - Node.js is set up via `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    - The binary artifact is downloaded using `robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10` without further verification.
  - Although the version tags are specified, relying solely on tags (which can be repointed or might be updated without notice) leaves open the possibility that a compromised version could be used.
  - There is no added code to verify or audit the downloaded outputs from these actions.

  **Security Test Case:**
  1. In a test environment, simulate a scenario where one of the third-party actions (e.g., `robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10`) is replaced with a modified version that performs an unintended action (for instance, injecting a malicious alteration in the downloaded binary).
  2. Trigger the release workflow by pushing a commit to a branch matching `release/**`.
  3. Examine the CI/CD logs and the final build artifact (the VSIX package) for signs that the modified (malicious) behavior has occurred.
  4. Confirm that the pipeline proceeds normally despite executing the compromised action.
  5. This exercise verifies that without commit-specific pinning or additional integrity checks, the pipeline is vulnerable to third-party action compromises.
