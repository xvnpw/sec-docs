### Vulnerability List

- Vulnerability Name: Insecure Tokenizer Download via URL

- Description:
    The `llm-vscode` extension allows users to configure a tokenizer by providing a URL. If a user configures the extension to download a tokenizer from a malicious URL, the extension might download and use a malicious tokenizer configuration. This could lead to unexpected behavior or potentially more serious issues if the tokenizer configuration parsing process in `llm-ls` has vulnerabilities. An attacker could host a malicious tokenizer configuration file on a server they control and trick a user into configuring the extension to download it.

- Impact:
    High. If a malicious tokenizer configuration is loaded by `llm-ls`, it could potentially lead to various issues. While the direct impact is dependent on vulnerabilities within `llm-ls` tokenizer parsing and usage, a maliciously crafted tokenizer could potentially cause unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion, or in a worst-case scenario, if vulnerabilities exist in `llm-ls`'s tokenizer handling, potentially lead to code execution within the `llm-ls` process. This compromises the security and stability of the local machine running the extension.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    None. Based on the provided documentation, there are no visible mitigations implemented in `llm-vscode` to prevent downloading tokenizer configurations from arbitrary URLs or to validate the downloaded content. The extension relies on the user to provide a valid and trusted URL.

- Missing mitigations:
    - **URL validation:** Implement validation for the provided URL to restrict allowed protocols to `https://` and potentially whitelist known safe domains for tokenizer configurations if applicable. Block `file://` URLs and other potentially dangerous protocols.
    - **Content type validation:** After downloading the file from the URL, validate the `Content-Type` header of the HTTP response to ensure that the server indicates it's serving a JSON file (`application/json`).
    - **Input sanitization and validation:** Implement robust validation of the downloaded tokenizer configuration file content. Verify that the JSON schema is as expected and that the values within the configuration are within expected ranges and formats. This should be done by `llm-ls`, but `llm-vscode` should ensure that `llm-ls` is designed to handle potentially malicious tokenizer files safely.
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Ensure that the `llm-ls` backend, which handles tokenizer loading and processing, is designed with security in mind. Ideally, tokenizer loading and processing should occur in a sandboxed or isolated environment to minimize the impact of any potential vulnerabilities in tokenizer handling. (Mitigation in `llm-ls` project, but `llm-vscode` project assumes its security).

- Preconditions:
    - The user must manually configure the `llm.tokenizer` setting in VSCode.
    - The user must choose to configure the tokenizer using the "url" option.
    - The user must be tricked or convinced to enter a malicious URL provided by the attacker.

- Source code analysis:
    1. **Configuration Reading**: `llm-vscode` reads the `llm.tokenizer` configuration from the user settings in VSCode. This configuration can specify a `url` property.
    2. **Configuration Passing to llm-ls**: `llm-vscode` then passes this tokenizer configuration to the `llm-ls` backend. The exact mechanism of passing configuration is not detailed in the provided files, but it's implied that `llm-vscode` acts as a client to `llm-ls` server and sends configuration data.
    3. **llm-ls URL Handling**: Within `llm-ls`, when it receives a tokenizer configuration with a `url`, it will attempt to download the file from the specified URL. Based on the README description: "llm-ls will attempt to download a file via an HTTP GET request".
    4. **File Download**: `llm-ls` performs an HTTP GET request to the provided URL. If the URL is under the attacker's control, the attacker can serve any file they want.
    5. **Tokenizer Loading**: `llm-ls` then attempts to load and use the downloaded file as a tokenizer configuration. If the downloaded file is not a valid tokenizer configuration or is maliciously crafted, and if `llm-ls` does not have sufficient validation and error handling, it could lead to issues.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Configures llm.tokenizer in VSCode --> llm-vscode (client) --> Sends config to llm-ls (server)
                                            |
                                            | llm.tokenizer config contains URL
                                            V
    llm-ls (server) --> HTTP GET request to URL from config --> Attacker's Malicious Server
                    <-- HTTP Response with Malicious Tokenizer File <--
                    |
                    V
    llm-ls attempts to load and use Malicious Tokenizer File --> Potential Vulnerability if no validation
    ```

- Security test case:
    1. **Attacker Setup**:
        a.  Set up a simple HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or `nginx`). Let's say the attacker's server is running at `https://malicious-attacker.example.com`.
        b.  Create a file named `malicious-tokenizer.json` with potentially malicious content. For initial testing, a simple invalid JSON or a JSON with unexpected structure for a tokenizer configuration can be used. For more advanced testing, if `llm-ls` tokenizer configuration schema is known, craft a file that exploits potential parsing vulnerabilities. For this example, let's use an invalid JSON: `{"malicious": "data"}`.
        c.  Place `malicious-tokenizer.json` in the web server's document root so it's accessible at `https://malicious-attacker.example.com/malicious-tokenizer.json`.

    2. **Victim Configuration in VSCode**:
        a.  Open VSCode with the `llm-vscode` extension installed.
        b.  Go to VSCode settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        c.  Search for `llm.tokenizer`.
        d.  In the `settings.json` file (or using the settings UI), configure the `llm.tokenizer` setting as follows:
            ```json
            "llm.tokenizer": {
              "url": "https://malicious-attacker.example.com/malicious-tokenizer.json",
              "to": "/tmp/malicious-tokenizer.json"  // Choose a writable path, can be ignored as 'to' path might be internal to llm-ls and not directly accessible.
            }
            ```
        e. Save the settings.

    3. **Trigger Extension Behavior**:
        a.  Restart VSCode or simply trigger the `llm-vscode` extension to load the new settings. This might happen automatically, or you might need to trigger a code completion request to force tokenizer loading.
        b.  Open a code file and attempt to use code completion features of the `llm-vscode` extension.

    4. **Verification**:
        a.  Observe VSCode for any errors or unexpected behavior. Check the "Output" panel in VSCode, specifically for any output related to the `llm-vscode` or `llm-ls` extension. Look for error messages related to tokenizer loading or parsing.
        b.  If the malicious tokenizer configuration is successfully loaded (even if invalid in structure), it might cause the extension to malfunction or behave erratically. The presence of errors in the output or unexpected extension behavior indicates a potential vulnerability in how the extension handles external tokenizer configurations.
        c.  For a more thorough test, monitor network traffic to confirm the download attempt to the attacker's server. If you have access to `llm-ls` logs (if any are produced and exposed), examine those for error messages related to tokenizer loading.

    5. **Expected Outcome**:
        Ideally, the extension should either:
            - Refuse to load the tokenizer configuration due to URL validation failure (if URL validation is implemented as a mitigation).
            - Detect that the downloaded file is not a valid tokenizer configuration and gracefully handle the error, preventing the extension from malfunctioning or crashing, and report an informative error to the user.
        If the extension proceeds without proper validation and malfunctions or throws unhandled exceptions after loading the malicious tokenizer configuration, it confirms the vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates how an attacker can leverage the "tokenizer from URL" feature to potentially influence the behavior of the `llm-vscode` extension by serving a malicious tokenizer configuration file.
