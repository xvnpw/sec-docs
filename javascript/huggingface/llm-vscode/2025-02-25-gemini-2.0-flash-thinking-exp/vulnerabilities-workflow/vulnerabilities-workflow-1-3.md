### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Unvalidated Custom Backend URL leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Description: The llm-vscode extension allows users to configure custom backend URLs for different Large Language Model (LLM) inference backends such as OpenAI, Ollama, and TGI. If the extension does not properly validate or sanitize these user-provided URLs before using them in HTTP requests, an attacker could potentially configure a malicious URL in the extension's settings. When the extension attempts to fetch code completions from this malicious URL, it could lead to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to make the extension send requests to internal services, external resources, or attacker-controlled endpoints that the attacker wouldn't normally have direct access to.
- Impact: High. A successful SSRF attack can lead to various security risks, including:
    - Information Disclosure: Accessing sensitive data from internal services or resources that are not intended to be publicly accessible.
    - Internal Network Scanning: Probing internal network infrastructure to discover open ports and services, potentially revealing network topology and vulnerabilities.
    - Data Exfiltration: In some scenarios, an attacker might be able to exfiltrate data from internal systems if they can be reached through the SSRF.
    - Potential Remote Code Execution: If internal services vulnerable to exploitation are reachable via SSRF, it could escalate to remote code execution on those internal systems.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations: Based on the provided README documentation, there are no explicitly mentioned mitigations against SSRF related to the backend URL configuration. The documentation describes URL construction logic, but it's unclear if this includes validation or sanitization to prevent SSRF.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the backend URL. The extension should validate that the provided URL is a valid URL, using a well-formed URL structure.
    - Implement URL sanitization to prevent unexpected characters or malicious inputs within the URL.
    - Employ a URL parsing library to correctly handle and construct URLs, ensuring proper encoding and preventing injection of malicious path components.
    - Implement a whitelist of allowed URL schemes (e.g., `http`, `https`) to restrict the protocol of the backend URL and prevent the use of potentially dangerous schemes like `file://`, `gopher://`, or others that could exacerbate SSRF risks.
- Preconditions:
    1. The user must have the llm-vscode extension installed in VSCode.
    2. The user must be able to access and modify the extension settings in VSCode.
    3. The `llm.backend` setting must be set to a backend type that supports custom URLs (e.g., `openai`, `tgi`, or `ollama` if it allows custom URLs).
    4. The attacker needs to convince a user to configure a malicious URL in the "Llm › Url" setting within the llm-vscode extension's configuration.
- Source Code Analysis:
    Based on the description in the `README.md` file, the extension constructs the endpoint URL using a `build_url(configuration)` function. The description indicates that for different backends, the extension might append specific paths to the base URL.

    ```javascript
    let endpoint;
    switch(configuration.backend) {
        // cf URL construction
        let endpoint = build_url(configuration);
    }

    const res = await fetch(endpoint, {
        body: JSON.stringify(data),
        headers,
        method: "POST"
    });
    ```

    The vulnerability likely resides within the `build_url` function if it does not properly validate or sanitize the `configuration.url` provided by the user. If `build_url` directly uses the user-provided URL without validation and then uses it in a `fetch` request, it becomes susceptible to SSRF.  Specifically, if the code doesn't check the URL scheme, or doesn't sanitize the URL to prevent injection of arbitrary hosts or paths, it could be exploited. The description mentions logic to avoid double appending paths, which suggests some URL manipulation is happening, increasing the risk of improper handling if not done securely. Without access to the source code of `build_url`, the analysis is based on the information available in the README.

- Security Test Case:
    1. Install the `llm-vscode` extension in VSCode from the VSCode Marketplace.
    2. Open VSCode settings by navigating to `Code` > `Settings` (or `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` on Windows/Linux) or using the shortcut `Cmd+,` (or `Ctrl+,`).
    3. In the settings search bar, type "Llm Backend". Locate the "Llm › Backend" setting and change its value to "openai". This enables the custom URL configuration option.
    4. Search for "Llm Url" in the settings. Locate the "Llm › Url" setting and set its value to a controlled external URL, for example, `https://webhook.site/your_unique_webhook_id`. (Replace `your_unique_webhook_id` with a unique ID generated by webhook.site).
    5. Open any code file in VSCode (e.g., a Python file).
    6. Start typing code in the editor where you would expect code completion suggestions to appear. For example, in a Python file, you could type `def hello():`.
    7. Trigger code completion explicitly if auto-suggestions are disabled (by default, suggestions might appear automatically). You can usually trigger inline suggestions with `Cmd+shift+l` as mentioned in the README, or by simply continuing to type.
    8. Check the webhook.site URL you configured (`https://webhook.site/your_unique_webhook_id`). If the extension is vulnerable to SSRF, you should observe an HTTP request from the llm-vscode extension being logged at webhook.site. This request confirms that the extension is making an outbound connection to the URL you provided in the settings.
    9. For a more targeted SSRF test, and if you are in a suitable testing environment (like a controlled cloud environment or local network), you could attempt to access internal resources. For example, if you are testing within an AWS environment, you could set the "Llm › Url" setting to `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`. Then repeat steps 5-7. If successful, the extension might be able to retrieve AWS metadata, which would be a clear indicator of SSRF. **Note: Be extremely cautious when testing with internal or metadata URLs and ensure you have proper authorization and are performing tests in a controlled environment.** For most external attacker scenarios, the webhook.site test is sufficient to demonstrate the vulnerability.
