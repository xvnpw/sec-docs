### Combined Vulnerability List

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Tokenizer Download via URL

  - **Description:**
    The `llm-vscode` extension allows users to configure a tokenizer by providing a URL. If a user configures the extension to download a tokenizer from a malicious URL, the extension might download and use a malicious tokenizer configuration. This could lead to unexpected behavior or potentially more serious issues if the tokenizer configuration parsing process in `llm-ls` has vulnerabilities. An attacker could host a malicious tokenizer configuration file on a server they control and trick a user into configuring the extension to download it.

  - **Impact:**
    High. If a malicious tokenizer configuration is loaded by `llm-ls`, it could potentially lead to various issues. While the direct impact is dependent on vulnerabilities within `llm-ls` tokenizer parsing and usage, a maliciously crafted tokenizer could potentially cause unexpected behavior, resource exhaustion, or in a worst-case scenario, if vulnerabilities exist in `llm-ls`'s tokenizer handling, potentially lead to code execution within the `llm-ls` process. This compromises the security and stability of the local machine running the extension.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** high

  - **Currently implemented mitigations:**
    None. Based on the provided documentation, there are no visible mitigations implemented in `llm-vscode` to prevent downloading tokenizer configurations from arbitrary URLs or to validate the downloaded content. The extension relies on the user to provide a valid and trusted URL.

  - **Missing mitigations:**
    - **URL validation:** Implement validation for the provided URL to restrict allowed protocols to `https://` and potentially whitelist known safe domains for tokenizer configurations if applicable. Block `file://` URLs and other potentially dangerous protocols.
    - **Content type validation:** After downloading the file from the URL, validate the `Content-Type` header of the HTTP response to ensure that the server indicates it's serving a JSON file (`application/json`).
    - **Input sanitization and validation:** Implement robust validation of the downloaded tokenizer configuration file content. Verify that the JSON schema is as expected and that the values within the configuration are within expected ranges and formats. This should be done by `llm-ls`, but `llm-vscode` should ensure that `llm-ls` is designed to handle potentially malicious tokenizer files safely.
    - **Sandboxing/Isolation:** Ensure that the `llm-ls` backend, which handles tokenizer loading and processing, is designed with security in mind. Ideally, tokenizer loading and processing should occur in a sandboxed or isolated environment to minimize the impact of any potential vulnerabilities in tokenizer handling. (Mitigation in `llm-ls` project, but `llm-vscode` project assumes its security).

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The user must manually configure the `llm.tokenizer` setting in VSCode.
    - The user must choose to configure the tokenizer using the "url" option.
    - The user must be tricked or convinced to enter a malicious URL provided by the attacker.

  - **Source code analysis:**
    1. **Configuration Reading**: `llm-vscode` reads the `llm.tokenizer` configuration from the user settings in VSCode. This configuration can specify a `url` property.
    2. **Configuration Passing to llm-ls**: `llm-vscode` then passes this tokenizer configuration to the `llm-ls` backend. The exact mechanism of passing configuration is not detailed in the provided files, but it's implied that `llm-vscode` acts as a client to `llm-ls` server and sends configuration data.
    3. **llm-ls URL Handling**: Within `llm-ls`, when it receives a tokenizer configuration with a `url`, it will attempt to download the file from the specified URL. Based on the README description: "llm-ls will attempt to download a file via an HTTP GET request".
    4. **File Download**: `llm-ls` performs an HTTP GET request to the provided URL. If the URL is under the attacker's control, the attacker can serve any file they want.
    5. **Tokenizer Loading**: `llm-ls` then attempts to load and use the downloaded file as a tokenizer configuration. If the downloaded file is not a valid tokenizer configuration or is maliciously crafted, and if `llm-ls` does not have sufficient validation and error handling, it could lead to issues.

    **Visualization:**

    ```
    User Configures llm.tokenizer in VSCode --> llm-vscode (client) --> Sends config to llm-ls (server)
                                            |
                                            | llm.tokenizer config contains URL
                                            V
    llm-ls (server) --> HTTP GET request to URL from config --> Attacker's Malicious Server
                    <-- HTTP Response with Malicious Tokenizer File <--
                    |
                    V
    llm-ls attempts to load and use Malicious Tokenizer File --> Potential Vulnerability if no validation
    ```

  - **Security test case:**
    1. **Attacker Setup**:
        a.  Set up a simple HTTP server (e.g., using Python's `http.server` or `nginx`). Let's say the attacker's server is running at `https://malicious-attacker.example.com`.
        b.  Create a file named `malicious-tokenizer.json` with potentially malicious content. For initial testing, a simple invalid JSON or a JSON with unexpected structure for a tokenizer configuration can be used. For more advanced testing, if `llm-ls` tokenizer configuration schema is known, craft a file that exploits potential parsing vulnerabilities. For this example, let's use an invalid JSON: `{"malicious": "data"}`.
        c.  Place `malicious-tokenizer.json` in the web server's document root so it's accessible at `https://malicious-attacker.example.com/malicious-tokenizer.json`.

    2. **Victim Configuration in VSCode**:
        a.  Open VSCode with the `llm-vscode` extension installed.
        b.  Go to VSCode settings (File -> Preferences -> Settings or Code -> Settings -> Settings).
        c.  Search for `llm.tokenizer`.
        d.  In the `settings.json` file (or using the settings UI), configure the `llm.tokenizer` setting as follows:
            ```json
            "llm.tokenizer": {
              "url": "https://malicious-attacker.example.com/malicious-tokenizer.json",
              "to": "/tmp/malicious-tokenizer.json"  // Choose a writable path, can be ignored as 'to' path might be internal to llm-ls and not directly accessible.
            }
            ```
        e. Save the settings.

    3. **Trigger Extension Behavior**:
        a.  Restart VSCode or simply trigger the `llm-vscode` extension to load the new settings. This might happen automatically, or you might need to trigger a code completion request to force tokenizer loading.
        b.  Open a code file and attempt to use code completion features of the `llm-vscode` extension.

    4. **Verification**:
        a.  Observe VSCode for any errors or unexpected behavior. Check the "Output" panel in VSCode, specifically for any output related to the `llm-vscode` or `llm-ls` extension. Look for error messages related to tokenizer loading or parsing.
        b.  If the malicious tokenizer configuration is successfully loaded (even if invalid in structure), it might cause the extension to malfunction or behave erratically. The presence of errors in the output or unexpected extension behavior indicates a potential vulnerability in how the extension handles external tokenizer configurations.
        c.  For a more thorough test, monitor network traffic to confirm the download attempt to the attacker's server. If you have access to `llm-ls` logs (if any are produced and exposed), examine those for error messages related to tokenizer loading.

    5. **Expected Outcome**:
        Ideally, the extension should either:
            - Refuse to load the tokenizer configuration due to URL validation failure (if URL validation is implemented as a mitigation).
            - Detect that the downloaded file is not a valid tokenizer configuration and gracefully handle the error, preventing the extension from malfunctioning or crashing, and report an informative error to the user.
        If the extension proceeds without proper validation and malfunctions or throws unhandled exceptions after loading the malicious tokenizer configuration, it confirms the vulnerability.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Lack of Integrity Verification for External Binary Artifacts in CI/CD Pipeline

  - **Description:**
  The release workflow (in `.github/workflows/release.yml`) downloads the `llm-ls` binary artifact from the upstream repository using the third‐party action `robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10` without performing any integrity verification. The process is as follows:
  1. The workflow pulls a gzipped binary file (named `llm-ls-${{ matrix.target }}.gz`) from the upstream repository “huggingface/llm-ls” for a fixed version (using the environment variable `LLM_LS_VERSION`).
  2. It immediately unzips the file with a `gunzip -c` command and sets executable permissions.
  3. The binary is then packaged into the VSCode extension using `npx vsce package` and eventually published via the associated publish steps.
  An attacker who can compromise or substitute the upstream release artifact could replace the expected binary with a malicious one. Since there is no cryptographic checksum or digital signature verification, the build process will happily package and publish the tampered binary.

  - **Impact:**
  If exploited, the attacker could cause the VSCode extension to include a malicious binary. Once end users install or update the extension, this could lead to remote code execution on their machines, potential data exfiltration, or full system compromise under the permissions of the affected user.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The workflow pins the binary download to a fixed version using `LLM_LS_VERSION`.
  - The download action is version-pinned (using `robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10`) to limit unexpected changes.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no integrity check (e.g. checksum or digital signature verification) for the downloaded binary artifact.
  - No mechanism exists to verify that the binary has not been tampered with before it’s unzipped, made executable, and packaged.
  - There is also no integration with a trusted dependency system to audit and verify the authenticity of external artifacts.

  - **Preconditions:**
  - The attacker must be able to compromise the upstream release artifact (for example, by exploiting a weakness in the upstream repository or intercepting the artifact download).
  - The CI/CD runner must pull in the tampered asset during an automated build triggered on a branch matching `release/**`.

  - **Source code analysis:**
  - In `release.yml`, the step
    ```
    - uses: robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10
      with:
        repository: "huggingface/llm-ls"
        tag: ${{ env.LLM_LS_VERSION }}
        fileName: "llm-ls-${{ matrix.target }}.gz"
    ```
    downloads the binary artifact with no subsequent validation.
  - Immediately after, the workflow unzips the file using commands such as:
    ```
    run: mkdir server && gunzip -c llm-ls-${{ matrix.target }}.gz  > server/llm-ls && chmod +x server/llm-ls
    ```
    and then packages it with `npx vsce package`.
  - Throughout these steps there is no cryptographic check or signature verification to ensure the binary is authentic and unmodified.

  - **Security test case:**
  1. In a controlled testing environment (or a staging branch), modify the release workflow so that the download step pulls a deliberately altered (but benign for testing) gzipped file instead of the genuine binary.
  2. Trigger the workflow by pushing a commit to a branch matching `release/**`.
  3. Observe that the workflow downloads and unzips the provided gz file without failing any integrity checks.
  4. Verify that the resulting packaged VSIX file contains the altered (maliciously substituted) binary.
  5. Conclude that because no integrity verification is in place, the build process is susceptible to binary substitution attacks.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Use of Third-Party GitHub Actions in CI/CD Pipeline

  - **Description:**
  The project’s CI/CD pipeline (primarily in `.github/workflows/release.yml`) relies on multiple third-party GitHub Actions to perform key steps such as checking out the repository, setting up Node.js, downloading external artifacts, and uploading build artifacts. For example, actions such as `actions/checkout@v4`, `actions/setup-node@v4`, and especially `robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10` are used. Although version tags (like `v1.10` or `v4`) are specified, these tags are not pinned to a specific commit hash. This means that if any of these external actions are compromised or if a malicious update is pushed to the tagged version, the compromised code would automatically run as part of the CI/CD pipeline.

  - **Impact:**
  A compromised GitHub Action in the pipeline could lead to several severe outcomes, including:
  - Injection of malicious code into the build process (such as downloading a tampered binary).
  - Exfiltration of CI/CD secrets or credentials (for example, the `MARKETPLACE_TOKEN` or `OPENVSX_TOKEN` used later in the workflow).
  - The publication of a malicious VSCode extension to the public, affecting all users who install the extension and potentially leading to remote code execution on their systems.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The workflows use published version tags (e.g. `@v1.10` and `@v4`) for third-party actions, which provides some control over unintended changes compared to using a “latest” tag.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
  - The project does not pin these actions to specific commit SHAs, leaving a window for an attacker to push a malicious update under the same tag.
  - There is no additional integrity verification (such as verifying checksums or digital signatures) for the actions.
  - No monitored process or additional auditing step is in place to detect if any of these actions have been altered maliciously.

  - **Preconditions:**
  - An attacker must compromise or influence one of the third-party actions (for example, by exploiting vulnerabilities in the action’s repository or gaining unauthorized write access).
  - The compromised action must be used during a CI/CD run before maintainers notice and update the pinned tag to a secure version.

  - **Source code analysis:**
  - In `release.yml`, several steps invoke external actions without commit-specific pinning:
    - The checkout is performed using `actions/checkout@v4`.
    - Node.js is set up via `actions/setup-node@v4`.
    - The binary artifact is downloaded using `robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10` without further verification.
  - Although the version tags are specified, relying solely on tags (which can be repointed or might be updated without notice) leaves open the possibility that a compromised version could be used.
  - There is no added code to verify or audit the downloaded outputs from these actions.

  - **Security test case:**
  1. In a test environment, simulate a scenario where one of the third-party actions (e.g., `robinraju/release-downloader@v1.10`) is replaced with a modified version that performs an unintended action (for instance, injecting a malicious alteration in the downloaded binary).
  2. Trigger the release workflow by pushing a commit to a branch matching `release/**`.
  3. Examine the CI/CD logs and the final build artifact (the VSIX package) for signs that the modified (malicious) behavior has occurred.
  4. Confirm that the pipeline proceeds normally despite executing the compromised action.
  5. This exercise verifies that without commit-specific pinning or additional integrity checks, the pipeline is vulnerable to third-party action compromises.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unvalidated Custom Backend URL leading to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

  - **Description:** The llm-vscode extension allows users to configure custom backend URLs for different Large Language Model (LLM) inference backends such as OpenAI, Ollama, and TGI. If the extension does not properly validate or sanitize these user-provided URLs before using them in HTTP requests, an attacker could potentially configure a malicious URL in the extension's settings. When the extension attempts to fetch code completions from this malicious URL, it could lead to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability. This could allow an attacker to make the extension send requests to internal services, external resources, or attacker-controlled endpoints that the attacker wouldn't normally have direct access to.

  - **Impact:** High. A successful SSRF attack can lead to various security risks, including:
    - Information Disclosure: Accessing sensitive data from internal services or resources that are not intended to be publicly accessible.
    - Internal Network Scanning: Probing internal network infrastructure to discover open ports and services, potentially revealing network topology and vulnerabilities.
    - Data Exfiltration: In some scenarios, an attacker might be able to exfiltrate data from internal systems if they can be reached through the SSRF.
    - Potential Remote Code Execution: If internal services vulnerable to exploitation are reachable via SSRF, it could escalate to remote code execution on those internal systems.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** Based on the provided README documentation, there are no explicitly mentioned mitigations against SSRF related to the backend URL configuration. The documentation describes URL construction logic, but it's unclear if this includes validation or sanitization to prevent SSRF.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for the backend URL. The extension should validate that the provided URL is a valid URL, using a well-formed URL structure.
    - Implement URL sanitization to prevent unexpected characters or malicious inputs within the URL.
    - Employ a URL parsing library to correctly handle and construct URLs, ensuring proper encoding and preventing injection of malicious path components.
    - Implement a whitelist of allowed URL schemes (e.g., `http`, `https`) to restrict the protocol of the backend URL and prevent the use of potentially dangerous schemes like `file://`, `gopher://`, or others that could exacerbate SSRF risks.

  - **Preconditions:**
    1. The user must have the llm-vscode extension installed in VSCode.
    2. The user must be able to access and modify the extension settings in VSCode.
    3. The `llm.backend` setting must be set to a backend type that supports custom URLs (e.g., `openai`, `tgi`, or `ollama` if it allows custom URLs).
    4. The attacker needs to convince a user to configure a malicious URL in the "Llm › Url" setting within the llm-vscode extension's configuration.

  - **Source code analysis:**
    Based on the description in the `README.md` file, the extension constructs the endpoint URL using a `build_url(configuration)` function. The description indicates that for different backends, the extension might append specific paths to the base URL.

    ```javascript
    let endpoint;
    switch(configuration.backend) {
        // cf URL construction
        let endpoint = build_url(configuration);
    }

    const res = await fetch(endpoint, {
        body: JSON.stringify(data),
        headers,
        method: "POST"
    });
    ```

    The vulnerability likely resides within the `build_url` function if it does not properly validate or sanitize the `configuration.url` provided by the user. If `build_url` directly uses the user-provided URL without validation and then uses it in a `fetch` request, it becomes susceptible to SSRF.  Specifically, if the code doesn't check the URL scheme, or doesn't sanitize the URL to prevent injection of arbitrary hosts or paths, it could be exploited. The description mentions logic to avoid double appending paths, which suggests some URL manipulation is happening, increasing the risk of improper handling if not done securely. Without access to the source code of `build_url`, the analysis is based on the information available in the README.

  - **Security test case:**
    1. Install the `llm-vscode` extension in VSCode from the VSCode Marketplace.
    2. Open VSCode settings by navigating to `Code` > `Settings` (or `File` > `Preferences` > `Settings` on Windows/Linux) or using the shortcut `Cmd+,` (or `Ctrl+,`).
    3. In the settings search bar, type "Llm Backend". Locate the "Llm › Backend" setting and change its value to "openai". This enables the custom URL configuration option.
    4. Search for "Llm Url" in the settings. Locate the "Llm › Url" setting and set its value to a controlled external URL, for example, `https://webhook.site/your_unique_webhook_id`. (Replace `your_unique_webhook_id` with a unique ID generated by webhook.site).
    5. Open any code file in VSCode (e.g., a Python file).
    6. Start typing code in the editor where you would expect code completion suggestions to appear. For example, in a Python file, you could type `def hello():`.
    7. Trigger code completion explicitly if auto-suggestions are disabled (by default, suggestions might appear automatically). You can usually trigger inline suggestions with `Cmd+shift+l` as mentioned in the README, or by simply continuing to type.
    8. Check the webhook.site URL you configured (`https://webhook.site/your_unique_webhook_id`). If the extension is vulnerable to SSRF, you should observe an HTTP request from the llm-vscode extension being logged at webhook.site. This request confirms that the extension is making an outbound connection to the URL you provided in the settings.
    9. For a more targeted SSRF test, and if you are in a suitable testing environment (like a controlled cloud environment or local network), you could attempt to access internal resources. For example, if you are testing within an AWS environment, you could set the "Llm › Url" setting to `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/`. Then repeat steps 5-7. If successful, the extension might be able to retrieve AWS metadata, which would be a clear indicator of SSRF. **Note: Be extremely cautious when testing with internal or metadata URLs and ensure you have proper authorization and are performing tests in a controlled environment.** For most external attacker scenarios, the webhook.site test is sufficient to demonstrate the vulnerability.
