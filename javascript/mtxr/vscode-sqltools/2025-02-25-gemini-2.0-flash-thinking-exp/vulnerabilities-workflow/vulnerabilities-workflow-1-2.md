After reviewing the provided vulnerabilities and applying the filtering instructions, here is the updated list in markdown format:

- **Vulnerability Name:** Weak Default Credentials in Docker Compose Test Configurations
  **Description:**
  The test docker-compose files (for MSSQL, MySQL, and PostgreSQL) include hard‐coded, weak default credentials. An external attacker who locates a publicly accessible instance using one of these configurations can use the known credentials to authenticate and gain unauthorized access to the database. For example, the MSSQL docker-compose file sets `SA_PASSWORD` to `root(!)Password`, the MySQL file sets `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD` to `root` (with additional weak values for user credentials), and the PostgreSQL file sets `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to `root`.
  **Impact:**
  Unauthorized access to the underlying databases can lead to data exfiltration, unauthorized data manipulation, or potential lateral movement within the network if the attacker can further abuse the compromised database.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - These configurations are provided solely for testing and development purposes.
  - Documentation and file locations (under `/test/docker`) are intended to signal that these files should never be deployed in production.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no enforced mechanism that prevents accidental deployment of these configurations in production environments.
  - No dynamic injection of secure, random credentials or integration with secrets management is provided.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The test docker-compose configurations must be deployed on a publicly accessible server (or with insufficient network or firewall restrictions).
  - Service ports (for example, MSSQL on port 1433, MySQL on port 3307, PostgreSQL on port 5433) are accessible externally.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `/code/test/docker/mssql/docker-compose.yml`, the environment section defines:
    • `SA_PASSWORD: root(!)Password`
  - In `/code/test/docker/mysql/docker-compose.yml`, the environment section defines:
    • `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: root`
    • `MYSQL_USER: user` and `MYSQL_PASSWORD: user`
  - In `/code/test/docker/pgsql/docker-compose.yml`, the environment section defines:
    • `POSTGRES_PASSWORD: root`
  The hard-coded and weak credentials clearly represent a security risk if these files are misused.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Deploy one of the test docker-compose files (for example, the MSSQL configuration) in an environment that is (mis)configured to be publicly accessible.
  2. From an external machine, scan for open database ports (e.g., port 1433 for MSSQL).
  3. Attempt to authenticate against the database using the known credentials (e.g., username `sa` and password `root(!)Password`).
  4. Confirm that the connection is successful and that the attacker gains access to database functions and data.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Overly Permissive File Permissions in Docker Volume Preparation Script
  **Description:**
  The preparation script for the MySQL docker test environment (`/code/test/docker/mysql/prepare.sh`) sets the permissions of the `local-mysqld` directory to 777 using the command `chmod -R 777 $SCRIPT_DIR/local-mysqld`. This allows any user on the host system to read, write, and execute files within that directory. An attacker who gains file system access—even remotely when the environment is misconfigured—could modify or replace database files or inject malicious content.
  **Impact:**
  Exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to unauthorized modifications of the database or startup scripts, potentially enabling an attacker to inject malicious code, alter data integrity, or compromise the confidentiality of data stored or processed by the database container.
  **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
  - The script is provided only for controlled testing environments and assumes that it will not be used in a production setting.
  **Missing Mitigations:**
  - There is no check or enforcement that this script is only executed in a safe, isolated environment.
  - More restrictive file permissions (or a dedicated non‐privileged user approach) should be used instead of setting permissions to 777.
  **Preconditions:**
  - The script is executed in an environment where the underlying file system (or the mounted volume) is accessible to external users (e.g., in a misconfigured CI/CD or production scenario)
  - The container’s volume mapping allows external modification of the host directory.
  **Source Code Analysis:**
  - In `/code/test/docker/mysql/prepare.sh`, the following command appears:
    • `chmod -R 777 $SCRIPT_DIR/local-mysqld`
  This command grants full permissions on the directory used as a volume for the MySQL container, effectively removing any file system access restrictions.
  **Security Test Case:**
  1. Set up the MySQL test environment using the provided docker-compose and run the `prepare.sh` script in an environment that also simulates external file system access.
  2. As an external attacker (or in a simulated attack scenario), attempt to modify files within the `local-mysqld` directory (for example, by replacing or altering a file that the MySQL container uses during startup).
  3. Observe that the file modifications succeed due to the permissive 777 settings and verify that these changes affect the behavior of the running MySQL container (such as executing an injected script).
