- **Vulnerability Name:** Potential SQL Injection via User-Provided Query Input in Driver Extensions

- **Description:**
    1. An attacker could potentially craft a malicious SQL query.
    2. The attacker uses the SQLTools extension to connect to a database using a vulnerable driver extension (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL).
    3. The attacker executes the malicious SQL query through the SQLTools extension's query runner feature.
    4. If the driver extension does not properly sanitize or parameterize user-provided query input before sending it to the database, the malicious SQL query could be executed directly against the database.
    5. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion depending on the database permissions and the nature of the SQL injection vulnerability.

- **Impact:**
    - **High:** Successful SQL injection can lead to significant data breaches, including unauthorized access to sensitive information, data modification, data deletion, and potentially even complete database takeover depending on the database system and user privileges.

- **Vulnerability Rank:** High

- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - **Unknown from provided files:** The provided files are mostly READMEs and configuration files. There is no source code available in these files to analyze the query execution and sanitization logic within the driver extensions. It is unknown if input sanitization or parameterized queries are consistently and correctly implemented across all driver extensions.

- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - **Input Sanitization and Parameterized Queries in Driver Extensions:** Each driver extension (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, SQLite, and community drivers) should implement robust input sanitization and use parameterized queries (or prepared statements) when handling user-provided query input. This is crucial to prevent SQL injection vulnerabilities.
    - **Security Audits of Driver Extensions:** Regular security audits and code reviews of all driver extensions, especially those contributed by the community, are necessary to identify and remediate potential SQL injection and other vulnerabilities.
    - **Principle of Least Privilege:** Encourage users to configure database connections with the principle of least privilege, limiting the database user's permissions to only what is necessary for their tasks. This can reduce the impact of a successful SQL injection attack.

- **Preconditions:**
    1. The attacker must have access to a publicly available instance of VS Code using the SQLTools extension and a vulnerable driver extension.
    2. The attacker needs to be able to establish a connection to a database through SQLTools using a vulnerable driver.
    3. The attacker needs to be able to execute SQL queries through the SQLTools query runner.
    4. A vulnerable driver extension must be in use that does not properly sanitize or parameterize user-provided query input.

- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - **Not possible with provided files:** The provided files do not contain the source code for the driver extensions or the core extension logic that handles query execution. To analyze the source code for SQL injection vulnerabilities, access to the driver extension code (e.g., packages/driver.mysql/, packages/driver.pg/) and the core extension code would be required.
    - **Hypothetical Vulnerable Code Example (Illustrative):**
        If a driver extension constructs a SQL query by directly concatenating user input without sanitization or parameterization, it would be vulnerable. For example, in a hypothetical driver extension code:

        ```javascript
        // Vulnerable code - DO NOT USE
        async executeQuery(queryText) {
            const sqlQuery = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '${queryText}'`; // Directly embedding user input
            const results = await this.dbConnection.query(sqlQuery);
            return results;
        }
        ```
        In this vulnerable example, if `queryText` is user-controlled and contains malicious SQL, it will be directly embedded into the SQL query, leading to SQL injection.

- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:**
        - Install VS Code and the SQLTools extension.
        - Install a driver extension (e.g., MySQL driver).
        - Set up a test database instance (e.g., MySQL) with a table named 'users' containing columns like 'username' and 'password'. Populate it with some test data.
        - Configure a connection in SQLTools to connect to the test database.
    2. **Exploit Attempt:**
        - Open a new SQL file in VS Code and connect to the configured database connection using SQLTools.
        - In the SQL editor, attempt to execute the following malicious SQL query designed to bypass authentication or extract data (example for MySQL, may vary for other databases):
            ```sql
            ' OR '1'='1'; --
            ```
            or
            ```sql
            '; DROP TABLE users; --
            ```
            or
            ```sql
            ' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = 'admin'; --
            ```
        - Execute the crafted query using SQLTools's "Run Query" feature.
    3. **Verification:**
        - Examine the query results.
        - If the query ` ' OR '1'='1'; -- ` successfully returns all rows from the 'users' table (or behaves unexpectedly), it indicates a potential SQL injection vulnerability.
        - If the query `'; DROP TABLE users; --` results in the 'users' table being dropped, it confirms a critical SQL injection vulnerability.
        - If the `UNION SELECT` query successfully extracts data like usernames and passwords, it also confirms SQL injection and data leakage.
    4. **Expected Outcome (Vulnerable Case):**
        - The malicious SQL query executes successfully, demonstrating SQL injection.
    5. **Expected Outcome (Mitigated Case):**
        - The malicious SQL query is either prevented from executing or does not have the intended malicious effect due to proper input sanitization or parameterized query usage in the driver extension. The query should fail or return expected (safe) results.
