## Vulnerability List

Based on the provided project files, no high-rank vulnerabilities meeting the specified criteria were identified.

The initial analysis indicated that no high-rank vulnerabilities were found within the project files themselves, which primarily consist of documentation and configurations.

After applying the filtering criteria to exclude:

- Vulnerabilities caused by developers explicitly using insecure code patterns.
- Vulnerabilities that are only missing documentation.
- Denial of service vulnerabilities.

And to include only vulnerabilities that:

- Are valid and not already mitigated.
- Have a vulnerability rank of at least "high".

No vulnerabilities from the initial list satisfy all these conditions.

Therefore, there are currently no high-rank vulnerabilities to report according to the specified instructions and the provided analysis.

If a list of vulnerabilities was initially provided and contained entries meeting the inclusion criteria after filtering, they would be listed below in the requested markdown format with their descriptions.
