Based on the provided vulnerability lists, which all indicate "No vulnerabilities found", the combined list of vulnerabilities is as follows:

## Vulnerability List

Based on the analysis of the provided project information, no vulnerabilities were identified.

- **No Vulnerabilities Found**

  **Description:** No security vulnerabilities were identified in the analyzed project. This conclusion is based on the nature of the project, which is a VS Code extension providing JavaScript code snippets. The extension's functionality is limited to inserting pre-defined code templates and does not involve processing external input, executing complex logic, or interacting with external systems in a way that could introduce vulnerabilities.

  **Impact:**  As no vulnerabilities were identified, there is no impact to report. The project, in its current state, does not pose any security risks.

  **Vulnerability Rank:** Not Applicable. Since no vulnerabilities were found, there is no vulnerability rank to assign.

  **Currently Implemented Mitigations:** Not Applicable. No specific mitigations are needed as no vulnerabilities have been identified within the extension itself. The nature of code snippet extensions inherently limits the scope for vulnerabilities.

  **Missing Mitigations:** Not Applicable. No missing mitigations are identified because no vulnerabilities were found in the project.

  **Preconditions:** Not Applicable. There are no preconditions to trigger any vulnerabilities because no vulnerabilities were found.

  **Source Code Analysis:** Not Applicable.  The analysis of the provided project descriptions indicates that the project consists of static code snippets.  A detailed source code analysis for vulnerabilities is not applicable as the extension's functionality is limited to providing these snippets and does not involve complex code execution or data processing that could be vulnerable.

  **Security Test Case:** Not Applicable.  Since no vulnerabilities are identified, there is no security test case to demonstrate or prove. The nature of the extension, providing static code snippets, inherently limits the attack surface and potential for vulnerabilities exploitable by an external attacker.
