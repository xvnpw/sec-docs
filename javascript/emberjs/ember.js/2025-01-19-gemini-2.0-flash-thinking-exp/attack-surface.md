# Attack Surface Analysis for emberjs/ember.js

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Template Injection](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_template_injection.md)

**Description:**  An attacker injects malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**How Ember.js Contributes:** Ember's template rendering engine can execute JavaScript if user-provided data containing HTML is directly injected into templates without proper sanitization, particularly when using the `{{unescaped}}` helper or by manually manipulating the DOM.

**Example:** A comment section where user comments are rendered using `{{unescaped this.comment}}`, and a malicious user submits a comment containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.

**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Default Escaping:** Rely on Ember's default `{{ }}` syntax for rendering dynamic content, which automatically escapes HTML.
*   **Avoid `{{unescaped}}`:**  Use the `{{unescaped}}` helper only when absolutely necessary and after careful sanitization of the data. Consider using a trusted library for sanitization.
*   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate the impact of XSS attacks.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Ember Components](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_ember_components.md)

**Description:**  Vulnerabilities within custom Ember components allow for the injection of malicious scripts.

**How Ember.js Contributes:** Components that directly render user-provided attributes or content within their templates without proper escaping can introduce XSS. This can occur when component logic manipulates the DOM directly or uses `{{@arg}}` without considering potential HTML content.

**Example:** A component accepting an `imageUrl` attribute and directly rendering it in an `<img>` tag: `<img src="{{@imageUrl}}" alt="User Image">`. If `@imageUrl` contains `"><script>alert('XSS')</script>`, it will execute.

**Impact:** Similar to template injection, leading to arbitrary JavaScript execution.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Sanitize Component Attributes:**  Sanitize component arguments, especially those derived from user input or external sources, before rendering them in the template.
*   **Secure DOM Manipulation:** When manipulating the DOM within component logic, use secure methods that prevent script injection.
*   **Template Linting:** Utilize template linters to identify potential XSS vulnerabilities in component templates.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Routing Vulnerabilities (leading to unauthorized access)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_routing_vulnerabilities__leading_to_unauthorized_access_.md)

**Description:**  Improperly configured or validated Ember routes can expose sensitive data or application states without proper authorization.

**How Ember.js Contributes:** Ember's routing system relies on developers to define and secure routes. If route parameters are used to directly fetch sensitive data without verifying if the current user has permission to access that specific resource, attackers can manipulate these parameters to gain unauthorized access.

**Example:** A route defined as `/admin/users/:userId/sensitive-data` where `userId` is directly used to fetch sensitive user data without verifying if the current user has admin privileges.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, potential information disclosure, or manipulation of critical application state.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Authorization in Route Handlers:** Implement robust authorization checks within route `model` hooks or `beforeModel` hooks to ensure users have the necessary permissions to access the requested resources.
*   **Avoid Exposing Sensitive IDs:**  Consider using UUIDs or other non-sequential, harder-to-guess identifiers instead of easily guessable sequential IDs in route parameters, especially for sensitive resources.
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design routes and data access patterns based on the principle of least privilege, granting only the necessary access to users.
