# Threat Model Analysis for emberjs/ember.js

## Threat: [Server-Side Template Injection](./threats/server-side_template_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into server-rendered HTML by providing unescaped user input that is directly embedded into Ember.js templates during server-side rendering. This allows them to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser when the page loads.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement.

**Affected Component:** Handlebars Templates (used in Ember.js), specifically during server-side rendering.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Always escape user-provided data before rendering it in server-side templates.
* Utilize Ember.js's built-in escaping mechanisms.
* Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful XSS attacks.

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection via Unsafe Helpers/Components](./threats/client-side_template_injection_via_unsafe_helperscomponents.md)

**Description:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts if developers use custom Handlebars helpers or Ember.js components that bypass Ember's default escaping and directly render user-controlled data as HTML. The attacker provides crafted input that, when rendered, executes arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, and defacement.

**Affected Component:** Handlebars Helpers, Ember.js Components.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid using mechanisms that bypass Ember's default escaping unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution.
* Thoroughly sanitize and validate user input before rendering it in custom helpers or components.
* Regularly audit custom helpers and components for potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Route Transition Authorization Bypass](./threats/route_transition_authorization_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker might attempt to bypass authorization checks implemented in route transition hooks (e.g., `beforeModel`, `model`) if these checks are flawed or incomplete. This could allow unauthorized access to sensitive parts of the application.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features and data.

**Affected Component:** Ember.js Router, specifically route transition hooks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication and authorization checks within route transition hooks.
* Ensure all necessary routes are protected by appropriate authorization logic.
* Regularly review and test route authorization logic.
