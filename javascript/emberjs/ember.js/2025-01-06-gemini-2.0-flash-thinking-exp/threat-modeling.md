# Threat Model Analysis for emberjs/ember.js

## Threat: [Client-Side Template Injection leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/client-side_template_injection_leading_to_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is then rendered by Handlebars templates without proper sanitization. This script executes in the victim's browser when the page is rendered. The attacker might achieve this by exploiting vulnerabilities in data handling from backend APIs or by manipulating URL parameters that are then used in templates.
    *   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, stealing sensitive information (including cookies and local storage), redirecting the user to malicious websites, or defacing the application.
    *   **Affected Ember.js Component:** `@ember/template` (Handlebars templating engine)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always sanitize user-provided data before rendering it in templates. Ember's default escaping helps, but be cautious with `{{{unescaped}}}` and `SafeString`. Avoid using them with user-controlled data.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources, mitigating the impact of successful XSS.
        *   Regularly review templates for potential injection points, especially when dealing with data from external sources or user input.
        *   Employ static analysis tools to identify potential template injection vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Ember Addons (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_ember_addons__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker leverages known vulnerabilities in third-party Ember addons used by the application. This could involve exploiting publicly disclosed vulnerabilities or vulnerabilities introduced by malicious actors who have compromised the addon. The attacker might gain control of the application's functionality or data.
    *   **Impact:**  Depending on the vulnerability, the impact can range from information disclosure and data breaches to complete application compromise. Attackers could gain unauthorized access, modify data, or disrupt application functionality.
    *   **Affected Ember.js Component:**  `@ember/component` (if the vulnerability is in a component addon), `@ember/service` (if in a service addon), `@ember/routing` (if in a routing-related addon), or any other addon component. This directly involves Ember as addons extend its core functionality.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and select Ember addons from trusted sources with active maintenance and a good security track record.
        *   Regularly update your addon dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address security vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
        *   Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track your dependencies and their known vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using dependency scanning tools in your CI/CD pipeline to automatically detect vulnerable addons.
        *   Be cautious about using addons with a large number of unresolved security issues or those that are no longer actively maintained.

## Threat: [Client-Side Routing Bypass due to Insecure Route Guards](./threats/client-side_routing_bypass_due_to_insecure_route_guards.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker manipulates the application's routing logic to bypass authentication or authorization checks implemented in route guards (e.g., `beforeModel`, `beforeEnter`). This could involve directly navigating to protected routes or manipulating route parameters in a way that circumvents the intended security measures.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to protected parts of the application or specific functionalities. Attackers could view sensitive data, perform actions they are not authorized to, or manipulate application state.
    *   **Affected Ember.js Component:** `@ember/routing` (Router, Route definitions, Route lifecycle hooks)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization checks within your route guards. Ensure that all protected routes have appropriate checks.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side checks for security. Implement server-side validation and authorization as well.
        *   Thoroughly test your routing logic to ensure that all access controls are enforced correctly and cannot be easily bypassed.
        *   Use Ember's built-in features for route protection and authentication, such as services to manage authentication state.
