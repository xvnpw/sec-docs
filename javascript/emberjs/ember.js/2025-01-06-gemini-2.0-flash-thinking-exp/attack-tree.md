## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Ember.js Application [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_ember_js_application__critical_node_.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and encompasses all successful exploitation paths.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Template Rendering Vulnerabilities (XSS) [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_rendering_vulnerabilities__xss___critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via User-Controlled Data [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_user-controlled_data__high-risk_path_.md)

**Directly Inject HTML/JavaScript into Templates (using `{{{unescaped}}}` or similar):
        * Attackers can inject `<script>` tags or other malicious HTML if developers use triple curly braces or similar mechanisms to render user-provided data without sanitization.
    * **Indirectly Inject via Data Attributes or Model Properties rendered unsafely:**
        * Attackers can inject malicious code into data attributes or model properties that are subsequently rendered into the template in a way that allows script execution (e.g., within event handlers).

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Inject HTML/JavaScript into Templates (using `{{{unescaped}}}` or similar) [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/directly_inject_htmljavascript_into_templates__using__{{{unescaped}}}__or_similar___high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Indirectly Inject via Data Attributes or Model Properties rendered unsafely [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/indirectly_inject_via_data_attributes_or_model_properties_rendered_unsafely__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Abuse Routing Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/abuse_routing_mechanisms.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate URL Parameters for Unauthorized Access [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_url_parameters_for_unauthorized_access__high-risk_path_.md)

**Goal:** Gain unauthorized access to restricted parts of the application.
* **Attack Vector: Access Routes Without Proper Authentication/Authorization Checks:**
    * Attackers can directly navigate to restricted routes by manipulating URL parameters if the application relies solely on client-side checks or has insufficient server-side authorization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Routes Without Proper Authentication/Authorization Checks [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/access_routes_without_proper_authenticationauthorization_checks__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Data Layer (Ember Data)](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_data_layer__ember_data_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Data into Models [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_data_into_models__high-risk_path_.md)

**Goal:** Compromise data integrity or application logic.
* **Attack Vector: Persist Malicious Data to Backend due to Insufficient Client-Side Validation:**
    * Attackers can bypass client-side validation and send malicious data to the server, which gets persisted to the database if server-side validation is lacking.

## Attack Tree Path: [Persist Malicious Data to Backend due to Insufficient Client-Side Validation [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/persist_malicious_data_to_backend_due_to_insufficient_client-side_validation__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_component_vulnerabilities.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Component Attributes [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_component_attributes__high-risk_path_.md)

**Goal:** Execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the component's context.
* **Attack Vectors:**
    * **Directly Inject HTML/JavaScript into Component Templates:**
        * Similar to general template vulnerabilities, if component templates render attribute values without proper sanitization, XSS attacks are possible within the component.
    * **Inject via Bindings to Vulnerable Properties:**
        * If component properties that are bound to the template are not properly sanitized, attackers can inject malicious code through these bindings.

## Attack Tree Path: [Directly Inject HTML/JavaScript into Component Templates [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/directly_inject_htmljavascript_into_component_templates__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Inject via Bindings to Vulnerable Properties [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/inject_via_bindings_to_vulnerable_properties__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage Vulnerabilities in Ember Addons [CRITICAL NODE]](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_vulnerabilities_in_ember_addons__critical_node_.md)

**Goal:** Compromise the application by exploiting third-party addon vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Used Addons [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerabilities_in_used_addons__high-risk_path_.md)

**Utilize Publicly Disclosed CVEs:**
        * Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the specific versions of Ember addons used by the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Utilize Publicly Disclosed CVEs [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/utilize_publicly_disclosed_cves__high-risk_path_.md)



## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Undisclosed Vulnerabilities in Addons [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_undisclosed_vulnerabilities_in_addons__high-risk_path_.md)

**Supply Chain Attack by Compromising Addon Dependencies:**
        * Attackers can compromise the dependencies of an addon, injecting malicious code that gets included in the application's build.
