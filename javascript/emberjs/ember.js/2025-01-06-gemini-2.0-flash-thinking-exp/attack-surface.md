# Attack Surface Analysis for emberjs/ember.js

## Attack Surface: [Handlebars Template Injection (Client-Side XSS)](./attack_surfaces/handlebars_template_injection__client-side_xss_.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the application's data, which are then rendered into the HTML without proper escaping by Handlebars, leading to execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser.
*   **How Ember.js Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Ember.js uses Handlebars for templating. If developers use the triple curly braces `{{{unescaped}}}` incorrectly or fail to sanitize user-provided data before rendering it with the default `{{expression}}` syntax, it can lead to XSS.
*   **Example:** A comment section where user input is directly rendered using `{{{comment.text}}}`. An attacker could submit a comment like `<img src="x" onerror="alert('XSS')">`.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of malicious scripts can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and other client-side attacks.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Rely on Default Escaping:**  Use the default `{{expression}}` syntax for rendering dynamic data, which automatically escapes HTML entities.
        *   **Explicitly Sanitize Unsafe HTML:** If unescaped rendering is absolutely necessary, use a trusted library (like DOMPurify) to sanitize the HTML on the client-side before rendering.
        *   **Avoid `{{{unescaped}}}`:**  Minimize the use of triple curly braces and carefully review any instances where they are used.
        *   **Context-Aware Output Encoding:**  Understand the context where data is being rendered and apply appropriate encoding (e.g., URL encoding for URLs).

## Attack Surface: [Route Parameter Manipulation leading to Unauthorized Access or Actions](./attack_surfaces/route_parameter_manipulation_leading_to_unauthorized_access_or_actions.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers manipulate URL route parameters to access resources or trigger actions they are not authorized to perform.
*   **How Ember.js Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Ember.js's routing mechanism maps URLs to application states and actions. If the application relies solely on client-side route parameters for authorization without server-side validation, it's vulnerable.
*   **Example:** An application with a route like `/users/:userId/profile`. An attacker could try to access `/users/admin/profile` hoping to bypass client-side checks and view admin information.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification of data belonging to other users, or execution of privileged actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Server-Side Authorization:** Always perform authorization checks on the server-side based on authenticated user roles and permissions, not just client-side route parameters.
        *   **Parameter Validation:** Validate route parameters on both the client-side (for better user experience) and, critically, on the server-side to ensure they are within expected ranges and formats.

## Attack Surface: [Component Property Injection with Malicious Data](./attack_surfaces/component_property_injection_with_malicious_data.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers provide malicious data as input to component properties, which can then be used to exploit vulnerabilities within the component's logic or cause unexpected behavior.
*   **How Ember.js Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Ember.js components communicate through properties. If a component doesn't properly validate or sanitize the data it receives through its properties, it can be vulnerable.
*   **Example:** A component that renders user-provided HTML passed through a property without sanitization. A parent component might pass `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` as a property value.
*   **Impact:**  Client-side XSS, unexpected application behavior, or denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Input Validation:**  Implement robust validation for all component properties to ensure they conform to expected types and formats.
        *   **Data Sanitization:** Sanitize any data received through properties that will be rendered as HTML.
        *   **Type Checking:** Utilize Ember's or TypeScript's type checking features to enforce data types for component properties.

## Attack Surface: [Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Ember Addons](./attack_surfaces/vulnerabilities_in_third-party_ember_addons.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers exploit security flaws in third-party Ember addons used by the application.
*   **How Ember.js Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Ember.js's addon ecosystem allows developers to extend functionality. However, relying on external code introduces the risk of vulnerabilities present in those addons.
*   **Example:** An addon used for handling file uploads contains a vulnerability that allows an attacker to upload malicious files to the server.
*   **Impact:**  Wide range of impacts depending on the vulnerability, including XSS, remote code execution, data breaches, and denial of service.
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   **Careful Selection of Addons:**  Thoroughly vet addons before using them. Consider their popularity, maintainership, security audit history (if available), and reported vulnerabilities.
        *   **Regularly Update Addons:** Keep all addons updated to their latest versions to patch known security vulnerabilities.
        *   **Security Audits:**  Conduct regular security audits of the application, including the dependencies introduced by addons.
        *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to identify known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
