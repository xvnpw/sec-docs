## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Ember Data [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_ember_data__high_risk_.md)

*   **1.1 XSS via Ember Data (CRITICAL NODE, *)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into data handled by Ember Data. This typically occurs when data received from the backend is not properly sanitized *before* being loaded into Ember Data models and subsequently rendered in templates. Ember's built-in sanitization is helpful but insufficient without robust backend sanitization.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (High if backend sanitization is weak/absent)
    *   **Impact:** High (Data exfiltration, session hijacking, defacement, potential for further attacks)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Finding an injection point may be easy; crafting a successful, persistent payload might require more effort)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of XSS vulnerabilities and how Ember Data handles data)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (CSP violations might be logged; unusual network activity could indicate an attack; subtle XSS can be hard to detect without careful monitoring)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Backend Sanitization:** *Crucially*, sanitize all data on the backend before sending it to the Ember application. This is the primary defense.
        *   **Input Validation:** Validate data types and formats on both the backend and within Ember Data models.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to limit the sources from which scripts can be executed.
        *   **Review Adapter Customizations:** Carefully review any custom Ember Data adapters for potential sanitization bypasses.
        *   **Minimize `htmlSafe`:** Avoid using `htmlSafe` and triple curlies (`{{{ }}}`) in templates unless absolutely necessary and with thoroughly vetted data. Prefer double curlies (`{{ }}`).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Manipulate Ember Routing [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__manipulate_ember_routing__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Route Hijacking (Force Unauthorized Route) (CRITICAL NODE, *)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers manipulate the URL or use JavaScript to force the application into a route the user shouldn't have access to. This bypasses authentication or authorization checks if those checks are not properly implemented within the route's lifecycle hooks (`beforeModel`, `model`, `afterModel`) and on the server.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (High if authorization is weak or only implemented on the UI)
    *   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to data and functionality; potential for data exfiltration or modification)
    *   **Effort:** Low (Often as simple as changing the URL in the browser)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (Requires basic understanding of web applications and URLs)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Failed authorization attempts might be logged; requires monitoring user activity and server-side validation of all requests)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Route-Level Authorization:** Implement robust authorization checks *within* each route's lifecycle hooks, especially `beforeModel`.
        *   **Server-Side Validation:** *Always* validate on the server that the user is authorized to access the data and perform actions associated with a particular route. Client-side checks are insufficient.
        *   **Secure `transitionTo` Usage:** When programmatically transitioning routes, ensure the target route and parameters are validated and come from a trusted source.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Compromise Ember Components [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/3__compromise_ember_components__high_risk_.md)

*   **3.1 XSS in Component (e.g., Handlebars) (CRITICAL NODE, *)**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into data rendered by Ember components. This occurs when a component renders user-provided or otherwise untrusted data without proper sanitization.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium (High if components don't sanitize user input)
    *   **Impact:** High (Data exfiltration, session hijacking, defacement, potential for further attacks)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Finding an injection point might be easy; crafting a successful payload could require more effort)
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate (Requires understanding of XSS and how Ember components render data)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (CSP violations might be logged; unusual network activity could be a sign; subtle XSS can be hard to detect)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Sanitize User Input:** *Always* sanitize user-provided data before rendering it in component templates. Use Ember's built-in sanitization (double curlies `{{ }}`) for most cases.
        *   **Avoid `htmlSafe`:** Minimize the use of `htmlSafe` and triple curlies (`{{{ }}}`). If necessary, ensure the data is *absolutely* safe and comes from a trusted source.
        *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strong CSP is a crucial defense against XSS.
        *   **Component Audits:** Regularly audit components for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
