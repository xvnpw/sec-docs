# Deep Analysis: Ember.js Route Hijacking (Attack Tree Path 2.1)

## 1. Define Objective

**Objective:** To thoroughly analyze the "Route Hijacking (Force Unauthorized Route)" attack vector in an Ember.js application, identify specific vulnerabilities, assess the risk, and propose concrete, actionable mitigation strategies beyond the high-level descriptions in the original attack tree.  This analysis aims to provide developers with a practical understanding of how to prevent this attack.

## 2. Scope

This analysis focuses specifically on:

*   **Ember.js Applications:**  The analysis is tailored to the Ember.js framework and its routing mechanisms.
*   **Route Hijacking:**  We are exclusively examining the scenario where an attacker forces the application into an unauthorized route.
*   **Client-Side and Server-Side Interactions:**  The analysis considers both client-side manipulations and the crucial role of server-side validation.
*   **Ember.js Routing Lifecycle Hooks:**  We will delve into the specific use of `beforeModel`, `model`, `afterModel`, and other relevant hooks.
*   **`transitionTo` and `replaceWith`:** We will analyze the secure usage of these methods.

This analysis *does not* cover:

*   Other forms of Ember.js application attacks (e.g., XSS, CSRF) except where they directly relate to route hijacking.
*   General web security principles that are not specific to Ember.js routing.

## 3. Methodology

The analysis will follow these steps:

1.  **Vulnerability Identification:**  Identify specific code patterns and architectural choices within an Ember.js application that could lead to route hijacking vulnerabilities.
2.  **Exploitation Scenarios:**  Describe realistic scenarios where an attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities.
3.  **Risk Assessment:**  Re-evaluate the likelihood, impact, effort, skill level, and detection difficulty based on the deeper analysis.
4.  **Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive:**  Provide detailed, code-level examples and best practices for implementing the mitigation strategies.
5.  **Testing Recommendations:** Suggest specific testing approaches to verify the effectiveness of the mitigations.

## 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path 2.1: Route Hijacking

### 4.1 Vulnerability Identification

Several common vulnerabilities can lead to route hijacking in Ember.js applications:

*   **Missing or Inadequate `beforeModel` Checks:**  The `beforeModel` hook is the *primary* location for authorization checks.  If this hook is missing, empty, or only performs superficial checks (e.g., checking a client-side flag), an attacker can easily bypass authorization.
*   **Client-Side Only Authorization:**  Relying solely on client-side checks (e.g., hiding UI elements based on a user role stored in a cookie or local storage) is fundamentally insecure.  An attacker can modify client-side data.
*   **Improper Server-Side API Design:**  If the server-side API does not independently verify user authorization for *every* request, even if the client-side route seems authorized, the attacker can directly interact with the API to access unauthorized data.
*   **Unvalidated `transitionTo` / `replaceWith` Parameters:** If the application uses `transitionTo` or `replaceWith` with user-supplied data without validation, an attacker can inject malicious route names or parameters.
*   **Dynamic Segment Misuse:** If dynamic segments in routes are not properly validated against a whitelist or expected format, an attacker might be able to inject unexpected values, potentially leading to unauthorized access or application errors.
* **Ignoring query parameters:** If query parameters are used to determine access, but are not validated, an attacker can manipulate them.

### 4.2 Exploitation Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Admin Panel Access**

*   **Vulnerability:**  An application has an `/admin` route, but the `beforeModel` hook in the `admin` route only checks for a `isAdmin` flag in the user's session (stored client-side).
*   **Exploitation:**  An attacker modifies their session data (e.g., using browser developer tools) to set `isAdmin = true`.  They then directly navigate to `/admin`, bypassing any login requirements for the admin panel.
*   **Impact:**  Full access to administrative functionality, potentially including user management, data deletion, and system configuration changes.

**Scenario 2:  Data Exfiltration via Dynamic Segment**

*   **Vulnerability:**  An application has a route `/users/:user_id/profile` where `:user_id` is a dynamic segment.  The `beforeModel` hook checks if the current user's ID matches `:user_id`.  However, the server-side API for fetching user profiles does *not* perform this check.
*   **Exploitation:**  An attacker, logged in as user 123, changes the URL to `/users/456/profile`.  The client-side check might prevent them from seeing the profile *page*, but they can still use browser developer tools or a tool like `curl` to directly call the API endpoint associated with fetching user profiles, passing `user_id=456`.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to other users' profile data.

**Scenario 3:  `transitionTo` Manipulation**

*   **Vulnerability:**  An application uses `transitionTo` based on a value retrieved from a URL parameter without validation.  For example:  `this.transitionTo(this.get('queryParams.nextRoute'))`.
*   **Exploitation:**  An attacker crafts a malicious URL: `https://example.com/app?nextRoute=admin`.  When the user clicks this link, the application transitions to the `/admin` route, potentially bypassing authentication if the `admin` route's `beforeModel` hook is weak.
*   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to the target route (`/admin` in this case).

**Scenario 4: Query Parameter Manipulation**

* **Vulnerability:** An application uses a query parameter to determine if a user can see sensitive data. For example `/reports?showAll=false`. The `beforeModel` hook checks this parameter.
* **Exploitation:** An attacker changes the URL to `/reports?showAll=true`. If the server-side API does not validate this parameter, the attacker can see all reports.
* **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data.

### 4.3 Risk Assessment (Re-evaluated)

*   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Depending on the prevalence of the vulnerabilities listed above.  Many applications have at least one of these weaknesses.)
*   **Impact:** High (Unauthorized access to data and functionality; potential for data exfiltration, modification, or system compromise.)
*   **Effort:** Low (Often as simple as changing the URL or modifying client-side data.)
*   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate (Requires basic understanding of web applications, URLs, and potentially browser developer tools.)
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires robust server-side logging of authorization failures and potentially user activity monitoring.  Client-side manipulations are difficult to detect reliably.)

### 4.4 Mitigation Strategy Deep Dive

**1. Robust Route-Level Authorization (with `beforeModel`)**

The `beforeModel` hook is the *critical* point for authorization.  It should:

*   **Always make a server-side request:**  Do *not* rely on client-side data for authorization decisions.  The `beforeModel` hook should make an asynchronous request to the server to verify the user's permissions for the requested route *and* any associated data.
*   **Handle Asynchronous Responses:**  Use Promises or async/await to handle the server's response.  If the user is *not* authorized, use `this.transitionTo('unauthorized')` or `this.replaceWith('unauthorized')` to redirect them to an appropriate error page or login page.  *Do not* proceed to the `model` hook.
*   **Validate Dynamic Segments:** If the route has dynamic segments, the server-side authorization check should include validation of these segments.  For example, if the route is `/users/:user_id/profile`, the server should verify that the current user is allowed to access the profile for `:user_id`.
* **Validate Query Parameters:** If the route has query parameters that affect authorization, the server-side authorization check should include validation of these parameters.

**Example (using async/await):**

```javascript
// app/routes/admin.js
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
import { inject as service } from '@ember/service';

export default class AdminRoute extends Route {
  @service session; // Assuming a session service for authentication
  @service store;

  async beforeModel(transition) {
    if (!this.session.isAuthenticated) {
      // Redirect to login if not authenticated
      return this.transitionTo('login');
    }

    try {
      // Make a server-side request to check admin privileges
      const isAdmin = await this.store.queryRecord('user', { filter: { id: this.session.currentUser.id, isAdmin: true } });

      if (!isAdmin) {
        // Redirect to an unauthorized page if not an admin
        return this.transitionTo('unauthorized');
      }
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle errors (e.g., network issues, server errors)
      console.error("Authorization error:", error);
      return this.transitionTo('error');
    }
  }
}
```

**2. Server-Side Validation (Always!)**

*   **Every API endpoint must independently verify authorization:**  Do not assume that because the client-side route passed a check, the user is authorized.  The server must check *every* request against the user's permissions.
*   **Use a consistent authorization mechanism:**  Implement a robust authorization library or framework on the server (e.g., role-based access control, attribute-based access control).
*   **Validate all input:**  Validate all data received from the client, including dynamic segments, query parameters, and request bodies.

**3. Secure `transitionTo` and `replaceWith` Usage**

*   **Avoid user-supplied route names:**  Never directly use user-supplied data as the route name in `transitionTo` or `replaceWith`.
*   **Validate parameters:**  If you need to pass parameters to a route, ensure they are validated and come from a trusted source.  Consider using a whitelist of allowed values.
*   **Use route names, not URLs:** Always use route names (e.g., `this.transitionTo('admin')`) instead of constructing URLs manually. This leverages Ember's routing system and reduces the risk of errors.

**Example (safe parameter passing):**

```javascript
// Instead of:
// this.transitionTo('userProfile', { queryParams: { userId: userInput } }); // UNSAFE

// Do this:
const userId = parseInt(userInput, 10); // Validate and sanitize
if (Number.isInteger(userId) && userId > 0) { // Further validation
  this.transitionTo('userProfile', { queryParams: { userId: userId } }); // SAFE
} else {
  // Handle invalid input
}
```

**4. Dynamic Segment and Query Parameter Sanitization**

*   **Whitelist allowed values:** If possible, define a whitelist of allowed values for dynamic segments and query parameters.
*   **Type checking:** Ensure that dynamic segments and query parameters have the expected data type (e.g., number, string).
*   **Regular expressions:** Use regular expressions to validate the format of dynamic segments and query parameters.

### 4.5 Testing Recommendations

*   **Unit Tests:**  Write unit tests for your route's `beforeModel` hook to verify that it correctly handles different authorization scenarios (e.g., authenticated user, unauthenticated user, authorized user, unauthorized user).
*   **Integration Tests:**  Write integration tests that simulate user interactions and verify that unauthorized users are redirected to the appropriate error pages.
*   **API Tests:**  Write API tests that directly call your server-side endpoints with different user credentials and data to verify that authorization is enforced correctly.
*   **Manual Penetration Testing:**  Perform manual penetration testing to try to bypass authorization checks by manipulating URLs, client-side data, and API requests.  Use browser developer tools to inspect network traffic and modify requests.
*   **Automated Security Scanners:** Consider using automated security scanners that can detect common web vulnerabilities, including authorization bypass issues.

## 5. Conclusion

Route hijacking is a serious vulnerability in Ember.js applications, but it can be effectively mitigated with a combination of robust client-side checks (primarily in the `beforeModel` hook) and, crucially, *mandatory* server-side validation of all requests.  By following the detailed mitigation strategies and testing recommendations outlined in this analysis, developers can significantly reduce the risk of this attack and build more secure Ember.js applications.  The key takeaway is that client-side checks are *necessary but not sufficient*; server-side validation is the ultimate defense against route hijacking.
