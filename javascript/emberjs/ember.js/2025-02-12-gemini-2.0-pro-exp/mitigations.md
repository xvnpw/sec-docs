# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for emberjs/ember.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Handling of `htmlSafe` (Ember-Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/safe_handling_of__htmlsafe___ember-specific_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Safe Handling of `htmlSafe` (Ember-Specific)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Avoid Direct Use with User Input:** Never directly pass user-supplied data or data derived from user input to Ember's `htmlSafe` function.
    2.  **Prefer Component Arguments:** Pass data to components as arguments. Ember's templating engine automatically escapes these, preventing XSS.
    3.  **Sanitize Before `htmlSafe` (If Necessary):** If `htmlSafe` is absolutely unavoidable, use a robust sanitization library like DOMPurify *before* calling `htmlSafe`.
        *   Install DOMPurify: `yarn add dompurify` or `npm install dompurify`.
        *   Import DOMPurify and `htmlSafe`:
            ```javascript
            import DOMPurify from 'dompurify';
            import { htmlSafe } from '@ember/template';
            ```
        *   Sanitize and then use `htmlSafe`:
            ```javascript
            let sanitizedHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
            this.safeHTML = htmlSafe(sanitizedHTML);
            ```
    4.  **Custom Handlebars Helpers:** For complex, *controlled* HTML generation, create custom Handlebars helpers. These helpers should encapsulate the sanitization logic, keeping templates clean and maintainable.  This is an Ember-specific way to manage dynamic HTML.
    5. **Code Review:** Enforce code review that will check for `htmlSafe` usage.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `htmlSafe`:** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from injecting malicious scripts by misusing Ember's `htmlSafe` function.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS via `htmlSafe`:** Risk reduction: High. Eliminates the primary Ember-specific XSS vector related to `htmlSafe`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. Developers are generally aware, but there's no strict enforcement or consistent use of DOMPurify. Custom helpers are used sometimes, but not systematically. Code review is not always catching `htmlSafe` issues.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Mandatory use of DOMPurify (or equivalent) *before* any use of `htmlSafe` with potentially unsafe data.
    *   Consistent use of custom Ember Handlebars helpers for dynamic HTML generation.
    *   Stricter code review to catch `htmlSafe` misuse.
    *   Automated linting rules to flag potentially unsafe `htmlSafe` uses.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Prototype Pollution Prevention (Ember.Object Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/prototype_pollution_prevention__ember_object_specific_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Prototype Pollution Prevention (Ember.Object Specific)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Upgrade Ember.js:** Ensure the project is using Ember.js 3.27 or later (this provides *some* built-in protection, but the following steps are still crucial).
    2.  **Use `Object.create(null)`:** When creating new objects *within Ember code* that might be populated with untrusted data, use `Object.create(null)` instead of `{}`. This is particularly relevant when dealing with Ember's object model.
    3.  **Input Validation and Sanitization (for Ember.set):** Before using `Ember.set` (or similar methods) to set properties on Ember objects, validate and sanitize both the keys and values. This is crucial when the data originates from outside the trusted Ember application context.
        *   **Key Validation:** Ensure keys are strings and match expected property names. Reject unexpected keys.
        *   **Value Sanitization:** Sanitize values based on their expected type.
    4.  **Deep Copy (with Ember Objects):** If merging untrusted data into an *existing* Ember object, create a deep copy of the Ember object first (using Lodash's `_.cloneDeep` or a similar method that correctly handles Ember objects), then merge the *sanitized* data into the copy.
    5. **Freeze Objects:** After initializing Ember objects with trusted data, use `Object.freeze()` to make them immutable.
    6. **Code Review:** Enforce code review that will check for prototype pollution unsafe code.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Prototype Pollution (targeting Ember.Object):** (Severity: High) - Prevents attackers from modifying the behavior of Ember's built-in objects and potentially executing arbitrary code *within the Ember application*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Prototype Pollution (Ember.Object):** Risk reduction: High. Addresses a specific vulnerability pattern within Ember's object model.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially. The project is on Ember 4.x. `Object.create(null)` is *not* consistently used. Input validation for `Ember.set` is not comprehensive. Deep copying and `Object.freeze()` are rarely used with Ember objects. Code review is not always catching prototype pollution issues.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of `Object.create(null)` for relevant Ember objects.
    *   Comprehensive input validation and sanitization before using `Ember.set` with potentially untrusted data.
    *   Strategic use of deep copying when merging untrusted data into existing Ember objects.
    *   More frequent use of `Object.freeze()` on initialized Ember objects.
    *   Stricter code review and potentially static analysis to find potential Ember-specific prototype pollution vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure use of `{{link-to}}` and `transitionTo` (Ember Routing)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_use_of__{{link-to}}__and__transitionto___ember_routing_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Secure use of `{{link-to}}` and `transitionTo` (Ember Routing)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Whitelist Allowed Routes (Ember Routes):**
        *   Create a JavaScript module (e.g., `app/utils/route-whitelist.js`) that exports an array or object containing the names of all allowed *Ember routes*.
        *   In components or controllers where Ember's `{{link-to}}` helper or `transitionTo` method is used with dynamic route names, import the whitelist.
        *   Before generating the link or transitioning, check if the target *Ember route* is in the whitelist. If not, prevent the action or redirect to a safe default Ember route.
    2.  **Validate Route Parameters (Ember Route Parameters):**
        *   If route parameters are derived from user input, define validation rules for each parameter (using `ember-cp-validations` or custom functions).
        *   Validate the parameters *before* passing them to Ember's `{{link-to}}` or `transitionTo`.
        *   If validation fails, prevent the link/transition and show an error.
    3.  **Avoid Dynamic Route Names from User Input (Ember Route Names):**
        *   Never directly construct Ember route names from user input strings.
        *   If the destination Ember route depends on user input, use a lookup table or mapping function to determine the correct Ember route name based on *validated* input. Example:
            ```javascript
            // Instead of: this.transitionToRoute(userInput);
            const routeMap = {
              'profile': 'user.profile',
              'settings': 'user.settings',
              // ...
            };
            const validatedInput = validateUserInput(userInput); // Returns a safe key
            const routeName = routeMap[validatedInput] || 'index'; // Default to 'index'
            this.transitionToRoute(routeName);
            ```
    4. **Code Review:** Enforce code review that will check for open redirect vulnerabilities.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirect (via Ember Routing):** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from redirecting users to malicious websites through manipulated Ember links or transitions.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirect (Ember Routing):** Risk reduction: High. Addresses a specific vulnerability pattern within Ember's routing system.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Not implemented. Dynamic Ember route names and parameters are sometimes used without proper validation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Implementation of an Ember route whitelist.
    *   Validation of Ember route parameters.
    *   Avoiding direct use of user input for Ember route names.
    *   Code review process to identify and prevent open redirect vulnerabilities in Ember routing.
