Okay, let's create a design document for the Ember.js project, focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Ember.js is a mature, open-source JavaScript framework for building ambitious web applications.  Its primary business goals revolve around:

*   Developer Productivity:  Ember.js aims to increase developer productivity by providing a comprehensive set of tools and conventions, allowing developers to focus on building features rather than making architectural decisions.
*   Application Stability and Maintainability:  Ember.js emphasizes convention-over-configuration and a strong commitment to backwards compatibility, leading to applications that are easier to maintain and upgrade over time.
*   Community Growth and Adoption:  The project's success depends on a vibrant and active community.  Attracting new users and retaining existing ones is crucial.
*   Performance: Ember applications should be performant, providing a good user experience.

Based on these priorities, the most important business risks are:

*   Security Vulnerabilities:  Vulnerabilities in the framework itself could be exploited to compromise applications built with Ember.js, leading to data breaches, reputational damage, and loss of user trust. This is the highest priority risk.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of dependencies used by Ember.js or its build process could introduce malicious code into the framework.
*   Loss of Community Trust:  Poor handling of security issues, breaking changes, or a decline in community engagement could lead to developers abandoning the framework.
*   Performance Degradation: Significant performance regressions could make Ember.js less attractive compared to competing frameworks.
*   Inability to Adapt: Failure to keep up with evolving web standards and browser capabilities could render the framework obsolete.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Ember.js has a well-defined security policy and a history of addressing vulnerabilities responsibly.

Existing security controls:

*   security control: Security Policy:  Ember.js has a documented security policy (likely in the SECURITY.md file in the repository or on their website) that outlines how to report vulnerabilities and how the team handles them.
*   security control: Regular Releases:  The project follows a regular release cycle, including security releases when necessary. This is evident from the release history on GitHub.
*   security control: Dependency Management:  Ember.js uses package managers (like npm or yarn) to manage dependencies, allowing for updates to address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Testing:  The project has an extensive test suite, which helps to identify and prevent regressions, including potential security issues.
*   security control: Code Reviews:  All changes to the codebase undergo code review, providing an opportunity to catch security flaws before they are merged.
*   security control: Community Scrutiny:  As an open-source project, Ember.js benefits from scrutiny by a large community of developers, who can identify and report potential issues.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP) Guidance: Ember.js provides guidance and tools to help developers implement CSP, mitigating XSS risks.
*   security control: Route-based Security: Ember's router provides mechanisms for controlling access to different parts of an application.

Accepted risks:

*   accepted risk: Third-Party Dependency Vulnerabilities: While Ember.js manages dependencies, there's always a risk that a vulnerability in a third-party library could affect Ember.js applications. This is a common risk in all software development.
*   accepted risk: User-Implemented Vulnerabilities:  Ember.js can't prevent developers from introducing security vulnerabilities in their own application code. This is mitigated by providing secure defaults and guidance.
*   accepted risk: Emerging Web Platform Vulnerabilities: New browser vulnerabilities or web platform issues could arise that affect Ember.js applications, requiring updates to the framework or application code.

Recommended security controls:

*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integrate SAST tools into the build process to automatically scan for potential vulnerabilities in the Ember.js codebase.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Use SCA tools to track dependencies and identify known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
*   security control: Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): While more applicable to applications built *with* Ember, consider DAST for the Ember.js website and any demo applications.
*   security control: Fuzz Testing: Implement fuzz testing to identify unexpected input handling issues that could lead to vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication: Ember.js itself doesn't handle authentication directly. It's the responsibility of the application developer to implement authentication mechanisms. However, Ember.js should provide clear guidance and best practices for integrating with authentication systems.
*   Authorization: Ember.js provides route-based authorization mechanisms.  These should be clearly documented and easy to use securely.  The framework should encourage secure-by-default patterns.
*   Input Validation: Ember.js should provide mechanisms for validating user input, both on the client-side (for immediate feedback) and the server-side (for security).  This includes escaping output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities.
*   Cryptography: Ember.js should provide guidance on using appropriate cryptographic libraries and techniques for tasks such as password hashing, data encryption, and secure communication. It should not attempt to implement its own cryptographic primitives.

## DEPLOYMENT

Ember.js applications are typically deployed as static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to a web server or CDN.  There are several deployment options:

1.  Traditional Web Server (e.g., Apache, Nginx): The built application files are copied to the server's document root.
2.  Cloud Storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage): The files are uploaded to a cloud storage bucket, which can be configured to serve as a static website.
3.  CDN (e.g., Cloudflare, Fastly, AWS CloudFront): The files are deployed to a CDN, which distributes them across multiple servers globally for faster delivery.
4.  Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Heroku): These platforms provide specialized hosting for front-end applications, often with built-in CI/CD pipelines.

We'll describe deployment to AWS S3 with CloudFront:

## BUILD

The Ember.js build process typically involves the following steps:

1.  Code Checkout: The CI/CD pipeline checks out the source code from the Git repository.
2.  Dependency Installation:  Dependencies are installed using a package manager (npm or yarn).
3.  Linting:  Code is checked for style and potential errors using linters (e.g., ESLint).
4.  Transpilation:  Modern JavaScript code is transpiled to older versions for compatibility with older browsers (using Babel).
5.  Compilation:  Templates are compiled into JavaScript code.
6.  Minification:  JavaScript and CSS files are minified to reduce their size.
7.  Asset Optimization:  Images and other assets are optimized for performance.
8.  Testing:  Unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests are run.
9.  Packaging:  The built files are packaged into a deployable format (usually a "dist" folder).
10. Artifact Storage/Publishing: The build artifacts are stored or published to a repository or deployment target.

```

Security Controls in the Build Process:

*   security control: Dependency Management: Use of npm or yarn with lockfiles to ensure consistent and reproducible builds.
*   security control: Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Integration of SCA tools (e.g., Snyk, npm audit) to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   security control: Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Integration of SAST tools (e.g., SonarQube, ESLint with security plugins) to scan for vulnerabilities in the Ember.js codebase.
*   security control: Linting: Use of linters to enforce coding standards and identify potential errors.
*   security control: Secure Build Environment: Running the build process in a secure and isolated environment (e.g., using containers).
*   security control: Secrets Management: Securely storing and managing API keys, credentials, and other secrets used during the build process.
*   security control: Code Signing: (Less common for web apps, but applicable to Electron apps built with Ember) Signing the build artifacts to ensure their integrity.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

*   Critical Business Processes:
    *   Serving web application to users.
    *   Maintaining developer productivity and application maintainability.
    *   Protecting user data handled by applications built with Ember.js.
    *   Maintaining the reputation and trust of the Ember.js project.

*   Data to Protect and Sensitivity:
    *   Ember.js Framework Code:  Sensitivity - High (compromise could affect many applications).
    *   Application Code (built *with* Ember.js): Sensitivity - Varies depending on the application (could range from low to very high).  Ember.js itself doesn't handle application data directly, but vulnerabilities in the framework could be exploited to access this data.
    *   User Data (handled by applications built *with* Ember.js): Sensitivity - Varies depending on the application (could range from low to very high).
    *   Ember.js Project Metadata (e.g., issue tracker, discussions): Sensitivity - Medium (compromise could disrupt the project and damage reputation).
