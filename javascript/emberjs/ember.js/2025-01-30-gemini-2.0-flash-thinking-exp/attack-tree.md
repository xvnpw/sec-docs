## Attack Tree Path: [*Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities (Ember Specific)*](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities__ember_specific_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   This path encompasses vulnerabilities that reside within the client-side Ember.js application itself. Attackers target weaknesses in how Ember.js handles user input, renders templates, manages application state, and interacts with the DOM.
    *   Successful exploitation occurs entirely within the user's browser, without necessarily requiring interaction with the server (though server-side data might be the target).
    *   Common consequences include Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), client-side data manipulation, and unauthorized access to client-side resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Template Injection Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/template_injection_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Ember.js uses Handlebars templates to dynamically render UI. If user-controlled data is directly embedded into templates without proper sanitization, it can be interpreted as Handlebars code.
    *   Attackers inject malicious Handlebars expressions within user inputs (e.g., form fields, URL parameters).
    *   When the template is rendered, these malicious expressions are executed as JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to XSS.
    *   *Inject Malicious Handlebars Expressions* is the most direct and common attack vector within this category.

## Attack Tree Path: [*Inject Malicious Handlebars Expressions*](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_handlebars_expressions.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Specifically targets the direct injection of malicious Handlebars code into templates.
    *   Attackers craft input data containing Handlebars helpers or expressions designed to execute arbitrary JavaScript.
    *   Example payloads might include expressions that access JavaScript constructors to execute code, or use Handlebars helpers to manipulate the DOM in malicious ways.
    *   Exploitation is often straightforward if input sanitization is lacking or insufficient.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Component Logic Flaws**](./attack_tree_paths/component_logic_flaws.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Ember.js applications are built using components. Vulnerabilities can arise from logical errors, race conditions, or insecure coding practices within the JavaScript logic of custom components.
    *   Attackers analyze component code to identify flaws in how components handle user input, manage state, or interact with other parts of the application.
    *   Exploitation can lead to a wide range of issues, from unexpected application behavior to security breaches depending on the nature of the flaw.
    *   *Vulnerabilities in Custom Component Logic* is the primary attack vector within this category.

## Attack Tree Path: [*Vulnerabilities in Custom Component Logic*](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerabilities_in_custom_component_logic.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Focuses on the vulnerabilities specifically within the custom JavaScript code written for Ember components.
    *   Attackers look for weaknesses in how components process user input, manage component state, handle events, or interact with services or Ember Data.
    *   Common vulnerabilities include:
        *   Improper input validation leading to XSS or other injection attacks.
        *   Race conditions in asynchronous operations within components.
        *   Logical errors in state management leading to unintended application behavior or security bypasses.
        *   Insecure handling of sensitive data within component logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Client-Side Data Manipulation Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_data_manipulation_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   This category encompasses vulnerabilities that allow attackers to manipulate the client-side data and DOM of the Ember.js application.
    *   Even without direct template injection, vulnerabilities in component rendering or data binding can be exploited to inject malicious content.
    *   *DOM Manipulation Attacks* is a key attack vector within this category.

## Attack Tree Path: [*DOM Manipulation Attacks*](./attack_tree_paths/dom_manipulation_attacks.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Exploits vulnerabilities in how Ember.js components render and update the DOM based on data.
    *   Attackers identify scenarios where user-controlled data influences DOM rendering, even indirectly through data binding.
    *   By crafting specific input data, attackers can inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the DOM.
    *   This injected content can then execute in the user's browser, leading to XSS or other client-side attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [*Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities (Ember Ecosystem)*](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependency_vulnerabilities__ember_ecosystem_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Ember.js applications heavily rely on external dependencies, including Ember addons and NPM packages.
    *   Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the application.
    *   *Vulnerable Ember Addons* is a direct and significant attack vector within this category.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Vulnerable Ember Addons**](./attack_tree_paths/vulnerable_ember_addons.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Targets known vulnerabilities in Ember addons used by the application.
    *   Attackers identify the addons used by the application (e.g., by examining `package.json` or build artifacts).
    *   They then check for known vulnerabilities in these addons using vulnerability databases or security advisories.
    *   If vulnerable addons are found, attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities, potentially gaining control of parts of the application or injecting malicious code.
    *   Outdated addons are a common source of vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Insecure Configuration of Ember Features**](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_configuration_of_ember_features.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Ember.js and web applications in general have various configuration options. Misconfigurations can introduce security vulnerabilities.
    *   *Insecure Content Security Policy (CSP)* is a critical misconfiguration risk within this category.

## Attack Tree Path: [*Insecure Content Security Policy (CSP)*](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_content_security_policy__csp_.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Content Security Policy (CSP) is a security mechanism to mitigate XSS attacks by controlling the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
    *   A weak or misconfigured CSP can fail to provide adequate protection or even be bypassed entirely.
    *   Attackers analyze the CSP headers of the application.
    *   If the CSP is overly permissive (e.g., allows `unsafe-inline`, `unsafe-eval`, or wide-open source whitelists) or contains logical errors, attackers can exploit these weaknesses to inject and execute malicious scripts, effectively bypassing the intended CSP protection.

## Attack Tree Path: [**Misuse of Ember APIs leading to Vulnerabilities**](./attack_tree_paths/misuse_of_ember_apis_leading_to_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Ember.js provides a rich set of APIs. Improper or insecure usage of these APIs by developers can introduce vulnerabilities.
    *   *Improper Handling of User Input in Components/Actions* is a common and high-risk example of API misuse.

## Attack Tree Path: [*Improper Handling of User Input in Components/Actions*](./attack_tree_paths/improper_handling_of_user_input_in_componentsactions.md)

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Focuses on the common developer mistake of not properly validating and sanitizing user input within Ember components and actions.
    *   Attackers target input fields, URL parameters, and other sources of user-controlled data.
    *   If input is not validated and sanitized before being used in templates, component logic, or API requests, it can lead to various vulnerabilities, including:
        *   XSS (if input is rendered in templates without escaping).
        *   Injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if input is used in backend queries).
        *   Unexpected application behavior or logic flaws.
        *   Data corruption.
