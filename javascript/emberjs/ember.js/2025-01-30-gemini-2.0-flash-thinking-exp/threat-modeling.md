# Threat Model Analysis for emberjs/ember.js

## Threat: [Handlebars Template Injection (XSS)](./threats/handlebars_template_injection__xss_.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into user-controlled data that is rendered by Handlebars templates within an Ember.js application. This occurs when developers use unescaped Handlebars expressions (`{{{expression}}}`) or dynamically construct templates with user input without proper sanitization. The injected code executes in the victim's browser when the template is rendered, leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
**Impact:** Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, session hijacking, cookie theft, redirection to malicious websites, application defacement, data theft, and further attacks against the user's system.
**Affected Ember.js Component:** Handlebars Templates, Ember Components rendering dynamic content using Handlebars, Application code handling user input and displaying data in templates.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Strictly adhere to default HTML escaping (`{{expression}}`) for all user-controlled data within Handlebars templates.**
*   **Avoid using unescaped expressions (`{{{expression}}}`) unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. Implement rigorous sanitization and validation of data before using unescaped expressions.**
*   **Never dynamically construct Handlebars templates from user-controlled input.**
*   Utilize Ember.js built-in helpers and components for safe rendering of dynamic content.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to further reduce the impact of potential XSS vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Ember Addon Dependency](./threats/vulnerable_ember_addon_dependency.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a known security vulnerability present in an Ember addon or one of its transitive dependencies used by the application. Ember.js applications heavily rely on addons for extended functionality. If a vulnerable addon is included, attackers can leverage the vulnerability to compromise the application. Exploitation methods depend on the specific vulnerability within the addon, potentially leading to XSS, arbitrary code execution, or data breaches.
**Impact:** Application compromise, data breach, server compromise (depending on the vulnerability and addon's capabilities), denial of service, unauthorized access to sensitive functionalities.
**Affected Ember.js Component:** Ember Addons integrated into the application, `package.json` dependencies, `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json` files managing addon versions.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Severity depends on the specific vulnerability in the addon and its potential impact).
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Establish a process for regularly auditing and updating npm packages and Ember addons used in the project.**
*   **Utilize dependency scanning tools (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, OWASP Dependency-Check) to proactively identify and remediate known vulnerabilities in addon dependencies.**
*   **Carefully evaluate the security posture and maintainability of Ember addons before incorporating them into the application. Consider factors like addon popularity, maintainer reputation, and recent update history.**
*   Implement a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to maintain a clear inventory of dependencies and facilitate vulnerability tracking and management.

## Threat: [Insecure Route Authorization Bypass in Ember Routing](./threats/insecure_route_authorization_bypass_in_ember_routing.md)

**Description:** An attacker attempts to bypass authorization checks implemented within the Ember.js routing system to gain unauthorized access to protected routes or application states. If route authorization logic within Ember route hooks (e.g., `beforeModel`, `model`, `afterModel`) is missing, incorrectly implemented, or contains logical flaws, attackers can manipulate route transitions or parameters to circumvent access controls and reach restricted parts of the application or data.
**Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or application features, privilege escalation, data breaches, unauthorized actions within the application, circumvention of intended application workflows.
**Affected Ember.js Component:** Ember Routes, Ember Route Hooks (`beforeModel`, `model`, `afterModel`) responsible for authorization logic, Ember Router configuration.
**Risk Severity:** High to Critical (Severity depends on the sensitivity of the routes and data protected by the routing system).
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Implement robust and comprehensive authorization checks within Ember route hooks to strictly control access to all protected routes and application states.**
*   **Ensure authorization logic is correctly implemented, covers all relevant routes, and cannot be easily bypassed through manipulation of route parameters or transition flows.**
*   **Thoroughly test route authorization logic with various scenarios and user roles to identify and rectify any potential bypass vulnerabilities.**
*   Adhere to the principle of least privilege when defining route access control, granting only necessary access to users based on their roles and permissions.
