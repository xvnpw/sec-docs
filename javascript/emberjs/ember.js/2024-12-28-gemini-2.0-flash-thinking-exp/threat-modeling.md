Here is the updated threat list, including only high and critical threats that directly involve the Ember.js framework:

### High and Critical Ember.js Specific Threats

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Unescaped Handlebars Output
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by providing crafted input that is not properly escaped when rendered in a Handlebars template. This script could then execute in other users' browsers when they view the affected content. The attacker might aim to steal session cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or deface the application.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, session hijacking, theft of sensitive information, redirection to malicious websites, or defacement of the application.
    *   **Affected Ember.js Component:** `Handlebars Templates` (specifically the rendering process).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Always use the default `{{ }}` syntax for rendering user-provided content, which automatically escapes HTML.
        *   Be extremely cautious when using the `{{{ }}}` triple-mustache syntax for unescaped content. Only use it when you explicitly trust the source of the data and understand the security implications.
        *   Sanitize user input on the server-side before storing it in the database.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.

*   **Threat:** Template Injection via Server-Side Rendering with User Input
    *   **Description:** If the application uses server-side rendering and incorporates user-controlled data directly into the construction of Handlebars templates on the server, an attacker could inject malicious Handlebars code. This could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server or the injection of client-side scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution on the server, server compromise, or client-side XSS.
    *   **Affected Ember.js Component:** `Handlebars Templates` (when used in server-side rendering contexts).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid constructing templates dynamically based on user input on the server-side.
        *   If dynamic template generation is absolutely necessary, implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent the injection of malicious Handlebars syntax.
        *   Consider alternative rendering strategies that do not involve direct user input in template construction.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attacks via Malicious or Vulnerable Addons
    *   **Description:** An attacker could compromise the application by introducing malicious code or exploiting vulnerabilities in third-party Ember addons (dependencies). This could happen if a legitimate addon is compromised, or if a developer unknowingly includes a malicious addon.
    *   **Impact:** Full application compromise, data theft, injection of malicious code, or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Ember.js Component:** `Ember Addons` (the dependency management system).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully vet and audit the addons used in the application.
        *   Keep addon dependencies up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Utilize tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
        *   Consider using a dependency management tool that allows for security scanning and vulnerability monitoring.
        *   Be cautious about using addons from unknown or untrusted sources.

*   **Threat:** Authorization Bypass through Route Manipulation
    *   **Description:** If authorization checks are not implemented correctly within Ember route handlers or route transition guards, an attacker might be able to bypass security restrictions by directly navigating to unauthorized routes, potentially by manipulating the URL or using browser developer tools.
    *   **Impact:** Access to sensitive data or functionality without proper authorization.
    *   **Affected Ember.js Component:** `Ember Routing` (route handlers, transition hooks).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authorization checks within route `beforeModel`, `model`, or `afterModel` hooks.
        *   Use route transition guards (e.g., `beforeunload`, `willTransition`) to prevent unauthorized navigation.
        *   Ensure that authorization logic is consistently applied across all protected routes.
        *   Avoid relying solely on client-side checks for critical authorization decisions; enforce them on the server-side as well.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Secrets in Client-Side Build Output
    *   **Description:** If sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other secrets are inadvertently included in the client-side build output (e.g., hardcoded in JavaScript files or configuration), an attacker could potentially extract this information by inspecting the application's source code.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of backend systems, unauthorized access to third-party services, or data breaches.
    *   **Affected Ember.js Component:** `Ember CLI Build Process` (configuration and asset handling).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid embedding secrets directly in the codebase.
        *   Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management techniques to handle sensitive information during the build process.
        *   Ensure that build processes do not inadvertently include sensitive files or data in the output.
