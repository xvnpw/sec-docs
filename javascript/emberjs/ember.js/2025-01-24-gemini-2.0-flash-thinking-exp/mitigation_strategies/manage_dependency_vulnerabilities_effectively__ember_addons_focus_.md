    *   **Cons:**
        *   **Overhead of Hash Management:**  Requires generating and managing SRI hashes for all external resources. Hashes need to be updated whenever the resource is updated.
        *   **Potential Performance Impact:**  Slight performance overhead due to hash verification during resource loading.
        *   **Limited Scope:**  SRI primarily protects the integrity of resources loaded via `<script>` and `<link>` tags. It may not cover all resources loaded by addons, especially if addons dynamically load resources or use other mechanisms.
        *   **Maintenance Burden:**  Maintaining SRI hashes can become a maintenance burden if not automated.
    *   **Challenges:**
        *   **Hash Generation and Management:**  Efficiently generating and managing SRI hashes, especially for frequently updated resources.
        *   **Integration with Build Process:**  Integrating SRI hash generation into the build pipeline to automate the process.
        *   **Dynamic Resources:**  Handling SRI for dynamically loaded resources or resources whose URLs change frequently.
        *   **SRI Coverage for Addons:**  Ensuring SRI coverage for external resources loaded by addons, which may require understanding addon implementation details.
    *   **Recommendations:**
        *   **Automate SRI Hash Generation:**  Automate SRI hash generation and integration into the build process using tools or scripts.
        *   **Integrate into Build Pipeline:**  Incorporate SRI hash generation as a standard step in the CI/CD pipeline.
        *   **Use SRI for All External Resources:**  Apply SRI to all external JavaScript and CSS resources loaded from CDNs, including those used by addons where feasible.
