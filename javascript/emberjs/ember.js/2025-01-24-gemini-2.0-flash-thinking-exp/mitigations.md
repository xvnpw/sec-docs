# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for emberjs/ember.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Leverage Ember's Built-in HTML Escaping](./mitigation_strategies/leverage_ember's_built-in_html_escaping.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Default Behavior:** Ensure all developers understand Ember.js's default HTML escaping using `{{expression}}`. This automatically escapes characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` in templates, preventing them from being interpreted as HTML.
    2.  **Use `{{expression}}` Consistently:**  Instruct developers to consistently use `{{expression}}` for dynamic data in templates, especially user-supplied content.
    3.  **Avoid `{{{expression}}}` (Unescaped HTML) Unless Necessary:** Educate developers about `{{{expression}}}` for unescaped HTML. Emphasize its rare use for trusted, controlled HTML sources only. Require code reviews for `{{{expression}}}` usage.
    4.  **Template Linting:** Integrate `ember-template-lint` into workflows and CI/CD. Configure rules to flag `{{{expression}}}` and promote secure template rendering.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (High Severity):** Prevents injection of malicious scripts via user input reflected in HTML.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Stored (High Severity):** Reduces risk of stored XSS by escaping data from storage rendered in templates.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS - Reflected:** Significantly Reduces Risk. Default escaping neutralizes most reflected XSS.
    *   **XSS - Stored:** Moderately Reduces Risk. Escaping protects rendering, but input validation is still needed for storage.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Yes, Globally:** Ember's default escaping is a core feature, always active with `{{expression}}`.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **N/A:** Default framework feature.  Focus on developer understanding and template linting rule enforcement.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Manage Dependency Vulnerabilities Effectively (Ember Addons Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/manage_dependency_vulnerabilities_effectively__ember_addons_focus_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Regularly Audit and Update npm Dependencies:** Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify vulnerabilities in project dependencies, including Ember addons.
    2.  **Employ a Dependency Vulnerability Scanner:** Integrate a scanner into CI/CD to automate vulnerability detection in dependencies, especially addons.
    3.  **Vet Ember Addons Before Adoption:** Carefully evaluate addons before use. Consider maintainership, community reputation, and security advisories. Prefer actively maintained, reputable addons.
    4.  **Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI for external JavaScript libraries or CSS stylesheets, including those potentially used by addons, to ensure integrity from CDNs.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities Exploitation (High to Critical Severity):** Mitigates risks from vulnerabilities in npm packages, particularly Ember addons, which can introduce various security flaws.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities Exploitation:** Significantly Reduces Risk. Regular auditing and vetting of addons minimizes exploitation opportunities.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially:** `npm audit` is run occasionally. Addon vetting is informal.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **CI/CD Integration:** Automate `npm audit` in CI/CD.
    *   **Formal Addon Vetting Process:** Establish a documented process for security review of Ember addons before adoption.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Routing and Authorization using Ember Features](./mitigation_strategies/secure_routing_and_authorization_using_ember_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Implement Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms:** Use Ember's routing system and lifecycle hooks (`beforeModel`, `model`, `afterModel`) to enforce authentication and authorization.
    2.  **Utilize Ember Addons for Authentication and Authorization:** Leverage Ember addons like `ember-simple-auth` or `torii` for authentication flows. Consider addons like `ember-data-permissions` for authorization or implement custom logic in services/components.
    3.  **Avoid Exposing Sensitive Data in Route/Query Parameters:** Be mindful of data in route/query parameters, visible in browser history and logs. Prefer POST requests or secure storage for sensitive data.
    4.  **Properly Handle Route Transitions and Redirects:** Securely handle route transitions and redirects, especially after authentication/authorization. Avoid redirects to untrusted URLs or bypassing security checks during transitions.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access (High Severity):** Prevents unauthorized access to application features and data.
    *   **Privilege Escalation (High Severity):** Reduces risk of attackers gaining higher privileges via authorization flaws.
    *   **Information Disclosure (Medium Severity):** Minimizes exposure of sensitive data in URLs.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Significantly Reduces Risk. Ember's routing and lifecycle hooks enable robust access control.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** Significantly Reduces Risk. Proper authorization logic within Ember components and routes limits escalation.
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Moderately Reduces Risk. Careful route design reduces URL-based information leaks.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Partially:** Basic authentication is present. Route-level authorization is inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Route-Level Authorization:** Implement authorization checks in route lifecycle hooks.
    *   **Granular Authorization:** Develop a more detailed authorization model (RBAC/ABAC) within Ember.
    *   **Consistent Route Transition Security:** Review and secure all route transitions and redirects for authorization bypasses.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Address Potential Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Security Considerations (If Applicable to Ember FastBoot)](./mitigation_strategies/address_potential_server-side_rendering__ssr__security_considerations__if_applicable_to_ember_fastbo_e5af99b2.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Sanitize Data Rendered During SSR:** If using Ember with SSR (e.g., FastBoot), sanitize all dynamic data rendered server-side to prevent server-side XSS. Apply HTML escaping principles as in client-side templates.
    2.  **Review SSR Code for Unescaped Output:** Review SSR code, especially dynamic data handling, for unescaped rendering. Fix any instances.
    3.  **Utilize SSR-Safe Templating Libraries:** If using templating libraries for SSR, ensure they offer built-in escaping or sanitization.
    4.  **Test SSR Output for XSS:** Thoroughly test server-rendered HTML for XSS vulnerabilities. Use security tools or manual testing to verify proper escaping.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (High Severity):** Prevents XSS from unescaped data during SSR, potentially affecting server or client.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Server-Side XSS:** Significantly Reduces Risk. Sanitization during SSR eliminates server-side XSS.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **No:** SSR is used, but explicit sanitization in SSR is inconsistent.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **SSR Code Review:** Review SSR code for unescaped data rendering.
    *   **SSR Sanitization Logic:** Implement sanitization within the SSR process.
    *   **SSR Security Testing:** Test SSR output specifically for XSS vulnerabilities.
