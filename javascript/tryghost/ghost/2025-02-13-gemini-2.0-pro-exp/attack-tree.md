## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Ghost Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_ghost_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1 API Vulnerabilities (Ghost API) [CN] [HR]:**
    *   **Description:**  Ghost's API is crucial for content management and administration. Vulnerabilities in input validation, authorization, rate limiting, or JWT handling within the API could allow attackers to bypass security restrictions.
    *   **Example:** An attacker exploits an API endpoint that lacks proper role checks, enabling a non-admin user to perform administrative actions (e.g., creating users, deleting content).  Alternatively, a flaw in JWT handling could allow forging an admin token.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

*   **1.2 Theme/App Upload Vulnerabilities [HR]:**
    *   **Description:**  Ghost allows uploading custom themes and apps. If the upload process doesn't properly sanitize or validate uploaded files, an attacker could upload a malicious theme or app containing server-side executable code.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a theme containing a malicious JavaScript or (if a bypass exists) PHP file that executes on the server, granting shell access or allowing data exfiltration.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Medium to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

*   **1.3 Configuration Vulnerabilities [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** Misconfigurations in Ghost's configuration files (e.g., `config.production.json`), such as exposing sensitive information (database credentials, API keys) or enabling debug mode in production, can create vulnerabilities.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the `config.production.json` file (perhaps through a directory traversal vulnerability or a misconfigured server) and obtains database credentials.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Compromise Ghost Admin Interface Directly](./attack_tree_paths/2__compromise_ghost_admin_interface_directly.md)

*   **2.1 Brute-Force Admin Login [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** An attacker attempts to guess the administrator's username and password by trying many different combinations.
    *   **Example:** Using a dictionary attack or a brute-force tool to try common usernames and passwords.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
    *   **Impact:** High
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie to Beginner
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Ghost Integrations/Themes](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_ghost_integrationsthemes.md)

*   **3.1 3rd Party Integration Vulnerabilities [HR]:**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in third-party integrations (apps) could be exploited to compromise the Ghost blog. This is a broad category encompassing various potential flaws.
    *   **Example:** A poorly coded integration might have a SQL injection vulnerability, expose sensitive data, or contain other security weaknesses.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium
    *   **Impact:** Low to Very High
    *   **Effort:** Low to High
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Advanced
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

    *   **3.1.1 Vulnerable Package (e.g., in theme) [HR]:**
        *   **Description:** A theme or integration includes an outdated or vulnerable JavaScript library (or other dependency) with known security issues.
        *   **Example:** A theme uses an old version of jQuery with a known cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High
        *   **Impact:** Low to High
        *   **Effort:** Low to Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Easy to Medium
