Okay, let's create a design document for the Ghost blogging platform based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Ghost is a popular open-source content management system (CMS) focused on blogging and online publishing.  Its primary business goals revolve around providing a user-friendly, performant, and customizable platform for creators.  It operates under a dual-license model: open-source (MIT License) for self-hosting and a paid "Pro" service (Ghost(Pro)) for managed hosting.  This suggests a balance between community contribution and revenue generation.

Business Priorities:

*   User Experience:  Provide a clean, intuitive interface for both content creators and readers.
*   Performance:  Ensure fast loading times and a smooth user experience.
*   Customization:  Allow users to tailor the look and feel of their blogs through themes and integrations.
*   Extensibility: Enable developers to extend functionality via apps and APIs.
*   Monetization (for Ghost(Pro)):  Maintain a reliable and scalable hosting infrastructure to support paying customers.
*   Community Growth: Foster a vibrant community of users and contributors.

Business Risks:

*   Data Breaches:  Unauthorized access to user data (emails, passwords, content) could severely damage reputation and user trust.  This is critical for both self-hosted and Ghost(Pro) users.
*   Service Downtime (especially for Ghost(Pro)):  Interruptions in service directly impact paying customers and revenue.
*   Malicious Content:  Users might exploit the platform to host illegal or harmful content, creating legal and reputational risks.
*   Spam and Abuse:  Comment sections and other user-generated content areas are vulnerable to spam and abuse.
*   Competition:  The CMS market is competitive, requiring continuous innovation and improvement to maintain market share.
*   Supply Chain Attacks: Compromise of third-party dependencies used by Ghost could introduce vulnerabilities.
*   Theme/Plugin Vulnerabilities:  Poorly coded themes or plugins (especially from third-party sources) could expose security flaws.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on the GitHub repository and general knowledge of Ghost):

*   security control: Input Validation: Ghost uses input validation techniques to prevent common web vulnerabilities like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and SQL Injection. Implemented in core code and libraries.
*   security control: Authentication:  User authentication is handled via email/password, with support for password hashing (likely bcrypt or similar).  Ghost(Pro) likely offers additional authentication options. Implemented in core authentication modules.
*   security control: Authorization:  Role-based access control (RBAC) restricts user actions based on their assigned roles (e.g., author, editor, administrator). Implemented in core authorization modules.
*   security control: CSRF Protection:  Ghost employs measures to prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. Implemented in core middleware.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP):  Ghost utilizes CSP headers to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks. Implemented in server configuration and response headers.
*   security control: HTTPS:  Ghost strongly encourages (and Ghost(Pro) enforces) the use of HTTPS to encrypt communication between the server and clients. Implemented in server configuration.
*   security control: Regular Updates:  The Ghost team releases regular updates to address security vulnerabilities and improve performance. Implemented through release process and update mechanisms.
*   security control: Dependency Management: Ghost uses package managers (like npm) to manage dependencies and track known vulnerabilities. Implemented in build process and dependency management tools.
*   security control: Code Reviews: The Ghost project likely employs code reviews to identify potential security issues before they are merged into the codebase. Implemented in development workflow.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Self-Hosted Security Responsibility: Users who self-host Ghost are responsible for securing their own server infrastructure, including operating system updates, firewall configuration, and database security.
*   accepted risk: Third-Party Theme/Plugin Risk:  While Ghost provides a platform for themes and plugins, the security of these extensions is ultimately the responsibility of their developers. Users are advised to use trusted sources.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):  Implement 2FA for user accounts, especially for administrators, to add an extra layer of security.
*   security control: Audit Logging:  Implement comprehensive audit logging to track user actions and system events, aiding in incident investigation and security monitoring.
*   security control: Rate Limiting:  Implement rate limiting on API endpoints and login attempts to mitigate brute-force attacks and denial-of-service (DoS) attempts.
*   security control: Security Scanning: Integrate automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, SCA) into the development and deployment pipeline.
*   security control: Intrusion Detection/Prevention System (IDS/IPS): For Ghost(Pro), implement an IDS/IPS to monitor network traffic and detect/prevent malicious activity.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   All user accounts must be protected by strong passwords.
    *   Password hashing must use a strong, industry-standard algorithm (e.g., bcrypt).
    *   Support for 2FA should be implemented.
    *   Session management must be secure, using unique session IDs and appropriate timeouts.

*   Authorization:
    *   RBAC must be enforced consistently throughout the application.
    *   Users should only have access to the resources and actions necessary for their roles.
    *   Privilege escalation vulnerabilities must be prevented.

*   Input Validation:
    *   All user input must be validated and sanitized to prevent XSS, SQL Injection, and other injection attacks.
    *   A whitelist approach to input validation should be preferred over a blacklist approach.
    *   Output encoding should be used to prevent stored XSS.

*   Cryptography:
    *   All sensitive data (passwords, API keys, etc.) must be stored securely using strong encryption.
    *   HTTPS must be enforced for all communication between the client and server.
    *   Cryptographic libraries must be kept up-to-date.

*   Data Protection:
    *   User data must be protected in accordance with relevant privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR).
    *   Data backups must be performed regularly and stored securely.
    *   Data retention policies must be defined and enforced.

*   What specific security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, SCA) are currently used in the Ghost development process?
*   What is the current process for handling security vulnerabilities reported by external researchers?
*   What are the specific security requirements for Ghost(Pro) beyond those for self-hosted installations?
*   What are the data retention policies for user data and content?
*   Are there any specific compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) that need to be considered?
*   What level of detail is required for the component-level C4 diagrams?

Assumptions:

*   BUSINESS POSTURE:  Ghost prioritizes user experience, performance, and security, balancing open-source principles with the need for revenue generation through Ghost(Pro).
*   SECURITY POSTURE:  Ghost employs standard web security practices, but there is room for improvement, particularly in areas like 2FA, audit logging, and security scanning.
*   DESIGN:  The provided diagrams represent a reasonable approximation of Ghost's architecture, but may not capture all the nuances of the system. The deployment model focuses on a Docker-based self-hosted setup, which is a common and recommended approach.
