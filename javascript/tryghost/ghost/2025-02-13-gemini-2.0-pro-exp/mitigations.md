# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for tryghost/ghost

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rapid Patching Cycle (Ghost Core)](./mitigation_strategies/rapid_patching_cycle__ghost_core_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement a rapid and (partially) automated patching process for Ghost core updates.

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Notifications:** Subscribe to the official Ghost blog, security announcements, and any relevant mailing lists.
    2.  **Automated Monitoring (Partial):** Use a script or service to detect new releases (can be integrated with Ghost-CLI).
    3.  **Staging Environment:** Set up a staging environment that mirrors the production environment.
    4.  **Automated Testing (Partial):** Upon detecting a new release, manually deploy it to the staging environment. Run automated tests (unit/integration) that can be triggered via Ghost-CLI or custom scripts.
    5.  **Manual Deployment (with Ghost-CLI):** Use the `ghost update` command (Ghost-CLI) for controlled deployments to production after successful staging tests.
    6.  **Rollback Plan:** Utilize Ghost-CLI's rollback capabilities (`ghost update --rollback`) or restore from backups.
    7.  **Post-Update Monitoring:** Monitor the Ghost admin panel and logs for any issues after the update.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Content Management and Moderation (Within Ghost)](./mitigation_strategies/content_management_and_moderation__within_ghost_.md)

* **Mitigation Strategy:** Implement strict content management and moderation practices within the Ghost editor and, if enabled, the commenting system.

* **Description:**
    1. **Input Sanitization (Trust, but Verify):** While Ghost handles input sanitization, perform periodic tests to confirm its effectiveness against XSS and other injection attacks. Try to input malicious scripts into posts and comments (if enabled).
    2. **Comment Moderation (If Enabled):** If comments are enabled, use the built-in moderation features (or a third-party integration managed *through* Ghost) to review and approve comments before they are published.
    3. **User Roles and Permissions (Admin Panel):** Carefully manage user roles and permissions within the Ghost admin panel. Grant only the necessary access to each user.  Use the "Contributor," "Author," "Editor," and "Administrator" roles appropriately.
    4. **Regular Content Audits:** Periodically review published content for any signs of malicious code or unexpected behavior.

* **Threats Mitigated:**
    * **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Content:** (Severity: High)
