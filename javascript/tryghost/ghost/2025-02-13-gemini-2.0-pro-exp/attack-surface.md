# Attack Surface Analysis for tryghost/ghost

## Attack Surface: [Admin Panel (`/ghost/`) Access](./attack_surfaces/admin_panel___ghost___access.md)

*   **Description:**  The primary interface for managing a Ghost blog, requiring authentication.  This is a *core* Ghost component.
*   **How Ghost Contributes:**  Provides the `/ghost/` endpoint and all associated authentication and authorization logic.  Vulnerabilities here are *directly* within Ghost's code.
*   **Example:**  An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Ghost's session management to hijack an authenticated admin session.
*   **Impact:**  Complete site compromise, content manipulation, data theft, defacement.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong, Unique Passwords:** Enforce strong password policies within Ghost's configuration.
    *   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**  Implement and *require* 2FA for all admin accounts within Ghost.
    *   **Rate Limiting:**  Ghost's built-in rate limiting must be properly configured and actively monitored.
    *   **Account Lockout:**  Ensure Ghost's account lockout mechanism is enabled and configured appropriately.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:**  Review Ghost's logs for suspicious login activity.  Audit Ghost's authentication and authorization code.

## Attack Surface: [Theme Vulnerabilities (Ghost-Uploaded Themes)](./attack_surfaces/theme_vulnerabilities__ghost-uploaded_themes_.md)

*   **Description:**  Custom themes uploaded *through Ghost* can introduce code execution vulnerabilities.
*   **How Ghost Contributes:**  Ghost's theme upload and activation mechanism is the direct attack vector.  The vulnerability lies in how Ghost handles and executes theme code.
*   **Example:**  An attacker uploads a malicious theme containing a backdoor that allows them to execute arbitrary code *via Ghost's theme engine*.
*   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Theme Validation (Server-Side):**  Implement *server-side* theme validation within Ghost *before* allowing uploads. This must include static code analysis and potentially sandboxed execution *within Ghost's environment*.
    *   **Code Review (of Ghost's Theme Handling):**  Thoroughly review Ghost's code responsible for handling theme uploads, activation, and execution.
    *   **Least Privilege (for Ghost Process):**  Run the Ghost process with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges to limit the impact of a compromised theme.

## Attack Surface: [API Exploitation (Admin API)](./attack_surfaces/api_exploitation__admin_api_.md)

*   **Description:**  Ghost's *Admin* API provides programmatic access to administrative functions.  This is a *core* Ghost component.
*   **How Ghost Contributes:**  The Admin API is entirely within Ghost's codebase.  Vulnerabilities here are direct flaws in Ghost's API implementation.
*   **Example:**  An attacker discovers an authentication bypass vulnerability in Ghost's Admin API, allowing them to create new administrator accounts without credentials.
*   **Impact:**  Complete site compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:**  Critical.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strong Authentication (for API):**  Require strong, unique API keys or JWTs for *all* Admin API endpoints within Ghost.
    *   **Authorization Checks (within Ghost):**  Implement robust, fine-grained authorization checks *within Ghost's API code* to ensure users can only access resources they are permitted to.
    *   **Input Validation (within Ghost's API):**  Strictly validate *all* input to *all* Admin API endpoints within Ghost to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Rate Limiting (for API):**  Implement and enforce strict rate limiting on Ghost's Admin API to prevent abuse.
    *   **Regular API Security Audits (of Ghost's Code):**  Conduct regular security assessments of Ghost's Admin API code, including penetration testing.

## Attack Surface: [File Upload Vulnerabilities (Images - Ghost's Handling)](./attack_surfaces/file_upload_vulnerabilities__images_-_ghost's_handling_.md)

*   **Description:**  Exploiting weaknesses in how Ghost *itself* handles image uploads.
*   **How Ghost Contributes:**  Ghost's image upload and processing logic is the direct attack vector.  The vulnerability lies in *Ghost's code*.
*   **Example:**  An attacker uploads a specially crafted image that exploits a vulnerability in Ghost's image processing library, leading to code execution *within the Ghost process*.
*   **Impact:**  Code execution, server compromise, data theft.
*   **Risk Severity:**  High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict File Type Validation (within Ghost):**  Implement *content-based* file type validation within Ghost's upload handling code.
    *   **File Renaming (by Ghost):**  Ghost should rename uploaded files to prevent attackers from controlling the file path or extension.
    *   **Store Files Outside Web Root (Configured in Ghost):** Configure Ghost to store uploaded files in a directory *not* directly accessible via the web server.
    *   **Image Processing Security (within Ghost):**  Use secure image processing libraries *within Ghost* and keep them updated.  Consider sandboxing image processing *within the Ghost environment*.
    *   **Regular Security Audits (of Ghost's Code):** Review Ghost's file upload and image processing code regularly.

## Attack Surface: [Outdated Ghost Version](./attack_surfaces/outdated_ghost_version.md)

*   **Description:** Running an outdated version of Ghost exposes the site to known vulnerabilities *within Ghost itself*.
*   **How Ghost Contributes:** The vulnerability exists directly within older versions of Ghost's code.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in an older version of Ghost's core to gain administrative access.
*   **Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but can range from information disclosure to complete site compromise.
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:** Keep Ghost updated to the latest stable version. This is the *primary* mitigation.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning (of Ghost):** Use vulnerability scanners specifically targeting Ghost to identify outdated installations.
    *   **Monitor Security Advisories:** Subscribe to security mailing lists and advisories specifically for Ghost.

## Attack Surface: [Code Injection via "Code Injection" Feature (Ghost's Feature)](./attack_surfaces/code_injection_via_code_injection_feature__ghost's_feature_.md)

*   **Description:** Misuse of Ghost's built-in code injection feature.
*   **How Ghost Contributes:** This feature is a *direct part* of Ghost's functionality.
*   **Example:** An attacker with admin access injects malicious JavaScript via Ghost's code injection feature.
*   **Impact:** Client-side attacks (XSS), session hijacking.
*   **Risk Severity:** High.
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Restrict Access (within Ghost):** Limit access to Ghost's code injection feature to *highly trusted* administrators.
    *   **Input Sanitization (within Ghost):** Ghost *must* sanitize any code entered into the code injection fields.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP) (Configured in Ghost):** Configure Ghost to use a strict CSP to limit script execution.
    *   **Regular Audits (of Ghost's Configuration):** Regularly review the code injected via Ghost's feature.
