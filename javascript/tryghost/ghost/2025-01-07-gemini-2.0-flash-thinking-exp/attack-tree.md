## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Ghost Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_ghost_core_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** Exploit Known Ghost Vulnerability (CVE)
    *   Identify Unpatched Ghost Version
    *   **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerability (e.g., RCE, SQLi, XSS)

*   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Ghost Core Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Known Ghost Vulnerability (CVE):**
        *   **Identify Unpatched Ghost Version:** The attacker first identifies the specific version of Ghost running on the target application. This can be done through various techniques like examining HTTP headers, error messages, or publicly accessible files.
        *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Publicly Known Vulnerability (e.g., RCE, SQLi, XSS):** If the identified Ghost version is known to have security vulnerabilities (CVEs), the attacker will attempt to exploit these vulnerabilities. This could involve sending specially crafted requests to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server; injecting malicious SQL queries (SQLi) to access or manipulate the database; or injecting Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) payloads to execute malicious scripts in users' browsers.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Ghost Admin Interface](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_ghost_admin_interface.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** Brute-Force Admin Credentials
    *   Identify Admin Login Page
    *   Attempt Numerous Password Combinations
*   **High-Risk Path:** Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
    *   Identify Flaw in Authentication Mechanism
    *   **[CRITICAL]** Bypass Login Requirements
*   **High-Risk Path:** Leverage Default or Weak Admin Credentials
    *   Application uses Default Ghost Credentials (if not changed)
    *   **[CRITICAL]** Access Admin Panel
*   Exploit Vulnerability in Admin Panel Functionality
    *   Identify Vulnerability in Admin Feature (e.g., file upload)
    *   **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Vulnerability for Code Execution or Data Access

*   **[CRITICAL] Compromise Ghost Admin Interface:**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Brute-Force Admin Credentials:**
        *   **Identify Admin Login Page:** The attacker locates the login page for the Ghost administrative interface, typically found at a standard URL like `/ghost`.
        *   **Attempt Numerous Password Combinations:** The attacker uses automated tools to try a large number of potential usernames and passwords to guess valid admin credentials. This is often done using lists of common passwords or previously leaked credentials.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Authentication Bypass Vulnerability:**
        *   **Identify Flaw in Authentication Mechanism:** The attacker discovers a flaw in how Ghost authenticates users. This could be a logical error in the code or a misconfiguration.
        *   **[CRITICAL] Bypass Login Requirements:** Leveraging the identified flaw, the attacker circumvents the normal login process without needing valid credentials. This could involve manipulating specific parameters in requests or exploiting a weakness in the authentication logic.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Leverage Default or Weak Admin Credentials:**
        *   **Application uses Default Ghost Credentials (if not changed):** The attacker attempts to log in using the default username and password that are often set during the initial installation of Ghost, if the administrator hasn't changed them.
        *   **[CRITICAL] Access Admin Panel:** If the default credentials haven't been changed, the attacker gains direct access to the administrative interface.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerability in Admin Panel Functionality:**
        *   **Identify Vulnerability in Admin Feature (e.g., file upload):** The attacker finds a vulnerability within a specific feature of the Ghost admin panel, such as a file upload functionality that doesn't properly sanitize input.
        *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerability for Code Execution or Data Access:** The attacker exploits the identified vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the server (e.g., by uploading a malicious script) or to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data accessible through the admin panel.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Content through Ghost Features](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_content_through_ghost_features.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Ghost Content
    *   Identify Input Fields that Render User Content (e.g., posts, comments)
    *   Inject Malicious JavaScript to Execute in Admin or User Contexts

*   **Inject Malicious Content through Ghost Features:**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Ghost Content:**
        *   **Identify Input Fields that Render User Content (e.g., posts, comments):** The attacker identifies areas within the Ghost application where user-provided content is displayed to other users, such as blog posts or comment sections.
        *   **Inject Malicious JavaScript to Execute in Admin or User Contexts:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into these input fields. When other users (including administrators) view this content, the injected script executes in their browser. This can be used to steal session cookies (leading to account hijacking), redirect users to malicious sites, or perform actions on behalf of the victim.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Ghost Theme/Plugin Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_ghost_themeplugin_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Themes
    *   Identify Vulnerable Theme (Often Third-Party)
    *   **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Vulnerability (e.g., XSS, RCE)
*   **High-Risk Path:** Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Integrations/Plugins
    *   Identify Vulnerable Integration/Plugin
    *   **[CRITICAL]** Exploit Vulnerability (e.g., data leakage, code execution)
*   **High-Risk Path:** Upload and Install Malicious Theme/Plugin (if allowed)
    *   Gain Sufficient Privileges (e.g., compromised admin)
    *   **[CRITICAL]** Upload and Activate Malicious Code

*   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Ghost Theme/Plugin Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Themes:**
        *   **Identify Vulnerable Theme (Often Third-Party):** The attacker identifies the theme being used by the Ghost application and determines if it has any known security vulnerabilities, which are common in third-party themes.
        *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerability (e.g., XSS, RCE):** The attacker exploits the identified vulnerability in the theme. This could involve injecting malicious scripts (XSS) within the theme's templates or, in more severe cases, achieving Remote Code Execution (RCE) if the theme has server-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Installed Integrations/Plugins:**
        *   **Identify Vulnerable Integration/Plugin:** The attacker identifies the integrations or plugins installed in the Ghost application and checks for known vulnerabilities in these components.
        *   **[CRITICAL] Exploit Vulnerability (e.g., data leakage, code execution):** The attacker exploits the vulnerability in the plugin or integration. This could lead to the leakage of sensitive data handled by the plugin or, in more critical cases, allow for code execution within the context of the Ghost application.
    *   **High-Risk Path: Upload and Install Malicious Theme/Plugin (if allowed):**
        *   **Gain Sufficient Privileges (e.g., compromised admin):** The attacker first needs to gain administrative access to the Ghost application, typically by exploiting one of the admin interface compromise vectors.
        *   **[CRITICAL] Upload and Activate Malicious Code:** Once they have admin privileges, the attacker uploads and activates a specially crafted malicious theme or plugin. This malicious code can then execute arbitrary commands on the server, grant the attacker persistent access, or steal sensitive information.
