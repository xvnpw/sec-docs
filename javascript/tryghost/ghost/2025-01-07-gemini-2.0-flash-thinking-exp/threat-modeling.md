# Threat Model Analysis for tryghost/ghost

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution via Theme Vulnerability](./threats/remote_code_execution_via_theme_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker identifies a vulnerability in how Ghost's core handles theme rendering or template processing. They craft a malicious payload that, when processed by Ghost's theme engine, allows the attacker to run arbitrary code on the server hosting the Ghost instance. This could stem from flaws in Handlebars processing or how Ghost handles specific template directives.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, pivot to other systems, or disrupt the service.

**Component Affected:** Ghost Theme Engine, Handlebars integration within Ghost core.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep Ghost updated to the latest stable version, ensuring all security patches related to the theme engine are applied.
*   Ghost developers should rigorously audit and sanitize theme template processing logic.
*   Implement security mechanisms within the theme engine to prevent code injection.

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Core Ghost Functionality](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_core_ghost_functionality.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a flaw within Ghost's core codebase where user-supplied data is not properly sanitized or escaped before being rendered in administrative interfaces or within publicly accessible content served directly by Ghost (not solely within themes). This could involve vulnerabilities in Ghost's input handling or output encoding mechanisms. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code that executes in the browsers of other users interacting with the Ghost instance.

**Impact:** **High**. Account takeover of administrative users, data theft, defacement of the website, and potential spread of malware to visitors.

**Component Affected:** Ghost Core, input handling modules, output encoding functions.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ghost developers should ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized and escaped before rendering.
*   Implement robust output encoding mechanisms within the Ghost core.
*   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) as a defense-in-depth measure.

## Threat: [Insecure Deserialization within Ghost Core](./threats/insecure_deserialization_within_ghost_core.md)

**Description:** An attacker targets a part of Ghost's core functionality that handles serialized data (e.g., for caching, session management, or internal communication) without proper validation. They craft a malicious serialized object containing code that, when deserialized by Ghost, executes arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Full compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to steal sensitive data, install malware, pivot to other systems, or disrupt the service.

**Component Affected:** Ghost Core, serialization/deserialization libraries used by Ghost.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid deserializing data from untrusted sources within Ghost's core.
*   If deserialization is necessary, use secure serialization formats and libraries.
*   Implement integrity checks on serialized data before deserialization within the Ghost core.

## Threat: [Ghost Admin Interface Authentication Bypass](./threats/ghost_admin_interface_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a vulnerability in Ghost's authentication mechanism for the administrative interface. This could involve flaws in session management, password verification, or other authentication logic, allowing the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the administrative panel without valid credentials.

**Impact:** **Critical**. Full control over the Ghost instance, including content manipulation, user management, and potentially access to the underlying server.

**Component Affected:** Ghost Admin Authentication module, session management.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ghost developers should rigorously audit and test the authentication mechanisms for the admin interface.
*   Enforce strong password policies.
*   Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts.
*   Regular security assessments of the authentication system.

## Threat: [Privilege Escalation within Ghost Roles](./threats/privilege_escalation_within_ghost_roles.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in Ghost's role-based access control system. This could allow a user with limited privileges to elevate their permissions to a higher level, granting them access to functionalities or data they are not intended to access.

**Impact:** **High**. Unauthorized access to sensitive data, ability to modify critical settings, or perform actions reserved for higher-level users.

**Component Affected:** Ghost Permissions system, role management module.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ghost developers should ensure the role-based access control system is implemented correctly and securely.
*   Thoroughly test the permission boundaries between different user roles.
*   Regularly review and audit user roles and permissions.

## Threat: [Data Exposure through Ghost API Vulnerability](./threats/data_exposure_through_ghost_api_vulnerability.md)

**Description:** An attacker discovers a vulnerability in Ghost's Content API or Admin API that allows them to bypass authorization checks and access sensitive information they are not authorized to see. This could be due to flaws in the API's authentication, authorization, or data filtering logic within the Ghost core.

**Impact:** **High**. Exposure of sensitive data like user details, internal application settings, or unpublished content. This can lead to privacy violations, reputational damage, or further attacks.

**Component Affected:** Ghost Content API, Ghost Admin API, API authentication/authorization modules.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ghost developers should implement robust authentication and authorization checks for all API endpoints.
*   Ensure proper data filtering and sanitization in API responses.
*   Regular security audits of the API endpoints and authentication mechanisms.
