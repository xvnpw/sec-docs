# Attack Surface Analysis for tryghost/ghost

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Content](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_content.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by other users' browsers.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost's handling of user-generated content within posts, pages, and potentially comments (if enabled) without proper sanitization allows for the injection of malicious scripts. The use of Markdown and HTML within content creation can be a vector if not handled securely.
    *   **Example:** A malicious user creates a blog post containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`. When another user views this post, the script executes in their browser.
    *   **Impact:** Cookie theft, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, defacement, and potentially more serious attacks depending on the user's privileges.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Ghost's built-in sanitization mechanisms and ensure they are enabled and configured correctly.
        *   Implement context-aware output encoding in theme templates.
        *   Educate content creators on safe content practices and the risks of copy-pasting from untrusted sources.
        *   Regularly update Ghost to benefit from security patches.

## Attack Surface: [Theme Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/theme_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Security flaws present in custom or third-party Ghost themes.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost's theming system allows for significant customization, and themes often involve custom code and potentially insecure practices by developers. Ghost's reliance on the theme for rendering makes it a critical attack surface.
    *   **Example:** A theme contains a JavaScript file with a vulnerability that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the user's browser or make unauthorized API requests. A theme might have an SQL injection vulnerability if it directly interacts with the database without proper sanitization (though less common in typical Ghost themes).
    *   **Impact:** XSS, CSRF, information disclosure, and potentially more severe vulnerabilities depending on the theme's code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly review and audit theme code before installation.
        *   Prefer themes from reputable developers or official Ghost marketplace.
        *   Keep themes updated to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of XSS.

## Attack Surface: [API Key Exposure and Misuse](./attack_surfaces/api_key_exposure_and_misuse.md)

*   **Description:**  Unauthorized access or misuse of Ghost's API keys.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost provides Content API keys for accessing content programmatically. If these keys are exposed or compromised, attackers can read or potentially manipulate content. Integration API keys have broader permissions and their compromise is more critical.
    *   **Example:** A developer accidentally commits an Integration API key to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds the key and uses it to create malicious posts or delete existing content.
    *   **Impact:** Data breach (content access), data manipulation (content creation/deletion), denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Store API keys securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions.
        *   Avoid hardcoding API keys in code.
        *   Regularly rotate API keys.
        *   Restrict API key permissions to the minimum necessary.
        *   Monitor API usage for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure File Uploads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_file_uploads.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities related to the uploading of files through Ghost's admin interface or API.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost allows users to upload images and other media. If not properly validated, malicious files can be uploaded.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as an image. If the server is not configured correctly, this shell could be executed, granting the attacker control over the server.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, server compromise, defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict file type validation based on content, not just extension.
        *   Sanitize file names to prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.
        *   Store uploaded files in a location outside the web root or with restricted execution permissions.
        *   Utilize a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that can provide additional security layers.
        *   Regularly update Ghost and underlying server software to patch known vulnerabilities in file handling.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in Admin Actions](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_request_forgery__csrf__in_admin_actions.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers trick authenticated administrators into performing unintended actions on the Ghost site.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** If Ghost's admin interface lacks proper CSRF protection, an attacker can craft malicious requests that the administrator's browser will unknowingly execute.
    *   **Example:** An attacker sends an email to an administrator containing a link that, when clicked while the administrator is logged into Ghost, changes the administrator's password or creates a new administrative user.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure Ghost's CSRF protection mechanisms are enabled and functioning correctly.
        *   Implement anti-CSRF tokens for all sensitive administrative actions.
        *   Educate administrators about the risks of clicking on suspicious links.

## Attack Surface: [Exposed Configuration Files](./attack_surfaces/exposed_configuration_files.md)

*   **Description:**  Sensitive configuration files (e.g., `config.production.json`) are accessible to unauthorized users.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost relies on configuration files to store sensitive information like database credentials, API keys, and mail settings. Incorrect server configuration or permissions can lead to exposure.
    *   **Example:** An attacker discovers that `config.production.json` is accessible via a direct URL or through a directory listing vulnerability. They gain access to database credentials.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the Ghost instance, including access to the database and potentially the underlying server.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure configuration files are stored outside the web root and have restrictive file permissions (e.g., readable only by the Ghost user).
        *   Avoid committing configuration files to version control systems.
        *   Use environment variables for sensitive configuration where possible.
