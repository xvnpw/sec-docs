**High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving Ghost:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Post Content:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into web pages, which are then executed by other users' browsers.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost's content creation features, allowing HTML and JavaScript, can introduce XSS if input is not properly sanitized before rendering.
    *   **Example:** A malicious author includes `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` in a blog post. When another user views the post, the script executes, potentially stealing cookies or redirecting the user.
    *   **Impact:** Account compromise, data theft, defacement of the website, redirection to malicious sites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding for all user-generated content, especially when rendering HTML. Utilize Ghost's built-in helpers for content rendering.

*   **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI) via Themes:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code into template engines, allowing them to execute arbitrary code on the server.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost uses Handlebars.js for theme templating. Directly rendering user-controlled data in templates without proper escaping can lead to SSTI.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerable theme directly renders user input from a custom field into a Handlebars template like `{{{custom_field}}}` without proper escaping, allowing an attacker to inject Handlebars expressions that execute server-side code.
    *   **Impact:** Full server compromise, data breach, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Avoid directly rendering user-controlled data in templates without strict sanitization and escaping. Use secure templating practices and be cautious with custom theme development.

*   **Ghost Admin Panel Brute-Force/Credential Stuffing:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to guess administrator credentials through repeated login attempts or by using lists of known username/password combinations.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** The `/ghost` admin panel is a direct entry point for managing the application. Weak or default credentials make it vulnerable to these attacks.
    *   **Example:** Attackers use automated tools to try common passwords against the admin login form. If a weak password is used, they gain access.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to the Ghost admin panel, leading to content manipulation, data theft, and potential server compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strong rate limiting and account lockout policies for the admin login. Enforce strong password policies during user creation. Consider multi-factor authentication.

*   **Insecure API Key Management:**
    *   **Description:** API keys used for integrations are exposed or stored insecurely, allowing unauthorized access to Ghost's data and functionality.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost uses API keys for its Content API and Admin API. Leaking or insecurely storing these keys exposes the application.
    *   **Example:** An API key is accidentally committed to a public GitHub repository. An attacker finds the key and uses it to access and modify content via the Content API.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized content manipulation, potential for further system compromise depending on the API's capabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Store API keys securely using environment variables or dedicated secrets management solutions. Avoid embedding keys directly in code. Implement proper authorization and authentication for API access.

*   **Image Upload Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Description:** Attackers upload malicious files disguised as images, which can then be executed by the server or client.
    *   **How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost allows users to upload images for use in posts and themes. Lack of proper validation and sanitization can lead to malicious file uploads.
    *   **Example:** An attacker uploads a PHP web shell disguised as a JPG file. If the server attempts to process this file without proper checks, the malicious code can be executed.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, website defacement, data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement strict file type validation based on content rather than just the file extension. Sanitize uploaded images to remove potentially malicious code. Store uploaded files outside the web root if possible.
