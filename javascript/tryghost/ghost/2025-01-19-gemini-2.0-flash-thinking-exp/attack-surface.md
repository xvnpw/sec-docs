# Attack Surface Analysis for tryghost/ghost

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Ghost Admin Interface](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__in_ghost_admin_interface.md)

**Description:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into the Ghost admin panel, which are then executed in the browsers of other administrators.

**How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost's admin interface handles user input for content creation, settings, and integrations. If this input is not properly sanitized, it can be used to inject malicious scripts.

**Example:** An attacker crafts a blog post title or a custom integration setting containing a `<script>` tag. When another admin views this content or setting, the script executes, potentially stealing session cookies or performing actions on their behalf.

**Impact:** Account takeover of administrators, manipulation of content, and potential further compromise of the Ghost instance.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Input Sanitization: Implement robust input sanitization and output encoding on all data entered into the Ghost admin interface. Use Ghost's built-in helpers or secure libraries for this purpose.
*   Content Security Policy (CSP): Configure a strict CSP header to limit the sources from which the browser can load resources, mitigating the impact of injected scripts.
*   Regular Updates: Keep Ghost and its dependencies updated to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Ghost Themes](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__through_ghost_themes.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities within custom or poorly developed Ghost themes allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the browsers of website visitors.

**How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost allows for custom themes, and if theme developers don't follow security best practices, they can introduce XSS vulnerabilities in their templates or JavaScript code.

**Example:** A theme template directly outputs user-provided data (e.g., a comment) without proper escaping. An attacker submits a comment containing a `<script>` tag, which is then executed for all visitors viewing that comment.

**Impact:** Stealing user credentials, redirecting users to malicious sites, defacing the website, or performing actions on behalf of users.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure Theme Development Practices: Educate theme developers on secure coding practices, emphasizing input sanitization and output encoding.
*   Theme Audits: Conduct security audits of custom themes before deployment.
*   Utilize Secure Theme Helpers: Encourage the use of Ghost's built-in theme helpers that automatically handle output encoding.
*   Content Security Policy (CSP): Implement a CSP header to mitigate the impact of XSS vulnerabilities in themes.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Theme Uploads](./attack_surfaces/insecure_theme_uploads.md)

**Description:** Attackers upload malicious themes containing backdoors, exploits, or other harmful code.

**How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost allows administrators to upload and activate custom themes. If the upload process doesn't include sufficient security checks, malicious themes can be introduced.

**Example:** An attacker uploads a theme containing a PHP backdoor or a script that grants them unauthorized access to the server or database.

**Impact:** Full server compromise, data breaches, website defacement, and denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strict File Type Checks: Implement strict checks on uploaded theme files to ensure they are valid theme archives and do not contain executable code outside of expected theme files.
*   Static Analysis of Themes: Perform static analysis on uploaded themes to identify potential malicious code or vulnerabilities.
*   Isolate Theme Execution: If possible, run theme code in a sandboxed environment to limit the impact of malicious code.
*   Trusted Theme Sources: Encourage the use of themes from trusted sources or conduct thorough security reviews of any custom themes.

## Attack Surface: [API Authentication and Authorization Flaws](./attack_surfaces/api_authentication_and_authorization_flaws.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in Ghost's Content API or Admin API allow unauthorized access to data or functionality.

**How Ghost Contributes:** Ghost provides both a public Content API and a more privileged Admin API. Weaknesses in authentication mechanisms (API keys, session management) or authorization logic can be exploited.

**Example:** An attacker discovers a way to bypass API key validation or exploits a flaw in the authorization logic to access or modify content they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact:** Data breaches, content manipulation, account takeover, and potential denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Secure API Key Management: Store and transmit API keys securely. Implement proper key rotation and revocation mechanisms.
*   Robust Authentication and Authorization: Ensure strong authentication mechanisms are in place for both APIs and that authorization logic correctly restricts access based on user roles and permissions.
*   Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
*   Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits of the API implementation.
