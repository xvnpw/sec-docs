# Threat Model Analysis for tryghost/ghost

## Threat: [API Authentication Bypass](./threats/api_authentication_bypass.md)

**Description:** An attacker finds a flaw in Ghost's API authentication mechanism (e.g., weak token generation, insecure cookie handling) that allows them to bypass authentication and access protected API endpoints without proper credentials. This could grant them administrative privileges or access to sensitive data.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the Ghost instance, unauthorized data access, ability to create/delete content, modify settings, and potentially gain control of the underlying server.

**Affected Component:** Ghost's Admin API authentication middleware and related functions responsible for verifying API requests.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Ensure strong and secure token generation and management for API authentication.
*   Properly configure cookie security attributes (e.g., `HttpOnly`, `Secure`, `SameSite`).
*   Regularly review and audit the API authentication code for vulnerabilities.
*   Enforce rate limiting on API endpoints to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   Keep Ghost updated to benefit from the latest security patches.

## Threat: [Insecure Default Configuration](./threats/insecure_default_configuration.md)

**Description:** Ghost is installed with default settings that are not secure, such as weak default passwords for the database or overly permissive file permissions *within the Ghost installation*. Attackers can exploit these insecure defaults to gain unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Unauthorized access to the database, potential data breaches, ability to modify Ghost configuration, and potentially gain control of the server.

**Affected Component:** Ghost's installation scripts and default configuration files (e.g., `config.production.json`).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Change all default passwords immediately after installation, especially for the database user.
*   Review and harden the Ghost configuration file, ensuring appropriate security settings are enabled.
*   Set restrictive file permissions for Ghost's installation directory and configuration files.
*   Follow the official Ghost documentation for recommended security configurations.

## Threat: [Vulnerabilities in Ghost Dependencies](./threats/vulnerabilities_in_ghost_dependencies.md)

**Description:** Ghost relies on numerous third-party libraries and packages (npm dependencies). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited to compromise the Ghost application.

**Impact:** Varies depending on the vulnerability, but could include remote code execution, data breaches, or denial of service.

**Affected Component:** The `package.json` file and the specific vulnerable npm packages used by Ghost.

**Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability).

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Ghost to the latest version, as updates often include dependency updates with security fixes.
*   Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address known vulnerabilities in dependencies.
*   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool for continuous monitoring of dependency vulnerabilities.
