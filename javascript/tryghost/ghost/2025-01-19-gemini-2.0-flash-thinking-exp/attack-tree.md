## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting known vulnerabilities in Node.js dependencies to achieve RCE](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_node_js_dependencies_to_achieve_rce.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers identify and exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the third-party Node.js libraries that Ghost relies on. This often involves using outdated versions of these libraries that have known security flaws. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the Ghost application.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting vulnerabilities in Ghost core code to achieve RCE (through deserialization or template injection)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_ghost_core_code_to_achieve_rce__through_deserialization_or_template_in_f1cdac8d.md)

* **Attack Vector (Insecure Deserialization):** Attackers manipulate serialized data that the Ghost application processes. By injecting malicious code into the serialized data, they can trigger its execution when the data is deserialized by the server.
    * **Attack Vector (Template Injection):** Attackers inject malicious code into template structures (like Handlebars templates) that are processed by the Ghost application. When the template is rendered, the injected code is executed on the server.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting vulnerabilities in custom integrations or apps to achieve RCE](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerabilities_in_custom_integrations_or_apps_to_achieve_rce.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the Ghost application uses custom-built integrations or apps, vulnerabilities within this custom code can be exploited. This could involve insecure handling of user input, flawed logic, or the use of vulnerable third-party libraries within the integration.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting vulnerable database queries in Ghost core to achieve SQL Injection](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_vulnerable_database_queries_in_ghost_core_to_achieve_sql_injection.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers craft malicious SQL queries by injecting code into input fields that are used to construct database queries. If the application doesn't properly sanitize or parameterize these inputs, the malicious SQL code is executed by the database, allowing the attacker to read, modify, or delete data.
    * **Impact:** Access to sensitive data stored in the database (user credentials, content, settings), modification or deletion of data, and potentially gaining control of the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Accessing publicly exposed API keys](./attack_tree_paths/accessing_publicly_exposed_api_keys.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers find API keys that are unintentionally exposed in publicly accessible locations, such as client-side JavaScript code, configuration files committed to public repositories, or error messages. These keys can then be used to authenticate as legitimate users or applications and access protected API endpoints.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to Ghost's APIs, allowing attackers to perform actions they shouldn't, such as creating, modifying, or deleting content, managing users, or accessing sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Default Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_default_credentials.md)

* **Attack Vector:** If the default administrator credentials for the Ghost application are not changed after installation, attackers can use these well-known credentials to log in to the admin panel.
    * **Impact:** Complete administrative access to the Ghost application, allowing the attacker to control all aspects of the site, including content, users, and settings, potentially leading to further compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Uploading a malicious theme](./attack_tree_paths/uploading_a_malicious_theme.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Attackers with administrative access (or by exploiting vulnerabilities that grant such access) upload a custom Ghost theme that contains malicious code. This code can be executed on the server when the theme is activated or when administrators preview the theme.
    * **Impact:** Complete compromise of the server, allowing the attacker to access sensitive data, install malware, or disrupt services.

## Attack Tree Path: [Leverage known vulnerabilities in libraries used by Ghost](./attack_tree_paths/leverage_known_vulnerabilities_in_libraries_used_by_ghost.md)

This is a common entry point for attackers as maintaining up-to-date dependencies can be challenging.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit insecure deserialization flaws](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_deserialization_flaws.md)

This vulnerability directly leads to RCE and is often difficult to detect and prevent.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit template injection vulnerabilities (e.g., in Handlebars templates)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_template_injection_vulnerabilities__e_g___in_handlebars_templates_.md)

This vulnerability directly leads to RCE by injecting code into template rendering processes.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit vulnerabilities in custom integrations or apps](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_custom_integrations_or_apps.md)

Custom code often introduces vulnerabilities if not developed with security in mind.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject malicious SQL through user-controlled input fields (e.g., settings, post content if not properly sanitized)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_sql_through_user-controlled_input_fields__e_g___settings__post_content_if_not_prope_e5cfb884.md)

This is the primary method for exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access publicly exposed API keys (e.g., in client-side code, configuration files)](./attack_tree_paths/access_publicly_exposed_api_keys__e_g___in_client-side_code__configuration_files_.md)

This is a common and easily exploitable configuration error.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access the admin panel using default credentials if they haven't been changed](./attack_tree_paths/access_the_admin_panel_using_default_credentials_if_they_haven't_been_changed.md)

This grants immediate and complete control over the Ghost application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Upload a theme containing malicious code that executes on the server or in the browser of administrators](./attack_tree_paths/upload_a_theme_containing_malicious_code_that_executes_on_the_server_or_in_the_browser_of_administra_a88b5c87.md)

This is a critical vulnerability that allows for server compromise.
