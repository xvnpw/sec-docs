### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploiting Vulnerable Database Queries in Ghost Core to Achieve SQL Injection

**Introduction:**

The core of this attack path lies in the failure to properly handle user-supplied input when constructing database queries within the Ghost core. If the application directly incorporates unsanitized or unparameterized user input into SQL queries, an attacker can inject malicious SQL code that will be executed by the database server. This can lead to a range of severe consequences.

**Detailed Breakdown of the Attack Vector:**

1. **Identifying Vulnerable Input Points:** Attackers will look for any input fields within the Ghost application that are used to construct database queries. Common examples include:
    * **Search functionality:**  If the search terms are directly inserted into a `WHERE` clause without proper sanitization.
    * **Filtering and sorting options:**  Parameters used to filter or sort lists of posts, users, or other data.
    * **API endpoints:**  Parameters passed to API endpoints that are used to retrieve or manipulate data.
    * **Potentially even fields in the admin panel:**  While less likely due to stricter controls, vulnerabilities can exist even in administrative interfaces.

2. **Crafting Malicious SQL Queries:** Once a vulnerable input point is identified, the attacker will craft malicious SQL code designed to exploit the lack of proper input handling. Examples of common SQL Injection techniques include:
    * **Union-based injection:**  Used to retrieve data from other tables by appending a `UNION SELECT` statement.
    * **Boolean-based blind injection:**  Used to infer information about the database structure and data by observing the application's response to different injected conditions.
    * **Time-based blind injection:**  Similar to boolean-based, but relies on introducing delays using database functions to infer information.
    * **Stacked queries:**  Attempting to execute multiple SQL statements in a single request (depending on database support).

3. **Exploiting the Vulnerability:** The attacker injects the malicious SQL code into the vulnerable input field. When the application constructs the database query using this unsanitized input, the injected code becomes part of the executed query.

**Example Scenario (Illustrative):**

Let's imagine a simplified scenario where the Ghost application uses the following code to fetch posts based on a search term:

```php
// Vulnerable PHP-like code (Illustrative - Ghost uses Node.js)
$searchTerm = $_GET['search'];
$query = "SELECT * FROM posts WHERE title LIKE '%" . $searchTerm . "%'";
// Execute the query
```

An attacker could inject the following into the `search` parameter:

```
' OR 1=1 --
```

This would result in the following SQL query being executed:

```sql
SELECT * FROM posts WHERE title LIKE '%%' OR 1=1 -- %'
```

The `OR 1=1` condition will always be true, effectively bypassing the intended search logic and returning all posts. The `--` comments out the rest of the original query, preventing syntax errors.

More sophisticated injections could involve `UNION SELECT` statements to retrieve data from other tables, or `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statements to modify or delete data.

**Impact of Successful Exploitation:**

The impact of a successful SQL Injection attack on a Ghost installation can be severe:

* **Access to Sensitive Data:** Attackers can gain access to all data stored in the Ghost database, including:
    * **User credentials (hashed passwords):**  While hashed, these could be targeted for offline cracking.
    * **Content (posts, pages, settings):**  Confidential or proprietary information could be exposed.
    * **User information (email addresses, names):**  Potentially leading to privacy breaches.
    * **API keys and other sensitive configuration data:**  Allowing further access to connected services.
* **Modification or Deletion of Data:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database, leading to:
    * **Defacement of the website:**  Altering content to display malicious messages.
    * **Data corruption:**  Making the application unusable.
    * **Deletion of critical data:**  Leading to significant data loss.
* **Privilege Escalation:** In some cases, attackers might be able to use SQL Injection to gain administrative privileges within the Ghost application.
* **Potential for Remote Code Execution (depending on database configuration):**  In certain database configurations, advanced SQL Injection techniques could potentially allow attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the database server itself.
* **Denial of Service:**  Attackers could craft malicious queries that overload the database server, leading to a denial of service for legitimate users.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

Preventing SQL Injection requires a multi-layered approach:

* **Parameterized Queries (Prepared Statements):** This is the most effective defense. Instead of directly embedding user input into SQL queries, parameterized queries use placeholders for user-supplied values. The database driver then handles the proper escaping and quoting of these values, preventing malicious code from being interpreted as SQL.
    * **Implementation in Ghost (Node.js):**  Ghost likely uses an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) like Bookshelf.js or direct database drivers that support parameterized queries. Developers must ensure they are consistently using these features correctly.
* **Input Sanitization and Validation:** While not a primary defense against SQL Injection, sanitizing and validating user input can help reduce the attack surface. This involves:
    * **Whitelisting:**  Only allowing specific characters or patterns in input fields.
    * **Escaping special characters:**  Converting characters that have special meaning in SQL (e.g., single quotes, double quotes) into their escaped equivalents.
    * **Validating data types and formats:**  Ensuring that input conforms to expected types and formats.
* **Principle of Least Privilege for Database Users:** The database user account used by the Ghost application should have only the necessary permissions to perform its intended functions. This limits the damage an attacker can do even if SQL Injection is successful.
* **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** A WAF can help detect and block malicious SQL Injection attempts by analyzing incoming requests for suspicious patterns.
* **Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**  Regularly auditing the codebase and conducting penetration tests can help identify potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.
* **Keeping Software Up-to-Date:**  Ensure that Ghost and its dependencies, including database drivers, are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches.

**Specific Considerations for Ghost:**

* **Node.js Environment:**  Developers need to be aware of SQL Injection prevention techniques specific to Node.js and the database drivers used by Ghost (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite).
* **ORM Usage:**  While ORMs can help prevent SQL Injection if used correctly, developers must understand how the ORM handles input and ensure they are not bypassing its security features with raw queries.
* **Ghost's Plugin Architecture:**  If plugins are allowed, developers need to be mindful of potential SQL Injection vulnerabilities introduced by third-party code.

**Conclusion:**

Exploiting vulnerable database queries to achieve SQL Injection poses a significant threat to Ghost installations. Understanding the attack vector, potential impact, and implementing robust mitigation strategies are crucial for securing the application. The development team must prioritize the use of parameterized queries and other security best practices to prevent this type of attack. Regular security assessments and a security-conscious development culture are essential for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data within the Ghost platform.
