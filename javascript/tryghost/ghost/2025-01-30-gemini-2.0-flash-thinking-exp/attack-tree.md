## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ghost Software Vulnerabilities (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ghost_software_vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path focuses on exploiting vulnerabilities within the Ghost CMS software itself.
*   **How it Works:** Attackers target weaknesses in the Ghost codebase, which could be due to coding errors, design flaws, or outdated dependencies. Exploits can range from publicly available scripts for known CVEs to custom-developed exploits for zero-day vulnerabilities.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High. Known vulnerabilities are regularly discovered in software, and unpatched systems are common targets.
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), allowing full system compromise, data breaches, and complete control over the application.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Exploit Known Ghost Vulnerabilities (CVEs):**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Targeting publicly disclosed Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) in Ghost.
        *   **How it Works:** Attackers identify CVEs affecting the Ghost version running on the target application. They then use readily available exploits or develop their own to leverage these vulnerabilities.
        *   **Why Critical:** Known CVEs are well-documented and often have readily available exploits, making them easy to exploit if systems are not patched.
    *   **Exploit Unpatched Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Targeting known vulnerabilities in outdated Ghost installations that have not been patched with security updates.
        *   **How it Works:** Attackers identify the Ghost version and check if it's vulnerable to known, but unpatched, vulnerabilities. They then use exploits applicable to that specific outdated version.
        *   **Why Critical:** Organizations can be slow to apply patches, leaving outdated systems vulnerable to well-known attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ghost Configuration Weaknesses (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ghost_configuration_weaknesses__high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path targets misconfigurations in the Ghost CMS setup, rather than software flaws.
*   **How it Works:** Attackers look for common configuration errors like default credentials, exposed admin panels, or insecure permissions. These weaknesses provide easy entry points into the application.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High. Configuration errors are common, especially in quick setups or when security best practices are not followed.
    *   **Impact:** High. Successful exploitation can lead to full admin access, data breaches, and system compromise.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Exploit Default or Weak Credentials:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attempting to log in to the Ghost admin panel using default credentials or easily guessable/brute-forceable passwords.
        *   **How it Works:** Attackers try common default usernames and passwords (e.g., `ghost:ghost`) or use brute-force/dictionary attacks against the login form.
        *   **Why Critical:** Default credentials are a very basic but often overlooked security flaw. Weak passwords are also a common vulnerability. Successful login grants full admin privileges.
    *   **Exploit Exposed Admin Panel:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing the Ghost admin panel (`/ghost`) when it is publicly accessible without proper IP restrictions or strong authentication beyond basic login.
        *   **How it Works:** Attackers simply access the admin panel URL. If it's not protected, they can attempt to log in using weak credentials or exploit other vulnerabilities.
        *   **Why Critical:** An exposed admin panel significantly increases the attack surface. It becomes a prime target for credential attacks and a gateway to further exploitation.
        *   **Exploit other vulnerabilities via admin panel access:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Once admin panel access is gained (through any means), attackers leverage admin functionalities to further compromise the application.
            *   **How it Works:** Attackers use admin features like theme/plugin upload, code injection points, or configuration settings to introduce malicious code or gain deeper access.
            *   **Why Critical:** Admin access unlocks powerful capabilities that can be abused for complete system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Ghost Extensibility (Themes and Integrations) (High-Risk Path)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_ghost_extensibility__themes_and_integrations___high-risk_path_.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This path exploits the extensibility features of Ghost, specifically themes and plugins, which are common attack vectors in CMS platforms.
*   **How it Works:** Attackers either upload malicious themes/plugins containing backdoors or exploit vulnerabilities in legitimate but poorly secured themes/plugins.
*   **Why High-Risk:**
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium. Themes and plugins are often developed by third parties and may not undergo rigorous security reviews.
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High. Successful exploitation can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), persistent backdoors, and full system compromise.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Exploit Malicious Theme/Plugin Installation:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading and installing a deliberately crafted malicious theme or plugin containing backdoors or malicious code.
        *   **How it Works:** Attackers first gain access to the Ghost admin panel (often through compromised credentials or configuration weaknesses). Then, they upload a specially crafted theme or plugin designed to execute malicious code upon installation or activation.
        *   **Why Critical:** This is a direct and highly effective way to inject malicious code into the application. Admin panel access is the key enabler for this attack.
        *   **Gain access to Ghost admin panel:**
            *   **Attack Vector:**  As a prerequisite for malicious theme/plugin upload, gaining admin panel access is crucial.
            *   **How it Works:**  Attackers use any of the methods described in "Exploit Configuration Weaknesses" or "Exploit Software Vulnerabilities" to gain administrative privileges.
            *   **Why Critical:** Admin access is the gateway to uploading and installing themes/plugins.
        *   **Upload and install a crafted malicious theme or plugin:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** The act of uploading and installing the malicious theme/plugin itself.
            *   **How it Works:**  Using the admin panel's theme/plugin upload functionality, attackers introduce their malicious payload into the Ghost environment.
            *   **Why Critical:** This action directly introduces malicious code into the application, leading to immediate compromise upon activation or usage.
    *   **Exploit Vulnerable Theme/Plugin:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Exploiting security vulnerabilities (like XSS, SQLi, RCE) present in legitimate but poorly coded or outdated themes and plugins.
        *   **How it Works:** Attackers identify themes or plugins with known vulnerabilities or discover new ones through code analysis. They then target applications using these vulnerable components and exploit the flaws.
        *   **Why Critical:** Themes and plugins are often less scrutinized than core CMS code, making them more likely to contain vulnerabilities. Exploiting these vulnerabilities can lead to application compromise.
