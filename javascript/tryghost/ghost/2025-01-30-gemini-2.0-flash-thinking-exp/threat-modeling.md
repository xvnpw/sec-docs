# Threat Model Analysis for tryghost/ghost

## Threat: [Admin API Authentication Bypass](./threats/admin_api_authentication_bypass.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities in Ghost's Admin API authentication (e.g., token flaws, session hijacking) to gain unauthorized access. They might use crafted requests, exploit weak authentication logic, or leverage session management issues to bypass login procedures.
*   **Impact:** Critical. Full administrative access allows attackers to control all content, users, settings, and potentially the underlying server. This can lead to data breaches, website defacement, and complete system compromise.
*   **Affected Ghost Component:** Ghost Admin API, Authentication Module
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly apply Ghost security updates and patches.
    *   Implement strong password policies for all administrative users.
    *   Consider enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) if supported by Ghost or through extensions.
    *   Audit Admin API access logs for suspicious activity.
    *   Review and harden Admin API configuration based on security best practices.

## Threat: [Theme-Based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./threats/theme-based_cross-site_scripting__xss_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits vulnerabilities within a Ghost theme (often third-party or custom) to inject malicious JavaScript code. This could be through poorly sanitized theme templates, insecure handling of user input within the theme, or vulnerable JavaScript libraries used by the theme.
*   **Impact:** High. XSS can lead to session hijacking, cookie theft, website defacement, redirection to malicious sites, and malware distribution to website visitors.
*   **Affected Ghost Component:** Ghost Theme Engine, Theme Templates, JavaScript within Themes
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Carefully select themes from reputable sources and conduct security reviews.
    *   Perform code audits of themes, especially custom or modified ones, focusing on input sanitization and output encoding.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks by controlling allowed script sources and origins.
    *   Regularly update themes to patch known vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Theme-Based Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./threats/theme-based_remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **Description:** A highly critical vulnerability in a Ghost theme allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could arise from insecure template engines, vulnerable server-side code within the theme (if any), or exploitation of underlying server vulnerabilities through theme interactions.
*   **Impact:** Critical. RCE grants the attacker complete control over the Ghost server. They can steal sensitive data, install malware, deface the website, or use the server for further attacks.
*   **Affected Ghost Component:** Ghost Theme Engine, Server-Side Theme Code (if any), Underlying Server
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Avoid using themes from untrusted sources.
    *   Thoroughly audit theme code for potential RCE vulnerabilities, especially if the theme involves server-side processing.
    *   Apply strict input validation and output encoding in theme code.
    *   Run Ghost with least privilege principles to limit the impact of RCE.
    *   Keep the underlying server and Ghost dependencies updated.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities (Node.js Modules)](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities__node_js_modules_.md)

*   **Description:** Ghost relies on numerous Node.js modules (npm packages). Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can be exploited by attackers. Outdated or vulnerable dependencies are a common entry point for attacks. Attackers might target known vulnerabilities in specific npm packages used by Ghost.
*   **Impact:** Varies from Low to Critical. Impact depends on the nature of the vulnerability in the dependency. Could range from Denial of Service to Remote Code Execution and data breaches.
*   **Affected Ghost Component:** Ghost Core, Node.js Dependencies (npm modules)
*   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Regularly audit and update Ghost's dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
    *   Implement dependency scanning in the development and deployment pipeline.
    *   Monitor security advisories for Node.js modules used by Ghost and promptly update vulnerable packages.
    *   Consider using a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) to track dependencies.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) via Resource Exhaustion](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__via_resource_exhaustion.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits Ghost's architecture to cause a Denial of Service. This could involve sending a flood of requests to resource-intensive API endpoints, exploiting inefficiencies in Ghost's code to exhaust server resources (CPU, memory, database connections), or targeting the Node.js event loop to cause performance degradation.
*   **Impact:** High. Website becomes unavailable to legitimate users, impacting business operations and user experience.
*   **Affected Ghost Component:** Ghost Core, API Endpoints, Node.js Runtime, Database
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement rate limiting on API endpoints and overall request rates.
    *   Optimize Ghost's configuration and server resources to handle expected traffic and potential spikes.
    *   Monitor server performance and resource usage regularly.
    *   Use a Content Delivery Network (CDN) and caching mechanisms to absorb some DoS traffic and reduce server load.
    *   Implement web application firewall (WAF) to filter malicious requests.

## Threat: [Insecure Update Process](./threats/insecure_update_process.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the Ghost update process. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks during updates to inject malicious code, exploiting vulnerabilities in the update mechanism itself, or compromising the source of update packages.
*   **Impact:** Critical. If successful, attackers can inject malicious code into the Ghost installation during an update, leading to complete system compromise after the update is applied.
*   **Affected Ghost Component:** Ghost Update Mechanism, Update Server Communication
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Ensure Ghost's update process uses HTTPS for secure communication.
    *   Verify the integrity of update packages using digital signatures or checksums.
    *   Follow official Ghost update procedures and best practices.
    *   Restrict access to the server during the update process.

## Threat: [Delayed Patching of Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/delayed_patching_of_known_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** Administrators fail to promptly apply security patches and updates released by the Ghost team. This leaves the Ghost instance vulnerable to publicly known exploits targeting patched vulnerabilities in older versions. Attackers can easily find and exploit these known vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact:** High to Critical. Exposure to known and publicly disclosed vulnerabilities significantly increases the risk of exploitation and system compromise.
*   **Affected Ghost Component:** Entire Ghost Installation (Vulnerable Core, Themes, Dependencies)
*   **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (increases over time after vulnerability disclosure)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Establish a process for regularly monitoring Ghost security advisories and release notes.
    *   Apply security updates and patches in a timely manner, ideally within a short timeframe after release.
    *   Consider automated update mechanisms where appropriate and thoroughly tested in a staging environment first.
    *   Implement vulnerability scanning to identify outdated Ghost versions and dependencies.
