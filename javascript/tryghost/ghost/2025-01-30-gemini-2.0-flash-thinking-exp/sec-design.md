# BUSINESS POSTURE

Ghost is an open-source publishing platform focused on providing tools for creators and businesses to build and manage online publications.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a user-friendly platform for content creation and publishing.
- Offer a customizable and extensible platform through themes and integrations.
- Support various content formats and media types.
- Enable monetization options for creators through subscriptions and memberships.
- Maintain a stable, reliable, and performant platform.
- Foster a strong community around the platform.

Business Risks:
- Data breaches and data loss impacting user trust and platform reputation.
- Platform downtime leading to loss of revenue and user dissatisfaction.
- Security vulnerabilities exploited by malicious actors.
- Lack of scalability to handle growing user base and content volume.
- Dependence on community contributions for maintenance and feature development.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Regular security audits and penetration testing (based on common industry practices for open-source projects).
- security control: Secure software development lifecycle (likely follows common practices for open-source projects, including code reviews and vulnerability scanning).
- security control: HTTPS enforced for all communication (standard web application security practice).
- security control: Input validation and sanitization to prevent common web vulnerabilities (likely implemented within the application code).
- security control: Authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to the platform and content (implemented within the application code).
- security control: Password hashing and secure storage (likely using bcrypt or similar algorithms).
- security control: Rate limiting to mitigate brute-force attacks (likely implemented at the application or infrastructure level).
- security control: Regular updates and patching of dependencies and the platform itself (part of open-source project maintenance).

Accepted Risks:
- accepted risk: Potential vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
- accepted risk: Risk of community-contributed themes and integrations introducing security issues.
- accepted risk: Reliance on community for timely security vulnerability disclosures and patches.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool in the build pipeline to automatically identify and manage vulnerabilities in dependencies.
- security control: Introduce static application security testing (SAST) tools in the development and build pipeline to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the codebase.
- security control: Implement a bug bounty program to incentivize external security researchers to find and report vulnerabilities.
- security control: Enhance security awareness training for developers and contributors, focusing on secure coding practices.
- security control: Implement robust logging and monitoring for security events and anomalies.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication:
    - requirement: Secure authentication mechanisms for users (administrators, authors, subscribers).
    - requirement: Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be supported for administrators and authors.
    - requirement: Password complexity requirements and account lockout policies should be enforced.
- Authorization:
    - requirement: Role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for different user roles (e.g., administrator, editor, author, subscriber).
    - requirement: Granular permissions to control access to specific features and content.
    - requirement: Secure API authorization for external integrations.
- Input Validation:
    - requirement: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization for all user inputs to prevent injection attacks (e.g., XSS, SQL injection).
    - requirement: Use of parameterized queries or ORM to prevent SQL injection.
    - requirement: Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS attacks.
- Cryptography:
    - requirement: Use of TLS/SSL for all communication to protect data in transit.
    - requirement: Secure storage of sensitive data (e.g., passwords, API keys) using strong encryption algorithms.
    - requirement: Proper handling of cryptographic keys and secrets.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Content publishing and delivery: Ensuring content is available to website visitors without interruption.
- User authentication and authorization: Protecting access to the platform and content management features.
- Payment processing (if monetization features are used): Securely handling financial transactions.
- Data storage and backup: Protecting content and user data from loss or corruption.

Data Sensitivity:
- User credentials (passwords, email addresses): Highly sensitive, requiring strong protection.
- Content data (posts, media files): Sensitive, as loss or unauthorized access can impact reputation and business operations.
- Payment information (if collected): Highly sensitive, requiring PCI DSS compliance if applicable.
- Website analytics data: Less sensitive, but still important to protect user privacy.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:
- What specific security audits and penetration testing are performed for Ghost?
- What SAST and SCA tools are currently used in the development and build pipeline?
- Is there a bug bounty program in place for Ghost?
- What is the process for handling security vulnerability disclosures and patching?
- What specific logging and monitoring mechanisms are in place for security events?
- What are the data retention policies for user data and content?
- What is the disaster recovery plan for Ghost?

Assumptions:
- BUSINESS POSTURE: Ghost prioritizes user experience, content creation, and platform stability. Security is a significant concern for maintaining user trust and platform reputation.
- SECURITY POSTURE: Ghost follows common secure development practices for open-source projects. HTTPS is enforced, and basic input validation and authentication are implemented. There is room for improvement in automated security scanning and proactive vulnerability management.
- DESIGN: Ghost follows a typical three-tier web application architecture with a frontend, backend API, and database. Deployment is flexible and can be cloud-based or self-hosted. The build process is automated using CI/CD principles.
