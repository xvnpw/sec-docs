## Mitigation Strategy: [Regularly Update Ghost Core](./mitigation_strategies/regularly_update_ghost_core.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Subscribe to Ghost Security Advisories:** Sign up for Ghost's official security mailing list or regularly check the Ghost blog and release notes for security announcements. This ensures you are promptly informed about new releases containing security patches specific to Ghost.
    2.  **Review Ghost Release Notes for Security Fixes:** When a new Ghost version is released, carefully review the official Ghost release notes, specifically looking for sections detailing security fixes and improvements made to the Ghost core. Understand the Ghost-specific vulnerabilities being addressed.
    3.  **Test Updates in Staging Environment (Ghost-Specific Setup):** Before applying updates to your production Ghost instance, always test the update in a staging or development environment that mirrors your production Ghost setup. This helps identify potential compatibility issues or regressions specific to your Ghost configuration before they impact your live site.
    4.  **Apply Updates Using Ghost-CLI:** Use the official Ghost-CLI (Command Line Interface), the recommended tool for managing Ghost installations, to perform the update process. Follow the documented Ghost upgrade procedures provided by Ghost. This typically involves commands like `ghost update`.
    5.  **Verify Ghost Functionality and Security:** After updating, thoroughly test your Ghost application to ensure it's functioning correctly and that the security patches are effectively applied to the Ghost platform. Check for any unexpected behavior or errors within Ghost.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Ghost core software (High Severity) - Attackers can exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in older Ghost versions to gain unauthorized access to the Ghost application, manipulate Ghost content, or cause denial of service specifically targeting the Ghost platform.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in Ghost core software: High reduction - Applying Ghost updates directly patches the vulnerabilities within the Ghost codebase, significantly reducing the risk of exploitation of the Ghost platform itself.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented - Ghost provides the Ghost-CLI tool and release notes which facilitate updates. However, the *proactive* monitoring of Ghost releases and *consistent application* of Ghost updates is the responsibility of the Ghost administrator/developer.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Automated update mechanisms within Ghost itself (beyond the CLI tool requiring manual execution).  Proactive alerting within the Ghost admin panel about available security updates for Ghost core.  Consistent user adherence to Ghost update schedules.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Source Themes and Integrations from Trusted Ghost Sources](./mitigation_strategies/source_themes_and_integrations_from_trusted_ghost_sources.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prioritize Official Ghost Marketplace:** When selecting themes and integrations for your Ghost blog, first explore the official Ghost Marketplace. Themes and integrations here are generally reviewed and more likely to adhere to security best practices within the Ghost ecosystem.
    2.  **Reputable Ghost Developers/Providers:** If using themes or integrations outside the Marketplace, choose those from reputable developers or established providers within the Ghost community with a history of security consciousness in the context of Ghost development. Research the developer/provider and look for community feedback or security audits specifically related to their Ghost contributions if available.
    3.  **Avoid Untrusted Sources for Ghost Themes/Integrations:**  Exercise extreme caution when using themes or integrations for Ghost from unknown or untrusted sources (e.g., random GitHub repositories, unofficial forums). These sources are higher risk for containing malicious code or vulnerabilities that could specifically impact your Ghost site.
    4.  **Code Review of Ghost Themes/Integrations (If Possible):** For custom or less-trusted Ghost themes/integrations, if you have development expertise, conduct a code review before installation. Look for suspicious code patterns, potential vulnerabilities (like insecure handling of Ghost data or user input within the Ghost context), and unnecessary permissions within the Ghost theme/integration code.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Malicious code injection via Ghost themes or integrations (High Severity) - Malicious Ghost themes or integrations can contain code designed to steal Ghost data, inject malware into your Ghost site, or compromise the Ghost server.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities introduced by Ghost themes or integrations (Medium to High Severity) - Poorly coded Ghost themes or integrations can introduce XSS vulnerabilities within your Ghost site, allowing attackers to inject scripts into your Ghost website and potentially steal user credentials or perform other malicious actions within the Ghost context.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Malicious code injection via Ghost themes or integrations: High reduction - Sourcing Ghost themes/integrations from trusted sources significantly reduces the likelihood of intentionally malicious code within your Ghost site.
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities introduced by Ghost themes or integrations: Medium reduction - Trusted sources for Ghost themes/integrations are more likely to follow secure coding practices specific to Ghost development, reducing the chance of unintentional vulnerabilities, but vigilance is still needed within the Ghost ecosystem.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented - Ghost has an official Marketplace, which provides a degree of curation for Ghost themes and integrations. However, users are still free to install Ghost themes and integrations from anywhere, and Ghost doesn't enforce source verification for externally sourced Ghost components.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Stronger verification process for Ghost themes and integrations in the Ghost Marketplace.  Security scanning of Ghost themes and integrations before listing in the Ghost Marketplace.  Warnings within the Ghost admin panel when installing Ghost themes/integrations from outside the official Ghost Marketplace.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Utilize Ghost's Theme Security Features](./mitigation_strategies/utilize_ghost's_theme_security_features.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Theme Documentation for Security Features:** Consult the documentation of your chosen Ghost theme to identify any built-in security features it offers. This might include features like template sanitization, input validation specific to the theme's functionality, or output encoding.
    2.  **Enable and Configure Theme Security Features:** If your Ghost theme provides security features, ensure they are properly enabled and configured according to the theme's documentation. Understand how these features work within the context of your Ghost site.
    3.  **Leverage Ghost Helpers for Security:** Utilize Ghost's built-in Handlebars helpers that provide security functionalities, such as helpers for escaping output to prevent XSS vulnerabilities within your Ghost templates.
    4.  **Stay Updated with Theme Security Updates:** Keep your Ghost theme updated to the latest version. Theme updates may include security patches or improvements to existing security features. Follow the theme developer's release notes for security-related information.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within Ghost themes (Medium to High Severity) - Theme security features and Ghost helpers can help prevent or mitigate XSS vulnerabilities that might be present in theme templates or custom theme code.
        *   Data injection vulnerabilities within Ghost themes (Medium Severity) - Input validation and sanitization features in themes can help prevent data injection attacks that target theme-specific input fields or functionalities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within Ghost themes: Medium to High reduction - Effective use of theme security features and Ghost helpers can significantly reduce XSS risks within the theme layer of your Ghost site.
        *   Data injection vulnerabilities within Ghost themes: Medium reduction - Theme-level input validation can provide a good layer of defense against certain data injection attacks targeting the theme.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Theme-dependent - Implementation of theme security features is dependent on the specific Ghost theme being used. Ghost itself provides helpers, but theme developers need to utilize them.  Not consistently implemented across all Ghost themes.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Standardized security feature set across Ghost themes.  Clear guidelines and best practices for theme developers to implement security features.  Potentially, a Ghost theme certification program that includes security checks.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Ghost API Access (if applicable)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_ghost_api_access__if_applicable_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Use API Keys or Authentication Tokens (Ghost API):** When accessing the Ghost Content API or Admin API, always use the appropriate authentication mechanisms provided by Ghost, such as API keys or authentication tokens. Never expose API keys directly in client-side code or public repositories.
    2.  **Restrict API Access Based on Need (Ghost Admin API):** For the Ghost Admin API, carefully control which users or integrations are granted access. Follow the principle of least privilege and only grant access to the specific API endpoints and functionalities that are absolutely necessary.
    3.  **Use HTTPS for API Communication (Ghost API):** Ensure all communication with the Ghost APIs (both Content and Admin) is conducted over HTTPS to protect API keys and data in transit.
    4.  **Rate Limiting for API Endpoints (Ghost Configuration):** Configure rate limiting for Ghost API endpoints within your Ghost configuration. This helps protect against denial-of-service attacks and brute-force attempts targeting the Ghost APIs.
    5.  **Input Validation for API Requests (Custom Integrations):** If you are developing custom integrations that interact with the Ghost API, implement robust input validation for all API requests to prevent injection vulnerabilities that could be exploited through the Ghost API.

    *   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
        *   Unauthorized access to Ghost Content or Admin APIs (High Severity) - Without proper API security, attackers could gain unauthorized access to read or modify Ghost content or administrative settings via the APIs.
        *   API key compromise (High Severity) - Exposed or leaked API keys can allow attackers to impersonate legitimate users or integrations and access the Ghost APIs.
        *   Denial-of-service attacks targeting Ghost APIs (Medium Severity) - Lack of rate limiting can make Ghost APIs vulnerable to DoS attacks.
        *   Injection vulnerabilities via Ghost API endpoints (Medium to High Severity) - Poorly validated input to custom integrations using the Ghost API could lead to injection vulnerabilities.

    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to Ghost Content or Admin APIs: High reduction - Using API keys and access control significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized API access.
        *   API key compromise: High reduction - Secure handling and HTTPS communication protect API keys in transit and at rest (to some extent).
        *   Denial-of-service attacks targeting Ghost APIs: Medium reduction - Rate limiting makes DoS attacks more difficult.
        *   Injection vulnerabilities via Ghost API endpoints: Medium reduction - Input validation in custom integrations mitigates injection risks.

    *   **Currently Implemented:**
        *   Partially implemented - Ghost provides API key and token authentication mechanisms. HTTPS is generally expected for web traffic. Rate limiting *can* be configured, but is not enabled by default in all configurations. Input validation is the responsibility of developers using the API.

    *   **Missing Implementation:**
        *   Rate limiting enabled by default in standard Ghost configurations.  More prominent guidance within Ghost documentation on API security best practices.  Potentially, built-in input validation helpers for common API use cases within Ghost.
