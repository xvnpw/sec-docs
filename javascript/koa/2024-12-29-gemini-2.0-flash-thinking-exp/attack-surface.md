### Key Attack Surface List for Koa.js Applications (High & Critical, Directly Involving Koa)

Here's a filtered list of key attack surfaces that directly involve Koa.js and are classified as high or critical severity:

* **Attack Surface: Middleware Execution Order Vulnerabilities**
    * **Description:** The order in which middleware is added and executed in a Koa application is critical. Incorrect ordering can lead to security vulnerabilities where one middleware bypasses the intended logic or security checks of another.
    * **How Koa Contributes:** Koa's middleware system is based on a stack, where middleware is executed sequentially in the order it's added using `app.use()`. This explicit ordering is a core feature of Koa.
    * **Example:** Imagine an authentication middleware added *after* a middleware that handles user requests. An unauthenticated user could potentially access resources they shouldn't because the authentication check hasn't happened yet.
    * **Impact:** Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access, data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure middleware with broader access or fewer restrictions is executed later in the chain.
        * **Modular Middleware:** Design middleware to be self-contained and focused on specific tasks, reducing the likelihood of unintended interactions.
        * **Thorough Testing:** Implement integration tests that specifically verify the correct execution order and interaction of middleware.

* **Attack Surface: Context Object (`ctx`) Manipulation**
    * **Description:** The `ctx` object in Koa carries request and response information and is passed through middleware. If middleware or application logic makes assumptions about the integrity of `ctx` properties without proper validation, malicious actors might be able to manipulate these properties to their advantage.
    * **How Koa Contributes:** Koa provides a single `ctx` object to access request and response details, making it a central point for data manipulation if not handled carefully.
    * **Example:** A middleware might rely on `ctx.request.body.userId` to identify the current user. If a malicious user can modify this value (e.g., through a crafted request or upstream middleware), they could potentially impersonate another user.
    * **Impact:** Authorization bypass, data manipulation, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Input Validation:** Always validate data received from the `ctx` object before using it in critical operations.
        * **Immutability:** Where possible, treat data within the `ctx` object as read-only after initial processing. If modifications are necessary, create new objects or properties.

* **Attack Surface: Request Header Injection**
    * **Description:** Koa provides access to request headers through `ctx.request.headers`. If application logic directly uses these headers in responses or other operations without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious headers.
    * **How Koa Contributes:** Koa exposes request headers directly, making them readily available for use within the application.
    * **Example:** An application might use the `User-Agent` header to set a custom response header. A malicious user could send a request with a crafted `User-Agent` containing newline characters to inject arbitrary response headers, potentially setting malicious cookies or redirecting the user.
    * **Impact:** Session fixation, cross-site scripting (XSS) through header manipulation, open redirects.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Header Sanitization:** Sanitize or encode header values before using them in responses or other operations.
        * **Avoid Direct Header Usage:** Minimize the direct use of request headers in sensitive operations. If necessary, use well-established libraries that handle header encoding correctly.

* **Attack Surface: Response Header Injection**
    * **Description:** If application logic constructs response headers based on user input without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious headers.
    * **How Koa Contributes:** Koa provides methods like `ctx.set()` and `ctx.append()` to set response headers, offering flexibility but also the potential for misuse.
    * **Example:** An application might dynamically set a `Content-Type` header based on a user-provided file extension. A malicious user could provide an extension that injects other headers, leading to XSS if they can control the `Content-Type` to `text/html`.
    * **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS), session fixation, information disclosure.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Header Sanitization:** Sanitize or encode any user-provided data before including it in response headers.
        * **Use Secure Header Libraries:** Utilize libraries that help set common security headers (e.g., `helmet`) correctly and consistently.

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Cookie Setting**
    * **Description:** Koa provides methods to set cookies. If cookies are set without proper security flags, they can be vulnerable to various attacks.
    * **How Koa Contributes:** Koa's `ctx.cookies.set()` method allows setting cookies, and developers need to be aware of the necessary security flags.
    * **Example:** Setting a session cookie without the `httpOnly` flag makes it accessible to JavaScript, potentially allowing an attacker to steal the session ID through XSS. Not setting the `secure` flag means the cookie can be intercepted over insecure HTTP connections.
    * **Impact:** Session hijacking, cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Set `httpOnly` Flag:** Always set the `httpOnly` flag for session cookies and other sensitive cookies to prevent client-side JavaScript access.
        * **Set `secure` Flag:** Set the `secure` flag to ensure cookies are only transmitted over HTTPS.
        * **Set `sameSite` Attribute:** Use the `sameSite` attribute (`Strict` or `Lax`) to mitigate CSRF attacks.
