## Mitigation Strategy: [Rigorous Package Vetting and Selection (Within Atom)](./mitigation_strategies/rigorous_package_vetting_and_selection__within_atom_.md)

**1. Mitigation Strategy: Rigorous Package Vetting and Selection (Within Atom)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Before Installation (Using `apm` or Atom's UI):**
        *   **Check the Package Repository:** *Directly from Atom's package installer*, click through to the package's GitHub repository (or equivalent).
        *   **Examine the Source Code:** Look for obfuscation, unnecessary permissions (network, file system), and suspicious code patterns.  This requires opening the repository in a separate browser window.
        *   **Review Issue Tracker:** Check for open security issues or unresolved bug reports on the repository.
        *   **Assess Maintainer Activity:** Look for recent commits, active responses to issues, and a history of updates on the repository.
        *   **Check Download Counts and Stars:** Visible within Atom's package installer. Low numbers *can* be a warning.
        *   **Search for Vulnerabilities:** Use external resources (Snyk, NVD, GitHub security advisories) â€“ this is *outside* Atom, but essential before installing.
    2.  **Document Justification:** Keep a separate record (outside of Atom) of why each package was approved.
    3.  **Regular Review:** Periodically re-evaluate installed packages *within Atom's settings* (`Settings > Packages`), checking for updates and revisiting the vetting criteria.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Packages (Severity: Critical):** Packages installed *through Atom* designed to steal data, install malware, or cause other harm.
    *   **Vulnerable Packages (Severity: High to Critical):** Packages installed *through Atom* with known or unknown security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Abandoned Packages (Severity: Medium to High):** Packages installed *through Atom* that are no longer maintained.
    *   **Typosquatting Packages (Severity: High):** Packages with names similar to popular packages, installed *through Atom*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Packages:** Significantly reduces the risk. (Risk Reduction: High)
    *   **Vulnerable Packages:** Reduces the likelihood. (Risk Reduction: Medium to High)
    *   **Abandoned Packages:** Helps avoid using them. (Risk Reduction: Medium)
    *   **Typosquatting Packages:** Reduces accidental installation. (Risk Reduction: High)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Developers are *encouraged* to review packages before installing via Atom, but it's not enforced.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Formal, documented review process *before* installing any package via Atom.*
    *   *Regular, scheduled re-evaluation of installed packages *within Atom's settings*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Regular Package and Atom Updates (Within Atom)](./mitigation_strategies/regular_package_and_atom_updates__within_atom_.md)

**2. Mitigation Strategy: Regular Package and Atom Updates (Within Atom)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Atom Updates:**
        *   Enable automatic updates within Atom's settings (`Settings > Core > Automatically Update`). This is the *primary* way to update Atom itself.
        *   If disabled, manually check *within Atom* (`Help > Check for Update` or `Atom > Check for Update`).
    2.  **Package Updates:**
        *   Regularly use Atom's built-in package manager:
            *   Go to `Settings > Updates`.
            *   Click "Check for Updates".
            *   Click "Update All" or update individual packages.
        *   *Alternatively*, use the `apm update` command in Atom's integrated terminal (if enabled and configured).

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerable Packages (Severity: High to Critical):** Exploitation of known vulnerabilities in packages installed *through Atom*.
    *   **Atom Core Vulnerabilities (Severity: High to Critical):** Exploitation of vulnerabilities in the Atom editor itself.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities (Severity: Critical):** Provides the fastest mitigation once a patch is available (for both Atom and packages).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerable Packages:** Significantly reduces the window of opportunity. (Risk Reduction: High)
    *   **Atom Core Vulnerabilities:** Ensures prompt application of patches. (Risk Reduction: High)
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerabilities:** Minimizes vulnerability time after patch release. (Risk Reduction: Medium)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Atom automatic updates are enabled for most developers.
    *   Developers are reminded to update packages, but there's no enforced schedule *within Atom*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Consistent, enforced schedule for checking for package updates *within Atom's settings or via `apm`*.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Least Privilege for Packages (Within Atom's Context)](./mitigation_strategies/least_privilege_for_packages__within_atom's_context_.md)

**3. Mitigation Strategy: Least Privilege for Packages (Within Atom's Context)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Understand Package Permissions (Pre-Installation):** Before installing *via Atom*, carefully consider what the package *does*.  Atom packages inherently have broad permissions, so this is about *relative* privilege.
    2.  **Avoid Unnecessary Functionality:** If a package offers features you don't need, consider if those features increase the attack surface unnecessarily.
    3.  **Review Custom Init Scripts (Within Atom):** Ensure that custom initialization scripts (`init.coffee` or `init.js`), accessible and editable *within Atom*, do not grant excessive privileges or execute unsafe commands.
    4. **Disable/Uninstall Unused Packages (Within Atom):** Regularly review installed packages *within Atom's settings* (`Settings > Packages`) and disable or uninstall any that are not actively used.  Use Atom's UI for this.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Malicious Packages (Severity: Critical):** Limits potential damage by reducing the scope of what a malicious package *installed through Atom* can do.
    *   **Vulnerable Packages (Severity: High to Critical):** Reduces the attack surface by minimizing the number of active packages *within Atom*.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Makes it harder for a package to steal data.
    *   **System Compromise (Severity: Critical):** Reduces the likelihood (though doesn't eliminate it, due to Atom's architecture).

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Malicious Packages:** Helps contain the damage. (Risk Reduction: Medium)
    *   **Vulnerable Packages:** Reduces potential impact. (Risk Reduction: Medium)
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Makes it more difficult. (Risk Reduction: Medium)
    *   **System Compromise:** Reduces the risk. (Risk Reduction: Medium)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Developers are generally aware, but there's no formal process *within Atom*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Regular audits of installed packages *within Atom's settings* to identify and remove unnecessary ones.*
    *   *Review of custom init scripts *within Atom* for security issues.*

## Mitigation Strategy: [Configuration Hardening (Within Atom)](./mitigation_strategies/configuration_hardening__within_atom_.md)

**4. Mitigation Strategy: Configuration Hardening (Within Atom)**

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Review Atom Settings (Within Atom):** Examine Atom's settings (`File > Settings` or `Ctrl+,`) for any options that could weaken security.  Focus on settings related to:
        *   Network access (if any).
        *   External command execution.
        *   File system access.
    2.  **Secure Custom Scripts (Within Atom):** Ensure that any custom initialization scripts (`init.coffee` or `init.js`), edited *directly within Atom*, are secure.
    3.  **Avoid Storing Secrets in Configuration (Within Atom):** Do not store sensitive information in Atom's configuration files or scripts *that are accessible within Atom*.
    4.  **Keybinding Review (Within Atom):** Carefully review custom keybindings (`Settings > Keybindings`), especially those that execute external commands, to ensure they are safe.  Edit these *within Atom*.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure (Severity: Medium to High):** Prevents accidental exposure through misconfigured settings *within Atom*.
    *   **Unauthorized Access (Severity: Medium):** Reduces risk through misconfigured settings or scripts *within Atom*.
    *   **Code Execution (Severity: High):** Prevents malicious code execution through insecure custom scripts or keybindings *configured within Atom*.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Reduces the likelihood. (Risk Reduction: Medium)
    *   **Unauthorized Access:** Makes it harder. (Risk Reduction: Medium)
    *   **Code Execution:** Prevents execution through configuration vulnerabilities. (Risk Reduction: High)

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Developers are generally advised to avoid storing secrets in configuration files *accessible within Atom*.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   *Formal review process for Atom settings and custom scripts *within Atom*.*
    *   *Enforcement of not storing secrets in files *editable within Atom*.
