## Attack Tree Path: [Malicious Package [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/malicious_package__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** This is the most likely attack vector. Attackers create and distribute malicious packages that, when installed, compromise the user's system or the application being developed.

*   **Sub-Vectors:**

    *   **Install via APM/Social Engineering {CRITICAL}**:
        *   *Description:* The attacker publishes a malicious package to the official Atom Package Manager (APM) or uses social engineering techniques (phishing, compromised websites, etc.) to trick the user into installing the package directly.
        *   *Likelihood:* High
        *   *Impact:* High/Very High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium

    *   **Trojanized Package**:        
        *   *Description:* The package appears legitimate and provides useful functionality, but it contains hidden malicious code that executes in the background.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High/Very High
        *   *Effort:* Medium
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard

    *   **Package Mimicking Legitimate Package**:
        *   *Description:* The attacker creates a package with a name very similar to a popular, trusted package (typosquatting).  Users may accidentally install the malicious package instead of the legitimate one.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High/Very High
        *   *Effort:* Low
        *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium/Hard

    *   **Package with Obfuscated Malicious Code**:
        *   *Description:* The malicious code within the package is intentionally obfuscated (made difficult to understand) to evade detection by static analysis tools and manual inspection.
        *   *Likelihood:* Medium
        *   *Impact:* High/Very High
        *   *Effort:* Medium/High
        *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard
    *  **Exploit API**
        *   **Abuse Atom's Node.js Integration (e.g., child_process) {CRITICAL}**:
            *   *Description:* Atom's deep integration with Node.js allows packages to execute arbitrary system commands. A malicious package can leverage this to gain full control over the user's system. The `child_process` module is a particularly dangerous example.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* Very High
            *   *Effort:* Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard/Very Hard
        *   **to Execute Arbitrary Code**:
            *    *Description:* Final step of Node.js Integration abuse, that leads to full system compromise.
            *   *Likelihood:* Medium
            *   *Impact:* Very High
            *   *Effort:* Medium
            *   *Skill Level:* Advanced
            *   *Detection Difficulty:* Hard/Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [Dependency Vulnerability [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/dependency_vulnerability__high_risk_.md)

*   **Overall Description:** Atom and its packages rely on numerous third-party dependencies (primarily NPM packages).  If a dependency is compromised, it can introduce vulnerabilities into Atom.

*   **Sub-Vectors:**

    *   **Malicious NPM Package (Supply Chain)**:
        *   *Description:* An attacker compromises a legitimate NPM package that is a dependency of Atom or one of its packages.  This allows the attacker to inject malicious code into the supply chain, affecting all users who install the compromised dependency.
        *   *Likelihood:* Low
        *   *Impact:* High/Very High
        *   *Effort:* High
        *   *Skill Level:* Advanced/Expert
        *   *Detection Difficulty:* Very Hard
