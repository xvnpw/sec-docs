## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Application Using Atom](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_application_using_atom.md)

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents a complete breach of the application's security through Atom-related vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Exploit Atom's Core Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__exploit_atom's_core_vulnerabilities.md)

* This node represents attacks targeting the fundamental components of Atom (Chromium and Node.js). Successful exploitation here grants significant control over the Atom environment.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL] Compromise Package Supply Chain](./attack_tree_paths/_critical__compromise_package_supply_chain.md)

* This node represents attacks that undermine the trust in Atom's package ecosystem. Success here allows attackers to distribute malicious code to multiple users.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Atom's Core Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Chromium Vulnerabilities -> Target Known CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_atom's_core_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_chromium_vulnerabilities_-_target_known_cves.md)

* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the embedded Chromium version used by Atom. This is more likely if the application uses an outdated Atom version. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution within the rendering process.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Atom's Core Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Node.js Vulnerabilities -> Target Known CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_atom's_core_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_node_js_vulnerabilities_-_target_known_cves.md)

* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the Node.js runtime used by Atom. This is more likely if the application uses an outdated Atom version. Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution within the Node.js process, potentially compromising the entire application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Atom Package Ecosystem -> Exploit Package Vulnerabilities -> Target Known CVEs](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_atom_package_ecosystem_-_exploit_package_vulnerabilities_-_target_known_cves.md)

* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** Medium to High
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Description:** Attackers exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in installed Atom packages. The impact depends on the package's privileges and functionality, potentially leading to code execution within Atom's context or access to sensitive data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Atom Package Ecosystem -> Compromise Package Supply Chain -> Malicious Package Install](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_atom_package_ecosystem_-_compromise_package_supply_chain_-_malicious_package_install.md)

* **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
* **Impact:** Medium to High
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Description:** Attackers trick users into installing a malicious package disguised as a legitimate one. This can be done through typosquatting, social engineering, or by compromising package repositories. The impact depends on the malicious package's capabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Atom Package Ecosystem -> Compromise Package Supply Chain -> Compromise Package Update](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_atom_package_ecosystem_-_compromise_package_supply_chain_-_compromise_package_update.md)

* **Likelihood:** Low
* **Impact:** High
* **Effort:** High
* **Skill Level:** Advanced
* **Detection Difficulty:** Low to Medium
* **Description:** Attackers compromise the update mechanism of a legitimate package to distribute malicious updates to users. This is a more sophisticated attack but can have a widespread impact.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Interoperability with Host Application -> Command Injection in Atom Calls -> Insecure Data Passed](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_interoperability_with_host_application_-_command_injection_in_atom_calls_-_insecure_data_pas_a884af6e.md)

* **Likelihood:** Medium
* **Impact:** High
* **Effort:** Low to Medium
* **Skill Level:** Medium
* **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
* **Description:** If the application uses Atom's command-line interface or APIs and passes user-controlled data without proper sanitization, attackers can inject malicious commands. This can lead to arbitrary command execution on the server or client machine.
