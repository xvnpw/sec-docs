*   **Attack Surface: Callback Function Exploitation**
    *   **Description:**  Attackers can exploit the callback functions provided to anime.js (e.g., `begin`, `update`, `complete`) if the application allows user-controlled data to influence their execution.
    *   **How anime contributes:** anime.js allows developers to define custom JavaScript functions to be executed at various stages of the animation lifecycle. If the application dynamically constructs or executes these functions based on untrusted input, it creates a vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into a string that is later used to define an `onComplete` callback function, leading to arbitrary code execution in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), arbitrary JavaScript execution, potential data exfiltration or manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Dynamic Callback Construction:**  Do not dynamically construct callback function bodies using user-provided data.
        *   **Predefined Callbacks:** Use predefined callback functions and pass data to them as arguments instead of embedding code within the callback definition.
        *   **Secure Data Handling in Callbacks:**  If callbacks need to handle dynamic data, ensure that data is properly sanitized and validated within the callback function itself.
