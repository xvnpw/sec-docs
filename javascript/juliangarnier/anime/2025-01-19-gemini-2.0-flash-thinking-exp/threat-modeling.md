# Threat Model Analysis for juliangarnier/anime

## Threat: [Compromised CDN or Source](./threats/compromised_cdn_or_source.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains control over the CDN hosting the anime.js library or compromises the source repository. They replace the legitimate anime.js file with a malicious version containing code to steal user data, redirect users, or perform other harmful actions. When users load the application, they unknowingly execute this malicious code. This directly involves the integrity of the anime.js library being loaded.

**Impact:** Complete compromise of the application's client-side security. Potential for data theft (including session tokens, personal information), redirection to phishing sites, installation of malware, or defacement of the application.

**Affected Component:** The loading mechanism of the anime.js library, specifically when fetched from an external source like a CDN. The `<script>` tag used to include the library is the entry point for this threat.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) by adding the `integrity` attribute to the `<script>` tag when including anime.js from a CDN. This ensures that the browser verifies the downloaded file against a known cryptographic hash, preventing the execution of tampered code.
* Consider hosting the anime.js library from the application's own domain if strict control over dependencies is required.
* Regularly monitor the source and CDN for any signs of compromise or unusual activity.

## Threat: [Callback Function Exploitation](./threats/callback_function_exploitation.md)

**Description:** If the application uses callback functions provided by anime.js (e.g., `begin`, `update`, `complete`) and passes unsanitized data or allows user-controlled code execution within these callbacks, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the user's browser context. This vulnerability directly stems from how anime.js allows defining and executing these callbacks.

**Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, or defacement.

**Affected Component:** The callback functions (`begin`, `update`, `complete`, etc.) within the `anime()` configuration object, specifically when they handle external or user-provided data.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Avoid directly executing strings or user-provided code within anime.js callback functions.
* If data needs to be processed within callbacks, ensure it is properly sanitized and validated before use.
* Use secure coding practices to handle data within callbacks, treating all external data as potentially malicious.
