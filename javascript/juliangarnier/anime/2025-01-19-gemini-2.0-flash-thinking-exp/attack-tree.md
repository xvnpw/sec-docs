```

## Attack Tree Path: [Supply Chain Attack](./attack_tree_paths/supply_chain_attack.md)

**Goal:** To compromise the `anime.js` library itself or its distribution channels to inject malicious code that will affect all applications using the compromised version.

* **Critical Node: Compromise anime.js Repository**
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit GitHub Account Vulnerability**
        * **Description:** An attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to the GitHub account of an `anime.js` maintainer.
        * **Methods:**
            * Phishing: Sending deceptive emails or messages to trick maintainers into revealing their credentials.
            * Credential Stuffing: Using lists of known username/password combinations to try and log into maintainer accounts.
            * Social Engineering: Manipulating maintainers into performing actions that compromise their accounts.
        * **Impact:** If successful, the attacker can directly modify the `anime.js` codebase, injecting malicious code that will be included in future releases.

* **Critical Node: Compromise anime.js Distribution Channel (CDN/NPM)**
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit CDN Vulnerability**
        * **Description:** An attacker identifies and exploits security vulnerabilities in the Content Delivery Network (CDN) used to host the `anime.js` library.
        * **Methods:** Exploiting known CDN vulnerabilities, gaining unauthorized access to CDN infrastructure.
        * **Impact:** If successful, the attacker can replace the legitimate `anime.js` file on the CDN with a malicious version, affecting all users who load the library from that CDN.
    * **Attack Vector: Exploit NPM Registry Vulnerability**
        * **Description:** An attacker targets the NPM registry, the primary distribution channel for JavaScript packages.
        * **Methods:**
            * Compromising Maintainer Account: Gaining unauthorized access to the NPM account of the `anime.js` maintainer (similar to GitHub account compromise).
            * Exploiting Registry Vulnerabilities: Identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities in the NPM registry platform itself to publish a malicious version of the package.
        * **Impact:** If successful, the attacker can publish a malicious version of `anime.js` on NPM, which will be downloaded by developers and included in their applications.

## Attack Tree Path: [Client-Side Exploitation of anime.js Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/client-side_exploitation_of_anime_js_functionality.md)

**Goal:** To exploit the way an application uses the `anime.js` library on the client-side to execute malicious code or manipulate the application's behavior.

* **Critical Node: Exploit `innerHTML` or `textContent` Properties (Indirectly)**
    * **Attack Vector:**  The application uses the output of `anime.js` animations (e.g., animated values) to dynamically set the `innerHTML` or `textContent` of DOM elements without proper sanitization.
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts input or manipulates the application state to influence the animated values produced by `anime.js`. These values, when used to set `innerHTML` or `textContent`, contain malicious script tags or other harmful HTML.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

* **Critical Node: Inject Malicious Elements**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application uses `anime.js` to dynamically create and inject DOM elements based on user input or application state without proper sanitization.
    * **Description:** An attacker manipulates the input or application state to cause `anime.js` to inject malicious HTML elements, including `<script>` tags, directly into the DOM.
    * **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.

* **High-Risk Node: Exploit `targets` Selector**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application allows user-controlled input to influence the `targets` selector used in `anime()` function calls.
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts input that causes `anime.js` to target sensitive DOM elements that were not intended to be animated. This can lead to:
        * Information Disclosure: Animating sensitive data to make it visible or observable.
        * UI Manipulation: Disrupting the intended user interface or functionality.
    * **Impact:** Information disclosure, UI manipulation, potential for further exploitation.

* **High-Risk Node: Modify Element Attributes for Redirection**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application uses `anime.js` to modify element attributes, such as `href` or `src`, based on user input or application state.
    * **Description:** An attacker manipulates the input or application state to cause `anime.js` to change the `href` or `src` attributes of links or other elements to point to malicious websites.
    * **Impact:** Redirection to phishing sites, malware distribution, or other malicious content.

* **High-Risk Node: Trigger Unexpected Layout Shifts for Phishing**
    * **Attack Vector:** The application uses `anime.js` to animate styles in a way that creates deceptive UI elements, such as fake login prompts or overlays.
    * **Description:** An attacker manipulates the application or triggers specific animations to create convincing fake UI elements that trick users into entering sensitive information.
    * **Impact:** Credential theft, phishing attacks.
