# Attack Surface Analysis for juliangarnier/anime

## Attack Surface: [Compromised CDN Delivery](./attack_surfaces/compromised_cdn_delivery.md)

*   **Description:** If anime.js is loaded from a compromised Content Delivery Network (CDN), the attacker can inject malicious code into the served file.
    *   **How anime Contributes:** The application relies on an external source to provide the anime.js library, creating a dependency on the CDN's security.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains control of the CDN hosting anime.js and replaces the legitimate file with a version that steals user credentials or redirects users to a phishing site.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the application's client-side, leading to data theft, malware distribution, or defacement.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes in the `<script>` tag to verify the integrity of the downloaded file.
        *   Consider self-hosting the anime.js library to eliminate the dependency on a third-party CDN.
        *   Use HTTPS to prevent Man-in-the-Middle attacks that could inject malicious code during transit.

## Attack Surface: [Dynamic Property Manipulation via User Input](./attack_surfaces/dynamic_property_manipulation_via_user_input.md)

*   **Description:** When animation properties or target selectors within the anime.js configuration are directly derived from unsanitized user input.
    *   **How anime Contributes:** Anime.js allows for dynamic configuration of animations, including target elements and animation properties, which can be exploited if user input is used directly.
    *   **Example:** A user-controlled input field is used to set the `targets` selector in `anime()`. An attacker inputs a malicious selector like `img onerror="alert('XSS')"` leading to Cross-Site Scripting.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or arbitrary JavaScript execution. CSS Injection, allowing for visual defacement or data exfiltration through CSS vulnerabilities.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly using user input in anime.js configuration options like `targets`, `keyframes`, or property values.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization on any user-provided data that influences animation parameters.
        *   Use allow-lists for acceptable values instead of blacklists.
        *   Consider using predefined animation configurations and allowing users to select from a limited set of safe options.

## Attack Surface: [Security Vulnerabilities in anime.js Library](./attack_surfaces/security_vulnerabilities_in_anime_js_library.md)

*   **Description:** Undiscovered security vulnerabilities within the anime.js library itself.
    *   **How anime Contributes:** By including and executing the anime.js library, the application becomes susceptible to any vulnerabilities present within its code.
    *   **Example:** A hypothetical vulnerability in anime.js's animation parsing logic could be exploited by crafting specific animation configurations to trigger unexpected behavior or code execution.
    *   **Impact:**  Varies depending on the nature of the vulnerability, potentially ranging from minor disruptions to full remote code execution.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (can be Critical or High depending on the vulnerability)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep the anime.js library updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported issues with anime.js.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools to scan the application's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
