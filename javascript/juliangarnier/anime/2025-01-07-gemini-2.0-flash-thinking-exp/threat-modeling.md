# Threat Model Analysis for juliangarnier/anime

## Threat: [DOM Manipulation Abuse for UI Subversion](./threats/dom_manipulation_abuse_for_ui_subversion.md)

**Description:** An attacker could leverage `anime.js` to manipulate the DOM in unintended ways, altering the application's user interface for malicious purposes. This could involve hiding critical elements, displaying misleading information, or creating fake UI elements to trick users. The attacker might exploit vulnerabilities in the application's logic that allow them to control which elements are targeted by `anime.js` or the properties being animated.

**Impact:**  User deception, phishing attempts, denial of access to functionality, compromised user experience, potential for users to perform unintended actions.

**Affected Component:** The `targets` parameter of the `anime()` function, which selects the DOM elements to be animated, and the animation properties that modify the appearance and behavior of these elements.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Carefully control which DOM elements are targeted by `anime.js` animations.
*   Avoid allowing user-controlled input to directly determine which elements are animated.
*   Implement proper access controls and authorization to limit who can trigger specific animations that modify critical UI elements.
*   Regularly review the application's code to ensure that animation logic cannot be manipulated to subvert the UI.

## Threat: [Dependency Confusion/Supply Chain Attack (Indirect)](./threats/dependency_confusionsupply_chain_attack__indirect_.md)

**Description:** While `anime.js` has no direct dependencies, there's a general risk of supply chain attacks affecting the delivery or distribution of the library itself (e.g., through a compromised CDN or package registry). An attacker could replace the legitimate `anime.js` file with a malicious version.

**Impact:**  Introduction of malicious code into the application, potentially leading to data theft, unauthorized actions, or other security breaches.

**Affected Component:** The entire `anime.js` library file as it is included in the application.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Use a package manager with integrity checks (like npm with lock files or yarn).
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or other verification methods.
*   Consider using a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool to monitor dependencies (even direct ones) for known vulnerabilities and potential supply chain risks.
*   If using a CDN, ensure the CDN provider has strong security measures in place and consider using Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes to verify the integrity of the downloaded file.

## Threat: [Phishing or Deception through UI Animation](./threats/phishing_or_deception_through_ui_animation.md)

**Description:** Subtle animation techniques could be used to manipulate the user interface in a way that tricks users into performing unintended actions, such as clicking on malicious links or entering sensitive information in fake forms. This could involve animating fake login prompts, subtly changing the text or appearance of buttons, or redirecting focus using animation.

**Impact:**  Users tricked into revealing sensitive information, clicking malicious links, or performing unintended actions, leading to potential financial loss, data breaches, or malware infections.

**Affected Component:** Animation properties that control the position, appearance, and behavior of UI elements, potentially in combination with event listeners and application logic orchestrated through `anime.js`.

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement strong UI integrity checks to prevent unauthorized manipulation of critical UI elements.
*   Educate users about potential phishing tactics involving UI manipulation.
*   Avoid using animations in a way that could mimic legitimate UI elements or interactions for malicious purposes.
*   Implement security measures to prevent unauthorized modification of the application's code and assets.
