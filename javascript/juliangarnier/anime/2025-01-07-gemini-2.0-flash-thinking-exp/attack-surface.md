# Attack Surface Analysis for juliangarnier/anime

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Code Execution via Function-based Values](./attack_surfaces/client-side_code_execution_via_function-based_values.md)

**Description:** anime.js allows using functions to dynamically determine animation property values. If these functions are constructed using unsanitized user input or data from untrusted sources, it can lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution (client-side XSS).

**How anime Contributes:** anime.js will execute the provided function during the animation lifecycle, potentially running malicious code if the function is crafted maliciously.

**Example:**  A user provides input that is used to construct a function for the `translateX` property: `anime({ targets: '.element', translateX: new Function('return ' + userInput), ... });`. An attacker could input `alert('XSS')` to execute arbitrary JavaScript.

**Impact:** Full compromise of the client-side context, allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, modify the page content, and perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Avoid Dynamic Function Creation:**  Strongly avoid creating functions dynamically based on user input or untrusted data.
* **Input Sanitization (Difficult):**  Sanitizing input to prevent malicious code injection within a function is extremely complex and error-prone. It's generally better to avoid this pattern altogether.
* **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP that restricts the execution of inline scripts and `eval()`-like functions. This can help mitigate the impact of XSS even if a vulnerability exists.

## Attack Surface: [Supply Chain Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/supply_chain_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** As a third-party library, anime.js is susceptible to supply chain attacks. If the library itself is compromised (e.g., through a compromised GitHub repository or CDN), malicious code could be injected, affecting all applications using it.

**How anime Contributes:**  Incorporating anime.js introduces a dependency on an external resource.

**Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the anime.js repository and injects code that steals user credentials or performs other malicious actions.

**Impact:** Widespread compromise of applications using the compromised library.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* **Subresource Integrity (SRI):** Use SRI tags when including anime.js from a CDN to ensure the integrity of the downloaded file.
* **Verify Source:**  Ensure you are obtaining the library from a trusted source.
* **Regularly Update:** Stay up-to-date with the latest version of anime.js to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
* **Dependency Scanning:** Use tools to scan your project's dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
