# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for juliangarnier/anime

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Input Sanitization and Validation (for `anime.js` parameters)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_input_sanitization_and_validation__for__anime_js__parameters_.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Identify `anime.js` Input Points:** Pinpoint every instance where user-supplied data is passed *directly* into `anime.js` function calls, specifically targeting animation parameters.
2.  **Implement DOMPurify for `anime.js`:** Before any user input reaches `anime.js`, sanitize it using DOMPurify. Configure DOMPurify with an extremely restrictive whitelist, allowing *only* the absolute minimum HTML elements and attributes needed for your animations.  Disallow `<script>`, `<iframe>`, event handlers (like `onclick`), and ideally, inline styles.
3.  **Type Validation for `anime.js` Parameters:** Before sanitization, rigorously validate the *data type* of each `anime.js` parameter. If `duration` is expected, ensure it's a number and within a defined range. If a color is expected, validate it against a color format regex.
4.  **Whitelist Values for `anime.js`:** For `anime.js` parameters with a limited set of valid options (like `easing`), create a whitelist of allowed values (e.g., `'linear'`, `'easeInQuad'`, etc.) and reject any input that doesn't match.
5.  **Sanitize Immediately Before `anime.js` Call:** The crucial step: sanitize user input *immediately* before it's passed to the `anime.js` function. Do not sanitize earlier and store the result; sanitize right at the point of use.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `anime.js`:** (Severity: High) - Prevents malicious JavaScript from being injected through `anime.js` parameters that modify the DOM.
    *   **DOM Clobbering (indirectly via `anime.js`):** (Severity: Medium) - Reduces the risk of attackers manipulating the DOM structure through `anime.js`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Reduces XSS risk related to `anime.js` to near zero if implemented correctly.
    *   **DOM Clobbering:** Provides significant protection against DOM clobbering attacks that leverage `anime.js`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in `ProductDetails` component. DOMPurify is used, but the configuration allows `<style>` tags. Type validation is missing.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `UserComments` component: No sanitization of `anime.js` parameters.
    *   `HomePageCarousel` component: Uses an insufficient regex for sanitization.
    *   Type validation is missing in most components using `anime.js`.
    *   Whitelist validation for `anime.js` easing functions is not implemented.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Use Safer `anime.js` Animation Targets](./mitigation_strategies/use_safer__anime_js__animation_targets.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Prioritize CSS Properties with `anime.js`:** Within your `anime.js` configurations, *always* prefer animating CSS properties (e.g., `transform`, `opacity`, `width`, `height`) over directly manipulating DOM content or attributes.
2.  **Avoid `innerHTML` with `anime.js`:** Never use user-supplied data to directly set the `innerHTML` property of an element within an `anime.js` animation.
3.  **Use `textContent` and `anime.js`'s `update` Callback:** If you *must* animate text content derived from user input, leverage `anime.js`'s `update` callback function. Inside this callback:
    *   Sanitize the user input (using DOMPurify).
    *   Set the element's `textContent` property (which automatically escapes HTML) with the sanitized input.  *Do not use `innerHTML`*.
4.  **Attribute Animations (Extremely Cautious):** If animating attributes is unavoidable, be *extremely* cautious. Sanitize attribute values rigorously. Prefer `data-*` attributes over `style` or event handler attributes.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via `anime.js`:** (Severity: High) - Reduces the attack surface for XSS by limiting how user input interacts with the DOM through `anime.js`.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS:** Significantly reduces XSS risk when combined with input sanitization, specifically within the context of `anime.js` animations.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Mostly implemented in `ProductImageGallery` component (primarily uses CSS transforms with `anime.js`).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `AnimatedBanner` component: Directly sets `innerHTML` based on user input within an `anime.js` animation.
    *   `NotificationSystem` component: Animates the `style` attribute directly with `anime.js`, using user-configurable colors (without proper validation).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit `anime.js` Animation Complexity](./mitigation_strategies/limit__anime_js__animation_complexity.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Maximum Elements (for `anime.js` calls):** Set a reasonable limit on the number of DOM elements that can be animated *simultaneously* in a single `anime.js` call triggered by user input.
2.  **`anime.js` Duration and Delay Limits:** Impose maximum values for the `duration` and `delay` properties within `anime.js` configurations. Prevent extremely long or infinite animations initiated by user input.
3.  **`anime.js` Easing Restrictions:** Limit the complexity of easing functions used in `anime.js`. Avoid allowing users to define custom easing functions. Use a whitelist of predefined `anime.js` easing functions.
4.  **`anime.js` Iteration Limits:** Restrict the number of `iterations` an `anime.js` animation can run, especially if triggered by user input. Prevent infinite loops.
5.  **Value Range Validation for `anime.js`:** For numerical `anime.js` parameters (e.g., `translateX`, `scale`), validate that user-provided values fall within a safe and reasonable range.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS) via `anime.js`:** (Severity: Medium) - Prevents attackers from overwhelming the browser with computationally expensive `anime.js` animations.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **DoS:** Significantly reduces the risk of client-side DoS attacks specifically targeting `anime.js`.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   A basic `duration` limit is implemented globally for `anime.js`, but it's too high (10 seconds).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   No limits on the number of elements animated by a single `anime.js` call.
    *   No restrictions on `anime.js` easing functions.
    *   No limits on `anime.js` animation iterations.
    *   No value range validation for most numerical `anime.js` parameters.
