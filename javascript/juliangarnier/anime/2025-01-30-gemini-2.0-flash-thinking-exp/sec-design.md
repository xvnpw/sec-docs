# BUSINESS POSTURE

This project, the 'anime' JavaScript animation library, aims to provide a flexible, lightweight, and easy-to-use animation engine for web developers.

- Business Priorities and Goals:
  - Provide a high-performance JavaScript animation library.
  - Ensure broad compatibility across modern web browsers.
  - Offer a simple and intuitive API for developers to create complex animations.
  - Maintain a small library size to minimize page load times.
  - Foster an active community for support and contributions.
  - Provide comprehensive documentation and examples.

- Business Risks:
  - Security vulnerabilities within the library could be exploited in web applications that utilize it, potentially leading to cross-site scripting (XSS) or other client-side attacks.
  - Performance bottlenecks in the animation engine could negatively impact the user experience of websites and applications using the library.
  - Lack of ongoing maintenance and updates could lead to compatibility issues with newer browsers or security vulnerabilities remaining unpatched.
  - Poor documentation or a difficult-to-use API could limit adoption and developer satisfaction.
  - Dependency on external libraries or tools that become outdated or insecure.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Security Controls:
  - security control: Code is publicly available on GitHub for community review (Location: GitHub Repository).
  - security control: Basic JavaScript linting might be in place during development (Assumption: Based on common JavaScript development practices, but not explicitly stated in the repository).

- Accepted Risks:
  - accepted risk: As an open-source project, in-depth security audits and penetration testing are not routinely performed.
  - accepted risk: Vulnerability disclosure process might be informal and rely on community reporting.
  - accepted risk: Security updates might be driven by community contributions rather than dedicated security team.

- Recommended Security Controls:
  - security control: Implement automated Static Application Security Testing (SAST) in the build pipeline to identify potential code-level vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Introduce Dependency Scanning to monitor and alert on known vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
  - security control: Establish a clear vulnerability disclosure policy and security contact information for security researchers to report issues.
  - security control: Conduct periodic, lightweight security code reviews, focusing on common web security vulnerabilities.
  - security control: Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers in example and documentation websites to mitigate potential XSS risks for users viewing these resources.

- Security Requirements:
  - Authentication: Not applicable for the library itself, as it is a client-side animation engine. Authentication is relevant for systems that *use* this library and need to secure access to their applications.
  - Authorization: Not applicable for the library itself. Authorization is relevant for systems that *use* this library and need to control user permissions within their applications.
  - Input Validation: While the library primarily handles numerical and string inputs for animation parameters, ensure robust input validation within the library's API to prevent unexpected behavior or potential vulnerabilities if users provide malformed input. This is especially important if the library processes user-provided data to generate animations.
  - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core functionality of an animation library. However, if future features involve handling sensitive data (which is not the current scope), appropriate cryptographic measures would be necessary. For now, ensure no accidental introduction of cryptographic functionalities that are not properly implemented, as this can introduce vulnerabilities.

## DEPLOYMENT

Deployment of the 'anime' JavaScript library itself is primarily about making it available to web developers. Web applications then deploy and utilize this library as part of their own deployment process. Here we focus on how the library is made available.

Deployment Options:
1. **npm Package Registry**: Published as an npm package, allowing developers to install it using package managers like npm or yarn.
2. **CDN Hosting**: Hosted on CDNs, allowing developers to include it in their web pages via a CDN URL.
3. **Direct Download**: Available for direct download from the GitHub repository or website, allowing developers to host it themselves.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical Business Processes:
  - For the 'anime' library itself, the critical process is maintaining the integrity and availability of the library for web developers.
  - For organizations using the 'anime' library, the critical business processes are the functionalities of their web applications that rely on animations to deliver user experience or business logic.

- Data Sensitivity:
  - The 'anime' library itself does not directly handle sensitive data.
  - However, web applications using the library might handle sensitive user data. In this context, a vulnerability in the 'anime' library could potentially be exploited within a web application to access or manipulate sensitive data processed by that application (e.g., through XSS if the library is misused or has a vulnerability that allows it). The sensitivity of data depends on the specific web application using the library, not the library itself. The library should be designed to minimize any potential for misuse that could lead to data security issues in consuming applications.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- Questions:
  - Is there an existing vulnerability disclosure policy for the 'anime' library?
  - Are there any automated security checks currently in place in the build process (e.g., linting, testing, security scanning)?
  - What is the process for managing and updating dependencies of the 'anime' library?
  - Are there any plans to conduct formal security audits or penetration testing of the library?

- Assumptions:
  - The 'anime' library is primarily used in client-side web applications.
  - The project is open-source and community-driven, with potentially limited resources for dedicated security efforts.
  - Security is currently addressed through community contributions and standard open-source development practices, but there might be room for improvement in formal security processes and controls.
  - The main security risks are related to potential vulnerabilities in the library code that could be exploited in web applications using it, primarily client-side vulnerabilities like XSS.
