# Threat Model Analysis for juliangarnier/anime

## Threat: [Compromised CDN or Distribution Point](./threats/compromised_cdn_or_distribution_point.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a Content Delivery Network (CDN) or another external source from which `anime.js` is loaded. They replace the legitimate `anime.js` file with a malicious version containing embedded JavaScript code. When users access the application, their browsers download and execute this compromised `anime.js` file. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the user's browser context, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or redirection to malicious websites.

**Impact:** High - Full compromise of client-side application functionality, potential for sensitive user data breach, user redirection to attacker-controlled sites, significant reputational damage to the application.

**Affected Anime.js Component:** Distribution mechanism (CDN, external hosting infrastructure).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement Subresource Integrity (SRI) attributes in the `<script>` tag when including `anime.js` from a CDN. This ensures the browser verifies the integrity of the downloaded file.
*   Host `anime.js` locally on the application's own servers. This eliminates reliance on third-party CDNs and provides greater control over the library's integrity.
*   Verify the checksum (e.g., SHA-256 hash) of the `anime.js` file against a known good checksum from a trusted source if downloading manually.

## Threat: [XSS Vulnerabilities within `anime.js`](./threats/xss_vulnerabilities_within__anime_js_.md)

**Description:**  A hypothetical Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists within the `anime.js` library's code itself. An attacker could discover and exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific animation parameters or input data that, when processed by `anime.js`, causes the library to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser. This could be achieved by manipulating animation properties or data structures that are not properly sanitized by the library.

**Impact:** High - Full client-side compromise, ability for the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in users' browsers, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, defacement of the application, and further attacks against users.

**Affected Anime.js Component:** Core `anime.js` library code (hypothetical vulnerability within modules responsible for parsing animation parameters or manipulating DOM).

**Risk Severity:** High (though probability is low for a mature library, the impact is critical if it occurs)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Keep `anime.js` updated to the latest version. Regularly update the library to benefit from security patches and bug fixes released by the maintainers.
*   Monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases for any reported vulnerabilities related to `anime.js`.
*   Conduct thorough code reviews of the application's integration with `anime.js`, focusing on how animation parameters and data are passed to the library, to identify any potential areas of vulnerability.
