# Attack Surface Analysis for juliangarnier/anime

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Dependency Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/client-side_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:**  Third-party libraries like `anime.js` can contain security vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit.
*   **How anime.js Contributes:**  By including `anime.js`, the application's security posture becomes dependent on the library's code. A vulnerability in `anime.js` directly exposes applications using it.
*   **Example:** A critical vulnerability is discovered in `anime.js` that allows for arbitrary JavaScript execution when processing a specially crafted animation configuration. Applications using the vulnerable version are immediately at risk if they handle external animation data or are targeted by an attacker exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Impact:**  Remote Code Execution (RCE) in the user's browser, leading to complete compromise of the client-side application context. This can result in session hijacking, data theft, malware injection, and full control over the user's interaction with the application.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Immediate Updates:**  Apply security patches and update to the latest version of `anime.js` as soon as vulnerabilities are disclosed and fixes are available.
    *   **Proactive Monitoring:**  Continuously monitor security advisories and vulnerability databases related to `anime.js` and its dependencies.
    *   **Automated Dependency Scanning:**  Integrate automated dependency scanning tools into the development pipeline to detect vulnerable versions of `anime.js` before deployment.
    *   **Subresource Integrity (SRI) with Vigilance:** While SRI protects against CDN tampering, it's crucial to update SRI hashes whenever `anime.js` is updated to a patched version.

## Attack Surface: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Animation Properties (Indirect)](./attack_surfaces/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_animation_properties__indirect_.md)

*   **Description:**  Improper handling of user-controlled data used in conjunction with `anime.js` can indirectly create Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
*   **How anime.js Contributes:**  `anime.js`'s core functionality is to manipulate the DOM based on provided animation properties, including targeting elements. If these properties are dynamically constructed using unsanitized user input, it opens a pathway for XSS injection.
*   **Example:** An application allows users to define custom CSS selectors to target elements for animation. If this user-provided selector is not sanitized, an attacker could inject a malicious selector like `*,[attribute=value]onerror=alert('XSS')` (or similar variations). When `anime.js` processes this selector, it could inadvertently trigger the `onerror` event on matched elements, executing the injected JavaScript.
*   **Impact:**  Full Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser within the application's context. This allows for session hijacking, cookie theft, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, sensitive data exfiltration, and other malicious actions.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization and Validation:**  Thoroughly sanitize and validate *all* user-provided data before using it to construct `anime.js` animation properties, especially the `targets` property and any properties that could indirectly manipulate DOM attributes or content. Use context-aware output encoding where appropriate.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Selectors:**  Avoid directly using user input to construct broad or dynamic CSS selectors. If possible, use predefined, controlled selectors or safer DOM manipulation methods.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a robust Content Security Policy to significantly reduce the impact of XSS vulnerabilities, even if they are indirectly introduced through animation logic. Use directives like `script-src` and `style-src` to restrict script execution and style application to trusted sources only.
    *   **Regular Security Code Reviews:** Conduct regular security code reviews, specifically focusing on areas where user input interacts with `anime.js` and DOM manipulation logic.
