## Mitigation Strategy: [Sanitize User-Provided Data in Animations](./mitigation_strategies/sanitize_user-provided_data_in_animations.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Sanitize User-Provided Data in Animations
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify User Input Points for Anime.js:** Pinpoint all locations in your application's code where user-provided data (from forms, URLs, APIs, etc.) is used to configure `anime.js` animations. This includes animation properties like `targets` (element selectors), animation `values`, `easing` functions if dynamically chosen based on user input, and any other animation parameters influenced by user data.
    2.  **Input Validation and Sanitization Specific to Anime.js Context:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization tailored to the context of `anime.js` configurations.  For example, if user input is used to construct CSS selectors for `targets`, ensure it's sanitized to prevent CSS injection vulnerabilities. If user input dictates animation values, validate the data type and range to prevent unexpected behavior or potential exploits.
    3.  **Output Encoding/Escaping for Anime.js Configurations:** When incorporating user input into `anime.js` configuration objects, especially for properties that manipulate DOM elements or attributes, use appropriate output encoding or escaping techniques.  For instance, if user input is used to dynamically set attribute values via `anime.js`, HTML-encode the input to prevent XSS.
    4.  **Review Anime.js Configuration Logic for Injection Risks:** Conduct code reviews specifically examining how `anime.js` configurations are built dynamically. Pay close attention to areas where user input directly influences selectors, property values, or function-based values within `anime.js` to identify potential injection points.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Anime.js Configuration (High Severity):**  If user input is not properly sanitized and is directly used in `anime.js` configurations (especially in `targets` selectors or property values), attackers can inject malicious scripts. This can occur if an attacker can manipulate user input to inject malicious CSS selectors or attribute values that, when processed by `anime.js`, lead to unintended script execution or DOM manipulation.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS via Anime.js Configuration:** Significantly reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities arising from the dynamic configuration of `anime.js` animations based on user input. Proper sanitization and validation prevent attackers from injecting malicious code through animation parameters.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Partially implemented. We have general input validation, but specific sanitization for user input used *within* `anime.js` configurations needs focused attention.
    *   Location: Input handling functions in front-end JavaScript code, form validation logic, but needs specific checks for `anime.js` usage contexts.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Missing dedicated sanitization and encoding specifically for user input that is used to construct `anime.js` animation configurations. A review is needed to identify all instances where user input influences `anime.js` and implement context-aware sanitization for these specific scenarios.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Careful Use of Function-Based Values in Anime.js](./mitigation_strategies/careful_use_of_function-based_values_in_anime_js.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Careful Use of Function-Based Values in Anime.js
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Scrutinize Logic in Anime.js Function Values:** Thoroughly examine the code within any function-based values used in `anime.js` configurations. This includes functions used for properties like `translateX`, `rotate`, dynamic `values`, `update`, `begin`, `complete` callbacks, and other dynamic animation logic within `anime.js`.
    2.  **Secure External Data Access in Anime.js Functions:** If these functions rely on external data sources or user input, ensure that data access is performed securely and with validation. Avoid directly using unsanitized external data within these functions that are part of `anime.js` configurations.
    3.  **Minimize DOM Manipulation within Anime.js Functions:** Limit DOM manipulation directly within function-based values in `anime.js`, especially if this manipulation is based on external or user-provided data. If DOM manipulation is necessary within these functions, ensure it is done safely and with appropriate sanitization if needed to prevent unintended side effects or vulnerabilities.
    4.  **Avoid Unsafe JavaScript Constructs in Anime.js Functions:**  Absolutely avoid using `eval()` or similar unsafe JavaScript constructs to dynamically execute code based on user input or external data within `anime.js` function-based values. This practice introduces a significant XSS risk within the animation logic itself.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Anime.js Function Values (High Severity):**  Improperly implemented function-based values in `anime.js` configurations can become injection points for malicious code. If these functions rely on unsanitized external data or user input, attackers could inject and execute malicious scripts within the animation context.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **XSS via Anime.js Function Values:** Reduces the risk of XSS vulnerabilities originating from dynamically defined animation logic within `anime.js`. Careful review and secure implementation of function-based values minimize the potential for XSS through this specific feature of the library.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Partially implemented. We generally avoid `eval()` and similar unsafe practices, but a specific security review focusing on function-based values *in the context of `anime.js`* is required.
    *   Location: JavaScript code where `anime.js` animations are defined, specifically where function-based values are utilized for animation properties or callbacks.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Missing a dedicated security review of all function-based values used in `anime.js` animations. This review should specifically assess whether these functions are implemented securely and do not inadvertently create injection vulnerabilities or rely on unsafe data handling practices.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Limit Animation Complexity and Duration in Anime.js Usage](./mitigation_strategies/limit_animation_complexity_and_duration_in_anime_js_usage.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Limit Animation Complexity and Duration in Anime.js Usage
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Establish Anime.js Animation Complexity Guidelines:** Define clear guidelines for animation complexity when using `anime.js`. This could include restrictions on the number of animated properties per element, the maximum number of elements animated concurrently using `anime.js`, or limitations on the use of computationally intensive easing functions within `anime.js` animations.
    2.  **Set Duration Limits for Anime.js Animations:** Implement maximum duration limits specifically for animations created with `anime.js`, particularly for animations triggered by user interactions or events. Prevent the creation of excessively long `anime.js` animations that could tie up client-side resources for extended periods, potentially impacting performance and user experience.
    3.  **Optimize Anime.js Animation Properties for Performance:** When designing animations with `anime.js`, prioritize the use of efficient animation properties. For example, favor CSS transforms (like `translateX`, `scale`, `rotate`) over properties that trigger layout reflows (like `width`, `height`, `top`, `left`) when animating element position or size using `anime.js`. This optimization is specific to how animations are constructed with the library.
    4.  **Performance Testing of Anime.js Animations:** Regularly test the performance of animations created with `anime.js` on a range of devices and browsers, especially on lower-powered devices. This testing should specifically focus on identifying and addressing performance bottlenecks introduced by `anime.js` animations.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Anime.js (Medium Severity):**  Overly complex or long-running animations created with `anime.js` can consume excessive client-side resources (CPU, memory), potentially leading to a Denial of Service for the user, especially on less powerful devices or browsers. This DoS risk is directly related to how animations are designed and used with `anime.js`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side DoS via Anime.js:** Reduces the risk of client-side DoS caused by resource-intensive `anime.js` animations. Limiting complexity and duration prevents resource exhaustion specifically related to animation processing and ensures animations are performant without negatively impacting user experience or device stability.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Partially implemented. We have general performance considerations in animation design, but no explicit, enforced limits on `anime.js` animation complexity or duration are in place.
    *   Location: Animation design guidelines, front-end performance optimization practices, but needs to be more specific to `anime.js` usage.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Missing explicit policies and technical controls to limit `anime.js` animation complexity and duration. Need to define specific limits tailored to `anime.js` usage and potentially implement mechanisms to enforce them (e.g., configuration options, code reviews specifically focused on `anime.js` animation performance and complexity).

## Mitigation Strategy: [Throttle Anime.js Animation Triggers](./mitigation_strategies/throttle_anime_js_animation_triggers.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Throttle Anime.js Animation Triggers
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify Rapid Trigger Events for Anime.js Animations:** Identify specific events within your application that can trigger `anime.js` animations rapidly and repeatedly, such as `mousemove`, `scroll`, `resize`, `keyup`, etc., and which are used to initiate animations created with `anime.js`.
    2.  **Implement Throttling or Debouncing for Anime.js Animation Triggers:** Use throttling or debouncing techniques in JavaScript to limit the rate at which `anime.js` animations are triggered by these rapid events. This is specifically about controlling the *initiation* of animations created with `anime.js`.
        *   **Throttling for Anime.js:** Execute the `anime.js` animation trigger function at most once within a specified time interval, preventing excessive animation starts.
        *   **Debouncing for Anime.js:** Delay the execution of the `anime.js` animation trigger function until after a certain period of inactivity of the triggering event, ensuring animations are not started too frequently.
    3.  **Choose Technique Appropriate for Anime.js Animation Behavior:** Select throttling or debouncing based on the specific event and the desired animation behavior in the context of `anime.js`. Throttling is suitable when you need to periodically respond to events with animations, while debouncing is better when you only need to trigger an animation after a period of event inactivity.
*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Denial of Service (DoS) via Excessive Anime.js Animations (Medium Severity):**  Rapidly firing events can trigger `anime.js` animations excessively, leading to resource exhaustion and client-side DoS. This is specifically about DoS caused by *over-triggering* animations created with `anime.js`.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side DoS via Excessive Anime.js Animations:** Reduces the risk of client-side DoS caused by over-triggering `anime.js` animations. Throttling or debouncing prevents excessive animation starts, mitigating the potential for resource exhaustion and improving performance, especially during rapid user interactions that could otherwise lead to a flood of `anime.js` animation requests.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Partially implemented. Throttling/debouncing is used in some areas for general performance optimization, but not consistently applied to all event handlers that trigger *`anime.js` animations specifically*.
    *   Location: Event handlers in JavaScript code, particularly for events like `scroll` and `resize`, but needs to be specifically reviewed for `anime.js` animation triggers.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Hypothetical Project - Missing systematic application of throttling/debouncing to all relevant event triggers that initiate `anime.js` animations. Need to review event handlers that start `anime.js` animations and implement throttling/debouncing where rapid event firing could lead to performance issues or potential DoS due to animation overload.
