## High-Risk Sub-Tree: Compromising Application Using 'natives'

**Attacker's Goal:** Achieve arbitrary code execution within the application's Node.js process with the privileges of the application.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application Using 'natives' Library
    * OR Exploit 'natives' API Directly
        * ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** AND Module Name Injection **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Application uses user-controlled input to determine module name
                * Attacker manipulates input to load malicious or unexpected internal module
                    * **CRITICAL NODE** Achieve arbitrary code execution via the loaded module (e.g., 'process', 'child_process')
        * ***HIGH-RISK PATH*** AND Access Control Issues within Application Logic **CRITICAL NODE**
            * Application grants access to overly powerful internal modules unnecessarily
                * Attacker leverages exposed powerful modules (e.g., 'process', 'fs', 'module')
                    * **CRITICAL NODE** Execute arbitrary commands on the server (via 'process')
                    * **CRITICAL NODE** Read or write arbitrary files (via 'fs')
    * OR Exploit Vulnerabilities in Internal Modules Exposed by 'natives'
        * AND Known Vulnerabilities in Internal Modules
            * A specific internal module accessible via 'natives' has a known vulnerability
                * Attacker targets this vulnerability through the application's use of 'natives'
                    * **CRITICAL NODE** Achieve arbitrary code execution or information disclosure

**Detailed Breakdown of High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path 1: Exploit 'natives' API Directly -> Module Name Injection -> Achieve arbitrary code execution**

* **Attack Vector:** Module Name Injection
    * **Description:** The application uses user-controlled input (e.g., query parameters, form data, API requests) to determine which internal Node.js module to load using the `natives` library.
    * **Critical Node:** Achieve arbitrary code execution via the loaded module
        * **Description:** An attacker successfully manipulates the input to load a malicious or unexpected internal module (e.g., 'process', 'child_process'). By interacting with the loaded module's API, the attacker can execute arbitrary code within the application's Node.js process with the application's privileges.
        * **Example:** Setting a query parameter `moduleName` to `'process'` and then using the loaded `process` module to spawn a shell command.

**High-Risk Path 2: Exploit 'natives' API Directly -> Access Control Issues within Application Logic -> Execute arbitrary commands on the server / Read or write arbitrary files**

* **Attack Vector:** Access Control Issues within Application Logic
    * **Description:** The application's logic grants access to overly powerful internal Node.js modules (e.g., 'process', 'fs') through the `natives` library without sufficient security controls or restrictions.
    * **Critical Node:** Execute arbitrary commands on the server (via 'process')
        * **Description:** The application exposes the 'process' internal module (or a subset of its functionality) in a way that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the application's privileges.
        * **Example:** An API endpoint that uses `natives` to access `process` and allows execution of commands based on user-provided input without proper sanitization.
    * **Critical Node:** Read or write arbitrary files (via 'fs')
        * **Description:** The application exposes the 'fs' internal module (or a subset of its functionality) in a way that allows an attacker to read or write arbitrary files on the server's file system. This could lead to data breaches, modification of application files, or even remote code execution by writing malicious code to accessible locations.
        * **Example:** An API endpoint that uses `natives` to access `fs` and performs file operations based on user-provided file paths without proper validation.

**Critical Nodes (Standalone):**

* **Achieve arbitrary code execution or information disclosure (via Known Vulnerabilities):**
    * **Description:** A specific internal Node.js module accessible through `natives` has a known, unpatched vulnerability. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability through the application's use of `natives` to achieve arbitrary code execution within the application's process or to gain access to sensitive information.
    * **Example:** An older version of Node.js with a known vulnerability in the `vm` module being accessed by the application via `natives`.
