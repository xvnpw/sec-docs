* **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data from Internal Modules
    * **Description:** An attacker could leverage `natives` to directly access internal Node.js modules that contain sensitive information such as API keys, database credentials, internal configuration details, or temporary secrets. They might then exfiltrate this data for malicious purposes. The direct access provided by `natives` bypasses intended security boundaries.
    * **Impact:** Data breach, unauthorized access to external services, compromise of internal systems, reputational damage, financial loss.
    * **Affected Component:** `require()` function within `natives` allowing direct access to various internal modules (e.g., `process`, `crypto`, `fs`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Avoid using `natives` if possible. Explore supported Node.js APIs.
        * If `natives` is necessary, restrict its usage to the absolute minimum required modules.
        * Implement strict access controls within the application to limit where `natives` can be used.
        * Regularly audit the codebase for any usage of `natives` and its potential to expose sensitive data.
        * Employ secrets management solutions to avoid hardcoding sensitive information, even within internal modules.

* **Threat:** Modification of Internal Application Behavior
    * **Description:** An attacker could use `natives` to directly access and manipulate the state or functions of internal Node.js modules, altering the application's intended behavior. This direct manipulation, facilitated by `natives`, can bypass normal application logic and security checks. This could involve changing internal flags, overriding functions, or injecting malicious logic.
    * **Impact:** Application malfunction, unexpected behavior, data corruption, security bypasses, potential for remote code execution if manipulated functions are involved in critical operations.
    * **Affected Component:**  `require()` function and the ability to directly access and potentially modify properties and methods of loaded internal modules via `natives`.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Minimize the use of `natives`.
        * Implement strong input validation and sanitization to prevent attackers from indirectly influencing the behavior of internal modules.
        * Employ code integrity checks to detect unauthorized modifications to application code or internal module states.
        * Regularly review code that uses `natives` for potential manipulation vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using immutable data structures where possible to limit the ability to modify internal state.

* **Threat:** Elevation of Privilege within the Node.js Process
    * **Description:** An attacker could utilize `natives` to directly access internal modules that provide privileged functionalities or bypass standard security checks within the Node.js process. The direct access granted by `natives` allows bypassing intended authorization mechanisms. This could allow them to perform actions they are not normally authorized to do, such as accessing restricted resources or executing privileged operations.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to system resources, potential for further system compromise, ability to bypass application-level security controls.
    * **Affected Component:** `require()` function within `natives` and specific internal modules that handle permissions or access control within the Node.js environment.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Adhere to the principle of least privilege when designing the application and its interactions with internal modules.
        * Carefully review the capabilities of any internal modules accessed via `natives` and ensure they do not grant unintended privileges.
        * Implement strong authorization checks within the application logic, even when interacting with internal modules.
        * Consider running the Node.js process with the minimum necessary privileges.
