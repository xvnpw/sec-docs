## Threat Model: Attack Tree Analysis for Applications Using `string_decoder` - High-Risk Focus

**Objective:** Cause Application-Level Impact through Exploitation of `string_decoder` Behavior.

**High-Risk Sub-Tree:**

* Compromise Application using string_decoder **(CRITICAL NODE)**
    * Supply Malicious Input to Decoder **(CRITICAL NODE, HIGH-RISK PATH START)**
        * Cause Incorrect Decoding **(CRITICAL NODE)**
            * Supply Incomplete Multibyte Sequence **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            * Supply Invalid UTF-8 Sequence **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            * Supply Mixed Encodings (if application doesn't enforce a single encoding) **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        * Exploit Encoding Assumptions **(HIGH-RISK PATH START)**
            * Application assumes UTF-8, but input is in a different encoding with overlapping byte sequences **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            * Application uses a less strict encoding, allowing for characters that could be misinterpreted in UTF-8 after decoding **(HIGH-RISK PATH)**

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Critical Nodes:**

* **Compromise Application using string_decoder:**
    * Attacker's ultimate goal is to negatively impact the application by exploiting weaknesses in how it uses the `string_decoder` library. This could manifest in various ways, such as data corruption, logic errors, security breaches, or denial of service.

* **Supply Malicious Input to Decoder:**
    * This is a crucial step where the attacker introduces data specifically crafted to exploit vulnerabilities in the `string_decoder` or the application's handling of its output. This input aims to cause incorrect decoding or leverage encoding assumptions.

* **Cause Incorrect Decoding:**
    * The attacker aims to manipulate the input in a way that the `string_decoder` produces an output that is not the intended or correct representation of the original data. This incorrect decoding can then lead to further issues within the application.

**High-Risk Paths:**

* **Supply Malicious Input to Decoder -> Cause Incorrect Decoding -> Supply Incomplete Multibyte Sequence:**
    * The attacker sends a partial UTF-8 sequence to the decoder.
    * **Impact:** The application processes this partially decoded data, potentially leading to logic errors, data corruption, or unexpected behavior.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

* **Supply Malicious Input to Decoder -> Cause Incorrect Decoding -> Supply Invalid UTF-8 Sequence:**
    * The attacker provides byte sequences that are not valid UTF-8.
    * **Impact:** The decoder might return replacement characters or throw errors. If the application doesn't handle this gracefully, it could lead to crashes, unexpected output, or information disclosure.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** Medium
    * **Effort:** Low
    * **Skill Level:** Low
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Easy

* **Supply Malicious Input to Decoder -> Cause Incorrect Decoding -> Supply Mixed Encodings (if application doesn't enforce a single encoding):**
    * The attacker sends input that combines different character encodings.
    * **Impact:** The decoder might interpret parts of the input incorrectly, leading to data corruption or security vulnerabilities if the decoded data is used in security-sensitive contexts.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** Medium to High
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

* **Supply Malicious Input to Decoder -> Exploit Encoding Assumptions -> Application assumes UTF-8, but input is in a different encoding with overlapping byte sequences:**
    * The attacker provides input in an encoding where certain byte sequences happen to be valid UTF-8 but represent different characters.
    * **Impact:** The decoder produces valid UTF-8, but the application interprets it incorrectly based on its assumed encoding, leading to logic errors or security vulnerabilities.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** Medium to High
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

* **Supply Malicious Input to Decoder -> Exploit Encoding Assumptions -> Application uses a less strict encoding, allowing for characters that could be misinterpreted in UTF-8 after decoding:**
    * The attacker provides input that is valid in a less strict encoding but could be misinterpreted when decoded as UTF-8.
    * **Impact:** Similar to the above, leading to potential misinterpretations and vulnerabilities within the application.
    * **Likelihood:** Low
    * **Impact:** Medium to High
    * **Effort:** Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Hard
