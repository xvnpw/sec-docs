Here's the updated key attack surface list, focusing only on elements directly involving Jasmine and with high or critical risk severity:

* **Attack Surface:** Malicious Test Code Injection
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into Jasmine test files.
    * **How Jasmine Contributes:** Jasmine executes these test files, allowing the malicious code to run within the testing environment, potentially with access to application code and test data.
    * **Example:** A compromised developer account pushes a test file that, upon execution by Jasmine, reads environment variables containing API keys and sends them to an external server.
    * **Impact:** Data exfiltration, modification of application code during testing, introduction of backdoors, compromised credentials.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access controls for development repositories and environments.
        * Enforce code review for all test files, similar to application code.
        * Utilize secure coding practices for test development.
        * Employ integrity checks for test files to detect unauthorized modifications.

* **Attack Surface:** Bypassing Security Controls in Tests
    * **Description:** Tests are designed to bypass normal security controls (authentication, authorization) to facilitate testing, and these bypasses could be exploited.
    * **How Jasmine Contributes:** Jasmine is used to execute these tests that inherently need to circumvent security measures for effective testing.
    * **Example:** Test setup code, executed by Jasmine, directly authenticates as an administrator without going through the standard login process, and this code is inadvertently left accessible or its logic is flawed.
    * **Impact:** Unauthorized access to application features or data, privilege escalation.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Carefully manage and secure the mechanisms used to bypass security controls in tests.
        * Ensure these bypasses are strictly limited to the test environment and cannot be triggered in production.
        * Regularly review and audit the code responsible for bypassing security in tests.
        * Implement clear separation between test-specific bypass logic and core application security mechanisms.

* **Attack Surface:** Supply Chain Risks (Jasmine Package Compromise)
    * **Description:**  The Jasmine package itself is compromised, introducing malicious code into the development process.
    * **How Jasmine Contributes:**  Developers include the Jasmine package as a dependency, and if compromised, the malicious code is integrated into their projects.
    * **Example:** A malicious actor gains access to the Jasmine repository and injects code that exfiltrates developer credentials during the installation process when developers install or update Jasmine.
    * **Impact:** Widespread compromise of projects using the compromised Jasmine package, data breaches, supply chain attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Utilize dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in Jasmine and its dependencies.
        * Employ software composition analysis (SCA) to monitor for unexpected changes in dependencies.
        * Consider using locked dependency versions to ensure consistency and prevent automatic updates to potentially compromised versions.
        * Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or signatures.
