# Threat Model Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Threat: [Exposure of Jasmine Test Suite in Production](./threats/exposure_of_jasmine_test_suite_in_production.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Jasmine Test Suite in Production
    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers that the Jasmine test suite (HTML runner, spec files, helper files) is accessible on a production server.  The attacker can view the test code, potentially revealing application logic, internal API endpoints, and even hardcoded credentials or sensitive data used in mock objects.  They might also attempt to modify the tests to run malicious code within the browser context of any user who accesses the exposed test suite (effectively an XSS attack).
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information disclosure of application internals, potentially including sensitive data.
        *   Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) if an attacker can modify and execute tests.
        *   Loss of user trust and potential legal/regulatory consequences.
    *   **Jasmine Component Affected:** Entire Jasmine framework (HTML runner, `SpecRunner.html`, spec files (`*.spec.js`), helper files). This is a direct threat because the *presence* of these Jasmine components in production is the vulnerability.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Strict Build Process:** Implement a build process that explicitly excludes Jasmine files and test directories from the production build artifact.
        *   **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline to prevent deployment of test-related files.
        *   **Web Server Configuration:** Configure the web server to deny access to directories containing test files.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing.

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Leakage in Test Results/Reporters](./threats/sensitive_data_leakage_in_test_resultsreporters.md)

*   **Threat:** Sensitive Data Leakage in Test Results/Reporters
    *   **Description:** Jasmine tests generate detailed error messages or logs that are captured by the Jasmine reporter (e.g., the default HTML reporter, or a custom reporter). If these reports contain sensitive data (e.g., API keys, session tokens, PII) that were inadvertently included in the test code or mock data, this information could be exposed. This is a direct threat because the Jasmine *reporter* is the mechanism of exposure.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Information disclosure of sensitive data.
        *   Potential for attackers to use the leaked information for malicious purposes.
    *   **Jasmine Component Affected:** Jasmine reporters (e.g., `jasmine.HtmlReporter`, custom reporters), `console.log` statements within tests that are captured by the reporter.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Avoid Sensitive Data in Tests:** Never hardcode sensitive data. Use environment variables or a secure configuration management system.
        *   **Sanitize Test Output:** Review and sanitize test results and error messages. Consider using a custom reporter that filters out sensitive information.
        *   **Secure Storage of Test Results:** If test results are stored, ensure they are stored securely and access is restricted.
        *   **Review Custom Reporters:** Thoroughly review custom Jasmine reporters for potential data leakage vulnerabilities.
