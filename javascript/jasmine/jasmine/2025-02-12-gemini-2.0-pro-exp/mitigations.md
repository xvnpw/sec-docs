# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Sensitive Data within Jasmine Tests](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_sensitive_data_within_jasmine_tests.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Identify Sensitive Data:** Developers must identify all data considered sensitive that might be used within Jasmine tests.
2.  **Environment Variable Usage:**  *Within Jasmine tests*, access sensitive data exclusively through environment variables.  In Node.js, use `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`.  For example: `const apiKey = process.env.EXAMPLE_SERVICE_API_KEY;`.  Do *not* hardcode any sensitive values directly in the test files.
3.  **Mocking and Spies:** For interactions with external services requiring credentials, *use Jasmine's spy features* (`spyOn`, `jasmine.createSpy`, `jasmine.createSpyObj`) to create mock objects or stub functions.  These mocks should simulate the service's behavior *without* using real credentials.  This is a core Jasmine feature.  Example:
    ```javascript
    // Instead of:  const result = realService.authenticate(username, password);
    // Use:
    const mockService = jasmine.createSpyObj('realService', ['authenticate']);
    mockService.authenticate.and.returnValue(Promise.resolve({ success: true }));
    const result = mockService.authenticate(username, password); // No real credentials used
    ```
4.  **Test File Review:** During code reviews, specifically examine Jasmine test files (`*.spec.js` or similar) for any instances of hardcoded sensitive data.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **Hardcoded Secrets Exposure in Test Files (Severity: High):** Directly prevents secrets from appearing in Jasmine test code.
*   **Accidental Disclosure of PII in Test Files (Severity: High/Medium):** Prevents PII from being hardcoded in Jasmine tests.
*   **Unauthorized Access via Test Credentials (Severity: High/Medium):** By using Jasmine's mocking capabilities, eliminates the need for real credentials within the tests.

**Impact:**
*   **Hardcoded Secrets Exposure:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination if implemented correctly within the Jasmine test files).
*   **Accidental Disclosure of PII:** Risk significantly reduced (near elimination if implemented correctly within the Jasmine test files).
*   **Unauthorized Access via Test Credentials:** Risk significantly reduced (dependent on the thoroughness of mocking using Jasmine's features).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Environment variables are used for API keys in `api-tests.spec.js`.
*   Mocking (using `jasmine.createSpyObj`) is used for the payment gateway in `payment.spec.js`.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Mocking is not consistently used for *all* external service interactions within Jasmine tests. Some tests in `user-management.spec.js` still directly interact with a test database. These need refactoring to use Jasmine spies.
*   Code reviews do not *always* explicitly focus on checking Jasmine test files for hardcoded data.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Robust Test Logic within Jasmine](./mitigation_strategies/robust_test_logic_within_jasmine.md)

**Description:**
1.  **Assertion Quality:** Within Jasmine tests, use specific and accurate assertions.  Avoid vague or overly broad assertions that might pass even if the underlying code is flawed.  Use Jasmine's rich set of matchers (e.g., `toBe`, `toEqual`, `toBeGreaterThan`, `toThrowError`, etc.) appropriately.
2.  **Edge Case and Boundary Testing:**  Within Jasmine tests, explicitly test edge cases and boundary conditions, especially for security-related functionality.  For example, test with empty strings, very large numbers, invalid characters, and other potentially problematic inputs.
3.  **Negative Testing:**  Include Jasmine tests that specifically check for expected *failures*.  For example, test that an authentication function *rejects* invalid credentials. Use Jasmine's `toThrow` or `toThrowError` matchers.
4.  **Setup and Teardown (Jasmine Functions):**  Use Jasmine's `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `beforeAll`, and `afterAll` functions correctly to ensure test isolation and prevent test pollution.
    *   `beforeEach`: Use to set up a clean and consistent state *before each test* within a `describe` block.
    *   `afterEach`: Use to clean up any resources or reset the state *after each test*.
    *   `beforeAll`: Use *sparingly* to set up resources that are shared across all tests in a `describe` block and only need to be set up once.
    *   `afterAll`: Use *sparingly* to clean up resources set up by `beforeAll`.
5. **Avoid Global State in Tests:** Minimize the use of global variables or shared state *between* Jasmine tests.  Favor creating new instances of objects or using Jasmine spies within each test to ensure isolation.

**Threats Mitigated:**
*   **False Positives in Tests (Severity: Medium/High):** Reduces the risk of Jasmine tests passing even when underlying security vulnerabilities exist due to weak assertions.
*   **Logic Errors in Jasmine Tests (Severity: Medium):** Helps identify and correct errors in the Jasmine test logic itself.
*   **Inadequate Coverage of Security-Relevant Code (Severity: Medium):** Improves coverage of edge cases and boundary conditions within Jasmine tests.
*   **Test Pollution (Severity: Medium/Low):** Prevents Jasmine tests from interfering with each other due to improper use of setup/teardown.

**Impact:**
*   **False Positives in Tests:** Risk reduced significantly (dependent on the quality of assertions and test design within Jasmine).
*   **Logic Errors in Jasmine Tests:** Risk reduced moderately (dependent on careful test writing and review).
*   **Inadequate Coverage:** Risk reduced significantly (dependent on explicitly testing edge cases and boundaries within Jasmine).
*   **Test Pollution:** Risk reduced significantly (dependent on correct use of Jasmine's `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, etc.).

**Currently Implemented:**
*   Basic Jasmine assertions are used in most tests.
*   `beforeEach` and `afterEach` are used in many test files.

**Missing Implementation:**
*   Consistent use of specific and robust Jasmine assertions is not enforced.
*   Explicit testing of edge cases and boundary conditions within Jasmine tests is not comprehensive.
*   Negative testing using Jasmine's `toThrow` matchers is not consistently applied.
*   Global state is sometimes used between Jasmine tests, leading to potential pollution.
*   `beforeAll` and `afterAll` are sometimes used unnecessarily within Jasmine suites.
