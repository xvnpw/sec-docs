# Attack Surface Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Attack Surface: [1. Malicious Test Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/1__malicious_test_code_injection.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the Jasmine test suite, which is then executed when the tests are run. This remains the most significant and direct risk.
    *   **How Jasmine Contributes:** Jasmine provides the *direct execution environment* for the injected JavaScript code.  It's the engine that runs the malicious payload.  Without Jasmine (or another testing framework), this specific attack wouldn't be possible in the same way.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the CI/CD pipeline and modifies an existing Jasmine test file (`spec/some_test.spec.js`) to include code that steals API keys from environment variables during test execution.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Data exfiltration (credentials, source code, sensitive data)
        *   System compromise (if tests run with elevated privileges)
        *   Lateral movement within the network
        *   Manipulation of CI/CD pipeline (further compromise)
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Development Environment:** Strong endpoint protection, access control, and multi-factor authentication on developer machines.
        *   **Secure CI/CD Pipeline:** Treat the CI/CD pipeline as a production system. Implement strict access controls, vulnerability scanning, secret management, and pipeline-as-code with mandatory reviews.
        *   **Mandatory Code Reviews (Tests):** Require thorough code reviews for *all* changes to test files, with a security focus.  Treat test code with the same rigor as production code.
        *   **Dependency Management:** Use package managers with integrity checking (`npm` with `package-lock.json`, `yarn` with `yarn.lock`). Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities.
        *   **Least Privilege:** Run tests with the *absolute minimum* necessary privileges.  Never run tests as root/administrator.
        *   **Sandboxing:** Run tests in isolated environments (Docker containers, VMs, restricted browser contexts) to contain the impact of compromised tests.  This is a crucial mitigation.
        *   **Input Validation (in Test Code):** Even within test code, validate and sanitize any external inputs (environment variables, file contents, etc.).

## Attack Surface: [2. Abuse of Jasmine Features (Spies, Custom Matchers, `beforeEach`/`afterEach`)](./attack_surfaces/2__abuse_of_jasmine_features__spies__custom_matchers___beforeeach__aftereach__.md)

*   **Description:** Improper or malicious use of Jasmine's built-in features *within the test code itself* creates vulnerabilities *within the testing environment*. This is about insecure *test* code leveraging Jasmine's capabilities.
    *   **How Jasmine Contributes:** Jasmine *provides the features* (spies, custom matchers, setup/teardown hooks) that are being misused. The vulnerability exists because these features *exist and can be manipulated*.
    *   **Example:** A `beforeEach` block in a Jasmine test suite attempts to write to a file path specified by an environment variable *without* sanitizing the path. An attacker sets the environment variable to a system-critical location, potentially overwriting important files.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Exposure or modification of sensitive files (if file system access is involved)
        *   Denial of Service (DoS) against the testing infrastructure (e.g., through infinite loops or resource exhaustion)
        *   Limited code execution (depending on the specific misuse and the environment)
        *   Leakage of sensitive information through improperly handled spy data.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical in specific scenarios, especially if tests run with elevated privileges or interact with sensitive systems)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Secure Test Code Practices:** Write tests with security as a primary concern. Avoid performing sensitive operations in setup/teardown blocks without robust security measures.
        *   **Input Validation (in Test Code):** Rigorously sanitize *all* external inputs used within tests, including environment variables, file contents, and data from external sources.
        *   **Code Reviews (Test Code Focus):** Conduct thorough code reviews of test code, specifically looking for potential side effects, unintended consequences, and security vulnerabilities related to Jasmine feature usage.
        *   **Reasonable Timeouts:** Use appropriate timeouts for asynchronous tests to prevent DoS attacks against the testing infrastructure.
        *   **Secure Handling of Spy Data:** Treat data captured by Jasmine spies as potentially sensitive. Store and transmit test results securely, and avoid logging sensitive information.
        *   **Avoid Global State Manipulation:** Minimize the use of global variables and side effects within tests to reduce the risk of unintended interactions and vulnerabilities.
