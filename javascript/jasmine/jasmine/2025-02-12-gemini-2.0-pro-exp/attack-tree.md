## Attack Tree Path: [Attacker's Goal: Execute Arbitrary JavaScript](./attack_tree_paths/attacker's_goal_execute_arbitrary_javascript.md)

*   **Description:** The ultimate objective of the attacker. Successful execution allows for a wide range of malicious actions, including data theft, session hijacking, website defacement, and malware installation.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Complete control over the application or user's session.
*  This is the root of the high-risk subtree.

## Attack Tree Path: [Sub-Goal 2: Leverage Misconfigured Test Environment](./attack_tree_paths/sub-goal_2_leverage_misconfigured_test_environment.md)

*   **Description:** Exploiting weaknesses arising from improper configuration of the testing environment. This often involves developers unintentionally exposing sensitive information or creating situations where test code can be executed in unintended contexts.
* This is the main entry point for the high-risk attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [2A: Expose Sensitive Data in Test Environment](./attack_tree_paths/2a_expose_sensitive_data_in_test_environment.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys or database credentials, is inadvertently made accessible within the testing environment. This can occur through hardcoding secrets in test files, improperly configured environment variables, or storing secrets in insecure locations.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium. It's a common mistake, especially in less mature development environments.
*   **Impact:** High. Exposure of secrets can lead to unauthorized access to other systems and data.
*   **Effort:** Low (for the attacker). Once the secrets are exposed, they are easily obtained.
*   **Skill Level:** Low. Requires minimal technical expertise to utilize the exposed secrets.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium. Code scanning tools and security audits can help detect exposed secrets.

## Attack Tree Path: [2A1: Leak API Keys](./attack_tree_paths/2a1_leak_api_keys.md)

*   **Description:** API keys, used for accessing external services, are exposed within the test environment.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** High. Attackers can use the leaked keys to access and potentially misuse the associated services, incurring costs or accessing sensitive data.
*   **Effort:** Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [2A2: Expose Database Credentials](./attack_tree_paths/2a2_expose_database_credentials.md)

*   **Description:** Database usernames and passwords are exposed within the test environment.
*   **Likelihood:** Medium.
*   **Impact:** High. Attackers can gain direct access to the database, allowing them to read, modify, or delete data.
*   **Effort:** Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Low.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium.

## Attack Tree Path: [2B: Run Tests in Production](./attack_tree_paths/2b_run_tests_in_production.md)

*   **Description:** Jasmine tests are accidentally executed in the production environment instead of the isolated testing environment. This is a severe misconfiguration.
*   **Likelihood:** Low. This should be prevented by proper deployment procedures.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Can expose users to vulnerabilities within the tests or allow server-side code execution.
*   **Effort:** Low (for the attacker, once the misconfiguration exists).
*   **Skill Level:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability exploited.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High. It may not be immediately obvious that tests are running in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [2B1: Browser Context](./attack_tree_paths/2b1_browser_context.md)

*   **Description:** Tests are run within the user's browser in the production environment.
*   **Likelihood:** Low.
*   **Impact:** High. Exposes users to potential XSS attacks and other vulnerabilities within the tests.
*   **Effort:** Low.
*   **Skill Level:** Low to Medium (depending on the vulnerability).
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High.

## Attack Tree Path: [2B2: Server-Side JavaScript Execution](./attack_tree_paths/2b2_server-side_javascript_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Tests designed for a Node.js environment are executed on the production server.
*   **Likelihood:** Low.
*   **Impact:** Very High. Allows arbitrary code execution on the server, leading to potential complete system compromise.
*   **Effort:** Medium to High.
*   **Skill Level:** High.
*   **Detection Difficulty:** High.
