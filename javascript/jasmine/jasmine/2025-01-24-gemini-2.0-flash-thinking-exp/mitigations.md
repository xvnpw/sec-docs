# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Mitigation Strategy: [Preventing Exposure of Test Code in Production Environments](./mitigation_strategies/preventing_exposure_of_test_code_in_production_environments.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Configure Build Process to Exclude Jasmine Files:**  Modify your build scripts (e.g., using Webpack, Parcel, Gulp, or custom scripts) to explicitly exclude Jasmine test directories (like `spec/`, `tests/`) and Jasmine test runner files (e.g., `SpecRunner.html`, files loading Jasmine like `test-main.js`) from the output directory that is deployed to production. This ensures that no Jasmine-related code is shipped to the live environment.
    2.  **Utilize `.gitignore` and `.dockerignore` for Jasmine Files:** Add patterns to your `.gitignore` file to prevent Jasmine test directories and files from being committed to your version control system. Similarly, configure `.dockerignore` to exclude these files from Docker images built for production. Focus these ignore rules specifically on directories and file patterns used by Jasmine. Example `.gitignore` entries:
        ```
        spec/
        tests/
        SpecRunner.html
        jasmine-standalone-* # If using Jasmine standalone distribution
        ```
    3.  **Implement CI/CD Pipeline Checks for Jasmine Files:** Integrate automated checks in your CI/CD pipeline to verify that Jasmine test directories and files are not present in the build artifacts. This can involve scripting to list files in the build output and failing the pipeline if Jasmine-related files are found. Specifically look for directories and file names associated with Jasmine.
    4.  **Regular Audits for Jasmine File Inclusion:** Periodically (e.g., before each major release) manually inspect the contents of your production deployment packages (e.g., zip files, Docker images) to confirm the absence of Jasmine test code and related files.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Exposure of Jasmine Test Logic (High Severity):**  Accidental deployment of Jasmine test code can reveal internal application logic, algorithms, and business rules through the tests written using Jasmine. This information can be used to understand application vulnerabilities and plan attacks.
    *   **Exposure of Test Data Used in Jasmine Tests (Medium Severity):** If Jasmine tests contain sensitive data (even if mocked), deploying these test files could inadvertently expose this data in production, potentially leading to data breaches or information disclosure.
    *   **Unnecessary Code in Production from Jasmine Tests (Low Severity):**  Including Jasmine test files in production adds unnecessary code, increasing the attack surface and potentially including unused Jasmine library code that might have unforeseen issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Exposure of Jasmine Test Logic:** Risk reduced by **High**. Effectively eliminates the threat of exposing test logic if implemented correctly by specifically targeting Jasmine files.
    *   **Exposure of Test Data Used in Jasmine Tests:** Risk reduced by **High**. Significantly minimizes the chance of accidental data exposure from Jasmine test files.
    *   **Unnecessary Code in Production from Jasmine Tests:** Risk reduced by **Medium**. Reduces unnecessary code related to Jasmine tests in production.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **`.gitignore` for Jasmine Files:** Implemented in the project repository root. Contains entries for common Jasmine test directories and files.
    *   **Build Process Exclusion of Jasmine Files:** Partially implemented. Webpack configuration attempts to exclude test files, but might not be comprehensively targeting all Jasmine-related files.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **`.dockerignore` for Jasmine Files:** Not currently configured in the project. Jasmine test files might be included in Docker images.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Checks for Jasmine Files:** No automated checks in the CI/CD pipeline to specifically verify exclusion of Jasmine files.
    *   **Regular Audits for Jasmine File Inclusion:** No formal process for regular audits of deployment packages to specifically confirm Jasmine file exclusion.
    *   **Webpack Configuration Comprehensiveness for Jasmine Files:** Review and enhance Webpack configuration to ensure all Jasmine-related files are reliably excluded, including any dynamically generated Jasmine test runner files or standalone Jasmine distributions.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Managing Potential Information Leakage through Jasmine Test Output](./mitigation_strategies/managing_potential_information_leakage_through_jasmine_test_output.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Data Sanitization in Jasmine Tests:**  When using data that resembles sensitive information in Jasmine tests (e.g., email addresses, usernames, IDs), sanitize or redact the sensitive parts within your Jasmine `describe` and `it` blocks and within the data used in `expect` statements.
    2.  **Mock Sensitive Data in Jasmine Tests:**  Prefer using mock data generators or libraries to create realistic but non-sensitive data for Jasmine tests instead of hardcoding data that could be considered sensitive within your Jasmine test suites.
    3.  **Custom Jasmine Test Reporters:** If using default Jasmine reporters that output verbose information, consider creating or using custom Jasmine reporters that limit the output to essential information and avoid logging potentially sensitive data from Jasmine test results or console outputs generated by Jasmine's execution.
    4.  **Review Jasmine Test Logs:** Regularly review test logs and console outputs generated during Jasmine testing (especially in CI/CD environments) to identify and remove any instances of unintentionally logged sensitive data that might be outputted by Jasmine or your test code within Jasmine.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Jasmine Test Logs (Medium Severity):** Jasmine test outputs and logs might inadvertently contain sensitive information that could be exposed if logs are not properly secured or reviewed. This could include API keys, internal identifiers, or patterns revealed through Jasmine test descriptions or assertion failures.
    *   **Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Jasmine Test Code (Low Severity):** While aiming to avoid hardcoding sensitive data, there's a risk of accidentally including real-looking sensitive data in Jasmine tests that could be exposed if Jasmine test code is leaked or reviewed by unauthorized individuals.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure through Jasmine Test Logs:** Risk reduced by **Medium**. Significantly reduces the chance of sensitive data leaking through Jasmine test outputs and logs.
    *   **Accidental Exposure of Sensitive Data in Jasmine Test Code:** Risk reduced by **Low**. Minimizes the potential impact of accidental inclusion of sensitive-looking data in Jasmine test code.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Data Sanitization in Jasmine Tests:** Partially implemented. Developers are generally aware of avoiding real sensitive data in Jasmine tests, but no formal guidelines or automated checks are in place specifically for Jasmine tests.
    *   **Mock Sensitive Data in Jasmine Tests:** Used in some Jasmine test cases, but not consistently applied across all Jasmine tests.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Formal Guidelines for Data Sanitization in Jasmine Tests:** Establish clear guidelines and best practices for sanitizing or mocking sensitive data specifically within Jasmine tests.
    *   **Automated Checks for Sensitive Data in Jasmine Tests:** Implement linters or static analysis tools to detect potential hardcoded sensitive data patterns in Jasmine test files.
    *   **Custom Jasmine Test Reporters:** Not implemented. Using default Jasmine reporters which might be verbose in their output.
    *   **Regular Jasmine Test Log Review Process:** No formal process for regularly reviewing Jasmine test logs for sensitive information.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keeping Jasmine and its Dependencies Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keeping_jasmine_and_its_dependencies_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Dependency Management Tools for Jasmine:** Utilize package managers like npm or yarn to manage Jasmine and its dependencies within your project.
    2.  **Regular Dependency Audits for Jasmine Dependencies:** Use `npm audit` or `yarn audit` commands regularly (e.g., weekly or as part of the CI/CD pipeline) to identify known vulnerabilities in Jasmine's dependencies.
    3.  **Automated Dependency Updates for Jasmine:** Implement automated dependency update tools (e.g., Dependabot, Renovate) to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates, including Jasmine and its dependencies.
    4.  **Monitor Jasmine Release Notes:** Subscribe to Jasmine's release notes or GitHub releases to stay informed about new versions, bug fixes, and security patches for Jasmine itself.
    5.  **Prompt Updates for Jasmine:**  Prioritize and promptly apply updates for Jasmine and its dependencies, especially security-related updates to the Jasmine framework and its dependencies.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Jasmine Framework (Medium to High Severity):**  Jasmine itself, like any software, could potentially have security vulnerabilities. Keeping it updated ensures you benefit from security patches released by the Jasmine maintainers. Severity depends on the nature of the vulnerability within Jasmine.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Jasmine Dependencies (Low to Medium Severity):** Jasmine relies on other libraries. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies can indirectly affect your application's security if exploited through Jasmine. Severity depends on the vulnerable dependency and the exploitability in the context of Jasmine.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Jasmine Framework:** Risk reduced by **Medium to High**. Significantly reduces the risk of exploiting known vulnerabilities directly within the Jasmine framework.
    *   **Vulnerabilities in Jasmine Dependencies:** Risk reduced by **Low to Medium**. Reduces the risk of indirect vulnerabilities stemming from Jasmine's dependencies used by your project.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   **Dependency Management Tools for Jasmine:** Using `npm` for dependency management of Jasmine.
    *   **`npm audit` (Manual):** Developers occasionally run `npm audit` manually to check for dependency vulnerabilities including those of Jasmine.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Automated Dependency Audits in CI/CD for Jasmine Dependencies:** Integrate `npm audit` or `yarn audit` into the CI/CD pipeline to automatically check for vulnerabilities in Jasmine's dependencies on each build.
    *   **Automated Dependency Updates for Jasmine:** No automated dependency update tools like Dependabot or Renovate are currently in use for managing Jasmine and its dependencies.
    *   **Jasmine Release Monitoring:** No formal process for monitoring Jasmine release notes specifically.
    *   **Prompt Update Policy for Jasmine:** No formal policy or process for prioritizing and applying Jasmine and dependency updates, especially security updates related to Jasmine.
