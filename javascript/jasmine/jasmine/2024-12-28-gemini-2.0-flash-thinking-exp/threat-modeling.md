### High and Critical Jasmine Threats

Here are the high and critical threats that directly involve the Jasmine testing framework:

*   **Threat:** Vulnerability in Jasmine Core
    *   **Description:** An attacker discovers and exploits a security vulnerability within the core Jasmine library code. This could involve crafting specific inputs or manipulating the testing environment to trigger unexpected behavior.
    *   **Impact:**  Arbitrary code execution within the testing environment, information disclosure from the testing environment, or denial of service of the testing process.
    *   **Affected Component:** `jasmine-core` module (specifically the test runner, reporters, or core matching logic).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Jasmine updated to the latest stable version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Monitor Jasmine's release notes and security advisories for reported vulnerabilities.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools on the Jasmine codebase (though this is less common for end-users).

*   **Threat:** Malicious Test Code Injection
    *   **Description:** An attacker with commit access or through a compromised development environment injects malicious JavaScript code within a test file. This code executes within the context of the test runner.
    *   **Impact:**  Exfiltration of sensitive data from the testing environment (e.g., environment variables, configuration), modification of files or configurations, launching attacks against internal services, or introducing backdoors into the application code through manipulated test outcomes.
    *   **Affected Component:** Test files (`*.spec.js` files) and the Test Runner.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strict code review processes for all test files.
        *   Enforce strong access controls and authentication for developers with commit access.
        *   Utilize version control systems and track changes to test files.
        *   Consider using static analysis tools on test code to identify potentially malicious patterns.
        *   Isolate the testing environment from production systems and sensitive data.

*   **Threat:** Supply Chain Attack on Jasmine Dependencies
    *   **Description:**  One of Jasmine's dependencies (direct or transitive) is compromised with malicious code. When Jasmine is installed or updated, this malicious code is also included.
    *   **Impact:**  Similar to vulnerabilities within Jasmine, this could lead to arbitrary code execution or information disclosure within the testing environment.
    *   **Affected Component:** `package.json` (dependency management) and potentially any of Jasmine's internal modules that rely on the compromised dependency.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dependency management tools that perform security vulnerability scanning on project dependencies (e.g., `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, Dependabot).
        *   Regularly update Jasmine and its dependencies to incorporate security fixes.
        *   Consider using tools that provide insights into the dependency tree and potential risks.
        *   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) practices to track and manage dependencies.
