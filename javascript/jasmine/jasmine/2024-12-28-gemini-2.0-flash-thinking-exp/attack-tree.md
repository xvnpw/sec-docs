## High-Risk Sub-Tree: Compromising Application via Jasmine

**Attacker's Goal:** Compromise the application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Jasmine testing framework or its usage.

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**Compromise Application via Jasmine [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the starting point of all potential attack paths. Its criticality stems from the fact that successful exploitation at any point in the tree leads to this outcome.

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Jasmine's Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **Compromise a Direct Jasmine Dependency:**
    * **Exploit Vulnerability in a Direct Dependency (e.g., Prototype Pollution, arbitrary code execution):** Attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in libraries that Jasmine directly relies on. This requires identifying a vulnerable dependency and crafting an exploit that can be triggered within the application's testing environment or potentially even during development processes that utilize Jasmine.
        * **Likelihood: Medium**
        * **Impact: High**
        * **Effort: Medium**
        * **Skill Level: Intermediate**
        * **Detection Difficulty: Medium**

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Jasmine's Configuration or Usage [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Expose Sensitive Information via Test Output:**
    * **Include Sensitive Data in Test Descriptions:** Developers might unintentionally embed sensitive information like API keys, passwords, or internal URLs directly within the descriptive text of their Jasmine tests. If test reports are accessible (even internally), this information can be exposed.
        * **Likelihood: Medium**
        * **Impact: Medium**
        * **Effort: Low**
        * **Skill Level: Basic**
        * **Detection Difficulty: Easy (with proper tooling) / Hard (without)**
* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Misconfiguration Leading to Information Disclosure:**
    * **Expose Test Files or Reports Publicly (e.g., through misconfigured web server):** If the server hosting test reports or the test files themselves is misconfigured, attackers can gain access to these resources. This can reveal insights into the application's logic, potential vulnerabilities, and even sensitive data if it's present in the test code or reports.
        * **Likelihood: Medium**
        * **Impact: Medium**
        * **Effort: Low**
        * **Skill Level: Basic**
        * **Detection Difficulty: Easy (with proper tooling) / Medium (without)**

**[HIGH-RISK PATH] Compromise the Development/CI Environment Using Jasmine [CRITICAL NODE]:**

* This node is critical because compromising the development or CI environment can have widespread and severe consequences, potentially affecting the entire application lifecycle.
* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Inject Malicious Code via Test Files:**
    * **Modify Test Files to Include Malicious Payloads Executed During Testing:** Attackers who gain access to the development or CI environment can modify test files to include malicious JavaScript code. This code will be executed during the test runs, potentially allowing the attacker to gain further access, steal credentials, or manipulate the build process.
        * **Likelihood: Low**
        * **Impact: High**
        * **Effort: Medium**
        * **Skill Level: Intermediate**
        * **Detection Difficulty: Medium**
* **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Manipulate Test Results to Hide Vulnerabilities:**
    * **Modify Test Files to Always Pass, Masking Underlying Issues:** Attackers can alter test files to ensure they always pass, regardless of the actual application state. This can mask existing vulnerabilities, allowing them to be deployed to production without being detected by the testing process.
        * **Likelihood: Low**
        * **Impact: High**
        * **Effort: Low**
        * **Skill Level: Basic**
        * **Detection Difficulty: Hard**
