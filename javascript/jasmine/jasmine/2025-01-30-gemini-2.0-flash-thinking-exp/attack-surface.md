# Attack Surface Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Attack Surface: [Test Code Injection and Execution](./attack_surfaces/test_code_injection_and_execution.md)

*   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code injected into the test suite can be executed by Jasmine during test runs.
    *   **Jasmine's Contribution:** Jasmine is the framework that directly executes the provided test code. It does not inherently validate the *content* of the test code for malicious intent, focusing solely on running the tests as defined. This direct execution makes Jasmine the vehicle for any injected malicious code.
    *   **Example:**
        *   A compromised developer account pushes a commit containing a malicious test file. This file, when executed by Jasmine, contains code to exfiltrate environment variables, access local files, or modify application code within the development environment.
        *   A supply chain attack compromises a development dependency, leading to the injection of malicious code into generated test files that are subsequently executed by Jasmine.
        *   An insider intentionally adds a test that reads sensitive configuration files and transmits them to an external, attacker-controlled server during Jasmine test execution.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Information Disclosure:**  Critical exposure of sensitive data from the development environment, including API keys, secrets, source code, and internal configurations.
        *   **Development Environment Compromise:** High potential for complete compromise of the development machine or CI/CD pipeline if malicious code gains sufficient privileges through exploitation during Jasmine test execution. This can lead to further attacks on production systems.
        *   **Supply Chain Poisoning:** Malicious modifications to application code or build processes through compromised test execution, potentially leading to the distribution of backdoored software.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rigorous Code Review for Test Files:** Implement mandatory and thorough code reviews for all test files, treating them with the same security scrutiny as production application code. Focus on identifying suspicious or unexpected code patterns.
        *   **Strong Dependency Scanning and Management:** Employ robust dependency scanning tools to continuously monitor development dependencies for vulnerabilities that could be exploited for code injection. Implement strict dependency management policies and promptly update to patched versions.
        *   **Robust Access Control and Authentication:** Enforce strong access control measures to the codebase and development environment. Implement multi-factor authentication for developer accounts and strictly limit access based on the principle of least privilege to mitigate insider threats and compromised account risks.
        *   **Input Validation and Output Encoding in Tests (where applicable):** If test logic involves processing external data or generating output that could be interpreted as code, apply rigorous input sanitization and output encoding techniques within the test code itself to prevent injection vulnerabilities.
        *   **Principle of Least Privilege for Test Processes:** Run Jasmine test processes with the minimum necessary privileges required for testing. Avoid running tests with elevated or administrative privileges to limit the potential impact of successful exploitation.
        *   **Secure Development Environment Hardening:** Implement security hardening measures for the entire development environment, including operating systems, development tools, and network configurations, to reduce the overall attack surface and limit the impact of potential compromises.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Information in Test Output/Reports](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_information_in_test_outputreports.md)

*   **Description:** Jasmine test reports and output logs can inadvertently expose sensitive information if developers are not diligent about preventing sensitive data from being included in test descriptions, expectations, and logging configurations.
    *   **Jasmine's Contribution:** Jasmine is the framework that generates test reports and provides logging mechanisms. While Jasmine itself doesn't introduce the sensitive data, its reporting features directly facilitate the potential exposure if developers include sensitive information in test artifacts.
    *   **Example:**
        *   Developers mistakenly hardcode API keys, passwords, or other secrets directly into test descriptions or expected values for simplified testing. These secrets are then directly embedded in generated HTML or text test reports produced by Jasmine.
        *   Overly verbose logging configurations during test runs capture sensitive data from the application under test, such as database connection strings, internal URLs, or personally identifiable information (PII), and include this data in Jasmine's test logs and reports.
        *   Test reports generated by Jasmine, containing inadvertently exposed sensitive information, are stored in publicly accessible locations (e.g., unsecured CI/CD artifact storage) or transmitted insecurely over unencrypted channels, making the sensitive data accessible to unauthorized parties.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   **Critical Information Disclosure:** High-impact exposure of credentials, API keys, internal URLs, confidential business data, or PII. This can lead to immediate unauthorized access to critical systems, data breaches, and significant financial and reputational damage.
        *   **Compliance Violations:** Exposure of sensitive data, especially PII, can lead to severe violations of data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) resulting in substantial fines and legal repercussions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Eliminate Hardcoding of Secrets in Tests:** Strictly prohibit the practice of hardcoding any sensitive information directly into test code. Mandate the use of secure secret management solutions, environment variables, or dedicated configuration files for handling sensitive data in tests.
        *   **Automated Sanitization of Test Output and Reports:** Implement automated processes to sanitize or redact potentially sensitive information from Jasmine test reports and logs before they are stored, shared, or archived. This can involve regular expression-based redaction or more sophisticated data masking techniques.
        *   **Secure Storage and Transmission of Test Reports:** Enforce secure storage of Jasmine test reports in access-controlled repositories. Transmit reports only over secure, encrypted channels (HTTPS, SSH) if necessary. Avoid storing reports in publicly accessible locations.
        *   **Regular Review of Test Reports for Sensitive Information:** Conduct periodic manual or automated reviews of generated Jasmine test reports to proactively identify and remove any inadvertently exposed sensitive data. Implement developer training to raise awareness about the risks of information leakage in test outputs.
        *   **Minimize Verbose Logging in Production-like Test Environments:**  Carefully configure logging levels in test environments, especially those resembling production, to avoid excessive logging of potentially sensitive data. Implement logging best practices to ensure only necessary information is logged and sensitive data is excluded.
