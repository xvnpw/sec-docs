# Threat Model Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./threats/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into test files. This code is executed by the Jasmine Test Runner during test execution. The attacker might aim to steal sensitive data accessible in the testing environment (like environment variables or configuration files), disrupt testing processes, or potentially modify application code if the testing environment has write access. The injection could happen through compromised developer accounts, malicious pull requests, or vulnerabilities in development tools.

**Impact:** Information Disclosure, Denial of Service, Code Tampering, Potential Privilege Escalation (in specific CI/CD setups). This can lead to significant security breaches, compromised builds, and delayed vulnerability detection.

**Jasmine Component Affected:** Test Runner (executes all test code within the testing environment).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement rigorous code review processes for all test code, treating it with the same security scrutiny as production code.
* Enforce strong access control and authentication for development environments and code repositories to prevent unauthorized code changes.
* Utilize dependency scanning and vulnerability monitoring for all test dependencies to identify and mitigate risks from compromised libraries.
* Apply the principle of least privilege to testing environments, limiting access to sensitive resources and functionalities.
* Employ sandboxed or containerized testing environments to isolate test execution and limit the potential impact of malicious code.
* Educate developers on secure coding practices for writing tests, emphasizing the risks of injecting or including untrusted code in test suites.
