## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Inject Malicious Code via Jasmine Tests *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__inject_malicious_code_via_jasmine_tests__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker aims to inject malicious JavaScript code into the Jasmine test suite. If successful, this code will execute within the context of the application being tested, potentially during development, CI/CD, or even in a misconfigured production-like test environment.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Full application compromise.
    *   Data exfiltration of sensitive application data.
    *   Account takeover or manipulation.
    *   Installation of backdoors for persistent access.
    *   Application defacement or disruption.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Supply Chain Attack on Jasmine Dependencies *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__supply_chain_attack_on_jasmine_dependencies__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers target the dependencies of Jasmine itself. By compromising a dependency package, they can inject malicious code that gets included when developers install Jasmine and its dependencies.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Widespread compromise of applications using Jasmine and the affected dependency.
    *   Similar impacts as injecting malicious code directly into tests (data theft, account takeover, etc.).
    *   Difficult to detect initially as the vulnerability resides in a trusted dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Jasmine's Dependencies *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_jasmine's_dependencies__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the specific action within the Supply Chain Attack. Attackers actively work to compromise a direct or transitive dependency of Jasmine. This could involve:
    *   Uploading a malicious version of a dependency to a package registry.
    *   Compromising the maintainer account of a dependency package.
    *   Exploiting vulnerabilities in the dependency's infrastructure.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Successful execution of the Supply Chain Attack.
    *   Injection of malicious code into applications using Jasmine.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Malicious Test Code Injection during Development *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__malicious_test_code_injection_during_development__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Malicious code is directly inserted into the Jasmine test files during the development process. This can happen through:
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Insider Threat/Compromised Developer Account *** HIGH RISK PATH ***:** A malicious insider developer intentionally adds malicious code, or an attacker compromises a legitimate developer's account and injects code.
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerable Development Tools/Environment *** HIGH RISK PATH ***:** An attacker compromises a developer's machine or development environment (e.g., IDE, build tools) and injects malicious code into the test suite.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Direct execution of malicious code within the development environment and potentially propagated to deployed applications if tests are part of the build/deployment process.
    *   Similar impacts as general malicious code injection.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Insider Threat/Compromised Developer Account *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__insider_threatcompromised_developer_account__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:**  An individual with internal access (insider) intentionally introduces malicious code into the test suite, or an external attacker gains control of a developer's account through phishing, credential stuffing, or other means.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Successful Malicious Test Code Injection.
    *   Bypass of security controls due to trusted access.
    *   Difficult to detect without strong code review and monitoring.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Vulnerable Development Tools/Environment *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__vulnerable_development_toolsenvironment__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Attackers exploit vulnerabilities in the development tools (IDE, build tools, linters, etc.) or the developer's machine itself (OS, software vulnerabilities) to gain access and inject malicious code into the test suite.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Successful Malicious Test Code Injection.
    *   Compromise of developer machines and potentially the wider development infrastructure.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Information Disclosure via Jasmine Test Output *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__information_disclosure_via_jasmine_test_output__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Jasmine test execution and reports can inadvertently leak sensitive information if not properly managed.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Exposure of sensitive data, secrets, API keys, internal configurations, or application logic.
    *   Information gathering for further attacks.
    *   Reputational damage and compliance violations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Sensitive Data in Test Descriptions/Expectations *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__sensitive_data_in_test_descriptionsexpectations__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Developers accidentally or intentionally include sensitive information directly within test code, such as in test descriptions, expected values, or example data used in tests.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Accidental Inclusion of Secrets/API Keys in Test Code *** HIGH RISK PATH ***:** Specifically, developers hardcode secrets, API keys, passwords, or other credentials directly into test files.
    *   Exposure of these secrets if test reports or code repositories are accessible to unauthorized individuals.
    *   Potential for account compromise, data breaches, and unauthorized access to external services.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Accidental Inclusion of Secrets/API Keys in Test Code *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__accidental_inclusion_of_secretsapi_keys_in_test_code__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** This is the specific action of hardcoding sensitive credentials directly into test files, often due to developer oversight or lack of awareness of secure coding practices.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Direct exposure of secrets in code repositories and test reports.
    *   High risk of immediate exploitation if these secrets are discovered.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Test Reports Exposed to Unauthorized Users *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__test_reports_exposed_to_unauthorized_users__high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Jasmine test reports, which may contain sensitive information or error details, are made accessible to unauthorized users. This can happen if:
    *   **[CRITICAL NODE] Publicly Accessible Test Report Artifacts (e.g., in CI/CD) *** HIGH RISK PATH ***:** Test report files generated by CI/CD pipelines are stored in publicly accessible locations (e.g., misconfigured artifact repositories, public web servers).
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Information disclosure from test reports.
    *   Exposure of secrets if accidentally included in test output or error messages.
    *   Information gathering for further attacks by understanding application internals from error messages and test results.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Publicly Accessible Test Report Artifacts (e.g., in CI/CD) *** HIGH RISK PATH ***](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__publicly_accessible_test_report_artifacts__e_g___in_cicd___high_risk_path.md)

*   **Attack Vector:** Misconfiguration of CI/CD pipelines or artifact storage leads to test report files being stored in publicly accessible locations, often unintentionally.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   Exposure of test reports to anyone on the internet.
    *   Information disclosure and potential secret leakage from these reports.
    *   Easy discovery by attackers through web crawling or directory listing.
