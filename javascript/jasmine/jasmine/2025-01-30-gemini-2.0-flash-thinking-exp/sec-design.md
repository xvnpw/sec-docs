# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business Priorities and Goals:
 - Facilitate robust and reliable Javascript software development by providing a comprehensive testing framework.
 - Enable developers to write clear, maintainable, and effective tests.
 - Support various testing methodologies including Behavior-Driven Development (BDD).
 - Promote code quality and reduce software defects in Javascript applications.
 - Foster a strong open-source community around Javascript testing.

- Most Important Business Risks:
 - Risk of reduced developer productivity if the framework is unreliable, buggy, or poorly documented.
 - Risk of negative community perception and decreased adoption if the framework is perceived as insecure or vulnerable.
 - Risk of supply chain vulnerabilities if dependencies of Jasmine are compromised, potentially affecting projects that use Jasmine.
 - Risk of compatibility issues with evolving Javascript environments and frameworks, leading to developer frustration and abandonment.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing Security Controls:
 - security control: Github repository with version control and history. Implemented in: Github.
 - security control: Open-source community review and contributions. Implemented in: Github community.
 - security control: Issue tracking and bug reporting system. Implemented in: Github Issues.
 - security control: Release management and versioning. Implemented in: Github Releases, npm.
 - accepted risk: Vulnerabilities in dependencies. Accepted risk: inherent in open-source projects relying on external libraries.
 - accepted risk: Potential for malicious contributions. Accepted risk: inherent in open-source projects with community contributions.

- Recommended Security Controls:
 - security control: Implement automated dependency scanning to identify and address vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.
 - security control: Integrate static application security testing (SAST) tools into the build process to detect potential code-level security issues.
 - security control: Conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing, especially before major releases.
 - security control: Establish a clear security incident response plan for addressing reported vulnerabilities.
 - security control: Implement a secure release process, including code signing and checksum verification for distributed packages.

- Security Requirements:
 - Authentication: Not directly applicable to Jasmine framework itself, as it is a library. However, consider authentication in the context of systems where Jasmine is used for testing, such as CI/CD pipelines or test reporting dashboards.
 - Authorization: Not directly applicable to Jasmine framework itself. Authorization is relevant in systems that utilize Jasmine for testing, to control access to test results and configurations.
 - Input Validation: Relevant for test inputs and configurations provided to Jasmine during test execution. Ensure proper validation to prevent unexpected behavior or vulnerabilities in the testing process itself.
 - Cryptography: Not directly applicable to the core Jasmine framework. Cryptographic requirements would be relevant for the applications being tested by Jasmine, and Jasmine should not interfere with or weaken the cryptographic implementations of tested applications.
