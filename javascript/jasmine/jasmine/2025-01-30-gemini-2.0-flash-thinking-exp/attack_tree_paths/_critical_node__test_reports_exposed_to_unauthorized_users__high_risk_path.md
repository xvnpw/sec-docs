### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path

#### 4.1. [CRITICAL NODE] Test Reports Exposed to Unauthorized Users *** HIGH RISK PATH ***

This top-level node highlights the critical risk of making Jasmine test reports accessible to individuals who are not authorized to view them.

*   **Attack Vector:** Unauthorized access to test reports. This can occur through various means, but the primary focus of the sub-path is public accessibility.
*   **Vulnerability:** Lack of proper access control and secure storage mechanisms for Jasmine test reports. This vulnerability stems from misconfigurations or insufficient security considerations during the CI/CD pipeline setup and artifact management.
*   **Potential Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** Test reports often contain valuable information about the application's functionality, internal logic, and potential weaknesses. This can include:
        *   **Test Case Descriptions:** Revealing specific features and functionalities being tested, giving attackers insights into application capabilities.
        *   **Error Messages and Stack Traces:** Exposing technical details about application errors, potential bugs, and underlying technologies. This information can be used to identify vulnerabilities and plan targeted attacks.
        *   **Code Snippets (in some cases):**  Depending on test setup and reporting configurations, snippets of code under test might be included in reports, revealing implementation details.
        *   **Environment Variables and Configuration Details (accidental inclusion):**  In poorly configured environments, sensitive configuration details or environment variables might inadvertently be logged or included in test outputs and subsequently in reports.
    *   **Exposure of Secrets:**  While not best practice, developers might accidentally include secrets (API keys, passwords, etc.) in test data, console logs, or error messages during development and testing. If these are captured in test reports and exposed, it can lead to direct compromise of sensitive credentials.
    *   **Information Gathering for Further Attacks:**  By analyzing test reports, attackers can gain a deeper understanding of the application's architecture, technologies used, potential vulnerabilities, and error handling mechanisms. This information can be leveraged to plan more sophisticated and targeted attacks against the application or its infrastructure.

*   **Likelihood:** **Medium to High**. The likelihood depends heavily on the organization's security practices and CI/CD pipeline configuration. If default settings are used without explicit security hardening, or if developers are unaware of the risks, the likelihood of accidental public exposure is significant.  The ease of misconfiguring cloud storage or web servers to be publicly accessible further increases the likelihood.
*   **Severity:** **High**. The severity is high due to the potential for significant information disclosure, which can lead to various negative consequences, including data breaches, reputational damage, and further targeted attacks. Exposure of secrets would be considered critical severity.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Implement Robust Access Control:**  Ensure that access to test report storage locations is strictly controlled and limited to authorized personnel only. Utilize role-based access control (RBAC) and principle of least privilege.
    *   **Secure Storage Solutions:** Store test reports in secure, private storage solutions that are not publicly accessible by default. Consider using dedicated artifact repositories with access control features or private cloud storage buckets with appropriate permissions.
    *   **Regular Security Audits and Reviews:** Conduct periodic security audits of CI/CD pipelines and artifact storage configurations to identify and rectify any misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access.
    *   **Security Awareness Training:** Educate development and DevOps teams about the risks of exposing test reports and the importance of secure CI/CD practices.
    *   **Data Sanitization and Filtering:** Implement mechanisms to sanitize or filter sensitive information from test reports before they are stored or archived. This might involve redacting secrets, removing overly verbose error messages, or configuring test reporting to exclude sensitive data.
    *   **Secure CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:**  Harden the CI/CD pipeline configuration to ensure that artifacts are stored securely and access is restricted. Avoid default public settings and actively configure security controls.

#### 4.2. [CRITICAL NODE] Publicly Accessible Test Report Artifacts (e.g., in CI/CD) *** HIGH RISK PATH ***

This sub-node drills down into a specific and common scenario where test reports become publicly accessible due to misconfigurations in CI/CD pipelines and artifact storage.

*   **Attack Vector:** Direct access to publicly accessible test report files stored as artifacts from CI/CD pipelines. Attackers can discover these reports through:
    *   **Direct URL Access:** If the storage location is predictable or URLs are inadvertently leaked (e.g., in commit messages, public forums).
    *   **Search Engine Indexing:** Publicly accessible web servers or cloud storage buckets can be indexed by search engines, making reports discoverable through simple searches.
    *   **Directory Listing (if enabled):**  Misconfigured web servers might expose directory listings, allowing attackers to browse and discover test report files.
    *   **Brute-force or Dictionary Attacks (less likely but possible):** If URLs are somewhat predictable, attackers might attempt to brute-force or use dictionary attacks to discover report locations.

*   **Vulnerability:**  **Misconfiguration of artifact repositories, public web servers, or cloud storage services used in the CI/CD pipeline.** This includes:
    *   **Default Public Permissions:**  Using default settings on artifact repositories or cloud storage that make files publicly readable.
    *   **Accidental Public Sharing:**  Unintentionally making storage buckets or web server directories public during configuration or maintenance.
    *   **Lack of Access Control Implementation:**  Failing to implement proper access control lists (ACLs) or identity and access management (IAM) policies on storage locations.
    *   **Insecure CI/CD Pipeline Scripts:**  Pipeline scripts that inadvertently copy or move test reports to public locations without proper security considerations.

*   **Potential Impact:**  The potential impact is **identical** to the parent node "Test Reports Exposed to Unauthorized Users" and includes:
    *   Information Disclosure
    *   Exposure of Secrets
    *   Information Gathering for Further Attacks

*   **Likelihood:** **Medium to High**.  This is a common misconfiguration, especially in fast-paced development environments where security might be overlooked in favor of speed and convenience. The ease of accidentally making cloud storage buckets public and the potential for default insecure settings in CI/CD tools contribute to a higher likelihood.
*   **Severity:** **High**.  As with the parent node, the severity remains high due to the potential for significant information disclosure and its cascading consequences.

*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Secure Artifact Repository Configuration:**  **Prioritize private artifact repositories.** If using public repositories, ensure strict access control is configured and enforced.
    *   **Private Cloud Storage:**  Utilize private cloud storage buckets for storing CI/CD artifacts, including test reports. **Never use public buckets for sensitive data.**
    *   **IAM and ACLs:**  Implement robust Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and Access Control Lists (ACLs) to restrict access to artifact storage to only authorized CI/CD pipelines and personnel.
    *   **CI/CD Pipeline Security Hardening:**  Review and harden CI/CD pipeline configurations to ensure that artifacts are stored securely and access is restricted throughout the pipeline lifecycle.
    *   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):**  Utilize Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to define and manage artifact storage and CI/CD infrastructure configurations. This promotes consistency and reduces the risk of manual misconfigurations.
    *   **Regular Security Scanning and Configuration Checks:** Implement automated security scanning and configuration checks for CI/CD infrastructure and artifact storage to detect and remediate misconfigurations proactively.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant only the necessary permissions to CI/CD pipelines and users for accessing artifact storage. Avoid overly permissive access policies.
    *   **Regularly Review Publicly Accessible Content:** Periodically review any publicly accessible web servers or storage locations associated with the application to ensure no test reports or other sensitive artifacts are inadvertently exposed.
