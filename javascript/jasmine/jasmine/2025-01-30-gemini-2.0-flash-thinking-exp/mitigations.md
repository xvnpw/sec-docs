# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Mitigation Strategy: [Keep Jasmine and its Dependencies Updated](./mitigation_strategies/keep_jasmine_and_its_dependencies_updated.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: Regularly monitor Jasmine's release notes and security advisories for new versions and security patches. Subscribe to Jasmine's mailing lists or follow their official channels (e.g., GitHub releases, Twitter).
    *   Step 2: Periodically update Jasmine and its dependencies to the latest stable versions. Use package managers like npm or yarn to update Jasmine (e.g., `npm update jasmine`, `yarn upgrade jasmine`).
    *   Step 3: After updating Jasmine, run your test suite to ensure compatibility and that no regressions have been introduced by the Jasmine update. Pay close attention to any changes in Jasmine's behavior or API that might affect your tests.
    *   Step 4: Document the updates made to Jasmine and its dependencies, including the versions updated to and the date of the update.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities in Jasmine: Exploitation of known security flaws in outdated versions of the Jasmine framework itself. - Severity: High

*   **Impact:**
    *   Dependency Vulnerabilities in Jasmine: Significantly reduces the risk by ensuring the project is using a version of Jasmine that includes the latest security patches and bug fixes specifically for the testing framework.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Partial - Developers are generally aware of updates, but there is no formal, scheduled process specifically for updating Jasmine. Updates are often done reactively rather than proactively.

*   **Missing Implementation:** Implement a scheduled process for checking for and applying updates specifically to Jasmine. This could be part of a monthly maintenance cycle or triggered by Jasmine release announcements.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Verify Jasmine Package Integrity](./mitigation_strategies/verify_jasmine_package_integrity.md)

*   **Description:**
    *   Step 1: When installing Jasmine from package registries (like npm), utilize package integrity verification mechanisms to ensure the downloaded Jasmine package is authentic and hasn't been tampered with.
    *   Step 2: For npm, `npm install` by default verifies package integrity using checksums from `package-lock.json`. Ensure `package-lock.json` is used and up-to-date to enable this verification for Jasmine.
    *   Step 3:  When adding or updating Jasmine, carefully review the installation output for any warnings or errors related to package integrity.
    *   Step 4: If you have concerns about the integrity of the Jasmine package, manually verify the package checksum against trusted sources. Jasmine's official GitHub repository or website might provide checksums for releases.

*   **List of Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Jasmine: Malicious actors tampering with the Jasmine package on public registries to distribute compromised versions of the testing framework. - Severity: Medium

*   **Impact:**
    *   Supply Chain Attacks Targeting Jasmine: Moderately reduces the risk by detecting tampered Jasmine packages during installation, preventing the introduction of potentially compromised testing framework code into the project.

*   **Currently Implemented:** Yes - `npm install` integrity checks are enabled by default due to the use of `package-lock.json`, which implicitly covers Jasmine package integrity verification during installation.

*   **Missing Implementation:**  While basic integrity checks are in place, there's no explicit process to *specifically* verify Jasmine package integrity beyond the default `npm` mechanisms. For higher assurance, consider adding a step to the build or deployment process to explicitly verify the Jasmine package checksum against a known good value from Jasmine's official sources, especially for critical projects.
