# Attack Tree Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To execute arbitrary code within the application's context or exfiltrate sensitive information by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities introduced by the use of the Jasmine testing framework (focusing on high-risk areas).

## Attack Tree Visualization

```
Compromise Application via Jasmine
- Exploit Malicious Test Code (HIGH RISK PATH)
    - Introduce Malicious Test Code

    - Identify and Exploit a Known Vulnerability in Jasmine
        - Outdated Jasmine Version with Known Vulnerabilities (CRITICAL NODE)
        - Zero-Day Vulnerability in Jasmine (CRITICAL NODE)
- Exploit Misconfiguration of Jasmine (HIGH RISK PATH)
    - Insecure Configuration of Test Environment (CRITICAL NODE)

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Malicious Test Code](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_malicious_test_code.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Malicious Test Code**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker introduces malicious test code into the application's codebase.
*   **Sequence of Actions:**
    1. The attacker compromises a developer's machine.
    2. Using their access, the attacker injects malicious test files or modifies existing ones.
    3. When the test suite is executed by Jasmine, the malicious code runs within the test environment.
    4. This malicious code can perform actions such as:
        *   Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive environment variables or configuration files.
        *   Making unauthorized network requests to external servers.
        *   Modifying application data or state.
*   **Critical Node within this Path: Compromise Developer Machine**
    *   **Significance:** Compromising a developer's machine provides a direct pathway to inject malicious code into the project.
    *   **Potential Consequences:** Full access to the developer's resources, including source code, credentials, and the ability to manipulate the codebase, leading to the introduction of malicious tests.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jasmine Itself](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_jasmine_itself.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Vulnerabilities in Jasmine Itself**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability directly within the Jasmine testing framework.
*   **Sequence of Actions (Outdated Jasmine Version):**
    1. The application uses an outdated version of Jasmine with known security vulnerabilities.
    2. The attacker identifies a publicly known exploit for one of these vulnerabilities.
    3. The attacker crafts an input or manipulates the test execution environment to trigger the vulnerability in Jasmine.
    4. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the test runner or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Sequence of Actions (Zero-Day Vulnerability):**
    1. The attacker discovers a previously unknown vulnerability (zero-day) within the Jasmine codebase.
    2. The attacker develops an exploit for this zero-day vulnerability.
    3. The attacker crafts an input or manipulates the test execution environment to trigger the zero-day vulnerability in Jasmine.
    4. Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the test runner or gain unauthorized access.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Outdated Jasmine Version with Known Vulnerabilities:**
        *   **Significance:** Using an outdated version directly exposes the application to known and potentially easily exploitable weaknesses.
        *   **Potential Consequences:**  Attackers can leverage readily available exploits to compromise the test environment and potentially the application.
    *   **Zero-Day Vulnerability in Jasmine:**
        *   **Significance:** A previously unknown vulnerability offers a direct and potentially powerful way to compromise the application through its testing framework.
        *   **Potential Consequences:**  Complete control over the test execution environment, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution and data breaches.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Misconfiguration of Jasmine](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_misconfiguration_of_jasmine.md)

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Misconfiguration of Jasmine**

*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker leverages insecure configurations within the test environment where Jasmine is executed.
*   **Sequence of Actions:**
    1. The test environment is configured in a way that grants excessive permissions or exposes sensitive resources.
    2. An attacker, potentially through a compromised developer machine or by exploiting a vulnerability, gains access to the test environment.
    3. The attacker leverages the misconfiguration to access sensitive resources that should not be available during testing.
    4. This could involve accessing databases, internal APIs, or sensitive configuration files.
*   **Critical Nodes within this Path:**
    *   **Insecure Configuration of Test Environment:**
        *   **Significance:** A poorly configured test environment creates opportunities for attackers to gain unauthorized access and escalate privileges.
        *   **Potential Consequences:** Exposure of sensitive data, modification of application state, or the ability to pivot to other parts of the infrastructure.
    *   **Allows Access to Sensitive Resources During Tests:**
        *   **Significance:**  Directly exposes sensitive information or functionalities to the test environment, making it a prime target for exploitation.
        *   **Potential Consequences:** Leakage of API keys, database credentials, or other secrets, potentially leading to full application compromise.
