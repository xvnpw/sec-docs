# Attack Surface Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

* **Attack Surface: Malicious Test Code Injection**
    * **Description:** Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code into Jasmine test files.
    * **How Jasmine Contributes:** Jasmine executes the JavaScript code within the test files during the testing process. This provides a direct execution path for injected code.
    * **Example:** A compromised developer account pushes a test file that includes code to exfiltrate environment variables containing API keys during test execution.
    * **Impact:** Data exfiltration, code tampering, unauthorized access to resources, supply chain contamination if the malicious code persists.
    * **Risk Severity:** Critical
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Implement strict access controls and code review processes for test files.
        * Utilize version control systems and track changes to test files diligently.
        * Employ static analysis tools to scan test code for suspicious patterns.
        * Educate developers on secure coding practices for test code.

## Attack Surface: [Compromised Test Dependencies](./attack_surfaces/compromised_test_dependencies.md)

* **Attack Surface: Compromised Test Dependencies**
    * **Description:** Jasmine tests rely on external JavaScript libraries or modules, which are compromised with malicious code.
    * **How Jasmine Contributes:** Jasmine's test runner executes code from these dependencies when running tests.
    * **Example:** A popular testing utility library used in Jasmine tests is compromised, and the malicious code is executed during test runs, potentially affecting the development environment.
    * **Impact:** Similar to malicious test code injection, including data breaches, code manipulation, and supply chain attacks.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Regularly audit and verify the integrity of test dependencies.
        * Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in test dependencies.
        * Consider using dependency pinning or lock files to ensure consistent and verified dependency versions.
        * Explore using private registries for internal dependencies to control the supply chain.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure Test Execution Environment](./attack_surfaces/insecure_test_execution_environment.md)

* **Attack Surface: Insecure Test Execution Environment**
    * **Description:** The environment where Jasmine tests are executed (e.g., developer's machine, CI/CD server) is compromised or misconfigured.
    * **How Jasmine Contributes:** Jasmine tests are executed within this environment, inheriting its security posture. A compromised environment can allow attackers to manipulate test execution or access sensitive data used during testing.
    * **Example:** A CI/CD server running Jasmine tests has weak access controls, allowing an attacker to modify test configurations or inject malicious code into the test execution process.
    * **Impact:** Compromise of the development pipeline, injection of malicious code into builds, data breaches.
    * **Risk Severity:** High
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * Harden the security of development machines and CI/CD servers.
        * Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms for access to these environments.
        * Regularly patch and update the operating systems and software on these machines.
        * Isolate test execution environments using virtualization or containerization.
