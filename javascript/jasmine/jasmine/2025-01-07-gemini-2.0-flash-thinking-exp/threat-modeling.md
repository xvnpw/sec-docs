# Threat Model Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Threat: [Compromised Jasmine Package](./threats/compromised_jasmine_package.md)

*   **Threat:** Compromised Jasmine Package
    *   **Description:** An attacker compromises the official Jasmine npm package (or other distribution method). They inject malicious code directly into the Jasmine library. When developers install or update Jasmine, this malicious code is included in their project.
    *   **Impact:**  Malicious code within the core Jasmine library can execute during the testing process, potentially:
        *   Modifying test behavior to hide vulnerabilities.
        *   Exfiltrating sensitive information from the development environment during test execution.
        *   Injecting malicious code into the application's build artifacts through the testing process.
    *   **Which Jasmine Component is Affected:** npm package
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in Jasmine.
        *   Implement Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) practices.
        *   Consider using a private npm registry or mirroring official registries.
        *   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or signatures.
        *   Monitor for unexpected changes or updates to the Jasmine package.

## Threat: [Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/transitive_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Transitive Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Jasmine relies on other JavaScript libraries (transitive dependencies). Vulnerabilities in these direct dependencies of Jasmine can be exploited, impacting the testing process. While not directly *in* Jasmine's code, the risk is introduced *by* Jasmine's dependencies.
    *   **Impact:** Exploiting vulnerabilities in Jasmine's direct dependencies could lead to:
        *   Malicious code execution within the testing environment during Jasmine's operation.
        *   Information disclosure from the development environment while Jasmine is running tests.
        *   Denial of service against the testing infrastructure used by Jasmine.
    *   **Which Jasmine Component is Affected:** Jasmine's dependency management (package.json, yarn.lock, package-lock.json)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize dependency scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in Jasmine's direct dependencies.
        *   Keep Jasmine and its direct dependencies updated.
        *   Investigate and potentially replace vulnerable direct dependencies if updates are unavailable.

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Injection Leveraging Jasmine APIs](./threats/malicious_test_code_injection_leveraging_jasmine_apis.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Test Code Injection Leveraging Jasmine APIs
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious code into test files that specifically utilizes Jasmine's APIs or functionality to perform malicious actions during test execution. This goes beyond simply having malicious JavaScript; it leverages Jasmine's context.
    *   **Impact:** Malicious test code using Jasmine APIs could:
        *   Manipulate the test environment to exfiltrate data.
        *   Use Jasmine's reporting mechanisms to leak information.
        *   Interfere with the test execution flow to hide malicious activities.
        *   Potentially interact with the system in ways that Jasmine's test runner allows.
    *   **Which Jasmine Component is Affected:** Test files (spec files), Jasmine's core API (e.g., `describe`, `it`, `expect`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement strong access controls and authentication for code repositories.
        *   Enforce mandatory code review processes for all test code changes, focusing on the usage of Jasmine APIs.
        *   Utilize static analysis tools to scan test code for suspicious patterns or misuse of Jasmine functions.
        *   Secure developer workstations to prevent unauthorized code modifications.
        *   Monitor code changes and pull requests for unusual or unexpected test code.
