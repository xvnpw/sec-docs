# Attack Surface Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Attack Surface: [Accidental Inclusion of Test Code in Production Builds](./attack_surfaces/accidental_inclusion_of_test_code_in_production_builds.md)

**Description:** Test files, containing potentially sensitive data (test credentials, API keys) or less secure code used for testing purposes, are mistakenly included in the final production deployment.

**How Jasmine Contributes:** Jasmine tests are typically written in separate files. If the build process isn't configured to explicitly exclude these files, they can be bundled with the production code.

**Example:** A test file containing hardcoded API keys for testing external services is deployed to production, making those keys accessible to attackers.

**Impact:** Exposure of sensitive information, potential for unauthorized access to external services, and potential execution of less secure test code in a production environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement a robust build process that explicitly excludes test directories and files.
* Utilize environment variables or secure configuration management for sensitive data in tests.
* Employ static analysis tools to detect inclusion of test files in production builds.
* Regularly review build configurations and deployment pipelines.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Test Infrastructure](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_test_infrastructure.md)

**Description:** The environment where Jasmine tests are executed (e.g., development servers, CI/CD runners) is not adequately secured, allowing unauthorized access.

**How Jasmine Contributes:** Jasmine requires an environment to run. If this environment is compromised, attackers can potentially manipulate tests, access test data, or pivot to other systems.

**Example:** A CI/CD server running Jasmine tests is publicly accessible due to misconfiguration. Attackers gain access and can modify test results or inject malicious code into the build process.

**Impact:** Compromise of test data, manipulation of test results leading to undetected vulnerabilities, potential for injecting malicious code into the application build, and access to other systems within the test infrastructure.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Secure test environments with strong access controls and network segmentation.
* Regularly patch and update the operating systems and software used in the test infrastructure.
* Implement multi-factor authentication for access to test environments.
* Monitor test infrastructure for suspicious activity.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Test Code Injection](./attack_surfaces/malicious_test_code_injection.md)

**Description:** An attacker with access to the development environment or CI/CD pipeline injects malicious test code designed to exploit vulnerabilities or compromise the system.

**How Jasmine Contributes:** Jasmine executes the test code provided to it. If this code is malicious, it can perform unintended actions.

**Example:** An attacker injects a test that attempts to access sensitive files on the testing server or makes unauthorized network requests.

**Impact:** Potential for data breaches, system compromise, or denial of service within the testing environment.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict access controls to the development environment and CI/CD pipeline.
* Enforce code review processes for all test code changes.
* Use integrity checks to ensure test files haven't been tampered with.
* Isolate test execution environments to limit the impact of malicious tests.
