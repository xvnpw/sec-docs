### 4. Deep Analysis of Attack Tree Path: Exploit Weak Access Controls on Code Repository

**Attack Tree Path:** Exploit Weak Access Controls on Code Repository -> Attackers gain access to the code repository due to inadequate access controls, allowing them to modify test files.

**4.1 Decomposition of the Attack Path:**

* **Step 1: Inadequate Access Controls on Code Repository:** This is the foundational vulnerability. It implies weaknesses in the mechanisms used to control who can access and modify the code repository. Examples include:
    * **Weak or default credentials:**  Using easily guessable passwords for repository accounts.
    * **Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Not requiring a second factor of authentication.
    * **Overly permissive access rights:** Granting write access to users who don't need it.
    * **Publicly accessible repository (when it should be private):**  Accidentally or intentionally making the repository accessible to anyone.
    * **Compromised developer accounts:** Attackers gaining access to legitimate developer credentials through phishing, malware, or other means.
    * **Insufficient access revocation:** Failing to remove access for former employees or contractors.
* **Step 2: Attackers Gain Access to the Code Repository:**  Exploiting the weaknesses identified in Step 1, attackers successfully authenticate or bypass authentication to gain access to the repository.
* **Step 3: Attackers Modify Test Files:** Once inside the repository with sufficient permissions, attackers target Jasmine test files.

**4.2 Threat Modeling:**

* **Threat Actors:**
    * **Malicious Insiders:**  Disgruntled employees or contractors with existing access.
    * **External Attackers:**  Individuals or groups seeking to disrupt the application, steal data, or gain unauthorized access.
    * **Automated Bots:**  Scripts designed to scan for and exploit common vulnerabilities.
* **Threat Intent:**
    * **Sabotage:**  Intentionally breaking the application or introducing vulnerabilities.
    * **Supply Chain Attack:**  Compromising the development process to inject malicious code that will be deployed to end-users.
    * **Covering Tracks:**  Modifying tests to hide malicious code or actions.
    * **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Making tests consistently fail, hindering development and deployment.
    * **Information Gathering:**  Potentially using test files to understand application logic or identify vulnerabilities.

**4.3 Impact Assessment:**

Modifying Jasmine test files can have significant and varied impacts:

* **False Sense of Security:** Attackers can modify tests to always pass, even if the application has critical bugs or vulnerabilities. This can lead to a false sense of security and the deployment of flawed code.
* **Introduction of Vulnerabilities:** Attackers can subtly alter test files to introduce vulnerabilities that are not detected by the existing test suite. This could involve changing expected behavior or manipulating test data.
* **Masking Malicious Code:**  Attackers can introduce malicious code into the application and simultaneously modify tests to ensure the malicious code doesn't trigger any failures.
* **Disruption of Development Workflow:**  Constantly failing tests due to malicious modifications can significantly slow down development, create frustration, and impact release schedules.
* **Compromised Code Quality:**  If developers rely on the modified tests, they might unknowingly introduce bugs or fail to address existing issues.
* **Supply Chain Compromise:**  If the compromised repository is used to build and deploy the application, the malicious changes in the test files (and potentially the application code they were designed to mask) will be propagated to end-users.
* **Data Exfiltration (Indirect):** While less direct, attackers could potentially modify tests to subtly leak sensitive information during test execution, although this is less likely with Jasmine tests compared to integration or end-to-end tests.

**4.4 Vulnerability Analysis:**

The core vulnerability is **weak access controls** on the code repository. This can manifest in several ways:

* **Lack of Strong Authentication Policies:** Not enforcing strong password requirements, lacking MFA, or not regularly rotating credentials.
* **Insufficient Authorization Management:**  Granting excessive permissions to users or not properly managing access levels based on roles and responsibilities.
* **Inadequate Monitoring and Auditing:**  Not tracking access attempts, modifications, or other relevant activities within the repository. This makes it difficult to detect and respond to unauthorized access.
* **Poor Repository Security Configuration:**  Using default settings, not enabling security features provided by the repository platform, or misconfiguring access rules.
* **Lack of Awareness and Training:** Developers and administrators not being adequately trained on secure coding practices and repository security.

**4.5 Mitigation Strategy Formulation:**

To mitigate the risk of this attack path, the following strategies should be implemented:

* **Strengthen Access Controls:**
    * **Enforce Strong Password Policies:** Require complex passwords and regular password changes.
    * **Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**  Mandate MFA for all repository accounts.
    * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Grant only the necessary permissions to users based on their roles.
    * **Regularly Review and Revoke Access:**  Periodically audit user access and remove permissions for former employees or those who no longer require access.
    * **Secure API Keys and Tokens:**  Properly manage and secure any API keys or tokens used to access the repository.
* **Enhance Repository Security Configuration:**
    * **Enable Security Features:** Utilize security features provided by the repository platform (e.g., branch protection rules, commit signing).
    * **Configure Access Rules Carefully:**  Define granular access rules based on branches, folders, or specific files if necessary.
    * **Keep Repository Software Updated:**  Ensure the repository platform is running the latest secure version.
* **Implement Monitoring and Auditing:**
    * **Track Access Attempts and Modifications:**  Monitor repository logs for suspicious activity.
    * **Set Up Alerts for Unauthorized Access:**  Configure alerts to notify administrators of unusual login attempts or permission changes.
    * **Regularly Audit Repository Activity:**  Periodically review logs and access patterns to identify potential security breaches.
* **Secure Development Practices:**
    * **Code Reviews:**  Implement mandatory code reviews for all changes, including test files. This can help identify malicious or unintended modifications.
    * **Commit Signing:**  Require developers to sign their commits to ensure authenticity and non-repudiation.
    * **Branch Protection Rules:**  Enforce rules that require reviews and checks before merging code into protected branches (e.g., `main`, `develop`).
    * **Immutable Infrastructure (where applicable):**  Treat infrastructure as immutable, making it harder for attackers to make persistent changes.
* **Incident Response Plan:**
    * **Develop a plan to respond to a repository compromise:**  Outline steps for containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident analysis.
    * **Regularly test the incident response plan.**
* **Security Awareness Training:**
    * **Educate developers and administrators on repository security best practices and the risks associated with weak access controls.**

**4.6 Risk Assessment:**

* **Likelihood:**  Moderate to High, depending on the current security posture of the code repository. If basic security measures are lacking, the likelihood is higher.
* **Severity:** High. The potential consequences of modified test files can range from disrupting development to introducing critical vulnerabilities into the deployed application, leading to significant financial and reputational damage.

### 5. Conclusion

The attack path "Exploit Weak Access Controls on Code Repository" leading to the modification of Jasmine test files poses a significant risk to the security and integrity of the application. By exploiting inadequate access controls, attackers can undermine the testing process, introduce vulnerabilities, and potentially compromise the entire software supply chain.

Implementing robust access controls, enhancing repository security configurations, and fostering secure development practices are crucial steps to mitigate this risk. Continuous monitoring and a well-defined incident response plan are also essential for detecting and responding to potential breaches effectively. Prioritizing the security of the code repository is paramount for maintaining the trustworthiness and reliability of the application.
