# Attack Tree Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To execute arbitrary code within the application's context by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Jasmine testing framework.

## Attack Tree Path: [Manipulate Test Execution Environment](./attack_tree_paths/manipulate_test_execution_environment.md)

*   This path focuses on attackers interfering with the environment where Jasmine tests are executed to introduce malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Tests](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_tests.md)

*   Attackers aim to introduce their own code disguised as tests to be executed by Jasmine.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Jasmine Configuration to Include Malicious Files](./attack_tree_paths/modify_jasmine_configuration_to_include_malicious_files.md)

*   Attackers target Jasmine's configuration files (e.g., `jasmine.json`) to include malicious JavaScript files.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Insecure Configuration Storage/Retrieval](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_insecure_configuration_storageretrieval.md)

*   Attackers exploit weaknesses in how configuration files are stored and accessed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Access Configuration Files with Weak Permissions](./attack_tree_paths/access_configuration_files_with_weak_permissions.md)

*   Attackers directly access configuration files due to overly permissive file system permissions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Test File Inclusion Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_test_file_inclusion_mechanisms.md)

*   Attackers leverage Jasmine's mechanisms for discovering and loading test files to inject malicious code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Path Traversal Vulnerabilities in Test File Loading](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_path_traversal_vulnerabilities_in_test_file_loading.md)

*   Attackers exploit path traversal flaws to include files outside the intended test directory.

## Attack Tree Path: [Contribute Malicious Tests to Shared Repository (if applicable)](./attack_tree_paths/contribute_malicious_tests_to_shared_repository__if_applicable_.md)

*   In collaborative environments, attackers introduce malicious tests into the shared repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Access Controls on Test Repository](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_access_controls_on_test_repository.md)

*   Attackers directly commit malicious code due to insufficient access controls on the repository.

## Attack Tree Path: [Modify Existing Tests to Introduce Malicious Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/modify_existing_tests_to_introduce_malicious_behavior.md)

*   Attackers alter existing legitimate tests to perform malicious actions when executed.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Unauthorized Access to Test Files](./attack_tree_paths/gain_unauthorized_access_to_test_files.md)

*   Attackers obtain unauthorized access to the files containing the test code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Weak Access Controls on Code Repository](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_weak_access_controls_on_code_repository.md)

*   Attackers gain access to the code repository due to inadequate access controls, allowing them to modify test files.
