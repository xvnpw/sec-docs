# Threat Model Analysis for jasmine/jasmine

## Threat: [Compromised Jasmine Dependency](./threats/compromised_jasmine_dependency.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises the official Jasmine package on npm or another package registry. They might inject malicious code into the package. When developers install or update Jasmine, this malicious code is included in their project's dependencies. The attacker could then execute arbitrary code within the testing environment or even the developer's machine during the installation or test execution phase.

**Impact:**
*   Exfiltration of sensitive data used in tests (e.g., API keys, test credentials).
*   Modification of test results to hide vulnerabilities or introduce backdoors.
*   Compromise of the development environment, potentially leading to further attacks on the application or infrastructure.

**Affected Component:**
*   Jasmine Core Library (npm package)

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize package lock files (e.g., `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`) to ensure consistent dependency versions and prevent unexpected updates.
*   Regularly audit project dependencies for known vulnerabilities using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
*   Consider using a dependency vulnerability scanning tool that integrates with your CI/CD pipeline.
*   Verify the integrity of downloaded packages using checksums or signatures if available.

## Threat: [Malicious Third-Party Jasmine Extension/Helper](./threats/malicious_third-party_jasmine_extensionhelper.md)

**Description:** Developers use community-created Jasmine extensions or helper libraries that contain vulnerabilities or malicious code. This code could be executed during test runs, potentially compromising the testing environment or exposing sensitive data. The attacker might have intentionally created the malicious extension or compromised a legitimate one.

**Impact:**
*   Exfiltration of sensitive data used in tests.
*   Manipulation of test results.
*   Compromise of the testing environment.

**Affected Component:**
*   Jasmine Extension/Helper Libraries

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Exercise caution when using third-party Jasmine extensions and helpers.
*   Thoroughly review the code of any third-party extensions before incorporating them into your project.
*   Check the reputation and maintainership of the extension/helper library. Look for signs of active development and a strong community.
*   Prefer well-established and widely used extensions over less known ones.

## Threat: [Malicious Test Code Introduced by Insiders](./threats/malicious_test_code_introduced_by_insiders.md)

**Description:** A malicious or compromised developer introduces malicious test code that leverages Jasmine's functionalities. This code could be designed to exfiltrate sensitive data accessible during testing through Jasmine's test execution context, create backdoors in the application (if the test environment has write access), or disrupt the testing process by manipulating Jasmine's behavior. The attacker leverages their legitimate access to the codebase and knowledge of Jasmine.

**Impact:**
*   Exposure of sensitive data used in tests.
*   Introduction of vulnerabilities or backdoors into the application.
*   Disruption of the development and testing workflow.

**Affected Component:**
*   Jasmine Test Files
*   Jasmine Test Runner

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement code review processes for test code, similar to application code.
*   Restrict write access to test code repositories to authorized personnel.
*   Utilize version control systems to track changes to test files and identify suspicious modifications.
*   Implement security awareness training for developers to recognize and avoid introducing malicious code.
