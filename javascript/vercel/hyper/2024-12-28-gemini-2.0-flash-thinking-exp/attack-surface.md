**High and Critical Attack Surfaces Directly Involving Hyper:**

*   **Attack Surface:** Renderer Process Exploitation (Cross-Site Scripting - XSS)
    *   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code injected into terminal output is executed within Hyper's renderer process.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper's use of web technologies to render the terminal makes it inherently susceptible to XSS if output is not rigorously sanitized *by Hyper*.
    *   **Example:** A remote server accessed via `ssh` includes a specially crafted escape sequence that injects `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` into the terminal output. Hyper's rendering engine executes this script.
    *   **Impact:**  Access to local resources, execution of arbitrary code within the renderer process, potential information disclosure, UI manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement robust output sanitization within Hyper's rendering logic to neutralize potentially malicious scripts and escape sequences. Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be loaded.

*   **Attack Surface:** Renderer Process Exploitation (Remote Code Execution via Vulnerable Dependencies)
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Node.js modules used by Hyper's renderer process are exploited to execute arbitrary code.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper's reliance on a specific set of Node.js dependencies introduces this attack surface. Vulnerabilities in these dependencies directly impact Hyper's security.
    *   **Example:** A vulnerability in a specific version of a library used for terminal rendering is discovered. An attacker crafts input that triggers this vulnerability, leading to code execution within Hyper.
    *   **Impact:** Full control over the user's machine, data theft, installation of malware.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update all Node.js dependencies to their latest versions to patch known vulnerabilities. Implement a robust dependency management strategy and use tools to identify and address vulnerable dependencies. Employ Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools.

*   **Attack Surface:** Main Process Exploitation (Inter-Process Communication - IPC Vulnerabilities)
    *   **Description:** Maliciously crafted messages sent from the renderer process to the main process exploit vulnerabilities in the main process logic.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper's architecture necessitates communication between the renderer and main processes. The way Hyper implements this communication directly determines the security of this channel.
    *   **Example:** A compromised renderer process sends a crafted IPC message to the main process, instructing it to execute a system command with elevated privileges.
    *   **Impact:** Privilege escalation, execution of arbitrary commands with system-level access, data manipulation.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement secure IPC mechanisms, carefully validating and sanitizing all messages received by the main process from renderer processes. Use the `contextBridge` API securely to expose only necessary and safe functionalities. Avoid directly exposing Node.js APIs to the renderer.

*   **Attack Surface:** Plugin System Vulnerabilities (Malicious Plugins)
    *   **Description:** Users install third-party plugins that contain malicious code.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper's core design includes a plugin system, inherently introducing the risk of malicious extensions. The security of this system is directly Hyper's responsibility.
    *   **Example:** A user installs a seemingly harmless plugin that, in the background, steals SSH keys or injects malicious commands into new terminal sessions.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, execution of arbitrary commands, system compromise, persistence mechanisms.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement a robust plugin security model, including sandboxing or limiting plugin capabilities. Provide clear guidelines and security best practices for plugin developers. Consider a plugin review or vetting process.

*   **Attack Surface:** Configuration File (`.hyper.js`) Vulnerabilities (Code Injection)
    *   **Description:** Malicious JavaScript code is injected into the `.hyper.js` configuration file and executed when Hyper starts.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper's design decision to execute the `.hyper.js` file as JavaScript directly creates this vulnerability.
    *   **Example:** An attacker gains access to the user's file system and modifies the `.hyper.js` file to include code that downloads and executes a backdoor.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution upon Hyper startup, persistence mechanisms, data theft.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:**  Minimize the amount of code execution directly from the configuration file. If necessary, sanitize or validate configuration options to prevent code injection. Consider alternative, less risky configuration methods.

*   **Attack Surface:** Update Mechanism Vulnerabilities (Insecure Update Channel)
    *   **Description:** Attackers intercept the update process and deliver a malicious update.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper's implementation of its update mechanism determines its security. A poorly implemented update process is a direct vulnerability in Hyper.
    *   **Example:** An attacker performs a man-in-the-middle attack on the update server connection and provides a compromised version of Hyper to the user.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malware, complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement secure update mechanisms using HTTPS and code signing to ensure the integrity and authenticity of updates. Verify the signature of updates before installation.
