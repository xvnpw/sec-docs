# Attack Surface Analysis for vercel/hyper

## Attack Surface: [Electron Framework Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/electron_framework_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Electron Framework Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Security flaws present in the underlying Electron framework (Chromium and Node.js) used by Hyper.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Hyper relies entirely on Electron. Vulnerabilities in Electron directly expose Hyper to potential exploits. Outdated Electron versions in Hyper increase this risk.
    *   **Example:** A known Chromium vulnerability allowing arbitrary code execution through a specially crafted website could be triggered if Hyper navigates to such a site (less likely but possible through plugin interactions or external links). A Node.js vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious plugin.
    *   **Impact:** Remote code execution, arbitrary code execution within the Hyper process, denial of service, information disclosure.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Regularly update Hyper to the latest stable version, ensuring it uses the most recent and patched Electron framework. Implement robust input sanitization and validation to prevent exploitation of potential vulnerabilities. Follow Electron's security best practices.
        *   **Users:** Keep Hyper updated to the latest version. Be cautious about clicking on untrusted links or interacting with potentially malicious content within Hyper.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_or_vulnerable_plugins.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Malicious or Vulnerable Plugins
    *   **Description:** Third-party plugins installed to extend Hyper's functionality can contain malicious code or security vulnerabilities.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Hyper's plugin architecture allows for the execution of arbitrary code through plugins. Lack of strict sandboxing or vetting of plugins increases the risk.
    *   **Example:** A plugin could be designed to steal sensitive data from the user's system, execute arbitrary commands, or act as a backdoor. A vulnerable plugin could be exploited by a remote attacker if the vulnerability is network-accessible.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, system compromise, remote code execution, denial of service.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Implement a robust plugin review process and consider sandboxing plugin execution. Provide clear guidelines and security best practices for plugin developers.
        *   **Users:** Only install plugins from trusted sources. Review plugin permissions and be wary of plugins requesting excessive access. Regularly update installed plugins. Consider using a plugin manager with security features.

## Attack Surface: [Configuration File Injection (`.hyper.js`)](./attack_surfaces/configuration_file_injection____hyper_js__.md)

*   **Attack Surface:** Configuration File Injection (`.hyper.js`)
    *   **Description:** The `.hyper.js` configuration file, if modifiable by an attacker, can be used to execute arbitrary code upon Hyper's startup.
    *   **How Hyper Contributes to the Attack Surface:** Hyper executes code defined within the `.hyper.js` file. If the file permissions are not properly secured or if other vulnerabilities allow for its modification, it becomes an attack vector.
    *   **Example:** An attacker could modify `.hyper.js` to execute a shell command that downloads and runs malware upon Hyper's launch.
    *   **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution, persistence of malicious code, system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Developers:** Ensure Hyper provides clear warnings about the security implications of modifying the configuration file. Consider implementing stricter validation of configuration options.
        *   **Users:** Ensure the `.hyper.js` file has appropriate permissions (read/write only by the user). Be cautious about running Hyper in untrusted environments or with elevated privileges unnecessarily.
