# Threat Model Analysis for vercel/hyper

## Threat: [Exploiting Vulnerable Hyper Extensions](./threats/exploiting_vulnerable_hyper_extensions.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerable Hyper Extensions

*   **Description:** An attacker could install or leverage a malicious or vulnerable Hyper extension to compromise the Hyper process or the underlying system. This could involve extensions with backdoors, vulnerabilities allowing remote code execution, or extensions that steal sensitive information.
*   **Impact:**  Execution of arbitrary code within the Hyper process, potentially leading to system compromise. Information disclosure, manipulation of Hyper's behavior, or denial of service.
*   **Affected Hyper Component:** Hyper's extension loading mechanism, extension APIs, and the extension's own code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Implement a mechanism to review and approve extensions before installation within the application's context (if the application manages extensions).
    *   Restrict the ability to install arbitrary extensions.
    *   Regularly audit installed extensions for known vulnerabilities.
    *   Isolate extension execution to limit their impact.
    *   Inform users about the risks associated with installing untrusted extensions.

## Threat: [Configuration Tampering Leading to Malicious Execution](./threats/configuration_tampering_leading_to_malicious_execution.md)

**Threat:** Configuration Tampering Leading to Malicious Execution

*   **Description:** An attacker could modify Hyper's configuration file (`.hyper.js`) to execute arbitrary commands upon startup or alter Hyper's behavior in a malicious way. This could be achieved through file system access or vulnerabilities in how Hyper handles configuration.
*   **Impact:** Execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the Hyper process. Persistence of malicious code across Hyper restarts. Potential for data exfiltration or system compromise.
*   **Affected Hyper Component:** Hyper's configuration loading mechanism, the `.hyper.js` file.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Protect the `.hyper.js` file with appropriate file system permissions.
    *   Implement integrity checks for the configuration file.
    *   Monitor for unauthorized changes to the configuration file.

## Threat: [Exploiting Electron/Node.js Vulnerabilities within Hyper](./threats/exploiting_electronnode_js_vulnerabilities_within_hyper.md)

**Threat:** Exploiting Electron/Node.js Vulnerabilities within Hyper

*   **Description:** An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying Electron or Node.js framework used by Hyper to execute arbitrary code within the Hyper process. This could be achieved through crafted input processed by Hyper's rendering process or Node.js backend.
*   **Impact:** Remote code execution, leading to potential system compromise. Information disclosure, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
*   **Affected Hyper Component:** Hyper's core Electron and Node.js runtime environment, rendering process.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical (depending on the specific vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   Keep Hyper updated to the latest version to benefit from security patches in Electron and Node.js.
    *   Follow security best practices for Electron application development within Hyper's codebase.
    *   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS vulnerabilities within Hyper's UI.
