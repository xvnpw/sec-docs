## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Hyper](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_hyper.md)

This is the ultimate goal of the attacker and represents the highest level of risk. Success here means the attacker has achieved their objective.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Main Process](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_main_process.md)

Compromising the main process of an Electron application grants significant control. The main process has more privileges and can interact directly with the operating system and other system resources.

## Attack Tree Path: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Main Process](./attack_tree_paths/remote_code_execution__rce__in_main_process.md)

Achieving RCE in the main process allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application. This can lead to full system compromise, data exfiltration, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Plugin System](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_plugin_system.md)

Hyper's plugin system, while providing extensibility, introduces a significant attack surface. If the plugin system is not securely designed and implemented, it can be a primary entry point for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Install Malicious Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/install_malicious_plugin.md)

Social engineering users into installing malicious plugins is a relatively low-effort attack that can have a high impact. Malicious plugins can be designed to perform a wide range of harmful actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Hyper](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_hyper.md)

Hyper relies on numerous Node.js dependencies. If these dependencies have known vulnerabilities, attackers can exploit them to compromise the application. This is a common attack vector due to the complexity of managing dependencies.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerabilities in Node.js Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerabilities_in_node_js_dependencies.md)

This specifically refers to leveraging known security flaws in the third-party libraries that Hyper uses. Exploits for these vulnerabilities are often publicly available, lowering the barrier to entry for attackers.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Main Process -> Remote Code Execution (RCE) in Main Process](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_main_process_-_remote_code_execution__rce__in_main_process.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Exploit vulnerabilities in Node.js APIs or dependencies used by Hyper's main process. This involves finding and leveraging security flaws in the code that runs the core functionality of Hyper.
    * **Why High-Risk:**  The likelihood is medium due to the potential for vulnerabilities in dependencies, and the impact is critical, allowing for complete control of the application and potentially the system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Hyper-Specific Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Plugin System -> Install Malicious Plugin](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_hyper-specific_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_plugin_system_-_install_malicious_plugin.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Socially engineer a user into installing a plugin containing malicious code. This relies on tricking users into trusting and installing untrusted software.
    * **Why High-Risk:** The likelihood is medium as social engineering can be effective, and the impact is high to critical, depending on the capabilities of the malicious plugin. The effort for the attacker is low, making it an attractive option.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Hyper-Specific Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Plugin System -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Specific Plugins](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_hyper-specific_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_plugin_system_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_specific_57cd6bac.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Target known vulnerabilities in popular or widely used Hyper plugins. This involves identifying and exploiting security flaws in plugins developed by the community.
    * **Why High-Risk:** The likelihood is medium if vulnerable plugins are commonly used, and the impact is high, potentially granting significant access or control depending on the plugin's function.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Hyper-Specific Vulnerabilities -> Exploit Input Handling Vulnerabilities -> Command Injection through Terminal Input](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_hyper-specific_vulnerabilities_-_exploit_input_handling_vulnerabilities_-_command_injection__1634f5d2.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Inject malicious commands through the terminal interface that are executed by Hyper or the underlying shell. This relies on weaknesses in how Hyper sanitizes or validates user input.
    * **Why High-Risk:** The likelihood is medium if input sanitization is weak, and the impact is high, allowing for arbitrary command execution on the user's system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Dependencies of Hyper -> Exploit Vulnerabilities in Node.js Dependencies](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_dependencies_of_hyper_-_exploit_vulnerabilities_in_node_js_dependencies.md)

* **Attack Vector:** Leverage known vulnerabilities in the Node.js packages that Hyper depends on. This involves exploiting security flaws in third-party libraries used by Hyper.
    * **Why High-Risk:** The likelihood is medium due to the constant discovery of new vulnerabilities in dependencies, and the impact is high to critical, depending on the specific vulnerability. The effort can be low if exploits are publicly available.
