# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vercel/hyper

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Plugin Vetting and Management (Hyper-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_plugin_vetting_and_management__hyper-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Source Verification:** Before installing, check the plugin's GitHub repository (if available) linked from the Hyper store. Look for activity, stars/forks, and a clear description.
    2.  **Code Review (if possible):** If you have JavaScript/Node.js skills, download the plugin's source *before* installation via `hpm` and examine it for suspicious patterns (network requests, file access, `eval()`).
    3.  **Permission Awareness:** Be mindful of any permission requests during plugin installation (though Hyper's current permission model is limited).
    4.  **Regular Audits:** Regularly review installed plugins via the `.hyper.js` file or `hpm list`. Remove unused or unmaintained plugins.
    5.  **Manual Updates (Optional):** Disable automatic plugin updates in `.hyper.js` by commenting out or modifying the `updateChannel` setting. This allows manual vetting before updating.
    6. **Backup Configuration:** Regularly back up your `.hyper.js` file.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Severity: Critical):** Malicious plugins can run arbitrary code.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Plugins can steal sensitive data.
    *   **System Modification (Severity: High):** Plugins can modify system settings.
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: Medium):** Poorly written plugins can cause resource issues.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **System Modification:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hyper's plugin management via `.hyper.js` and `hpm`.
    *   Warning for plugins outside the official store.
    *   Plugin update checks (configurable).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Plugin Sandboxing:** No isolation; plugins run with Hyper's privileges.
    *   **Automated Code Analysis:** No built-in vulnerability scanning.
    *   **Fine-Grained Permissions:** Limited control over plugin permissions.
    *   **Reputation System:** Basic star ratings only.

## Mitigation Strategy: [`.hyper.js` Configuration Hardening (Hyper-Specific Aspects)](./mitigation_strategies/__hyper_js__configuration_hardening__hyper-specific_aspects_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Version Control:** Store your `.hyper.js` in a Git repository. Commit changes to track modifications and revert if needed.
    2. **Regular Backups:** Include your `.hyper.js` in your regular system backups.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes (Severity: High):** Prevents attackers from modifying settings to install malicious plugins.
    *   **Malware Persistence (Severity: High):** Makes it harder for malware to use Hyper for persistence.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Risk significantly reduced.
    *   **Malware Persistence:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hyper uses `.hyper.js` for configuration (standard text file).

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Built-in FIM:** No built-in file integrity monitoring.
    *   **Configuration Encryption:** `.hyper.js` is stored in plain text.
    *   **Tamper-Proofing:** No specific anti-tampering mechanisms.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Renderer Process Exploit Mitigation (Hyper Update Focus)](./mitigation_strategies/renderer_process_exploit_mitigation__hyper_update_focus_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Minimize Plugin Count:** Fewer plugins reduce the attack surface exposed through Electron.
    2.  **Prompt Hyper Updates:** Update Hyper *immediately* when a new version is released, especially if release notes mention Electron or Chromium updates. Use Hyper's built-in update mechanism.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (Severity: Critical):** Exploits targeting Chromium renderer vulnerabilities.
    *   **Data Exfiltration (Severity: High):** Exploits could access data within Hyper.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Risk moderately reduced.
    *   **Data Exfiltration:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Hyper uses Electron (benefits from Chromium updates).
    *   Hyper provides an update mechanism.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Renderer Process Isolation:** Ideally, each tab/window would be isolated.
    *   **Stricter CSP:** A more restrictive Content Security Policy could be used.
    *   **Automatic Vulnerability Scanning:** No built-in scanning for Electron vulnerabilities.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Resource Usage Monitoring (Using Hyper and OS tools)](./mitigation_strategies/resource_usage_monitoring__using_hyper_and_os_tools_.md)

* **Description:**
    1.  **Regular Monitoring:** Periodically check Hyper's resource usage using your operating system's built-in tools (Task Manager on Windows, Activity Monitor on macOS, `top` or `htop` on Linux).
    2.  **Identify Resource-Intensive Plugins:** If you notice Hyper consuming excessive CPU or memory, investigate which plugins might be responsible. Try disabling plugins one by one to identify the culprit, using `hpm` or editing `.hyper.js`.
    3.  **Report Issues:** If you find a plugin that consistently causes high resource usage, report the issue to the plugin's developer.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Denial of Service (Severity: Medium):** Prevents Hyper from becoming unresponsive.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** Risk moderately reduced.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Operating systems provide resource monitoring tools.
    *   Hyper provides plugin management to disable plugins.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   **Built-in Resource Monitoring:** Hyper has no built-in monitoring.
    *   **Plugin Resource Limits:** No way to limit plugin resource usage.
