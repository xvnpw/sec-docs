Okay, let's create a design document for the Hyper project (https://github.com/vercel/hyper), focusing on aspects relevant for threat modeling.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

Hyper is a terminal emulator built on web technologies (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).  It's designed to be extensible and customizable, prioritizing user experience and developer convenience.  It's an open-source project, likely aiming to build a community and potentially integrate with other Vercel products/services in the future (though this is speculative).  The primary goal is to provide a beautiful and functional terminal application.

Business Priorities:

*   User Adoption:  Attract a large user base by offering a superior terminal experience.
*   Extensibility:  Enable users and developers to easily customize and extend the terminal's functionality.
*   Community Growth:  Foster a vibrant community around the project for contributions, support, and feedback.
*   Performance:  Provide a fast and responsive terminal experience, despite being built on web technologies.
*   Cross-Platform Compatibility:  Support major operating systems (macOS, Windows, Linux).

Business Risks:

*   Security Vulnerabilities:  Given its reliance on web technologies and a plugin architecture, security vulnerabilities (especially those related to plugins) pose a significant risk.  Compromised plugins or core vulnerabilities could lead to arbitrary code execution on the user's system.
*   Performance Bottlenecks:  Poor performance could deter users, especially those accustomed to native terminal applications.
*   Maintenance Overhead:  Maintaining a complex project with a large number of dependencies and a plugin ecosystem can be challenging.
*   Competition:  The terminal emulator market has established players, making it difficult to gain significant market share.
*   Reputation Damage: Security incidents or negative user experiences could damage the reputation of the project and potentially Vercel.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:

*   security control: Code Reviews: Pull requests on GitHub are subject to code review before merging. (Implicit in the GitHub workflow).
*   security control: Dependency Management: Uses package managers (npm/yarn) to manage dependencies, allowing for updates and vulnerability patching. (Standard practice for Node.js projects).
*   security control: Electron Security Best Practices: Likely follows some Electron security best practices, given Vercel's expertise, but this needs verification. (Assumed based on Vercel's reputation).
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): May implement CSP to mitigate XSS risks, but this needs to be confirmed in the codebase. (Recommended for Electron applications).
*   security control: Node Integration Disabled: `nodeIntegration` is likely disabled in the Electron configuration to prevent renderer processes from accessing Node.js APIs directly. (Needs verification).
*   security control: Context Isolation: `contextIsolation` is likely enabled in Electron configuration. (Needs verification).

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Third-Party Plugin Risks: The plugin architecture inherently introduces risk, as Vercel cannot guarantee the security of all third-party plugins. Users install plugins at their own risk.
*   accepted risk: Dependency Vulnerabilities: While dependencies are managed, there's always a risk of vulnerabilities in third-party libraries.  Regular updates are crucial.
*   accepted risk: Zero-Day Exploits:  Vulnerabilities in underlying technologies (Chromium, Node.js) could be exploited before patches are available.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   security control: Plugin Signing/Verification: Implement a mechanism to verify the authenticity and integrity of plugins, such as code signing.
*   security control: Sandboxing: Explore sandboxing techniques for plugins to further isolate them from the main process and the user's system.
*   security control: Regular Security Audits: Conduct regular security audits, including penetration testing and code reviews, focusing on the core application and the plugin API.
*   security control: Vulnerability Disclosure Program: Establish a clear process for reporting and handling security vulnerabilities.
*   security control: Automated Security Scanning: Integrate static and dynamic analysis tools into the build process to identify potential vulnerabilities.

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Not directly applicable to the core terminal application itself, but relevant for any potential integration with external services (e.g., cloud-based configuration syncing).
    *   If external services are integrated, use secure authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth 2.0).

*   Authorization:
    *   Plugin Permissions: Implement a permission system for plugins, limiting their access to system resources and user data.  Users should be prompted to grant permissions to plugins.
    *   File System Access: Carefully control access to the file system, limiting plugins to only necessary directories.

*   Input Validation:
    *   Terminal Input: Sanitize user input to prevent command injection vulnerabilities.
    *   Plugin API: Validate all input passed to the plugin API to prevent malicious plugins from exploiting vulnerabilities.
    *   Configuration Files: Validate configuration files to prevent injection of malicious code or settings.

*   Cryptography:
    *   Secure Communication: If any network communication is involved (e.g., fetching updates, plugin metadata), use secure protocols (HTTPS).
    *   Data Storage: If sensitive data is stored locally (e.g., API keys, configuration), encrypt it at rest.

## DEPLOYMENT

Possible Deployment Solutions:

1.  **Traditional Installers (DMG, EXE, DEB/RPM):**  Hyper is packaged into platform-specific installers.  This is the most common approach for desktop applications.
2.  **Package Managers (Homebrew, Chocolatey, apt/yum):**  Hyper is distributed through package managers, making installation and updates easier.
3.  **App Stores (Mac App Store, Microsoft Store):**  Hyper is distributed through app stores, providing a centralized and trusted distribution channel.

Chosen Solution (Detailed Description): Traditional Installers (DMG, EXE, DEB/RPM)

Hyper is likely distributed primarily through traditional installers for each supported operating system.  These installers are likely built using tools like `electron-builder`, which can generate installers for multiple platforms from a single codebase.

## BUILD

The build process for Hyper likely involves the following steps:

1.  **Code Checkout:**  The source code is checked out from the GitHub repository.
2.  **Dependency Installation:**  Dependencies are installed using `npm` or `yarn`.
3.  **Linting:**  Code is linted using tools like ESLint to enforce code style and identify potential errors.
4.  **Testing:**  Unit tests and integration tests are run.
5.  **Building:**  The Electron application is built using `electron-builder`. This process compiles the code, packages it with the Electron runtime, and creates platform-specific installers.
6.  **Code Signing:** The built installers are code-signed to ensure their authenticity and integrity.
7.  **Publishing:** The installers are published to a distribution channel (e.g., GitHub Releases, a website, or an update server).

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:

*   Providing a functional and reliable terminal emulator.
*   Maintaining a secure application to protect user data and systems.
*   Supporting and growing the user and developer community.

Data to Protect:

*   User's file system (High sensitivity): Hyper has access to the user's file system, making it a high-value target for attackers.
*   User's shell environment (High sensitivity): Hyper executes commands within the user's shell environment, which could contain sensitive information (e.g., environment variables, command history).
*   Plugin data (Variable sensitivity): Plugins may store data locally or communicate with external services, and the sensitivity of this data depends on the specific plugin.
*   Configuration data (Medium sensitivity): Hyper's configuration files may contain user preferences and potentially sensitive information (e.g., custom themes, keybindings).

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

Questions:

*   What specific Electron security best practices are currently implemented? (e.g., Node integration, context isolation, CSP)
*   Is there a formal process for reviewing and approving third-party plugins?
*   What is the update mechanism for Hyper and its plugins?
*   Are there any plans to integrate with other Vercel services?
*   What are the specific security requirements for any potential cloud-based features (e.g., configuration syncing)?
*   Does Hyper use any native Node.js modules that might introduce additional security risks?
*   What kind of testing (unit, integration, end-to-end) is performed?
