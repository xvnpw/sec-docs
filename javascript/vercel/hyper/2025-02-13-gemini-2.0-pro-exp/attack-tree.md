## Attack Tree Path: [1. Remote Code Execution (RCE)](./attack_tree_paths/1__remote_code_execution__rce_.md)

*   **1.1 Buffer Overflow [HR] [CN]**
    *   *Description:* A vulnerability where `hyper` (or a dependency) writes data beyond the allocated buffer size. This can overwrite adjacent memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.  Most likely to occur within `unsafe` Rust code or in C libraries used by dependencies.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low (Due to Rust's memory safety)
    *   *Impact:* Very High (Full system compromise)
    *   *Effort:* High
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced/Expert
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium/Hard
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   Thoroughly audit all `unsafe` code blocks.
        *   Regularly audit dependencies using `cargo audit`.
        *   Implement comprehensive fuzzing.
        *   Use memory sanitizers (ASan) during testing.

*   **1.2 HTTP/2 Parsing Vulnerabilities [HR] [CN]**
    *   *Description:* Errors in `hyper`'s implementation of the complex HTTP/2 protocol, particularly in handling frames, streams, or HPACK compression.  These errors could lead to unexpected states or memory corruption, potentially enabling RCE.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low/Medium
    *   *Impact:* Very High
    *   *Effort:* High
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced/Expert
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium/Hard
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   Comprehensive HTTP/2 compliance testing.
        *   Specific fuzzing of HTTP/2 parsing components.
        *   State machine analysis of the HTTP/2 implementation.

*   **1.3 Use-After-Free [HR] [CN]**
    *   *Description:* A vulnerability where `hyper` attempts to use memory that has already been freed.  While Rust's ownership system aims to prevent this, it can still occur in `unsafe` code or due to complex concurrency issues.
    *   *Likelihood:* Low
    *   *Impact:* Very High
    *   *Effort:* High
    *   *Skill Level:* Advanced/Expert
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium/Hard
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   `unsafe` code review, focusing on memory management.
        *   Concurrency testing under heavy load.
        *   Dynamic analysis tools (e.g., Valgrind).

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Denial of Service (DoS)](./attack_tree_paths/2__denial_of_service__dos_.md)

*   **2.1 Header Flooding [HR] [CN]**
    *   *Description:* An attacker sends requests with an excessive number of headers, or headers with extremely large values, to consume server resources.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium/High
    *   *Impact:* Medium/High
    *   *Effort:* Low
    *   *Skill Level:* Novice/Intermediate
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy/Medium
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   Configure limits on header count and size.
        *   Monitor server resource usage.

*   **2.3 Resource Exhaustion (General) [HR]**
    *   *Description:* A broad category encompassing various techniques to consume server resources (CPU, memory, file descriptors), making the service unavailable to legitimate users.  Examples include slowloris attacks, sending large request bodies, or exploiting inefficiencies in `hyper`.
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium/High
    *   *Impact:* Medium/High
    *   *Effort:* Low/Medium
    *   *Skill Level:* Novice/Intermediate
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Easy/Medium
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   Performance profiling to identify bottlenecks.
        *   Implement rate limiting.
        *   Configure appropriate timeouts.

*   **2.4 HTTP/2 Specific Attacks [HR] [CN]**
    *   *Description:* Exploiting vulnerabilities specific to the HTTP/2 protocol, such as stream multiplexing abuse (creating too many streams) or HPACK bombing (sending compressed headers that expand to a huge size).
    *   *Likelihood:* Medium
    *   *Impact:* Medium/High
    *   *Effort:* Medium/High
    *   *Skill Level:* Intermediate/Advanced
    *   *Detection Difficulty:* Medium
    *   *Mitigation Strategies:*
        *   Configure limits on concurrent streams.
        *   Implement HPACK bomb protection.
        *   Stay updated on HTTP/2 security research.
