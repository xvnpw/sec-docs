# Attack Surface Analysis for vercel/hyper

## Attack Surface: [Malicious/Compromised Plugins](./attack_surfaces/maliciouscompromised_plugins.md)

*   **Description:** Plugins in Hyper are Node.js modules with extensive access to system resources. A malicious or compromised plugin can execute arbitrary code.
*   **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper's plugin architecture provides a direct mechanism for loading and executing external code within the terminal's context. This is a *core feature* of Hyper.
*   **Example:** A plugin advertised as a "productivity enhancer" could actually contain code to steal SSH keys, install a backdoor, or exfiltrate sensitive data. A legitimate plugin could be compromised through a supply chain attack.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, installation of malware, remote control of the user's machine.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Implement a rigorous plugin vetting process before listing plugins in any official repository.
        *   Consider a plugin signing mechanism to verify plugin authenticity.
        *   Explore sandboxing techniques for plugins (e.g., running them in separate processes with limited privileges). This is a challenging area, but research should be ongoing.
        *   Implement a plugin permission system, requiring plugins to request specific capabilities (file system access, network access, etc.).
        *   Regularly audit the code of popular and critical plugins.
        *   Encourage plugin developers to follow secure coding practices and keep their dependencies updated.
        *   Provide clear documentation and warnings to users about the risks of installing untrusted plugins.
    *   **User:**
        *   *Only install plugins from trusted sources.* Prefer plugins from a curated repository (if available) or from well-known, reputable developers.
        *   Carefully review the source code of plugins before installing them (if you are able).
        *   Keep plugins updated to the latest versions.
        *   Be wary of plugins that request excessive permissions or access to sensitive resources.
        *   Remove any plugins you no longer use.

## Attack Surface: [Node.js Integration Vulnerabilities (Exploitation via `hyper.js` or IPC)](./attack_surfaces/node_js_integration_vulnerabilities__exploitation_via__hyper_js__or_ipc_.md)

*   **Description:** Vulnerabilities in Node.js itself, or in Hyper's *use* of Node.js APIs, can be exploited to gain arbitrary code execution. This can occur through a compromised `hyper.js` file or through malicious IPC messages.  This is distinct from general Node.js vulnerabilities; it focuses on how Hyper *uses* Node.js.
*   **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper's reliance on Node.js for core functionality and plugin execution creates a large attack surface. The `hyper.js` file is executed as JavaScript, and IPC is used for communication between the renderer and main processes. *Hyper's design choices* regarding Node.js integration and IPC are the key factors.
*   **Example:** An attacker could trick a user into replacing their `hyper.js` file with a malicious one. A flaw in Hyper's IPC message handling could allow a compromised renderer process (perhaps due to a less severe vulnerability) to escalate privileges to the main process and execute arbitrary Node.js code.
*   **Impact:** Complete system compromise, data theft, installation of malware, remote control.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developer:**
        *   Ensure `contextIsolation` is enabled and rigorously tested. This is a *Hyper configuration* choice.
        *   Ensure `nodeIntegration` is *disabled* in the renderer process. This is a *Hyper configuration* choice.
        *   Ensure `sandbox` is enabled. This is a *Hyper configuration* choice.
        *   Use `contextBridge` to expose *only* the necessary APIs to the renderer process. This is a *Hyper architectural* choice.
        *   Implement strict input validation for *all* IPC messages, using a well-defined schema. This is a *Hyper implementation* detail.
        *   Regularly update Electron and all Node.js dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities. While updating dependencies is good practice, the *way* Hyper uses these dependencies is the key attack surface.
        *   Implement integrity checks for the `hyper.js` file (e.g., checksumming). This is a *Hyper-specific* mitigation.
        *   Avoid passing complex objects or executable code through IPC. This is a *Hyper architectural* choice.
    *   **User:**
        *   Protect your `hyper.js` file. Ensure it has appropriate file permissions (read-only for most users).
        *   Be cautious about modifying `hyper.js` with code from untrusted sources.
        *   Keep Hyper updated to the latest version (which should include the developer mitigations).
