*   **Description:**
    1.  **Hyper Development Team:** When configuring Electron's `BrowserWindow` for Hyper's renderer processes, explicitly set `nodeIntegration: false`.
    2.  **Hyper Development Team:**  If Node.js functionality is required in Hyper's renderer, use Electron's `contextBridge` API within the Hyper codebase.

    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) related attacks in Hyper (Medium Severity):** While traditional XSS is less direct in a terminal, reducing Node.js access in Hyper's renderer limits the potential damage if XSS-like vulnerabilities were to be exploited in Hyper's rendering context.
*   **Impact:** Significantly reduces the attack surface of Hyper's renderer process and limits the potential damage from renderer-side vulnerabilities in Hyper.
*   **Currently Implemented:** Likely partially implemented in `vercel/hyper`. Modern Electron applications are generally encouraged to disable `nodeIntegration`. The extent of `contextBridge` usage and API minimization in Hyper needs code review.
