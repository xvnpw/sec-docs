# Threat Model Analysis for vercel/hyper

## Threat: [HTTP/2 Rapid Reset Attack](./threats/http2_rapid_reset_attack.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits the HTTP/2 protocol by sending a flood of `RST_STREAM` frames to the Hyper server. This forces Hyper to rapidly reset streams, consuming significant server resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth) in the process of stream management and teardown. The attacker's goal is to overwhelm Hyper, leading to a denial of service and preventing legitimate users from accessing the application. The attack leverages the nature of HTTP/2 multiplexing to amplify the impact from a single connection.
**Impact:** Critical Denial of Service (DoS), complete service outage, server resource exhaustion, significant performance degradation making the application unusable.
**Affected Hyper Component:** HTTP/2 Connection Handling, Stream Management module.
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement aggressive rate limiting on incoming connections and requests to identify and block malicious sources.
*   Employ robust monitoring for unusual patterns of `RST_STREAM` frames and connection resets, triggering alerts upon detection.
*   Configure strict connection limits and timeouts within Hyper or the application to prevent resource exhaustion from excessive connections.
*   Utilize a Web Application Firewall (WAF) or dedicated DDoS mitigation service capable of identifying and filtering HTTP/2 rapid reset attacks.

## Threat: [Bugs and Vulnerabilities in Hyper's Codebase (Zero-Day or Unpatched Known Vulnerabilities)](./threats/bugs_and_vulnerabilities_in_hyper's_codebase__zero-day_or_unpatched_known_vulnerabilities_.md)

**Description:** Hyper's codebase, like any complex software, may contain undiscovered security vulnerabilities (zero-day) or known vulnerabilities that have not yet been patched in the deployed version. An attacker who discovers such a vulnerability could exploit it by sending specially crafted HTTP/2 requests or manipulating connection state to trigger the vulnerability within Hyper. Successful exploitation could lead to severe consequences, including remote code execution on the server, significant data breaches, or complete server compromise.
**Impact:** Critical Remote Code Execution (RCE), complete server compromise, significant data breach and information disclosure, privilege escalation, Denial of Service (DoS), application instability.
**Affected Hyper Component:** Any module within Hyper's codebase depending on the specific vulnerability (e.g., HTTP/2 parsing, request handling, stream processing, memory management).
**Risk Severity:** Critical
**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   **Proactive:**  Vigilantly monitor Hyper's release notes, security advisories, and GitHub repository for vulnerability disclosures and security patches. Subscribe to security mailing lists or notification channels related to Hyper.
*   **Reactive:**  Immediately apply security patches and updates released by the Hyper maintainers as soon as they become available. Implement a rapid patching process for critical security updates.
*   **Defensive:** Implement robust input validation and sanitization in the application code that uses Hyper to minimize the potential impact of vulnerabilities within Hyper itself.
*   **Advanced:** (For high-security environments) Consider performing regular security audits and penetration testing of applications using Hyper, and potentially include static and dynamic code analysis of Hyper itself to proactively identify potential vulnerabilities (if feasible and within your security practices).
