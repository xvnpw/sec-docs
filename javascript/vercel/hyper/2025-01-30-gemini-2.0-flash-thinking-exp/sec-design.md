# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Hyper project is a terminal application built with web technologies (HTML, JavaScript, CSS). It aims to provide a beautiful and extensible terminal experience for developers and users who prefer a modern, customizable interface over traditional terminal emulators.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a visually appealing and user-friendly terminal application.
- Offer extensibility through plugins to enhance functionality and customization.
- Ensure cross-platform compatibility (macOS, Windows, Linux).
- Maintain good performance and responsiveness for a smooth user experience.
- Foster an open-source community around the project.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities in the terminal application could lead to command injection or privilege escalation, compromising user systems.
- Data breaches could occur if sensitive information is exposed or logged by the terminal or its plugins.
- Availability issues or instability could disrupt user workflows and damage reputation.
- Supply chain attacks targeting dependencies or the build process could introduce malicious code.
- Lack of user trust due to security concerns could hinder adoption.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Code review process is likely in place as it is an open-source project on GitHub, although the extent and rigor are unknown. (Location: GitHub repository - pull request reviews)
- security control: Dependency management using `package.json` and `yarn.lock` helps track and manage project dependencies. (Location: GitHub repository - `package.json`, `yarn.lock`)
- security control: Regular updates of dependencies are likely to address known vulnerabilities in libraries. (Assumption based on common practice in JavaScript projects)
- accepted risk: Reliance on Node.js and its ecosystem, which has a history of security vulnerabilities.
- accepted risk: Plugin system introduces potential security risks if plugins are not vetted or sandboxed properly.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning (SAST/DAST) in the CI/CD pipeline to detect vulnerabilities in code and dependencies.
- security control: Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities and update them promptly.
- security control: Implement a robust plugin security model with sandboxing or permission controls to limit plugin access to system resources.
- security control: Perform penetration testing and security audits to identify and address potential vulnerabilities.
- security control: Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent command injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities, especially in plugin APIs and terminal rendering.
- security control: Secure update mechanism to ensure that updates are authentic and not tampered with.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to the core terminal application itself, but might be relevant for plugin authentication or integration with external services.
- Authorization: Plugin system should implement authorization to control what resources and APIs plugins can access. User permissions within the operating system will govern command execution.
- Input Validation: All user inputs, especially commands and plugin inputs, must be validated to prevent command injection and other injection attacks.
- Cryptography:  Consider using cryptography for secure storage of configuration data or secrets, and for secure communication if the terminal interacts with remote services or plugins. Securely handle any credentials if stored or passed through the application.
