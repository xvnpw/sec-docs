# Attack Surface Analysis for vercel/hyper

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Hyper Plugins](./attack_surfaces/malicious_hyper_plugins.md)

**Description:**  Third-party extensions that can add functionality to Hyper but may contain malicious code or vulnerabilities.
- **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper's plugin architecture allows for arbitrary code execution within the Hyper process, granting plugins significant access to the system.
- **Example:** A user installs a seemingly harmless plugin that, in the background, exfiltrates SSH keys or executes commands to install malware.
- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine.
    - Data exfiltration of sensitive information.
    - Installation of malware or other malicious software.
    - Denial of Service (DoS) by a poorly written or malicious plugin.
- **Risk Severity:** Critical.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**
        - Implement a robust plugin security model with clear permission boundaries.
        - Consider code signing or verification mechanisms for plugins.
        - Provide clear warnings to users about the risks of installing untrusted plugins.
    - **Users:**
        - Only install plugins from trusted sources and developers.
        - Carefully review plugin permissions and functionality before installation.
        - Regularly review and remove unused or suspicious plugins.
        - Be aware of the potential risks associated with installing third-party extensions.

## Attack Surface: [Malicious Configuration Manipulation](./attack_surfaces/malicious_configuration_manipulation.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting Hyper's configuration file (`.hyper.js`) to execute arbitrary commands or modify its behavior for malicious purposes.
- **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper's configuration file is a JavaScript file, allowing for the execution of arbitrary code when Hyper starts.
- **Example:** An attacker gains access to the user's file system and modifies `.hyper.js` to execute a command that downloads and runs malware upon Hyper's next launch.
- **Impact:**
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the user's machine upon Hyper startup.
    - Modification of terminal behavior to facilitate further attacks.
    - Data exfiltration by configuring Hyper to send output to a remote server.
- **Risk Severity:** High.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**
        - Avoid executing arbitrary code directly from the configuration file if possible.
        - Implement security checks and sanitization for configuration options.
        - Provide mechanisms for users to secure their configuration file permissions.
    - **Users:**
        - Protect the permissions of the `.hyper.js` file to prevent unauthorized modification.
        - Be cautious about running Hyper in environments where the configuration file might be compromised.
        - Regularly review the contents of the `.hyper.js` file for any unexpected or suspicious entries.

## Attack Surface: [Inter-Process Communication (IPC) Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/inter-process_communication__ipc__vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting weaknesses in how Hyper's different processes (main and renderer) communicate with each other.
- **How Hyper Contributes:** Hyper uses IPC mechanisms provided by Electron. Vulnerabilities in how these messages are handled or validated could be exploited.
- **Example:** A malicious plugin or a compromised renderer process sends a crafted IPC message to the main process, tricking it into performing an action with elevated privileges, such as executing a system command.
- **Impact:**
    - Privilege escalation, allowing an attacker to perform actions they wouldn't normally be authorized for.
    - Remote Code Execution (RCE) if IPC can be used to trigger code execution in a privileged process.
- **Risk Severity:** High to Critical.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**
        - Implement secure IPC communication patterns with proper validation and authorization checks for messages.
        - Minimize the attack surface exposed through IPC by limiting the functionality accessible via IPC messages.
        - Follow Electron's best practices for secure IPC.

## Attack Surface: [Local File System Access Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/local_file_system_access_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:**  Exploiting Hyper's ability to access the local file system for malicious purposes.
- **How Hyper Contributes:**  Hyper, like many desktop applications, needs access to the file system for configuration, plugins, and potentially other features. If this access is not properly controlled, it can be abused.
- **Example:** A vulnerability in Hyper allows a remote server connected to the terminal to write arbitrary files to the user's system, potentially overwriting critical system files or installing malware.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary file read or write access.
    - Data exfiltration by reading sensitive files.
    - System compromise by writing malicious files.
- **Risk Severity:** High.
- **Mitigation Strategies:**
    - **Developers:**
        - Minimize the need for file system access and restrict access to only necessary locations.
        - Implement strict validation and sanitization for any file paths or filenames handled by Hyper.
        - Avoid granting excessive file system permissions to the Hyper process.
    - **Users:**
        - Be cautious about running Hyper in untrusted environments or with untrusted connections.
