## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Application Using Hyper](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_application_using_hyper.md)

**Attack Vector:** This represents the ultimate goal of the attacker. Any successful path through the attack tree leads to this node.
**Impact:**  Complete compromise of the application, potentially leading to data breaches, loss of service, reputational damage, and financial losses.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Hyper Core Functionality](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_hyper_core_functionality.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application using Hyper takes user input and directly passes it to Hyper commands without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker can inject malicious commands.
**Example:** An application allows users to specify a command to run in the terminal. An attacker inputs `ls & rm -rf /`, potentially deleting critical system files.
**Impact:**  Successful command injection can lead to arbitrary code execution within the Hyper process, allowing the attacker to read files, modify data, execute system commands, and potentially compromise the entire system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Command Injection via Malicious Input](./attack_tree_paths/command_injection_via_malicious_input.md)

**Attack Vector:** If the application using Hyper takes user input and directly passes it to Hyper commands without proper sanitization or validation, an attacker can inject malicious commands.
**Example:** An application allows users to specify a command to run in the terminal. An attacker inputs `ls & rm -rf /`, potentially deleting critical system files.
**Impact:**  Successful command injection can lead to arbitrary code execution within the Hyper process, allowing the attacker to read files, modify data, execute system commands, and potentially compromise the entire system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Code Execution within Hyper's Context](./attack_tree_paths/gain_code_execution_within_hyper's_context.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the result of successful command injection. The attacker's injected commands are executed within the security context of the Hyper process.
**Impact:**  Once code execution is achieved, the attacker can perform a wide range of malicious activities, including accessing application resources, exfiltrating data, installing malware, and establishing persistence.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Electron Framework Vulnerabilities (Hyper's Foundation)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_electron_framework_vulnerabilities__hyper's_foundation_.md)

**Attack Vector:** Hyper is built on the Electron framework. Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Electron used by Hyper. These vulnerabilities can range from remote code execution (RCE) to sandbox escapes.
**Example:** A known vulnerability in the Chromium engine (used by Electron) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting a specific web page or by exploiting a flaw in how Hyper handles certain resources.
**Impact:** Successful exploitation of Electron vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution on the user's machine, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the system and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Electron Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_electron_vulnerabilities.md)

**Attack Vector:** Hyper is built on the Electron framework. Attackers can exploit publicly known vulnerabilities in the specific version of Electron used by Hyper. These vulnerabilities can range from remote code execution (RCE) to sandbox escapes.
**Example:** A known vulnerability in the Chromium engine (used by Electron) allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code by crafting a specific web page or by exploiting a flaw in how Hyper handles certain resources.
**Impact:** Successful exploitation of Electron vulnerabilities can lead to remote code execution on the user's machine, allowing the attacker to gain complete control over the system and the application.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Code Execution within the Electron Context](./attack_tree_paths/gain_code_execution_within_the_electron_context.md)

**Attack Vector:** This is the result of successfully exploiting a known Electron vulnerability. The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary code within the Electron main or renderer process.
**Impact:**  Code execution within the Electron context provides a powerful foothold for the attacker. They can interact with the operating system, access files, manipulate application data, and potentially escalate privileges.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Code Execution or Modify Hyper Behavior](./attack_tree_paths/gain_code_execution_or_modify_hyper_behavior.md)

**Attack Vector:** If an attacker can gain write access to the user's `~/.hyper.js` configuration file, they can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed when Hyper starts.
**Example:** An attacker injects code into `~/.hyper.js` that downloads and executes a keylogger upon Hyper's launch.
**Impact:**  Successful injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code within Hyper's context or modify its behavior to facilitate further attacks or data theft.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Code Execution within Hyper's Context](./attack_tree_paths/gain_code_execution_within_hyper's_context.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker compromises a dependency used by Hyper, injecting malicious code into the dependency. When Hyper uses this compromised dependency, the malicious code is executed.
**Example:** A popular npm package used by Hyper is compromised, and the attacker injects code that exfiltrates user credentials when Hyper is launched.
**Impact:**  Leads to arbitrary code execution within Hyper's context, potentially compromising the application and the user's system.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Code Execution or Access Sensitive Data](./attack_tree_paths/gain_code_execution_or_access_sensitive_data.md)

**Attack Vector:**  Third-party Hyper extensions may contain vulnerabilities. Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to execute code within the extension's context or access sensitive data handled by the extension.
**Example:** A vulnerable extension that handles API keys could be exploited to steal those keys.
**Impact:**  Allows the attacker to execute malicious code within the extension's scope or gain access to sensitive information managed by the extension.

## Attack Tree Path: [Gain Full Control Over Hyper Instance](./attack_tree_paths/gain_full_control_over_hyper_instance.md)

**Attack Vector:** An attacker tricks the user into installing a malicious Hyper extension. This could be through social engineering or by exploiting vulnerabilities in the extension installation process.
**Example:** An attacker creates a fake "productivity" extension that, once installed, logs user keystrokes.
**Impact:**  A malicious extension can have full access to Hyper's functionalities and potentially the underlying system, allowing for a wide range of malicious activities.
