# Threat Model Analysis for vercel/hyper

## Threat: [Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Electron Vulnerabilities](./threats/remote_code_execution__rce__via_electron_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Remote Code Execution (RCE) via Electron Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known or zero-day vulnerability within the Electron framework, Chromium, or Node.js *that Hyper relies upon*. This could involve crafting malicious terminal input, exploiting vulnerabilities in how Hyper handles certain protocols, or leveraging flaws in the rendering engine *within the Hyper context*. The attacker might gain the ability to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine with the privileges of the Hyper process.
    *   **Impact:** Full compromise of the user's system, including the ability to steal data, install malware, or pivot to other systems on the network.
    *   **Affected Component:** Electron runtime, Chromium rendering engine, Node.js runtime.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep Hyper updated to the latest version, as updates often include patches for underlying Electron vulnerabilities.
        *   Monitor security advisories for Electron, Chromium, and Node.js and assess their potential impact on the application using Hyper.
        *   Implement strong input validation and sanitization for any data that is displayed or processed within the Hyper terminal.

## Threat: [Node.js Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/node_js_dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Node.js Dependency Vulnerabilities
    *   **Description:** Hyper utilizes numerous Node.js dependencies. An attacker could exploit known vulnerabilities in these dependencies to compromise the application or the user's system. This might involve triggering specific code paths within a vulnerable dependency *used by Hyper* through crafted input or by exploiting a known flaw in how the dependency handles data *within the Hyper process*.
    *   **Impact:** Depending on the vulnerability, this could lead to remote code execution, denial of service, or information disclosure.
    *   **Affected Component:** Node.js module dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly audit Hyper's dependencies using tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit`.
        *   Keep dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.
        *   Consider using Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tools to identify and manage dependency vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Malicious Hyper Plugins](./threats/malicious_hyper_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Malicious Hyper Plugins
    *   **Description:** Hyper's plugin architecture allows for extending its functionality. An attacker could create and distribute a malicious plugin *specifically for Hyper* designed to steal data, execute arbitrary commands, or compromise the user's system when installed *into Hyper*. Users might be tricked into installing such plugins through social engineering or by disguising them as legitimate extensions *for Hyper*.
    *   **Impact:** Data theft, system compromise, installation of malware, unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hyper's plugin system, plugin code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Educate users about the risks of installing untrusted plugins *for Hyper*.
        *   If possible, implement a mechanism to verify the integrity and source of plugins (though this is not a standard Hyper feature).
        *   Encourage users to only install plugins from trusted sources.

## Threat: [Vulnerable Hyper Plugins](./threats/vulnerable_hyper_plugins.md)

*   **Threat:** Vulnerable Hyper Plugins
    *   **Description:** Even well-intentioned Hyper plugins can contain security vulnerabilities. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to compromise the application or the user's system. This could involve exploiting flaws in the plugin's code, its dependencies, or how it interacts with Hyper's core functionality.
    *   **Impact:** Similar to malicious plugins, ranging from data theft to system compromise.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific plugin code.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Encourage users to keep their installed plugins updated to the latest versions, as updates often contain security fixes.
        *   Potentially provide guidance or recommendations on selecting reputable and well-maintained plugins.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Hyper's Configuration](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_hyper's_configuration.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Hyper's Configuration
    *   **Description:** Hyper's configuration files might contain sensitive information, such as API keys, access tokens, or other credentials. If an attacker gains access to these configuration files (e.g., through a separate vulnerability on the user's system), they could extract this sensitive data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to external services or systems, potential for further attacks using the compromised credentials.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hyper's configuration files.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid storing sensitive information directly in Hyper's configuration files.
        *   If sensitive data must be stored, use secure storage mechanisms and encryption.
        *   Ensure proper file system permissions are in place to restrict access to Hyper's configuration files.

## Threat: [Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Hyper Updates](./threats/man-in-the-middle__mitm__attacks_on_hyper_updates.md)

*   **Threat:** Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks on Hyper Updates
    *   **Description:** If Hyper's update mechanism is not properly secured, an attacker could potentially intercept the update process and inject a malicious update. This compromised version of Hyper could then be installed on the user's system, leading to a full compromise.
    *   **Impact:** Installation of malware, system compromise, data theft.
    *   **Affected Component:** Hyper's update mechanism.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Rely on Hyper's built-in update mechanism and ensure it uses secure protocols (HTTPS) for downloading updates.
        *   Verify the integrity of updates using digital signatures if possible.
