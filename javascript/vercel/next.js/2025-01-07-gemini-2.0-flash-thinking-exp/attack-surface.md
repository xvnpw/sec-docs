# Attack Surface Analysis for vercel/next.js

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `getServerSideProps`](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via__getserversideprops_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can induce the server to make requests to unintended internal or external resources.

**How Next.js Contributes:** The `getServerSideProps` function executes on the server, allowing developers to fetch data from external sources. If the URLs for these fetches are derived from user input without proper validation, it creates an SSRF vulnerability.

**Example:** A page that displays data from a user-provided URL fetched using `getServerSideProps`. An attacker could provide a URL pointing to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:3000/admin`) or an arbitrary external site.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential data breaches, launching attacks from the server's IP address.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Validate and sanitize user-provided URLs used in `fetch` or other request libraries within `getServerSideProps`.
- Use allow-lists for permitted domains or protocols.
- Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs.
- Consider using a dedicated service or library for making external requests with built-in SSRF protections.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Server-Side Rendering (SSR)](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_server-side_rendering__ssr_.md)

**Description:** Sensitive information intended for the server-side might be inadvertently rendered and sent to the client.

**How Next.js Contributes:** `getServerSideProps` fetches data on the server, and this data is then used to render the initial HTML sent to the client. If sensitive data is included in this data without careful consideration, it becomes accessible in the client-side HTML source.

**Example:**  Fetching user roles or API keys within `getServerSideProps` and passing them directly to a component's props, which then renders them (even if not visibly displayed). This data would be present in the initial HTML source.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential compromise of credentials or sensitive business logic.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Carefully review the data being passed from `getServerSideProps` to components.
- Avoid passing sensitive information directly as props.
- If sensitive data is needed on the client-side, fetch it separately using client-side requests after authentication.
- Utilize environment variables and avoid hardcoding secrets in the codebase.

## Attack Surface: [Insecure API Routes (`pages/api`)](./attack_surfaces/insecure_api_routes___pagesapi__.md)

**Description:** API endpoints within the `pages/api` directory can be vulnerable to various web application attacks if not properly secured.

**How Next.js Contributes:** Next.js simplifies the creation of backend API endpoints using the `pages/api` directory. This ease of use can lead to vulnerabilities if developers don't implement proper security measures.

**Example:** An API route that accepts user input and directly uses it in a database query without sanitization, leading to SQL injection. Or an API route that doesn't implement authentication, allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, manipulation of data, server compromise.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Implement robust authentication and authorization for all API routes.
- Validate and sanitize all user input received by API routes to prevent injection attacks (SQL injection, command injection, etc.).
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- Use secure coding practices and follow security guidelines for API development.

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to Improper Rendering](./attack_surfaces/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__due_to_improper_rendering.md)

**Description:**  Malicious scripts can be injected into the client-side application and executed in users' browsers.

**How Next.js Contributes:** While Next.js itself doesn't directly introduce XSS vulnerabilities, improper handling of user-provided data within React components can lead to XSS. If data fetched from APIs or provided by users is rendered without proper escaping, it can execute malicious scripts.

**Example:** Displaying user-generated content without proper sanitization. If a user submits a comment containing a `<script>` tag, this script could be executed when other users view the comment.

**Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, defacement.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Sanitize and escape user-provided data before rendering it in components.
- Utilize React's built-in mechanisms for preventing XSS, such as using JSX correctly and avoiding `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.
- Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.
