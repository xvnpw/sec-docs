## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities__high-risk_path_.md)

**SSR Data Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Vulnerable Data Fetching in `getServerSideProps` [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Threat:** Attacker injects malicious data through query parameters or headers that is then used in server-side data fetching, leading to backend vulnerabilities.
        * **Actionable Insight:**
            * Always sanitize and validate user inputs used in `getServerSideProps`.
            * Use parameterized queries or prepared statements for database interactions.
            * Avoid directly concatenating user input into queries.
    * **Unsafe Deserialization of Server-Side Data [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Threat:** Attacker manipulates serialized data fetched in `getServerSideProps`, potentially leading to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
        * **Actionable Insight:**
            * Avoid deserializing untrusted data.
            * If necessary, use secure deserialization libraries.
            * Carefully validate the structure and type of deserialized data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit API Routes [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_api_routes__high-risk_path_.md)

**API Route Injection [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Command Injection via Unsanitized Input [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Threat:** Attacker injects malicious commands through API route parameters that are then executed on the server.
        * **Actionable Insight:**
            * Avoid executing system commands based on user input.
            * If necessary, use secure libraries and strictly validate and sanitize input.
            * Implement the principle of least privilege for the application's user.
    * **Code Injection via `eval()` or similar [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Threat:** Attacker injects malicious code through API route parameters that is then executed on the server using functions like `eval()` or `Function()`.
        * **Actionable Insight:**
            * Never use `eval()` or similar functions with user-provided data.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Next.js Specific Features/Configurations [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_next_js_specific_featuresconfigurations__high-risk_path_.md)

**Misconfigured `next.config.js` [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Exposing Sensitive Information via Environment Variables [CRITICAL NODE]:**
        * **Threat:** Sensitive information like API keys or database credentials are exposed in client-side bundles due to incorrect configuration of environment variables.
        * **Actionable Insight:**
            * Avoid exposing sensitive information in client-side bundles.
            * Use server-side environment variables and access them through API routes or `getServerSideProps`.
            * Utilize `.env.local` for development and proper environment variable management in production.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Build Process/Deployment Issues [HIGH-RISK PATH]](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_build_processdeployment_issues__high-risk_path_.md)

**Compromise Development Dependencies [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Threat:** Attackers introduce malicious code by exploiting vulnerabilities in the application's dependencies.
    * **Actionable Insight:**
        * Regularly audit and update dependencies.
        * Use tools like `npm audit` or `yarn audit` to identify and address vulnerabilities.
        * Consider using a dependency management tool with security scanning.
**Inject Malicious Code During Build Process [CRITICAL NODE]:**
    * **Threat:** Attackers compromise the build process and inject malicious code into the application's bundles.
    * **Actionable Insight:**
        * Secure the build environment and restrict access to build scripts and configuration files.
        * Implement integrity checks for build artifacts.
        * Use a secure CI/CD pipeline.
