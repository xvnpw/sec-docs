# Threat Model Analysis for vercel/next.js

## Threat: [Server-Side Cross-Site Scripting (SS-XSS) via Unsanitized Data in SSR/SSG](./threats/server-side_cross-site_scripting__ss-xss__via_unsanitized_data_in_ssrssg.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious scripts into data that is rendered on the server-side during Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG). This script then executes on the server, potentially allowing the attacker to read server-side environment variables, access internal resources, or even execute arbitrary code on the server. The attacker might achieve this by submitting crafted input through forms, URL parameters, or manipulating data sources used during rendering.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive server-side data (API keys, database credentials), potential for complete server takeover and data breaches, modification of content served to other users.

**Affected Next.js Component:** Server Components during SSR, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, React components rendered server-side.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict output encoding and escaping of all dynamic data rendered on the server-side.
* Sanitize user-provided input before using it in server-side rendering logic.
* Utilize templating engines or libraries that provide automatic escaping by default.
* Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the sources from which the browser can load resources.

## Threat: [Exposure of Server-Side Only Code or Secrets via SSR/SSG](./threats/exposure_of_server-side_only_code_or_secrets_via_ssrssg.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to the generated HTML source code of a page rendered using SSR or SSG and finds sensitive information or server-side logic inadvertently included within the client-side bundle. This might happen if developers directly embed API keys, database credentials, or internal implementation details within React components intended for server-side rendering.

**Impact:** Leakage of sensitive credentials allowing attackers to access backend systems, databases, or third-party services. Exposure of internal logic can aid in further attacks.

**Affected Next.js Component:** Server Components during SSR, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, React components rendered server-side, potentially environment variable handling if not used correctly.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Strictly separate server-side logic and secrets from client-side components.
* Utilize environment variables and Next.js's built-in mechanisms for accessing them securely on the server-side.
* Avoid directly embedding sensitive data in React components.
* Review generated HTML source code to ensure no sensitive information is exposed.

## Threat: [Denial of Service (DoS) through Resource Intensive SSR](./threats/denial_of_service__dos__through_resource_intensive_ssr.md)

**Description:** An attacker crafts malicious requests that force the server to perform computationally expensive operations during Server-Side Rendering (SSR). This could involve requesting pages that trigger complex data fetching, intensive calculations, or large data serialization, overwhelming the server's resources and making it unavailable to legitimate users.

**Impact:** Application downtime, inability for users to access the application, potential financial losses due to service disruption.

**Affected Next.js Component:** Server Components during SSR, `getServerSideProps`, API Routes called during SSR.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement caching mechanisms for frequently accessed pages or components.
* Optimize data fetching and processing logic within `getServerSideProps` and API routes.
* Implement rate limiting to prevent excessive requests from a single source.
* Monitor server resource usage and set up alerts for unusual activity.

## Threat: [Insecure API Endpoint Exposure and Lack of Authentication/Authorization](./threats/insecure_api_endpoint_exposure_and_lack_of_authenticationauthorization.md)

**Description:** An attacker directly accesses Next.js API routes that are intended for internal use or require authentication. If these routes lack proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, attackers can bypass intended access controls and potentially read, modify, or delete data, or perform unauthorized actions.

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized data manipulation, compromise of application functionality, potential for privilege escalation.

**Affected Next.js Component:** API Routes.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT, session-based authentication) for all API routes requiring protection.
* Implement authorization checks to ensure users only have access to the resources they are permitted to access.
* Use middleware to enforce authentication and authorization checks before processing API requests.

## Threat: [Input Validation Vulnerabilities in API Routes](./threats/input_validation_vulnerabilities_in_api_routes.md)

**Description:** An attacker sends malicious or unexpected data to Next.js API routes. If the API route does not properly validate the input data, it can lead to various vulnerabilities, including injection attacks (e.g., NoSQL injection if interacting with a database), business logic flaws, or unexpected application behavior.

**Impact:** Data breaches, data corruption, application crashes, potential for remote code execution depending on the vulnerability.

**Affected Next.js Component:** API Routes.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Implement strict input validation for all data received by API routes.
* Use schema validation libraries (e.g., Zod, Yup) to define and enforce data structures.
* Sanitize and escape user input appropriately before using it in database queries or other sensitive operations.

## Threat: [Security Bypass via Middleware Misconfiguration or Vulnerabilities](./threats/security_bypass_via_middleware_misconfiguration_or_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** An attacker exploits misconfigurations or vulnerabilities within Next.js middleware functions to bypass security checks or access restricted resources. For example, a poorly written middleware might incorrectly identify a malicious user as authenticated or fail to properly sanitize request data.

**Impact:** Circumvention of security measures, unauthorized access to resources, potential for further exploitation of the application.

**Affected Next.js Component:** Middleware.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Thoroughly test and review middleware logic to ensure it functions as intended and does not introduce vulnerabilities.
* Ensure the correct order of middleware execution to avoid bypassing security checks.
* Keep Next.js and its dependencies updated to patch known vulnerabilities in middleware functionality.

## Threat: [Accidental Exposure of Environment Variables](./threats/accidental_exposure_of_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** An attacker gains access to sensitive environment variables containing API keys, database credentials, or other secrets due to misconfiguration or insecure practices. This could happen if `.env` files are accidentally committed to version control or if the hosting environment is not properly configured.

**Impact:** Leakage of sensitive credentials allowing attackers to access backend systems, databases, or third-party services.

**Affected Next.js Component:** Environment variable handling.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
* Utilize Next.js's built-in mechanisms for managing environment variables securely.
* Avoid committing `.env` files to version control.
* Configure the hosting environment to properly manage and protect environment variables.
* Use secret management tools for sensitive credentials.
