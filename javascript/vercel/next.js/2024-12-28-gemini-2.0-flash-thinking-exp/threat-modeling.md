*   **Threat:** Rehydration Mismatch Leading to DOM Manipulation
    *   **Description:** An attacker might exploit inconsistencies between the server-rendered HTML and the client-side rendered output (rehydration mismatch). This could allow them to inject malicious HTML or JavaScript that executes with the privileges of the user's session, potentially leading to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other client-side vulnerabilities.
    *   **Impact:**  Client-side vulnerabilities like XSS, leading to session hijacking, data theft, or malicious actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Affected Next.js Component:**  The rehydration process, specifically the reconciliation between server-rendered HTML and the client-side React component tree.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Ensure consistent rendering logic between server and client.
        *   Thoroughly test the application for rehydration issues, especially with dynamic content.
        *   Utilize Next.js's built-in mechanisms for handling rehydration carefully and avoid anti-patterns.

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Data Fetching Functions
    *   **Description:** An attacker could manipulate the URLs or parameters used in `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps` to make the server send requests to internal or external resources that it shouldn't access. This could be used to scan internal networks, access internal services, or exfiltrate data.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to internal resources, potential data breaches, or abuse of external services.
    *   **Affected Next.js Component:**  `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` functions, specifically the `fetch` calls or other HTTP request mechanisms within these functions.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize and validate any user-provided input used in data fetching URLs.
        *   Implement allow-lists for allowed external domains or resources.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs.
        *   Consider using a dedicated service or proxy for external data fetching.

*   **Threat:** Exploiting Vulnerabilities in Image Processing Libraries
    *   **Description:** An attacker could craft malicious images designed to exploit known vulnerabilities in the underlying image processing libraries used by Next.js (e.g., sharp). This could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
    *   **Impact:**  Potentially critical vulnerabilities leading to server compromise or application downtime.
    *   **Affected Next.js Component:**  The Next.js Image Optimization API (`next/image`) and its underlying image processing dependencies.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Next.js and its dependencies, including image processing libraries.
        *   Monitor security advisories for vulnerabilities in used libraries and apply patches promptly.

*   **Threat:** Security Bypass via Flawed Middleware Logic
    *   **Description:** An attacker could exploit vulnerabilities or logical flaws in custom Next.js middleware to bypass security checks like authentication or authorization, gaining unauthorized access to protected resources or functionalities.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionalities, potentially leading to data breaches or other security incidents.
    *   **Affected Next.js Component:**  Next.js Middleware (`middleware.ts` or `middleware.js`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test middleware logic for vulnerabilities and edge cases.
        *   Ensure middleware is correctly ordered and applied to the intended routes.
        *   Follow secure coding practices when implementing middleware, including proper input validation and error handling.

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Information in Client-Side Bundles
    *   **Description:** Developers might unintentionally include sensitive information (API keys, credentials, internal URLs) directly in the client-side code, which is then bundled and accessible to anyone viewing the source code in the browser.
    *   **Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive data that can be exploited for unauthorized access or further attacks.
    *   **Affected Next.js Component:**  The Next.js build process and the resulting client-side JavaScript bundles.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize environment variables for sensitive configuration and access them securely on the server-side.
        *   Avoid hardcoding sensitive data in the codebase.
        *   Carefully review the generated client-side bundles to ensure no sensitive information is exposed.
