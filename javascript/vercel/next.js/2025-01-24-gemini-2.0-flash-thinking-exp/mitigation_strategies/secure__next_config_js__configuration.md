The stated impact levels for each threat and the mitigation strategy's reduction effectiveness are generally reasonable and aligned with security best practices.

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `next/image`:**  **Medium Severity, Medium Reduction.** Restricting `domains` and `remotePatterns` effectively reduces the attack surface for SSRF via `next/image`. However, it doesn't eliminate all SSRF risks if other parts of the application are vulnerable.
*   **Open Redirects:** **Low to Medium Severity, Low to Medium Reduction.** Secure redirects and rewrites in `next.config.js` prevent open redirects originating from these configurations. However, open redirects can still exist in other parts of the application's routing logic.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** **High Severity, High Reduction.** Avoiding embedding secrets in `next.config.js` significantly reduces the risk of accidental secret exposure in code repositories.
*   **Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities:** **Medium Severity, Medium Reduction.** Regular audits and secure configuration practices reduce the overall risk of misconfiguration-related vulnerabilities in `next.config.js`. However, misconfigurations can still occur and may require ongoing vigilance.

### 6. Current Implementation and Missing Implementation Analysis

*   **Currently Implemented:** `domains` for `next/image` is configured. Redirects and rewrites are used but not explicitly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Analysis:**  While configuring `domains` is a good starting point, it's insufficient. The lack of explicit security review for redirects and rewrites is a significant gap.
*   **Missing Implementation:** `remotePatterns` for `next/image` is missing. A comprehensive security review of all `next.config.js` settings, especially redirects and rewrites, is needed. CSP headers are not yet configured within `next.config.js`.
    *   **Analysis:** The missing `remotePatterns` limits the granularity of SSRF mitigation. The lack of comprehensive security review and CSP implementation represents critical security gaps that need immediate attention.
