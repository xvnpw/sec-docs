# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vercel/next.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Validation and Sanitization in Server Components and API Routes](./mitigation_strategies/input_validation_and_sanitization_in_server_components_and_api_routes.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Identify Server Components and API Routes:** List all Server Components and API routes defined in your `pages` and `pages/api` directories respectively, which handle user input or external data.
2.  **Analyze Input Sources:** For each component/route, identify all sources of user input: props in Server Components, request body (JSON, form data), query parameters, and request headers in API routes.
3.  **Choose Validation Library:** Select a robust validation library for JavaScript/Node.js (e.g., `zod`, `joi`, `express-validator`) suitable for both server-side and API contexts.
4.  **Define Validation Schemas:** Create schemas using the chosen library that define the expected structure, data types, formats, and constraints for each input field in Server Components and API routes.
5.  **Implement Validation Logic:**
    *   **Server Components:** Integrate validation directly within the Server Component function, before processing or rendering data.
    *   **API Routes:** Implement validation logic within the API route handler, ideally using middleware or validation functions at the beginning of each route handler.
6.  **Validate Input Data:** Use the defined schemas to validate incoming data against the expected format in both Server Components and API routes.
7.  **Handle Validation Errors:** If validation fails, handle errors appropriately:
    *   **Server Components:**  Return error messages or render fallback UI to gracefully handle invalid input. Avoid exposing sensitive server-side details in client-side error messages.
    *   **API Routes:** Return appropriate HTTP error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request) with informative error messages indicating invalid input.
8.  **Sanitize Validated Data:** After successful validation, sanitize the input data before rendering in Server Components or using in backend operations in API routes. Sanitize based on the context of use (e.g., HTML escaping for rendering in JSX, database-specific escaping for database queries).

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (Medium Severity): Prevents injection of malicious scripts through user input rendered in Server Components or API responses.
*   SQL Injection (High Severity): Mitigates SQL injection vulnerabilities in API routes by sanitizing input before database queries.
*   NoSQL Injection (High Severity): Mitigates NoSQL injection vulnerabilities in API routes by sanitizing input before NoSQL database queries.
*   Command Injection (High Severity): Prevents command injection in API routes if input is used in system commands.
*   Business Logic Errors due to invalid data (Medium Severity): Reduces errors caused by unexpected data formats in both Server Components and API routes.

**Impact:**

*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Medium reduction - Reduces injection vectors, output encoding in JSX is also crucial for full XSS prevention in Server Components.
*   SQL Injection: High reduction - Effectively prevents SQL injection in API routes if implemented correctly.
*   NoSQL Injection: High reduction - Effectively prevents NoSQL injection in API routes if implemented correctly.
*   Command Injection: High reduction - Prevents command injection in API routes if input is properly validated and sanitized.
*   Business Logic Errors due to invalid data: High reduction - Significantly reduces errors caused by unexpected data formats.

**Currently Implemented:** Partially implemented in `/pages/api/auth/login` and `/pages/api/auth/register` API routes using basic type checks and manual sanitization. Some basic sanitization is used in Server Components for user-generated content display.

**Missing Implementation:** Missing in most API routes (`/pages/api/products`, `/pages/api/orders`, `/pages/api/profile`, etc.). Needs to be implemented across all API endpoints using a schema validation library and consistent sanitization practices. Server Components data fetching and handling user input in more complex scenarios require more robust validation.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Rate Limiting for Next.js API Routes](./mitigation_strategies/rate_limiting_for_next_js_api_routes.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Choose Rate Limiting Middleware/Library:** Select a rate limiting middleware or library for Node.js (e.g., `express-rate-limit`, `rate-limiter-flexible`) compatible with Next.js API routes.
2.  **Define API Route Rate Limits:** Determine appropriate rate limits for each API route in `pages/api` based on expected usage and resource capacity. Consider different limits for authenticated and unauthenticated users.
3.  **Implement Rate Limiting Middleware in API Routes:** Integrate the chosen rate limiting middleware into your Next.js API route handlers. This is typically done by wrapping the API route handler function with the middleware.
4.  **Configure Rate Limiting Options:** Configure the middleware with defined rate limits, window duration, key generation function (e.g., based on IP address or user ID), and error handling specific to Next.js API route responses.
5.  **Handle Rate Limit Exceeded Responses in API Routes:** Customize the response sent by API routes when a user exceeds the rate limit. Return a 429 Too Many Requests status code with a clear JSON message indicating the rate limit and when to retry. Include `Retry-After` header if possible.
6.  **Consider Whitelisting/Blacklisting for API Routes:** Implement whitelisting for trusted clients or IP addresses that should be exempt from rate limiting for specific API routes. Consider blacklisting malicious IPs that consistently violate rate limits on API routes.
7.  **Monitoring and Adjustment of API Route Rate Limits:** Monitor API route traffic and rate limiting effectiveness using Next.js monitoring tools or external services. Adjust rate limits as needed based on observed usage patterns and potential abuse attempts targeting API routes.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) (High Severity): Prevents attackers from overwhelming Next.js API routes with excessive requests, impacting application availability.
*   Brute-Force Attacks (Medium Severity): Slows down brute-force attempts against Next.js API route based login forms or authentication endpoints.
*   API Abuse (Medium Severity): Limits automated abuse of Next.js API endpoints for malicious purposes.

**Impact:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS) / Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): High reduction - Significantly reduces the impact of DoS attacks targeting API routes.
*   Brute-Force Attacks: Medium reduction - Makes brute-force attacks against API routes slower and less effective.
*   API Abuse: Medium reduction - Limits the scale of API abuse against Next.js API endpoints.

**Currently Implemented:** Not implemented in any Next.js API routes.

**Missing Implementation:** Missing across all API routes in `pages/api`. Rate limiting needs to be implemented for all public API endpoints, especially authentication and data-intensive routes exposed via Next.js API routes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `next/image` Component Configuration and Usage](./mitigation_strategies/secure__nextimage__component_configuration_and_usage.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Configure `domains` and `remotePatterns` in `next.config.js`:**  In your `next.config.js` file, strictly define the `domains` and `remotePatterns` allowed for the `next/image` component. Only include domains and patterns that are explicitly trusted sources for images used in your Next.js application.
2.  **Validate Dynamic Image URLs for `next/image`:** When using dynamic image URLs with `next/image`, especially those derived from user input or external sources, rigorously validate and sanitize the URLs *before* passing them to the `next/image` component.
3.  **Implement Image URL Allowlisting for `next/image`:** If dynamic URLs are necessary, create an allowlist of trusted image domains or URL patterns. Validate incoming image URLs against this allowlist before using them in `next/image`.
4.  **Use `next/image` Optimization:** Rely on the built-in image optimization features of `next/image` by default. Avoid using `unoptimized={true}` unless absolutely necessary for specific images where optimization is not desired. Image optimization provides security benefits by processing images on the server.
5.  **Content Security Policy (CSP) for `next/image` Sources:** Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) header in your Next.js application that includes `img-src` directive to further restrict the sources from which `next/image` can load images. This provides an additional layer of defense.
6.  **Regularly Review `next/image` Configuration in `next.config.js`:** Periodically review your `next.config.js` settings related to `next/image` (`domains`, `remotePatterns`) to ensure they are still accurate, secure, and aligned with your application's image sources.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `next/image` (Medium Severity): Restricting allowed domains and patterns in `next.config.js` mitigates SSRF risks by preventing `next/image` from fetching images from arbitrary URLs.
*   Loading Malicious Images via `next/image` (Medium Severity): Prevents `next/image` from loading images from untrusted or malicious domains, reducing the risk of serving malicious image content.

**Impact:**

*   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `next/image`: Medium reduction - Restricting allowed domains and patterns significantly reduces SSRF risks associated with `next/image`.
*   Loading Malicious Images via `next/image`: Medium reduction - Prevents loading images from explicitly disallowed domains, reducing the risk of serving malicious images through `next/image`.

**Currently Implemented:** `domains` is configured in `next.config.js` with a limited set of allowed domains for primary website images.

**Missing Implementation:** `remotePatterns` is not configured in `next.config.js`. Dynamic image URLs, especially from user-generated content, are not consistently validated against an allowlist before being used with `next/image`. CSP headers are not yet implemented to further restrict image sources for `next/image`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure `next.config.js` Configuration](./mitigation_strategies/secure__next_config_js__configuration.md)

**Description:**

1.  **Review `next.config.js` for Security-Sensitive Settings:** Carefully review all configurations within your `next.config.js` file, paying close attention to settings that could have security implications. This includes, but is not limited to, `domains`, `remotePatterns` for `next/image`, custom headers, redirects, rewrites, and environment variable configurations.
2.  **Minimize `domains` and `remotePatterns` Whitelisting in `next/image`:**  Keep the `domains` and `remotePatterns` lists in `next.config.js` for `next/image` as restrictive as possible, only allowing truly trusted and necessary image sources. Avoid overly broad whitelisting.
3.  **Secure Custom Headers Configuration:** If you are configuring custom headers in `next.config.js`, ensure they are set securely. For example, when setting Content Security Policy (CSP) or other security headers, verify the directives are correctly configured and do not introduce new vulnerabilities.
4.  **Validate Redirects and Rewrites in `next.config.js`:** If you define redirects or rewrites in `next.config.js`, carefully validate the destination URLs to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities. Ensure redirects and rewrites point to intended and trusted destinations.
5.  **Avoid Exposing Secrets in `next.config.js`:** Do not directly embed sensitive information or secrets within `next.config.js`. Use environment variables for sensitive configuration values and access them within `next.config.js` if needed.
6.  **Regularly Audit `next.config.js`:** Periodically audit your `next.config.js` file as your application evolves to ensure configurations remain secure and aligned with security best practices. Review changes made to `next.config.js` during code reviews for potential security implications.

**List of Threats Mitigated:**

*   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `next/image` (Medium Severity): Restrictive `domains` and `remotePatterns` in `next.config.js` mitigate SSRF risks.
*   Open Redirects (Low to Medium Severity): Securely configured redirects and rewrites in `next.config.js` prevent open redirect vulnerabilities.
*   Exposure of Sensitive Information (High Severity): Avoiding embedding secrets in `next.config.js` prevents accidental exposure of sensitive data.
*   Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities (Medium Severity): Regular audits and secure configuration practices for `next.config.js` reduce the risk of misconfiguration-related vulnerabilities.

**Impact:**

*   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `next/image`: Medium reduction -  Reduces SSRF risks through `next/image` configuration.
*   Open Redirects: Low to Medium reduction - Prevents open redirects originating from Next.js routing configurations.
*   Exposure of Sensitive Information: High reduction - Prevents direct exposure of secrets in configuration files.
*   Misconfiguration Vulnerabilities: Medium reduction - Proactive configuration management reduces overall misconfiguration risks.

**Currently Implemented:** `domains` for `next/image` is configured. Redirects and rewrites are used but not explicitly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.

**Missing Implementation:** `remotePatterns` for `next/image` is missing.  A comprehensive security review of all `next.config.js` settings, especially redirects and rewrites, is needed.  CSP headers are not yet configured within `next.config.js`.
