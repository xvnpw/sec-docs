# BUSINESS POSTURE

- Business priorities and goals:
  - Next.js aims to provide a React framework for building user interfaces with excellent developer experience and optimized end-user performance.
  - It prioritizes features like server-side rendering, static site generation, routing, and API routes to enable developers to build full-stack web applications efficiently.
  - A key goal is to simplify web development and improve website performance, leading to better user engagement and business outcomes for companies using Next.js.
  - Another goal is to foster a large and active community around the framework, ensuring its continuous improvement and adoption.
- Most important business risks:
  - Risk of security vulnerabilities in the framework itself, which could impact all applications built with Next.js.
  - Risk of performance issues or instability in the framework, leading to poor user experience for applications built with Next.js.
  - Risk of developer dissatisfaction due to complexity, lack of features, or poor documentation, potentially leading to decreased adoption.
  - Risk of losing community support and contributions, hindering the framework's long-term development and relevance.

# SECURITY POSTURE

- Existing security controls:
  - security control: Regular dependency updates to address known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries. Implemented through automated dependency scanning and update processes (not explicitly documented in the repo, but standard practice for open-source projects).
  - security control: Community security audits and vulnerability reports. Implemented through open communication channels and bug bounty programs (if any, not explicitly documented in the repo).
  - security control: Secure coding practices within the Next.js development team. Implemented through code reviews and developer training (not explicitly documented, assumed best practice).
  - security control: Input validation and sanitization within the framework's core components to prevent common web vulnerabilities like XSS and injection attacks. Implemented within the framework's source code.
  - security control: Protection against common web attacks like CSRF and clickjacking are likely considered and implemented within the framework (not explicitly documented, assumed best practice for web frameworks).
- Accepted risks:
  - accepted risk: Potential for zero-day vulnerabilities to be discovered in the framework. Mitigation is through rapid response and patching when vulnerabilities are reported.
  - accepted risk: Risk of vulnerabilities in user-developed applications built with Next.js due to improper usage of the framework or insecure coding practices. This is the responsibility of the application developers, not the Next.js team.
  - accepted risk: Reliance on the security of underlying platforms and infrastructure where Next.js applications are deployed (e.g., Node.js, hosting providers).
- Recommended security controls:
  - security control: Implement a formal security vulnerability disclosure and response process.
  - security control: Conduct regular automated security scans (SAST, DAST) of the Next.js codebase.
  - security control: Consider a formal security audit by a third-party security firm.
  - security control: Enhance documentation with security best practices for developers using Next.js.
  - security control: Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) framework within Next.js to help developers easily configure CSP for their applications.
- Security requirements:
  - Authentication: Next.js itself does not handle authentication, but provides mechanisms (API routes, middleware) for developers to implement authentication in their applications. Security requirement is to provide clear guidance and best practices for implementing secure authentication.
  - Authorization: Similar to authentication, authorization is the responsibility of the application developer. Next.js should provide tools and guidance for implementing fine-grained authorization within applications. Security requirement is to offer flexible and secure authorization patterns.
  - Input validation: Next.js framework should enforce input validation at framework level to prevent common injection attacks. Security requirement is to ensure robust input validation for all framework-handled inputs. Applications built with Next.js also need to implement their own input validation.
  - Cryptography: Next.js might use cryptography internally for certain features (e.g., secure cookies). Security requirement is to use secure cryptographic libraries and practices. For application-level cryptography, Next.js should provide guidance and best practices.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

- Critical business processes:
  - For Next.js as a framework, the critical business process is the development, maintenance, and distribution of the framework itself. Any compromise to this process can impact all users of Next.js.
  - For applications built with Next.js, critical business processes depend on the specific application. Examples include e-commerce transactions, user data management, content delivery, etc.
- Data sensitivity:
  - Next.js framework itself does not directly handle sensitive data. However, applications built with Next.js can handle various types of data, including:
    - User data (personal information, credentials, etc.)
    - Application data (business-specific data)
    - Configuration data (API keys, database credentials, etc.)
  - Sensitivity of data depends on the application and its purpose. User data and credentials are generally considered highly sensitive. Configuration data also needs strong protection.

# QUESTIONS & ASSUMPTIONS

- BUSINESS POSTURE:
  - Question: What are the primary revenue streams for Vercel (the company behind Next.js)? Understanding this can provide more context to business priorities.
  - Assumption: The primary business goal is to increase the adoption and usage of Next.js, which indirectly benefits Vercel through platform adoption and related services.
- SECURITY POSTURE:
  - Question: Does Next.js have a formal security vulnerability disclosure policy and bug bounty program?
  - Assumption: Next.js follows common open-source security practices, including community security reporting and reactive patching, but might not have a formal documented policy or bug bounty program.
  - Question: Are there regular security audits conducted on the Next.js codebase?
  - Assumption: Security audits are likely performed periodically, but the frequency and scope are not publicly documented.
- DESIGN:
  - Question: What specific technologies are used for serverless functions and storage in Vercel's deployment environment?
  - Assumption: Vercel's serverless functions are based on AWS Lambda or a similar technology, and storage is based on AWS S3 or a similar object storage service.
  - Question: What SAST and dependency scanning tools are used in the Next.js build process (internally by Vercel or recommended for users)?
  - Assumption: Standard open-source or commercial SAST and dependency scanning tools are likely used or recommended, but specific tools are not explicitly defined in the public repository.
