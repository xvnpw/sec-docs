# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vercel/next.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Input Sanitization and Validation in Server Components and API Routes (Next.js Context)](./mitigation_strategies/input_sanitization_and_validation_in_server_components_and_api_routes__next_js_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Input Sanitization and Validation (Next.js Server-Side)
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Focus on Next.js Entry Points:**  Specifically target Server Components and Next.js API routes as primary entry points for user input.
    2.  **Utilize Next.js Context:** Within Server Components and API route handlers, implement validation and sanitization logic for all request parameters, body data, and headers.
    3.  **Leverage Server-Side Libraries:** Use server-side validation libraries compatible with Next.js environment (Node.js) like `zod`, `joi`, or built-in Node.js modules for input validation.
    4.  **Parameterized Queries in API Routes:** When API routes interact with databases, strictly use parameterized queries or ORMs (like Prisma, often used with Next.js) to prevent SQL injection.
    5.  **Sanitization in Server Rendering:** In Server Components, sanitize user inputs before rendering them into HTML to prevent XSS vulnerabilities during server-side rendering.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Severity: High
    *   SQL Injection - Severity: High
    *   Command Injection - Severity: High
    *   LDAP Injection - Severity: Medium
    *   XML Injection - Severity: Medium
    *   Data Integrity Issues - Severity: Medium
*   **Impact:**
    *   XSS: High reduction - Prevents malicious scripts from being injected and executed, especially during server rendering in Next.js.
    *   SQL Injection: High reduction - Prevents database manipulation via API routes in Next.js.
    *   Command/LDAP/XML Injection: Medium to High reduction - Mitigates injection attacks through server-side input handling in Next.js.
    *   Data Integrity Issues: Medium reduction - Ensures data processed by Next.js server components and API routes is valid.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Partially implemented in API routes using basic input validation in route handlers for user registration and login forms within Next.js API routes. Parameterized queries are used with Prisma ORM in API routes.
    *   Basic sanitization is applied to user comments in blog posts rendered server-side using Next.js Server Components.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Comprehensive validation is missing in Server Components that handle form submissions (contact forms, profile updates) within Next.js application.
    *   Sanitization is not consistently applied across all Server Components rendering user-generated content in Next.js.
    *   No validation is implemented for file uploads in Next.js API routes.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Secure Handling of Server-Side Data and Secrets (Next.js Context)](./mitigation_strategies/secure_handling_of_server-side_data_and_secrets__next_js_context_.md)

*   **Mitigation Strategy:** Secure Secret Management using Next.js Configuration
*   **Description:**
    1.  **Utilize Next.js Environment Variables:** Store secrets as environment variables, leveraging Next.js's environment variable handling.
    2.  **Differentiate Server-Side and Client-Side Variables (Next.js Convention):**  Strictly adhere to Next.js convention of prefixing client-side variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to ensure server-side secrets are not exposed client-side.
    3.  **Leverage `serverRuntimeConfig` and `publicRuntimeConfig` (Next.js Feature):** Utilize Next.js's `serverRuntimeConfig` for storing sensitive secrets accessible only server-side and `publicRuntimeConfig` for public configuration.
    4.  **Secure Deployment Platform Configuration:**  In production, use secure secret management features provided by your Next.js hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify environment variables or secret management).
    5.  **Minimize Client-Side Data Exposure (Next.js Rendering):**  When using Server Components and API routes, carefully control data passed to Client Components to avoid unintentional exposure of server-side secrets or sensitive data in the client-side bundle.
*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   Exposure of Secrets - Severity: High
    *   Unauthorized Access to Backend Systems - Severity: High
    *   Data Breaches - Severity: High

    *   Exposure of Secrets: High reduction - Prevents secrets from being included in client-side JavaScript bundles in Next.js applications.
    *   Unauthorized Access: High reduction - Protects backend systems by keeping credentials server-side within Next.js environment.
    *   Data Breaches: Medium reduction - Reduces risk by securing access to sensitive resources via properly managed secrets in Next.js.
*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   API keys for third-party services are stored as environment variables, following Next.js conventions.
    *   Database credentials are managed through environment variables and accessed by Prisma within Next.js API routes.
    *   `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix is used for client-side accessible variables as per Next.js guidelines.
*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   `serverRuntimeConfig` and `publicRuntimeConfig` are not fully utilized for managing different configuration types in Next.js.
    *   No dedicated secret management solution beyond platform environment variables is used in production for Next.js application.
