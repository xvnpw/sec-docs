```

## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Next.js Application [CRITICAL NODE - Top Level Goal]:](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_next_js_application__critical_node_-_top_level_goal_.md)

*   This is the ultimate goal of the attacker. Success means gaining unauthorized access, control, or causing disruption to the Next.js application.

## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) & Server Components Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - SSR Vulnerabilities]:](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__&_server_components_vulnerabilities__critical_node_-_ssr_vuln_5d4c417e.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** SSR logic executes on the server, making vulnerabilities here potentially more impactful than client-side issues. Exploiting SSR vulnerabilities can lead to server-side compromise, data breaches, or denial of service.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.1. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):](./attack_tree_paths/1_1__server-side_request_forgery__ssrf_.md)

*   **1.1.1. Exploit Unvalidated External Data Fetching in SSR [CRITICAL NODE - Unvalidated SSR Data Fetching]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If SSR logic fetches data from external URLs based on user input without proper validation, an attacker can manipulate the URL.
    *   **Impact:** Can lead to the server making requests to internal resources (information disclosure, internal network scanning) or unintended external endpoints (potential interaction with malicious services, data exfiltration). In some cases, SSRF can be chained with other vulnerabilities to achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on backend systems.

## Attack Tree Path: [1.3. Logic Flaws in Server-Side Component Rendering:](./attack_tree_paths/1_3__logic_flaws_in_server-side_component_rendering.md)

*   **1.3.1. Bypass Authentication/Authorization checks in SSR components [CRITICAL NODE - SSR Auth/Auth Bypass]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Logic errors in SSR components that handle authentication or authorization can allow attackers to bypass these security controls.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to restricted resources, data, or functionalities. Attackers can gain access as another user or an administrator, depending on the flaw.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit API Routes Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE - API Route Vulnerabilities]:](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_api_routes_vulnerabilities__critical_node_-_api_route_vulnerabilities_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** API routes are backend endpoints that handle data and application logic. Vulnerabilities here can directly expose sensitive data, compromise backend systems, or disrupt application functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.1. Injection Vulnerabilities in API Routes [CRITICAL NODE - API Route Injection]:](./attack_tree_paths/2_1__injection_vulnerabilities_in_api_routes__critical_node_-_api_route_injection_.md)

*   **2.1.1. SQL Injection in API Route Database Queries [CRITICAL NODE - SQL Injection]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** If API routes construct SQL queries using user input without proper sanitization or parameterized queries, attackers can inject malicious SQL code.
    *   **Impact:**  Direct access to the database, allowing attackers to read, modify, or delete data. In severe cases, SQL injection can lead to database server compromise or even command execution on the database server.

## Attack Tree Path: [2.2. Authentication and Authorization Bypass in API Routes [CRITICAL NODE - API Route Auth/Auth Bypass]:](./attack_tree_paths/2_2__authentication_and_authorization_bypass_in_api_routes__critical_node_-_api_route_authauth_bypas_10d3db31.md)

*   **2.2.1. Weak or Missing Authentication in API Routes [CRITICAL NODE - Weak/Missing API Auth]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** API routes lacking proper authentication mechanisms allow anyone to access them, regardless of authorization.
    *   **Impact:**  Unauthorized access to API functionalities and data. Attackers can bypass intended access controls and perform actions they should not be allowed to.

    *   **2.2.2. Inadequate Authorization Checks in API Routes [CRITICAL NODE - Inadequate API Authz]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** API routes with insufficient authorization checks might not properly verify user permissions before granting access to resources or actions.
        *   **Impact:**  Privilege escalation, where attackers can access resources or perform actions beyond their intended permissions. This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Client-Side Rendering (CSR) Vulnerabilities (Next.js Context) [CRITICAL NODE - CSR Vulnerabilities]:](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_client-side_rendering__csr__vulnerabilities__next_js_context___critical_node_-_csr_vulner_703b1765.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** While Next.js emphasizes SSR, CSR is still used. Client-side vulnerabilities, especially XSS, can have significant impact by compromising user sessions and potentially leading to further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in Client-Side Components [CRITICAL NODE - Client-Side XSS]:](./attack_tree_paths/3_1__cross-site_scripting__xss__in_client-side_components__critical_node_-_client-side_xss_.md)

*   **3.1.1. Reflected XSS via URL parameters or query strings [CRITICAL NODE - Reflected XSS]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Attackers inject malicious scripts into URL parameters or query strings. If the application renders this data without proper escaping, the script executes in the user's browser.
    *   **Impact:**  Client-side compromise, allowing attackers to steal cookies (session hijacking), redirect users to malicious sites, deface the website, or perform actions on behalf of the user.

    *   **3.1.2. Stored XSS via database or backend data rendered client-side [CRITICAL NODE - Stored XSS]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers inject malicious scripts that are stored in the database or backend. When this data is retrieved and rendered client-side without proper escaping, the script executes for every user who views the content.
        *   **Impact:**  Widespread client-side compromise affecting multiple users. Similar impacts to reflected XSS, but persistent and potentially more damaging due to wider reach.

## Attack Tree Path: [3.2. Client-Side Logic Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/3_2__client-side_logic_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **3.2.1. Bypass Client-Side Validation or Security Checks [CRITICAL NODE - Client-Side Validation Bypass]:**
    *   **Attack Vector:** Attackers manipulate client-side requests or responses to bypass client-side validation or security checks.
    *   **Impact:**  Circumventing intended security measures. While client-side validation is not a primary security control, bypassing it can lead to exploitation of server-side vulnerabilities or unintended application behavior if server-side validation is also weak or missing.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Next.js Specific Features Vulnerabilities:](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_next_js_specific_features_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **4.2. Middleware Vulnerabilities (`middleware.ts/js`) [CRITICAL NODE - Middleware Vulnerabilities]:**
    *   **4.2.1. Authentication/Authorization Bypass in Middleware [CRITICAL NODE - Middleware Auth/Auth Bypass]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Logic flaws in middleware that handle authentication or authorization can allow attackers to bypass these security controls at a global level, affecting multiple routes.
        *   **Impact:**  Significant bypass of security controls across the application. Attackers can gain unauthorized access to large portions of the application if middleware authentication/authorization is flawed.
    *   **4.4.  `app` directory (if used - Next.js 13+) Specific Vulnerabilities:**
         *   **4.4.1. Server Actions vulnerabilities (similar to API routes but within components) [CRITICAL NODE - Server Actions Vulnerabilities]:**
            *   **Attack Vector:** Server Actions, being a newer feature, might have undiscovered vulnerabilities. They also share similar risks to API routes if not secured properly.
            *   **Impact:** Similar to API route vulnerabilities, including injection vulnerabilities, authentication/authorization bypass, potentially leading to data breaches or server compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [5. Exploit Development & Deployment Environment Vulnerabilities (Next.js Context):](./attack_tree_paths/5__exploit_development_&_deployment_environment_vulnerabilities__next_js_context_.md)

*   **5.2. Insecure Deployment Practices [CRITICAL NODE - Insecure Deployment]:**
    *   **5.2.1.  Expose `.env` files or environment variables with sensitive information [CRITICAL NODE - Exposed Env Variables]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:**  Accidentally exposing `.env` files or environment variables containing sensitive information (API keys, database credentials, secrets) through public repositories, misconfigured servers, or other means.
        *   **Impact:**  Direct exposure of sensitive credentials and secrets. Attackers can use these credentials to gain unauthorized access to backend systems, databases, APIs, or other services, leading to data breaches or full system compromise.

## Attack Tree Path: [6. Social Engineering & Phishing (Targeting Developers/Users) [CRITICAL NODE - Social Engineering]:](./attack_tree_paths/6__social_engineering_&_phishing__targeting_developersusers___critical_node_-_social_engineering_.md)

*   **High-Risk Path:** Social engineering attacks, especially phishing, are often successful and can bypass technical security controls.

    *   **6.1. Phishing attacks targeting developers to gain access to codebase or deployment credentials [CRITICAL NODE - Developer Phishing]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Phishing emails or messages targeting developers to trick them into revealing credentials for code repositories, deployment platforms, or other sensitive systems.
        *   **Impact:**  If successful, attackers gain access to the codebase, deployment infrastructure, and potentially sensitive data. This can lead to code modification, deployment of malicious versions, or data breaches.

    *   **6.2. Phishing attacks targeting application users to steal credentials or sensitive data [CRITICAL NODE - User Phishing]:**
        *   **Attack Vector:** Phishing emails or messages targeting application users to steal login credentials or other sensitive data.
        *   **Impact:**  User account compromise, data theft, and reputational damage. Attackers can use compromised user accounts to access user data, perform unauthorized actions, or further compromise the application.
