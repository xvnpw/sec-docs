# Attack Surface Analysis for vercel/next.js

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal in Dynamic Routes](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_in_dynamic_routes.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can manipulate URL paths, especially dynamic route parameters, to access files or directories outside the intended web application root.
*   **Next.js Contribution:** Dynamic routing features in Next.js, particularly when parameters are used to construct file paths on the server (e.g., in `getServerSideProps` or API routes), directly create opportunities for path traversal if not handled carefully.
*   **Example:** A route like `/api/files/[filename]` where `filename` is directly used to read a file from the server without validation. An attacker could request `/api/files/../../../etc/passwd` to attempt to read sensitive system files.
*   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive files, configuration files, or even application source code.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:**  Strictly validate and sanitize all dynamic route parameters before using them in file system operations. Use allowlists of allowed characters or patterns.
    *   **Absolute Paths:**  Construct absolute paths to files and directories on the server instead of relying on relative paths derived from user input.
    *   **Chroot Jails/Sandboxing:** In highly sensitive applications, consider using chroot jails or sandboxing techniques to restrict file system access.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure the application process runs with minimal necessary file system permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Injection Attacks in API Routes and Data Fetching](./attack_surfaces/injection_attacks_in_api_routes_and_data_fetching.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers inject malicious code (e.g., SQL, command, NoSQL) into application inputs, which are then executed by the server, leading to unauthorized actions or data breaches.
*   **Next.js Contribution:** API routes and server-side data fetching functions (`getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`) in Next.js, which are core features for backend logic and data retrieval, directly expose backend functionality and can become vulnerable if inputs are not sanitized.
*   **Example:** An API route `/api/users/[id]` that fetches user data from a database using a SQL query constructed directly with the `id` parameter without sanitization. An attacker could inject SQL code in the `id` parameter (e.g., `1; DROP TABLE users; --`) to manipulate the database.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data manipulation, unauthorized access, denial of service, and potentially remote code execution.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Parameterized Queries/Prepared Statements:**  Always use parameterized queries or prepared statements when interacting with databases to prevent SQL injection.
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization:** Validate and sanitize all user inputs before using them in queries or commands. Use allowlists and escape special characters appropriately for the target system (SQL, shell, etc.).
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege:**  Grant database users and application processes only the necessary permissions.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in Data Fetching and Image Optimization](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__in_data_fetching_and_image_optimization.md)

*   **Description:** Attackers can induce the server to make requests to unintended internal or external resources. This can be used to access internal services, read sensitive data, or perform port scanning.
*   **Next.js Contribution:** `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, and image optimization features in Next.js, designed for server-side data handling and image processing, can involve making requests to external URLs, directly creating SSRF risks if URLs are not properly validated.
*   **Example:** An image optimization feature that allows users to provide an image URL. If the application fetches and optimizes the image from the provided URL without validation, an attacker could provide a URL to an internal service (e.g., `http://localhost:6379`) to interact with it.
*   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, sensitive data exposure, port scanning, denial of service, and potentially remote code execution in vulnerable internal services.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Input Validation and Sanitization (URL Validation):**  Strictly validate and sanitize URLs provided by users. Use allowlists of allowed domains or protocols.
    *   **URL Filtering/Blocking:** Implement URL filtering or blocking mechanisms to prevent requests to internal networks or sensitive external resources.
    *   **Network Segmentation:** Isolate backend services and restrict network access to only necessary resources.
    *   **Principle of Least Privilege (Network Access):**  Ensure the application server has minimal necessary network access.
