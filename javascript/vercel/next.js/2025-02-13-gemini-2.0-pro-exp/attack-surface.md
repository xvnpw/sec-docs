# Attack Surface Analysis for vercel/next.js

## Attack Surface: [SSR Data Exposure via `getServerSideProps` Errors](./attack_surfaces/ssr_data_exposure_via__getserversideprops__errors.md)

*   **Description:** Sensitive data leakage through unhandled errors in `getServerSideProps`.
    *   **How Next.js Contributes:** `getServerSideProps` runs on the server on *every* request, increasing the chance of server-side errors being exposed if not handled correctly. Next.js's default error handling can be overly verbose, revealing more than intended.
    *   **Example:** An unhandled database query error in `getServerSideProps` revealing database connection details (host, username, password) in the client-side error message, which is then displayed to the user.
    *   **Impact:** Exposure of sensitive data (credentials, API keys, internal system information), potentially leading to further exploitation and complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive `try...catch` blocks within `getServerSideProps` to gracefully handle *all* potential errors, including network issues, database errors, and unexpected exceptions.
        *   **Generic Error Responses:** *Never* return raw error objects or detailed error messages to the client.  Return generic, user-friendly error messages that do not reveal any internal implementation details.
        *   **Server-Side Logging:** Log detailed error information server-side for debugging and auditing purposes. Use a dedicated error monitoring service (e.g., Sentry, Bugsnag, New Relic) to track and analyze errors.
        *   **Custom Error Page:** Create a custom error page (`pages/_error.js`) to control the user experience and ensure that no sensitive information is ever displayed to the user, regardless of the error.
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews, specifically focusing on error handling within `getServerSideProps`, to ensure consistency and completeness.

## Attack Surface: [API Route Exposure (Unprotected Endpoints)](./attack_surfaces/api_route_exposure__unprotected_endpoints_.md)

*   **Description:**  Publicly accessible API routes (`/pages/api`) due to missing or inadequate authentication and authorization mechanisms.
    *   **How Next.js Contributes:** Next.js API routes are serverless functions, making it easy to create endpoints.  However, developers *must* explicitly implement security measures; there are no built-in protections.
    *   **Example:** An API route designed to retrieve sensitive user data (`/api/getUserData`) that does not check if the requesting user is authenticated or authorized, allowing *anyone* to access *any* user's data.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion; potential for privilege escalation; complete system compromise.  This can lead to severe data breaches and legal consequences.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Authentication:** Implement robust authentication for *all* protected API routes. Use established and well-vetted authentication libraries like NextAuth.js or a custom solution using JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) with proper secret management.
        *   **Authorization:** Implement authorization checks *after* authentication to verify that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions (roles, scopes) to access the requested resource or perform the requested action.
        *   **Input Validation:** Strictly validate *all* input received by API routes to prevent malicious data from being processed. Use a validation library (e.g., Zod, Joi) to define and enforce input schemas.
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks targeting API routes.
        *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing specifically targeting API routes to identify and address potential vulnerabilities proactively.

## Attack Surface: [SSR Denial of Service (DoS) via `getServerSideProps`](./attack_surfaces/ssr_denial_of_service__dos__via__getserversideprops_.md)

*   **Description:**  Overwhelming the server with requests that trigger expensive or time-consuming operations within `getServerSideProps`, leading to a denial of service.
    *   **How Next.js Contributes:** `getServerSideProps` runs on *every* request, making it a prime target for DoS attacks if it performs resource-intensive tasks (database queries, external API calls, complex calculations).
    *   **Example:** An attacker repeatedly requesting a page that triggers a complex database query involving multiple joins and aggregations within `getServerSideProps`, exhausting database connections and CPU resources, making the site unavailable to legitimate users.
    *   **Impact:** Application unavailability, degraded performance for all users, potential financial losses (especially if using pay-per-use cloud services).
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement strict rate limiting and request throttling, especially for routes using `getServerSideProps`. Differentiate rate limits based on user roles or IP addresses if necessary.
        *   **Caching (where appropriate):** If the data returned by `getServerSideProps` is not highly dynamic and can tolerate some staleness, consider caching strategies (e.g., using a CDN, in-memory cache, Redis).  Carefully manage cache invalidation to ensure data consistency.
        *   **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the code within `getServerSideProps` to minimize execution time and resource consumption.  Profile the code to identify and address performance bottlenecks. Use efficient database queries and algorithms.
        *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Use asynchronous operations (e.g., `async/await`) to avoid blocking the main thread and improve responsiveness.
        *   **Web Application Firewall (WAF):** Deploy a WAF to help mitigate DDoS attacks and filter malicious traffic, providing an additional layer of defense.
        *   **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor server resource usage (CPU, memory, network, database connections) and set up alerts for unusual activity or resource exhaustion.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Logic Errors](./attack_surfaces/middleware_logic_errors.md)

*   **Description:** Bugs or logic flaws in custom middleware that can bypass security checks or expose sensitive information.
    *   **How Next.js Contributes:** Middleware runs on *every* request *before* routing, making it a critical security component.  A single flaw can compromise the entire application.
    *   **Example:** A middleware function intended to redirect unauthenticated users that incorrectly allows access to protected routes due to a flawed regular expression or incorrect conditional logic.  Another example: middleware that accidentally logs sensitive request data.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassed authentication/authorization, data exposure, unexpected application behavior, potential for complete system compromise.
    *   **Risk Severity:** **High**
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Thorough Testing:** Extensively test middleware logic, including edge cases, boundary conditions, and error conditions. Use both unit tests (testing individual functions) and integration tests (testing the middleware in the context of the application).
        *   **Simplicity:** Keep middleware logic as simple and concise as possible to reduce the risk of errors and make it easier to understand and maintain.
        *   **Established Patterns:** Use well-established patterns and libraries for common middleware tasks (e.g., authentication, authorization, request logging) instead of reinventing the wheel.
        *   **Logging (Carefully):** Log middleware activity for debugging, auditing, and identifying potential issues.  *However*, be extremely careful *not* to log sensitive data (passwords, API keys, personally identifiable information).
        *   **Code Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews of *all* middleware code, paying close attention to security-related logic.  Have multiple developers review the code.
