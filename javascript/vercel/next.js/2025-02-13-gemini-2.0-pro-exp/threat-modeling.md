# Threat Model Analysis for vercel/next.js

## Threat: [Sensitive Data Exposure in Build Output](./threats/sensitive_data_exposure_in_build_output.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of API Keys or Secrets in Client-Side Bundles
*   **Description:** An attacker inspects the generated JavaScript bundles (found in the `.next` directory after building) and finds hardcoded API keys, environment variables, or other sensitive data that were mistakenly included in client-side code. The attacker could use these keys to access backend services, databases, or third-party APIs with the application's privileges.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Unauthorized access to sensitive data and services.
    *   Potential financial loss (e.g., if the attacker uses cloud service credentials).
    *   Reputational damage.
    *   Data breaches.
*   **Affected Next.js Component:** `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, `getServerSideProps`, any client-side component that incorrectly uses server-side environment variables without the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.  Webpack configuration (if customized).
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Environment Variable Usage:**  *Never* hardcode secrets. Use environment variables correctly. Prefix client-side environment variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Use `.env.local` (never committed), `.env.development`, and `.env.production` files appropriately.
    *   **Code Reviews:**  Mandatory code reviews to ensure no sensitive data is passed to client-side components.
    *   **Build Output Inspection:**  Regularly inspect the `.next` directory (or equivalent) after building to verify no sensitive data is present.  Automate this check as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Server Components (Next.js 13+):** Utilize Server Components to keep sensitive logic and data entirely on the server.
    *   **Secrets Management:** Use a dedicated secrets management service (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, Vercel's environment variable management).

## Threat: [Unprotected API Routes](./threats/unprotected_api_routes.md)

*   **Threat:** Unauthorized Access to API Routes
*   **Description:** An attacker directly accesses Next.js API routes (`/api/*`) without proper authentication or authorization.  The attacker could retrieve sensitive data, modify data, or trigger unintended actions on the server.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Data modification or deletion.
    *   Unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the application.
    *   Denial of service (if the attacker floods the API route).
*   **Affected Next.js Component:** API Routes (`/api/*`)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Authentication:** Implement robust authentication for all API routes that require protection. Use NextAuth.js, a custom solution, or an external authentication provider.
    *   **Authorization:** Implement authorization checks to ensure that authenticated users have the necessary permissions to access specific API routes and perform actions.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Strictly validate *all* inputs to API routes, even for authenticated users, to prevent injection attacks and unexpected behavior.
    *   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
    *   **CSRF Protection:** If API routes are accessed via forms, implement CSRF protection.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via Image Optimization](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via_image_optimization.md)

*   **Threat:** SSRF via `next/image`
*   **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL for an external image that, when processed by Next.js's Image Optimization feature, causes the server to make requests to internal or protected resources. The attacker might be able to access internal services, metadata endpoints (on cloud providers), or other sensitive resources.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Access to internal network resources.
    *   Data exfiltration from internal services.
    *   Potential for remote code execution (in severe cases).
    *   Bypassing firewalls.
*   **Affected Next.js Component:** `next/image` component, `images` configuration in `next.config.js`
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Domain Whitelisting:**  In `next.config.js`, configure the `images.domains` array to *only* allow trusted domains for external images.  Avoid using wildcards.
    *   **Image Proxy:** Use a dedicated image proxy service that sanitizes and validates image URLs before fetching them.
    *   **Input Validation:**  Validate and sanitize any user-provided input that is used to construct image URLs.
    *   **Network Segmentation:**  Ensure that your Next.js application is deployed in a network environment that limits its access to internal resources.

## Threat: [Dependency Vulnerabilities](./threats/dependency_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Threat:** Exploitation of Vulnerabilities in Dependencies
*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known vulnerability in Next.js itself or one of its dependencies (npm packages). The attacker could gain control of the application, steal data, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete application compromise.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Affected Next.js Component:** Any component that uses a vulnerable dependency.
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical to High (depending on the vulnerability)
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Updates:**  Keep Next.js and all dependencies up-to-date. Use `npm outdated` or `yarn outdated` to check for updates.  Automate dependency updates using tools like Dependabot.
    *   **Vulnerability Scanning:**  Use tools like `npm audit`, `yarn audit`, Snyk, or OWASP Dependency-Check to automatically scan for known vulnerabilities. Integrate these tools into your CI/CD pipeline.
    *   **Dependency Review:**  Before adding a new dependency, carefully review its security posture, maintenance activity, and community reputation.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Use SCA tools to gain a deeper understanding of your application's dependencies and their vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [Client-Side Data Manipulation](./threats/client-side_data_manipulation.md)

* **Threat:** Tampering with Client-Side Data
* **Description:** An attacker modifies data fetched on the client-side before it's used in a critical operation (e.g., a form submission that updates the database).  Since the server doesn't re-validate the data, the attacker can bypass client-side validation and inject malicious data.  This is *directly* relevant to Next.js because Next.js applications often involve client-side data fetching and interactions.
* **Impact:**
    *   Data corruption.
    *   Unauthorized actions.
    *   Bypassing security controls.
* **Affected Next.js Component:** Any component that relies solely on client-side data validation without server-side re-validation.  API routes that don't validate data received from the client.  Forms using client-side fetched data without server-side revalidation.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Server-Side Validation:** *Always* re-validate all data on the server, even if it was initially validated on the client.  Treat client-side data as untrusted.
    *   **Input Sanitization:** Sanitize all data received from the client to prevent injection attacks.
    *   **Use SSR or SSG:** Prefer Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG) for data that requires strong security guarantees.

## Threat: [Unsafe Redirects in Middleware](./threats/unsafe_redirects_in_middleware.md)

* **Threat:** Open Redirect Vulnerability via Middleware
* **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL that leverages a poorly configured Next.js middleware redirect to redirect the user to a phishing site or a site that delivers malware. This is a *direct* threat because it involves the Next.js middleware feature.
* **Impact:**
    *   Phishing attacks.
    *   Malware distribution.
    *   Reputational damage.
* **Affected Next.js Component:** Middleware (`middleware.js` or `middleware.ts`)
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Validate Redirect URLs:**  Strictly validate all redirect URLs within your middleware.  Avoid using user-provided input directly in redirect URLs.
    *   **Whitelist Allowed Redirects:**  If possible, maintain a whitelist of allowed redirect destinations.
    *   **Use Relative Paths:** Prefer relative paths for redirects whenever possible.
    *   **Avoid Open Redirects:** Never redirect to a URL provided directly by the user without proper validation.
