# Mitigation Strategies Analysis for vercel/next.js

## Mitigation Strategy: [Strict Environment Variable Management (Next.js Specific)](./mitigation_strategies/strict_environment_variable_management__next_js_specific_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **`NEXT_PUBLIC_` and `SERVER_ONLY_` Prefixes:** Enforce a strict naming convention.  All client-side environment variables *must* use the `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix.  All server-side-only variables *must* use a custom prefix like `SERVER_ONLY_`.
    2.  **Centralized Access (Next.js Context):** Create a module (e.g., `config.js`) that imports `process.env`.  This module selectively exports *only* the intended client-side variables (those with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) through clearly named functions or constants. Client components *never* directly access `process.env`.
    3.  **Build-Time Validation (Next.js Build Process):** Integrate a script into the Next.js build process (using `prebuild` or `build` in `package.json`). This script:
        *   Runs *after* the Next.js build completes.
        *   Analyzes the generated client-side bundles (in the `.next` directory).
        *   Uses a regular expression (or AST parsing) to search for any usage of `SERVER_ONLY_` prefixed variables within these bundles.
        *   If found, the build *fails* with a descriptive error.
    4.  **Runtime Validation (`_app.js`):** Within `_app.js` (or a custom server), *before* any rendering, include a script that:
        *   On the server (`typeof window === 'undefined'`), checks for the *presence* of required `SERVER_ONLY_` variables.
        *   On the client (`typeof window !== 'undefined'`), checks for the *absence* of `SERVER_ONLY_` variables.
        *   Throws an error or prevents rendering if validation fails.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Client-Side Exposure of Secrets (High Severity):** Prevents accidental leakage of server-side secrets (API keys, etc.) to the client due to incorrect usage of Next.js's environment variable handling.
    *   **Next.js Configuration Errors (Medium Severity):** Reduces the risk of deploying a Next.js application with misconfigured environment variables, leading to unexpected behavior.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Client-Side Exposure of Secrets:** Risk significantly reduced (near zero with full implementation). The multi-layered approach leverages Next.js's build process and runtime environment.
    *   **Next.js Configuration Errors:** Risk significantly reduced. Early detection during build and runtime prevents deployment of misconfigured applications.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Prefixes: Partially (inconsistent use of `SERVER_ONLY_`).
    *   Centralized Access: Not implemented.
    *   Build-Time Validation: Not implemented.
    *   Runtime Validation: Not implemented.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent `SERVER_ONLY_` prefixing.
    *   `config.js` module creation.
    *   Build-time validation script.
    *   Runtime validation in `_app.js`.

## Mitigation Strategy: [SSRF Prevention in Next.js Data Fetching Functions](./mitigation_strategies/ssrf_prevention_in_next_js_data_fetching_functions.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **URL Allowlist (Next.js Config):** Maintain a strict allowlist of permitted domains and URL prefixes within the Next.js configuration (or carefully managed environment variables). This list is used *exclusively* by `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, and `getServerSideProps`.
    2.  **URL Validation (within Data Fetching):** Inside `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, and `getServerSideProps`, use the built-in `URL` object (or a similar library) to parse *all* URLs *before* making any external requests.
    3.  **Allowlist Enforcement:** Before fetching data, compare the parsed URL's hostname and path against the allowlist.  Reject the request if it doesn't match.
    4.  **Avoid Direct User Input (in URL Construction):**  Within these data fetching functions, *never* directly construct URLs from user-supplied input. Instead, use user input as keys to look up pre-defined, safe URLs from a configuration or database. If user input *must* be used, sanitize it rigorously *before* using it in any URL-related logic.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in `getStaticProps`, `getStaticPaths`, `getServerSideProps` (High Severity):** Prevents attackers from exploiting these Next.js server-side functions to access internal resources or make unauthorized requests.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **SSRF:** Risk significantly reduced. By strictly controlling the URLs accessed by these Next.js functions, the attack surface is minimized.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   URL Allowlist: Not implemented.
    *   URL Validation: Partially (inconsistent).
    *   Allowlist Enforcement: Not implemented.
    *   Avoid Direct User Input: Partially.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Allowlist creation.
    *   Consistent URL parsing.
    *   Allowlist check implementation.
    *   Refactoring to avoid direct user input in URLs.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Safe Redirects with Next.js](./mitigation_strategies/safe_redirects_with_next_js.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Prefer Relative Redirects (Next.js `redirect`):** When using the `redirect` object in `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, or `next.config.js`, *always* prefer relative paths (e.g., `/login`) over absolute URLs.
    2.  **URL Allowlist (for External Redirects - Next.js Config):** If external redirects are *unavoidable*, maintain an allowlist of permitted domains within the Next.js configuration.
    3.  **Validation (within Redirect Logic):** Before performing *any* redirect (using the `redirect` object), validate the destination URL:
        *   If it's a relative path, no further validation is needed.
        *   If it's an absolute URL, use the `URL` object to parse it and check if the hostname matches the allowlist.
    4.  **Avoid User Input (in Redirect Destinations):** Do *not* use user-supplied data directly to construct the `destination` property of the `redirect` object. Use server-side logic or a lookup table.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Open Redirects using Next.js `redirect` (Medium Severity):** Prevents attackers from using the Next.js redirect functionality to redirect users to malicious sites.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Open Redirects:** Risk significantly reduced. Prioritizing relative redirects and validating absolute URLs against an allowlist effectively mitigates this vulnerability.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Relative Redirects: Partially.
    *   URL Allowlist: Not implemented.
    *   Validation: Not implemented.
    *   Avoid User Input: Partially.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Consistent use of relative redirects.
    *   Allowlist for external redirects.
    *   Validation logic for all redirects.
    *   Refactoring to avoid user input.

## Mitigation Strategy: [Migrate from `getInitialProps` (Next.js Deprecation)](./mitigation_strategies/migrate_from__getinitialprops___next_js_deprecation_.md)

*   **Description:**
    1.  **Identify:** Search the entire codebase for any usage of `getInitialProps`.
    2.  **Refactor (to Next.js Recommended Methods):** Replace *every* instance of `getInitialProps` with either `getServerSideProps` (for server-side rendering on each request) or `getStaticProps` (for static generation at build time). Choose the appropriate method based on the component's data requirements.
    3.  **Testing (Post-Migration):** After refactoring, thoroughly test all affected components to ensure they function correctly and that no data is unintentionally exposed to the client.  This is crucial because `getInitialProps` runs on both the server and client, while the replacements have clear server/client separation.

*   **Threats Mitigated:**
    *   **Data Exposure due to `getInitialProps` Misuse (High Severity):** Eliminates the risk of accidentally exposing sensitive data to the client by using the deprecated `getInitialProps` method, which has ambiguous execution context.

*   **Impact:**
    *   **Data Exposure:** Risk eliminated by migrating to `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps`, which have clearly defined server-side execution.

*   **Currently Implemented:**
    *   Identify: Not performed.
    *   Refactor: Not performed.
    *   Testing: Not performed.

*   **Missing Implementation:**
    *   Codebase search for `getInitialProps`.
    *   Complete refactoring to `getServerSideProps` or `getStaticProps`.
    *   Thorough testing after migration.
