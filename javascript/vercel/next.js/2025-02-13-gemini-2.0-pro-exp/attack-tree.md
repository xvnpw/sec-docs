## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 1](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_1.md)

*   **Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / API Routes:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the server-side components of the Next.js application.
    *   **Misconfigured API Route Permissions (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** API routes (`/pages/api/*`) lack proper authentication and authorization checks *within the route handler itself*.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium
    *   **Bypass AuthN/Z (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker successfully accesses protected resources or functionality without proper credentials.
        *   **Likelihood:** High (if Misconfigured API Route Permissions exist)
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice to Intermediate
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 2](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_2.md)

*   **Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / API Routes:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the server-side components.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies in Server-Side Code (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** Server-side code (API routes, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`) uses packages with known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Dependency Confusion (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as an internal/private package, tricking the application into installing it.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 3](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_3.md)

*   **Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / API Routes:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the server-side components.
    *   **Leaked Environment Variables (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** Sensitive information (API keys, database credentials) stored in environment variables are accidentally exposed in API responses or logs.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very Low
        *   **Skill Level:** Novice
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 4](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_4.md)

*   **Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / API Routes:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the server-side components.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies in Server-Side Code (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** Server-side code (API routes, `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`) uses packages with known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** High to Very High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    * **Supply Chain Attack (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker compromises a legitimate dependency used by the application, injecting malicious code that is then executed by the application.
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** Very High
        *   **Effort:** Very High
        *   **Skill Level:** Expert
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 5](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_5.md)

*   **Exploit Client-Side Features:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities or misconfigurations within the client-side components of the Next.js application.
    *   **Vulnerable Dependencies in Client-Side Code:**
        *   **Description:** Client-side code uses packages with known vulnerabilities.
        *   **Likelihood:** Medium
        *   **Impact:** Medium to High
        *   **Effort:** Medium to High
        *   **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard
    *   **Dependency Confusion (CRITICAL):**
        *   **Description:** The attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as an internal/private package, tricking the application into installing it (executed in the user's browser).
        *   **Likelihood:** Low
        *   **Impact:** High
        *   **Effort:** Medium
        *   **Skill Level:** Advanced
        *   **Detection Difficulty:** Hard

## Attack Tree Path: [High-Risk Path 6](./attack_tree_paths/high-risk_path_6.md)

* **Exploit Client-Side Features:** The attacker targets vulnerabilities in how data is handled on the client-side, even if fetched server-side.
    * **Exploit `getStaticProps` or `getServerSideProps`:** The attacker leverages issues in how these data-fetching functions are used.
        * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium
        * **Impact:** Medium to High
        * **Effort:** Medium to High
        * **Skill Level:** Intermediate to Advanced
