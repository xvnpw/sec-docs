# Attack Surface Analysis for vercel/next.js

## Attack Surface: [Path Traversal via Dynamic Routes](./attack_surfaces/path_traversal_via_dynamic_routes.md)

**Description:** Attackers can manipulate dynamic route parameters to access files or directories outside the intended scope.

**How Next.js Contributes:** Next.js's dynamic routing feature (`pages/[param].js`) relies on developers properly validating and sanitizing route parameters. Failure to do so opens the door for path traversal.

**Example:** An application has a route `/files/[filename].js` to display files. An attacker could request `/files/../../../../etc/passwd` if the `filename` parameter is not validated, potentially exposing sensitive system files.

**Impact:**  Exposure of sensitive files, potential for remote code execution if executable files are accessed.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement robust input validation and sanitization on all dynamic route parameters.
*   Use allow-lists instead of deny-lists for accepted file names or paths.
*   Avoid directly using user-provided input to construct file paths.
*   Consider using a dedicated file serving mechanism with restricted access.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Injection](./attack_surfaces/server-side_rendering__ssr__injection.md)

**Description:** Malicious code is injected into data used during server-side rendering, leading to its execution on the server.

**How Next.js Contributes:** Next.js's SSR capability renders components on the server. If data fetched or processed on the server is not properly sanitized before being used in the rendered output, it can lead to injection vulnerabilities.

**Example:** An API route fetches user comments and renders them on the server. If a comment contains `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` and is not sanitized, this script will execute on the server during rendering, potentially allowing access to server-side resources or environment variables.

**Impact:** Information disclosure, potential for remote code execution, server-side cross-site scripting (SS-XSS).

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Sanitize all user-provided data before using it in server-side rendering.
*   Use templating engines with built-in auto-escaping features.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate the impact of successful injections.
*   Regularly review server-side code for potential injection points.

## Attack Surface: [API Route Vulnerabilities](./attack_surfaces/api_route_vulnerabilities.md)

**Description:** Security flaws in the backend logic exposed through Next.js API routes.

**How Next.js Contributes:** Next.js simplifies the creation of backend APIs within the `pages/api` directory. This direct exposure of backend logic makes it a significant attack surface if not secured properly.

**Example:** An API route `/api/users` fetches user data based on a query parameter. If this parameter is not sanitized, it could be vulnerable to SQL injection (e.g., `/api/users?id=1 OR 1=1`).

**Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, data manipulation, denial of service.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Implement secure coding practices for all API routes.
*   Validate and sanitize all input data received by API routes.
*   Use parameterized queries or ORM/ODMs to prevent SQL injection.
*   Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.
*   Apply rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial of service.
*   Securely store and handle sensitive data.

## Attack Surface: [Middleware Security Issues](./attack_surfaces/middleware_security_issues.md)

**Description:** Vulnerabilities in the custom middleware logic that intercepts and modifies requests.

**How Next.js Contributes:** Next.js middleware allows developers to run code before a request is handled by routes. Flaws in middleware can bypass security checks or introduce new vulnerabilities.

**Example:** Middleware intended to block access based on IP address has a logic error, allowing blocked IPs to bypass the check. Or, middleware modifies request headers in a way that introduces a security vulnerability in subsequent handlers.

**Impact:** Bypass of security controls, unauthorized access, potential for request smuggling or other HTTP-related attacks.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Thoroughly test middleware logic for security vulnerabilities.
*   Ensure middleware correctly implements intended security policies.
*   Avoid complex logic in middleware if possible, keeping it focused on core tasks.
*   Regularly review and audit middleware code.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) via `next/image`](./attack_surfaces/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__via__nextimage_.md)

**Description:** Attackers can abuse the `next/image` component to make requests to internal or external resources that the server has access to.

**How Next.js Contributes:** The `next/image` component can be configured to fetch and optimize images from remote URLs. If user-provided URLs are not properly validated, attackers can force the server to make requests to arbitrary locations.

**Example:** An application allows users to provide a URL for a profile picture. An attacker provides a URL to an internal service (`http://localhost:8080/admin`) which the server then attempts to fetch, potentially exposing internal resources or performing actions on the attacker's behalf.

**Impact:** Access to internal resources, potential for data exfiltration, ability to perform actions on behalf of the server.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Strictly validate and sanitize image URLs provided to `next/image`.
*   Implement allow-lists for allowed image domains or protocols.
*   Consider using a dedicated image proxy service.
*   Disable remote image fetching if not required.

## Attack Surface: [Exposure of Sensitive Environment Variables](./attack_surfaces/exposure_of_sensitive_environment_variables.md)

**Description:** Accidental exposure of sensitive environment variables to the client-side.

**How Next.js Contributes:** While Next.js provides mechanisms to manage environment variables, improper configuration or usage can lead to their exposure in the browser's JavaScript bundle.

**Example:**  An API key is directly included in a component using `process.env.API_KEY` without proper prefixing (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_`). This key becomes accessible in the client-side JavaScript.

**Impact:** Exposure of API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive information, leading to potential account compromise or data breaches.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Only expose necessary environment variables to the client-side by prefixing them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
*   Store sensitive credentials securely using environment variables on the server and avoid exposing them directly to the client.
*   Use server-side API routes to handle sensitive operations that require these credentials.
