## Attack Tree Path: [Compromise Next.js Application](./attack_tree_paths/compromise_next_js_application.md)

The ultimate goal of the attacker, representing successful exploitation of one or more vulnerabilities.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Server-Side Rendering (SSR) Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_server-side_rendering__ssr__vulnerabilities.md)

A broad category encompassing vulnerabilities that arise due to server-side rendering of content and handling of data.

## Attack Tree Path: [SSRF via Data Fetching](./attack_tree_paths/ssrf_via_data_fetching.md)

**Identify SSR Data Fetching Points:** The attacker identifies locations in the Next.js application's server-side code where data is fetched from external or internal resources.
**Manipulate Data Fetching Parameters/URLs:** The attacker crafts malicious URLs or manipulates parameters used in data fetching requests to target unintended resources, potentially leading to information disclosure or further attacks.

## Attack Tree Path: [Insecure Deserialization in SSR Context](./attack_tree_paths/insecure_deserialization_in_ssr_context.md)

**Identify SSR Data Handling Deserialization:** The attacker identifies points in the server-side code where data from untrusted sources (e.g., cookies, external APIs) is deserialized.
**Inject Malicious Serialized Data:** The attacker crafts and injects malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Server Component Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/server_component_vulnerabilities.md)

**Identify Server Components Handling User Input:** The attacker identifies Server Components that directly process user-provided data.
**Exploit Vulnerabilities in Server Component Logic (e.g., injection):** The attacker exploits vulnerabilities within the Server Component's logic, such as SQL injection, command injection, or other injection flaws, to compromise the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [API Route Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/api_route_vulnerabilities.md)

A common attack surface in Next.js applications, targeting the serverless functions that handle backend logic.

## Attack Tree Path: [Data Injection (SQLi, NoSQLi, Command Injection)](./attack_tree_paths/data_injection__sqli__nosqli__command_injection_.md)

**Identify API Routes Accepting User Input:** The attacker identifies API routes that accept user-provided data as input.
**Inject Malicious Payloads:** The attacker crafts and injects malicious payloads into the input fields of API requests to execute arbitrary database queries (SQLi, NoSQLi) or system commands (Command Injection) on the server.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authentication Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authentication_bypass.md)

**Identify Authentication Mechanisms in API Routes:** The attacker analyzes how API routes authenticate users.
**Exploit Weaknesses in Authentication Logic:** The attacker exploits flaws in the authentication implementation (e.g., weak password policies, insecure token handling) to gain unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Authorization Bypass](./attack_tree_paths/authorization_bypass.md)

**Identify Authorization Checks in API Routes:** The attacker analyzes how API routes authorize access to resources.
