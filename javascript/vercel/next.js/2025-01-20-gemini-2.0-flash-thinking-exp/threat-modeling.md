# Threat Model Analysis for vercel/next.js

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Server-Rendered Content](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_server-rendered_content.md)

*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Server-Rendered Content
    *   **Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into user-provided data. When **Next.js** renders the page using `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, or custom server-side rendering logic, this script is included in the HTML sent to other users. Their browsers execute the script, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect users, or deface the website.
    *   **Impact:** Account takeover, data theft, website defacement, malware distribution.
    *   **Affected Component:** `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, custom server-side rendering logic within **Next.js** components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust input validation and output encoding on the server-side within **Next.js** data fetching and rendering functions.
        *   Utilize libraries like DOMPurify for sanitizing HTML within **Next.js** components before rendering.
        *   Employ Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources of executable scripts, configured within **Next.js** application.

## Threat: [Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in `getServerSideProps` or API Routes](./threats/server-side_request_forgery__ssrf__in__getserversideprops__or_api_routes.md)

*   **Threat:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in `getServerSideProps` or API Routes
    *   **Description:** An attacker manipulates user-controlled input used in **Next.js** `getServerSideProps` or API routes (within `pages/api`) to make the server send requests to unintended internal or external resources. This can be used to access internal services, read sensitive files, or launch attacks against other systems.
    *   **Impact:** Access to internal resources, data breaches, potential compromise of other systems.
    *   **Affected Component:** **Next.js** `getServerSideProps`, **Next.js** API Routes (`pages/api`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly validate and sanitize any user-provided data used in external API calls within **Next.js** data fetching and API route handlers.
        *   Implement allow-lists for allowed domains or IP addresses for outgoing requests made by **Next.js** server-side code.
        *   Avoid directly using user input to construct URLs for server-side requests within **Next.js** applications.
        *   Consider using a dedicated service or library for making external requests with built-in security features within **Next.js** backend logic.

## Threat: [Exposure of Sensitive Data in Server-Rendered HTML](./threats/exposure_of_sensitive_data_in_server-rendered_html.md)

*   **Threat:** Exposure of Sensitive Data in Server-Rendered HTML
    *   **Description:** Sensitive information, such as API keys, internal paths, or database credentials, is accidentally included in the HTML rendered by the **Next.js** server. This information becomes visible in the page source to anyone accessing the website.
    *   **Impact:** Compromise of credentials, access to internal systems, potential data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** `getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`, custom server-side rendering logic within **Next.js** components.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid directly embedding sensitive information in component props or server-side rendering logic within **Next.js** applications.
        *   Utilize environment variables and secure configuration management for sensitive data accessed by **Next.js**.
        *   Carefully review the data being passed to components during SSR in **Next.js**.

## Threat: [Insecure API Endpoints in `pages/api`](./threats/insecure_api_endpoints_in__pagesapi_.md)

*   **Threat:** Insecure API Endpoints in `pages/api`
    *   **Description:** API routes created within the **Next.js** `pages/api` directory lack proper security measures, allowing attackers to exploit common API vulnerabilities. This can include bypassing authentication, injecting malicious code, or performing unauthorized actions.
    *   **Impact:** Data breaches, unauthorized access, manipulation of data, denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** **Next.js** API Routes (`pages/api`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Implement robust authentication and authorization mechanisms for all API endpoints within **Next.js**.
        *   Validate and sanitize all user input received by **Next.js** API routes.
        *   Protect against common web application vulnerabilities like injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection if interacting with databases from **Next.js** API routes).
        *   Implement rate limiting within **Next.js** API routes to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.

## Threat: [Middleware Bypassing Security Measures](./threats/middleware_bypassing_security_measures.md)

*   **Threat:** Middleware Bypassing Security Measures
    *   **Description:** Incorrectly configured or implemented **Next.js** middleware can inadvertently bypass intended security measures, such as authentication or authorization checks, allowing unauthorized access to protected resources.
    *   **Impact:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.
    *   **Affected Component:** **Next.js** Middleware (`_middleware.js` or `middleware.ts`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Thoroughly test **Next.js** middleware to ensure it functions as intended and doesn't introduce vulnerabilities.
        *   Carefully consider the order of middleware execution in **Next.js** to avoid unintended bypasses.
        *   Ensure **Next.js** middleware correctly handles different request methods and paths.
