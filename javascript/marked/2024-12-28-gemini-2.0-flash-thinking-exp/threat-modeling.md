*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious Markdown
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within Markdown content. When `marked.js` parses this content, it renders the malicious script into HTML, which is then executed by the victim's browser. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as stealing cookies, redirecting to malicious sites, or defacing the webpage.
    *   **Impact:**  Critical. Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the user's session and potential data breaches.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core parsing logic, specifically the HTML rendering component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Utilize `marked.js`'s `sanitizer` option to strip potentially dangerous HTML tags and attributes.
        *   Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed.
        *   Regularly update `marked.js` to the latest version to benefit from security patches.
        *   Consider using a dedicated HTML sanitization library after `marked.js` processing for an additional layer of defense.

*   **Threat:** HTML Injection and Content Spoofing
    *   **Description:** An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML elements and attributes into Markdown content. While not directly executing scripts, this can be used to manipulate the visual presentation of the webpage, potentially misleading users, displaying fake content, or creating phishing opportunities.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. Can damage the website's reputation, trick users into providing sensitive information, or disrupt the user experience.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core parsing logic, specifically the HTML rendering component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Carefully review `marked.js`'s default HTML handling and ensure it aligns with security requirements.
        *   Use `marked.js`'s `sanitizer` option to remove unwanted HTML tags and attributes.
        *   Implement output encoding to prevent the browser from interpreting injected HTML as code.

*   **Threat:** Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)
    *   **Description:** `marked.js` relies on regular expressions for parsing Markdown. An attacker could craft specific input patterns that cause the regular expression engine to backtrack excessively, leading to a significant slowdown or complete freeze of the parsing process.
    *   **Impact:** Medium to High. Can lead to application slowdowns or denial of service.
    *   **Affected Component:** Specific regular expressions used within the parsing logic.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update `marked.js` as security patches often address ReDoS vulnerabilities.
        *   If possible, review the regular expressions used by `marked.js` for potential vulnerabilities (requires deep technical understanding of the library).
        *   Implement timeouts for the parsing process.

*   **Threat:** Bypass of Security Measures Relying on Markdown Parsing
    *   **Description:** If the application uses `marked.js` to sanitize or process user input before further actions (e.g., storing in a database), vulnerabilities in `marked.js` could allow attackers to bypass these security measures by crafting specific Markdown input that is not correctly sanitized or processed.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the bypassed security measure, can range from medium to critical.
    *   **Affected Component:** Core parsing logic, sanitization functions (if relied upon).
    *   **Risk Severity:** Medium to Critical (depending on the bypassed measure)
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Avoid relying solely on `marked.js` for critical security sanitization. Implement defense-in-depth strategies with multiple layers of validation and sanitization.
        *   Thoroughly test the application's security measures with various types of Markdown input, including potentially malicious ones.
