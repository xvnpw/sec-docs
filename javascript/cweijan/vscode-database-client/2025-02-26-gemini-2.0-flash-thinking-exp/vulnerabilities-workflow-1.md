### Combined Vulnerability List

#### 1. SQL Injection in `wrapQuote` Function

- **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in `wrapQuote` Function
- **Description:**
    1. The `wrapQuote` function in `/code/src/vue/result/mixin/util.js` is intended to sanitize string values for SQL queries by enclosing them in single quotes and escaping inner single quotes.
    2. However, the function only escapes single quotes (`'`) by replacing them with escaped single quotes (`\'`).
    3. It fails to escape other characters that can be leveraged for SQL injection, such as double quotes (`"`), backticks (`\``), semicolons (`;`), or other SQL control characters.
    4. If user-provided input, processed by `wrapQuote`, is used to construct dynamic SQL queries without further robust sanitization, it becomes susceptible to SQL injection attacks.
    5. An attacker can craft malicious input strings containing SQL injection payloads. When this input is processed by `wrapQuote` and incorporated into an SQL query, the attacker's SQL code can be executed by the database.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands against the database.
    - This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, modification or deletion of data, or even complete database compromise, depending on the database user's permissions.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None apparent. The `wrapQuote` function is present, but it provides incomplete sanitization and does not prevent SQL injection.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement parameterized queries or prepared statements to prevent SQL injection by design.
    - If parameterization is not feasible, employ a comprehensive SQL injection prevention library or implement robust input sanitization to escape or disallow all potentially harmful characters, not just single quotes. This should include characters like double quotes, backticks, semicolons, and other database-specific injection vectors.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must utilize the `wrapQuote` function to process user-provided input before incorporating it into dynamically generated SQL queries.
    - No other effective SQL injection prevention mechanisms, such as parameterization or prepared statements, are in place for these specific queries.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/vue/result/mixin/util.js`
    2. **Function:** `wrapQuote(type, value)`
    3. **Line of Vulnerability:** `if (typeof value == "string") { value = value.replace(/'/g, "\\'") }`
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: wrapQuote(type, value)
        Input: value (string, potentially user-controlled)
        |
        v
        Check if value is string -> YES
        |
        v
        Replace all single quotes in value with escaped single quotes: value.replace(/'/g, "\\'")
        |
        v
        Return value
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** The code only addresses single quotes. An attacker can use other SQL injection techniques that do not rely on single quotes but use other special characters not handled by this function.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Assume a feature in the application filters data based on user input used in a SQL WHERE clause, processed by `wrapQuote`.
    2. **Action:** As an external attacker, input the value: `test" OR 1=1 --`.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** The crafted input bypasses the intended filter logic because the double quote and `OR 1=1 --` are not escaped, leading to SQL injection. The query effectively becomes `SELECT ... WHERE column = 'test" OR 1=1 --'`.  The `OR 1=1 --` will always be true, and `--` comments out the rest of the intended query.
    4. **Verification:** Observe the application's response. If all data is returned instead of filtered results, it indicates SQL injection. Database logs might also show errors related to unexpected SQL syntax.

#### 2. FTP Command Injection Vulnerability

- **Vulnerability Name:** FTP Command Injection Vulnerability
- **Description:**
    1. The `connection.js` file in `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/connection.js` implements FTP client functionality.
    2. Functions like `cwd`, `delete`, `rename`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `list`, `get`, `put`, `append` within this file accept file paths as arguments.
    3. These file paths, potentially derived from user input or application logic, are directly embedded into FTP commands without adequate sanitization.
    4. An attacker can craft malicious file paths containing embedded FTP commands or command sequences due to the lack of input validation.
    5. For instance, in the `cwd` function, the path is directly concatenated into the `CWD` command: `this._send('CWD ' + path, ...)`
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary FTP commands on the FTP server.
    - This could lead to unauthorized file access, modification, deletion, or server-side information disclosure, depending on the FTP user's privileges.
    - In severe cases, if the FTP server or its environment is misconfigured, command injection could be exploited for broader server compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly constructs FTP commands by concatenating provided paths without any sanitization or validation to prevent command injection.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement robust sanitization and validation of file paths before incorporating them into FTP commands.
    - Restrict allowed characters in file paths to a safe subset, excluding characters like newline (`\r`, `\n`) and command separators.
    - Parameterized FTP command construction is less common, but consider if the FTP library supports any form of safer command building.
    - Implement input validation to ensure paths conform to expected formats and do not contain unexpected or malicious characters or sequences.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The application must utilize the FTP client functionality in `connection.js` to interact with an FTP server.
    - User-controlled input or data influenced by an attacker must be used to specify file paths for FTP operations.
    - The FTP server must be accessible to the attacker, or the attacker can influence the application to connect to a malicious FTP server.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/model/ftp/lib/connection.js`
    2. **Vulnerable Functions:** `cwd(path, cb, promote)`, `delete(path, cb)`, `rename(from, to, cb)`, `mkdir(path, recursive, cb)`, `rmdir(path, recursive, cb)`, `list(path, zcomp, cb)`, `get(path, zcomp, cb)`, `put(input, path, zcomp, cb)`, `append(input, path, zcomp, cb)`
    3. **Code Pattern (Example from `cwd`):** `FTP.prototype.cwd = function(path, cb, promote) { this._send('CWD ' + path, ...)`
    4. **Code Visualization (for `cwd`):**
        ```
        Function: cwd(path, cb, promote)
        Input: path (string, potentially user-influenced)
        |
        v
        Construct FTP command: 'CWD ' + path
        |
        v
        Send command using _send() method
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** The `path` argument is directly concatenated into the FTP command string without any sanitization. An attacker can inject FTP commands by providing a path like `"fileA\r\nDELE fileB"`.  If the FTP server processes multi-line commands, this can lead to execution of injected commands.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Set up a test FTP server and configure the application to connect to it. Ensure write access to a directory on the FTP server.
    2. **Action:** Use a feature in the application to specify an FTP directory (e.g., for file upload, listing). Provide a malicious path: `"test\r\nDELE important_file.txt"`.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** After a `CWD test` command, the injected `DELE important_file.txt` command will be executed by the FTP server, deleting "important_file.txt" in the current working directory on the server.
    4. **Verification:** Check FTP server logs for the `DELE important_file.txt` command. Verify if "important_file.txt" was deleted, confirming FTP command injection.

#### 3. Redis Command Injection in `openTerminal` function

- **Vulnerability Name:** Redis Command Injection in `openTerminal` function
- **Description:**
    1. The `openTerminal` function in `/code/src/model/redis/redisConnectionNode.ts` allows users to open a terminal to interact with a Redis server.
    2. The `exec` event handler within the webview terminal in `/code/src/model/redis/redisConnectionNode.ts` processes user input as commands.
    3. This input is split by spaces and directly passed to `client.send_command(command, splitCommand)` without sanitization or validation.
    4. An attacker can inject arbitrary Redis commands by crafting a malicious input string.
    5. When executed, these malicious commands are sent to and executed by the Redis server.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary Redis commands on the Redis server.
    - This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, deletion, or potentially server takeover, depending on Redis configuration and user permissions.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. User input is directly passed to `client.send_command` without any form of sanitization or validation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement a whitelist of allowed Redis commands executable via the terminal.
    - Sanitize user input to escape or remove harmful characters or command sequences before passing to `client.send_command`.
    - Consider a more secure terminal interaction method that avoids directly executing arbitrary user-provided commands.
- **Preconditions:**
    - The Redis terminal feature must be enabled and accessible in the application.
    - The attacker must be able to send commands through the terminal interface.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/model/redis/redisConnectionNode.ts`
    2. **Function:** `openTerminal()` and its event handler.
    3. **Code Pattern:**
        ```typescript
        handler.on("exec", async (content) => {
            if (!content) {
                return;
            }
            const splitCommand: string[] = content.replace(/ +/g, " ").split(' ')
            const command = splitCommand.shift()
            const reply = await client.send_command(command, splitCommand)
            handler.emit("result", reply)
        })
        ```
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Event Handler: "exec" (content)
        Input: content (string, user-provided Redis command)
        |
        v
        Split content by spaces: splitCommand
        |
        v
        Extract command name: command = splitCommand.shift()
        |
        v
        Execute Redis command: client.send_command(command, splitCommand)
        |
        v
        Emit result
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** User input `content` is directly processed and sent to the Redis server.  An attacker can inject any Redis command by providing a malicious `content` string.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Connect to a test Redis server using the application and open the Redis terminal.
    2. **Action:** In the terminal, enter: `CONFIG SET dir /tmp`. Press Enter. Then: `CONFIG SET dbfilename malicious.rdb`. Press Enter. Finally: `SAVE`. Press Enter.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** The Redis server will execute these commands. `CONFIG SET dir /tmp` changes the save directory to `/tmp`. `CONFIG SET dbfilename malicious.rdb` sets the filename. `SAVE` saves the database to `/tmp/malicious.rdb`.
    4. **Verification:** Check the terminal output for successful command execution. Verify if `malicious.rdb` is created in `/tmp` on the Redis server. Check Redis server logs if possible.

#### 4. SSH Remote Filename Path Traversal in Download Operation

- **Vulnerability Name:** SSH Remote Filename Path Traversal in Download Operation
- **Description:**
    1. The `downloadByPath` function in `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts` recursively downloads files/directories from an SSH server.
    2. Local file paths are constructed by concatenating the base download path with `child.label` (filename from the remote server).
    3. If a malicious/compromised SSH server returns filenames with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`), `child.label` can contain these sequences.
    4. Concatenating these malicious labels with the base download path can write files outside the intended download directory on the user's local system.
    5. An attacker controlling the SSH server can overwrite sensitive local files by providing malicious filenames.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the user's local file system during SSH download.
    - This can lead to local file overwrite, potentially including configuration files, executables, or sensitive data, enabling local privilege escalation or system compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The code directly uses `child.label` (remote filename) to construct local paths without sanitization against path traversal.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Sanitize `child.label` from the SSH server to remove/escape path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`, `..\\`).
    - Use secure path joining functions that prevent path traversal, ensuring downloaded files remain within the intended download directory.
    - Validate downloaded paths to ensure they stay within the expected base directory before local file writes.
- **Preconditions:**
    - User initiates a download from an SSH connection.
    - The SSH server is malicious/compromised and returns filenames with path traversal sequences.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`
    2. **Function:** `downloadByPath(path: string)`
    3. **Code Pattern:** `const childPath = path + "/" + child.label;`
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: downloadByPath(path: string)
        Input: path (local base download path)
        |
        v
        Get children (files/directories) from SSH server: childs
        |
        v
        For each child in childs:
            |
            v
            Construct local child path: childPath = path + "/" + child.label  // Vulnerability
            |
            v
            If child is FileNode: child.downloadByPath(childPath)
            Else if child is SSHConnectionNode:
                Create directory if not exists: mkdirSync(childPath)
                child.downloadByPath(childPath)
        ```
    5. **Explanation:**  `child.label` from the remote server is directly concatenated into the local path. Malicious `child.label` can cause path traversal.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Set up a malicious SSH server returning a file entry with filename `"../../../../../../tmp/evil.txt"`. Configure the application to connect. Local download directory: `/tmp/download_test`.
    2. **Action:** Browse to the malicious server's directory, initiate download to `/tmp/download_test`.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** File `evil.txt` will be created in `/tmp/` on the local machine due to path traversal.
    4. **Verification:** Check for `evil.txt` in `/tmp/` after download. Verify creation timestamp aligns with download time.

#### 5. SSH Remote Filename Path Traversal in Delete Operation

- **Vulnerability Name:** SSH Remote Filename Path Traversal in Delete Operation
- **Description:**
    1. The `delete` function in `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts` deletes directories on an SSH server using `sftp.rmdir(this.fullPath)`.
    2. `this.fullPath` is based on directory names from the SSH server. If a malicious server provides names with path traversal, `this.fullPath` can be manipulated.
    3. Malicious `this.fullPath` can cause `sftp.rmdir` to delete directories outside the intended target on the remote SSH server.
    4. An attacker controlling the SSH server can delete critical system directories by manipulating directory names.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can delete arbitrary directories on the remote SSH server.
    - This can lead to data loss, system instability, or denial of service on the remote server.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. `this.fullPath`, derived from potentially attacker-influenced directory names, is directly used in `sftp.rmdir` without sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Sanitize/validate directory names from the SSH server to remove/escape path traversal sequences before constructing `this.fullPath`.
    - Restrict delete operations to the intended directory and subdirectories, preventing traversal to parent/sibling directories.
    - Implement confirmation steps before directory deletion to prevent accidental/malicious actions.
- **Preconditions:**
    - User initiates a delete operation on a directory in the SSH file browser.
    - SSH server is malicious/compromised and returns directory names with path traversal sequences.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/model/ssh/sshConnectionNode.ts`
    2. **Function:** `delete()`
    3. **Code Pattern:** `sftp.rmdir(this.fullPath, (err) => { ... })`
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: delete()
        |
        v
        Show confirmation dialog: Util.confirm(...)
        |
        v (on confirmation)
        Get SFTP client: ClientManager.getSSH(...)
        |
        v
        Delete remote directory: sftp.rmdir(this.fullPath, ...) // Vulnerability
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `this.fullPath`, constructed using remote directory names, is directly used in `sftp.rmdir`. Malicious directory names from the server can cause path traversal during deletion.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Malicious SSH server returning directory entry `"../../../../../../tmp/evil_dir"`. Configure application to connect. Create `/tmp/important_dir` on SSH server.
    2. **Action:** Browse to malicious server's directory, select `"../../../../../../tmp/evil_dir"`, initiate delete.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** `sftp.rmdir` will resolve path traversal and attempt to delete `/tmp/important_dir` on the SSH server.
    4. **Verification:** Connect to SSH server externally. Check if `/tmp/important_dir` is deleted. If yes, path traversal in delete is confirmed.

#### 6. SSH Remote Filename Path Traversal in File Download Operation (FileNode)

- **Vulnerability Name:** SSH Remote Filename Path Traversal in File Download Operation (FileNode)
- **Description:**
    1. `downloadByPath` in `/code/src/model/ssh/fileNode.ts` downloads a single file from SSH using `sftp.createReadStream(this.fullPath)`.
    2. `this.fullPath` is constructed as `this.parentName + this.file.filename;`, where `this.file.filename` is from the remote SSH server.
    3. If a malicious server returns filenames with path traversal (e.g., `../`), `this.file.filename` can contain these.
    4. `sftp.createReadStream(this.fullPath)` with malicious `this.fullPath` can read files outside the intended directory on the remote SSH server.
    5. An attacker controlling the SSH server can expose sensitive server files by crafting malicious filenames.
- **Impact:**
    - Attacker can cause the application user to read arbitrary files on the remote SSH server.
    - This leads to unauthorized information disclosure of sensitive data from the remote server.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. `this.fullPath`, derived from potentially attacker-influenced filenames, is directly used in `sftp.createReadStream` without sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Sanitize/validate filenames from the SSH server to remove/escape path traversal sequences before constructing `this.fullPath`.
    - Restrict file access in download to the intended directory and subdirectories, preventing traversal to parent/sibling directories.
- **Preconditions:**
    - User initiates a file download from the SSH file browser.
    - SSH server is malicious/compromised and returns filenames with path traversal sequences.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/model/ssh/fileNode.ts`
    2. **Function:** `downloadByPath(path: string, showDialog?: boolean)`
    3. **Code Pattern:** `const fileReadStream = sftp.createReadStream(this.fullPath)`
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: downloadByPath(path:string,showDialog?:boolean)
        |
        v
        Get SFTP client: ClientManager.getSSH(...)
        |
        v
        Create read stream for remote file: sftp.createReadStream(this.fullPath) // Vulnerability
        |
        v
        Create write stream for local file: createWriteStream(path)
        |
        v
        Pipe streams: fileReadStream.pipe(str).pipe(outStream);
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `this.fullPath`, constructed using remote filenames, is directly used in `sftp.createReadStream`. Malicious filenames from the server can cause path traversal during file reading.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Malicious SSH server returning file entry `"../../../../../../etc/passwd"`. Configure application to connect.
    2. **Action:** Browse to malicious server's directory, select `"../../../../../../etc/passwd"`, initiate download.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** `/etc/passwd` content will be downloaded to the user's machine, potentially overwriting a local file named `passwd`.
    4. **Verification:** Check downloaded file content. If it matches `/etc/passwd`, remote path traversal in file download is confirmed. Check SSH server logs for `/etc/passwd` access attempts.

#### 7. OS Command Injection in Import Functionality

- **Vulnerability Name:** OS Command Injection in Import Functionality
- **Description:**
    1. Import services (`MongoImportService`, `MysqlImportService`, `PostgresqlImortService`, `SqlServerImportService`) use `child_process.exec` to execute command-line database tools.
    2. Commands are constructed by string concatenation, including `importPath` (SQL import file path).
    3. If `importPath` is not validated, an attacker can inject OS commands by crafting a malicious file path.
    4. For example, `mongoimport ... ${importPath}`. Malicious `importPath` like `"file.json; touch /tmp/evil"` can execute `touch /tmp/evil` after `mongoimport`.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the application's machine.
    - This can lead to complete system compromise, including unauthorized data access, modification, malware installation, or denial of service.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. `importPath` is directly used in `exec` without sanitization. `commandExistsSync` only checks for base commands (e.g., `mongoimport`), not command safety.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Robust sanitization/validation of `importPath` before `exec`.
    - Treat `importPath` strictly as a file path, not a command string.
    - Use parameterized command execution or safer alternatives to `exec`. Avoid `exec` for file operations if possible.
    - Restrict allowed characters in `importPath` to a safe subset.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Import functionality enabled and accessible.
    - Attacker can provide or influence the `importPath` argument.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **Files:** `/code/src/service/import/mongoImportService.ts`, `/code/src/service/import/mysqlImportService.ts`, `/code/src/service/import/postgresqlImortService.ts`
    2. **Function:** `importSql(importPath: string, node: Node)` in each file.
    3. **Code Pattern (Example from `MongoImportService`):** `exec(command, (err,stdout,stderr) => { ... })`, where `command` is `mongoimport ... ${importPath}`
    4. **Code Visualization (for `MongoImportService`):**
        ```
        Function: importSql(importPath: string, node: Node)
        Input: importPath (string, user-controlled file path)
        |
        v
        Construct command string: command = `mongoimport ... ${importPath}` // Vulnerability
        |
        v
        Execute command: exec(command, ...)
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `importPath` is directly concatenated into the command string for `exec`. Malicious `importPath` can inject OS commands.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Monitor command execution (e.g., using `auditd` or `strace` on Linux).
    2. **Action:** Initiate import for any DB type. Provide malicious `importPath`: `"test.json; touch /tmp/pwned"`.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** `exec` will execute `mongoimport` and `touch /tmp/pwned`. File `pwned` will be created in `/tmp/`.
    4. **Verification:** Check for `/tmp/pwned` after import. Verify command execution logs to confirm `touch /tmp/pwned` execution.

#### 8. OS Command Injection in Dump Functionality

- **Vulnerability Name:** OS Command Injection in Dump Functionality
- **Description:**
    1. `MysqlDumpService` uses `child_process.exec` to execute `mysqldump` for database backups.
    2. Command construction uses string concatenation, including `folderPath.fsPath` (output file path from "save file" dialog).
    3. If `folderPath.fsPath` is not sanitized, an attacker can inject OS commands.
    4. For example, `mysqldump ... > ${folderPath.fsPath}`. Malicious `folderPath.fsPath` like `/tmp/backup.sql; touch /tmp/evil_dump` can execute `touch /tmp/evil_dump` after `mysqldump`.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands on the application's machine.
    - This can lead to system compromise, similar to OS Command Injection in Import Functionality.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. `folderPath.fsPath` and `node.password` are directly used in `exec` without sanitization. `commandExistsSync` is insufficient.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Robust sanitization/validation of `folderPath.fsPath` and other user-influenced parameters before `exec`.
    - Treat `folderPath.fsPath` strictly as a file path.
    - Use parameterized command execution or safer alternatives.
    - Sanitize/securely handle passwords instead of embedding them in command strings.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Dump functionality enabled and accessible.
    - Attacker can initiate dump and influence output file path.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/service/dump/mysqlDumpService.ts`
    2. **Function:** `dump(node: Node, withData: boolean)`
    3. **Code Pattern:** `Util.execute(command).then(() => { ... }).catch(err => Console.log(err.message))`, where `command` is `mysqldump ... >${folderPath.fsPath}`
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: dump(node: Node, withData: boolean)
        Input: folderPath.fsPath (user-controlled save file path)
        |
        v
        Construct command string: command = `mysqldump ... >${folderPath.fsPath}` // Vulnerability
        |
        v
        Execute command: Util.execute(command)
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `folderPath.fsPath`, user-controlled via the save dialog, is directly used in the command string for `exec`. Malicious file paths can inject OS commands.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Monitor command execution.
    2. **Action:** Initiate database dump. Provide malicious `folderPath.fsPath`: `/tmp/backup.sql; touch /tmp/dump_pwned`.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** `exec` will execute `mysqldump` and `touch /tmp/dump_pwned`. File `dump_pwned` will be created in `/tmp/`.
    4. **Verification:** Check for `/tmp/dump_pwned` after dump. Verify command execution logs to confirm `touch /tmp/dump_pwned` execution.

#### 9. SSH Tunnel Command Injection via Native SSH Client

- **Vulnerability Name:** SSH Tunnel Command Injection via Native SSH Client
- **Description:**
    1. `SSHTunnelService` in `/code/src/service/tunnel/sshTunnelService.ts` uses native SSH client (`spawn('ssh', args)`) when `ssh.type` is 'native'.
    2. SSH command arguments are constructed in `createTunnel`, including `ssh.privateKeyPath` from SSH config.
    3. If `sshConfig` or `ssh.privateKeyPath` are attacker-influenced, SSH options or commands can be injected.
    4. Malicious `ssh.privateKeyPath` like `"-o ProxyCommand="evil_command""` can lead to command execution.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands when an SSH tunnel using the native client is established.
    - This can result in system compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. Command arguments for `spawn('ssh', args)` are constructed from SSH config without sanitization.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Strict validation/sanitization of SSH config parameters, especially `ssh.privateKeyPath`.
    - Treat `ssh.privateKeyPath` strictly as a file path, not a command option.
    - Avoid string concatenation for shell commands. Use safer command execution APIs with proper argument handling.
    - Limit allowed characters in SSH config parameters.
- **Preconditions:**
    - SSH tunnel feature with 'native' SSH type enabled.
    - Attacker can influence SSH config, particularly `ssh.privateKeyPath`.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/service/tunnel/sshTunnelService.ts`
    2. **Function:** `createTunnel(node: Node, errorCallback: (error) => void)`
    3. **Code Pattern:** `const bat = spawn('ssh', args);`, where `args` includes `ssh.privateKeyPath`.
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: createTunnel(node: Node, errorCallback: (error) => void)
        Input: sshConfig (potentially attacker-influenced, especially ssh.privateKeyPath)
        |
        v
        Construct args array for spawn('ssh', args): args.push('-i', ssh.privateKeyPath) // Vulnerability
        |
        v
        Spawn SSH process: spawn('ssh', args);
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `ssh.privateKeyPath` from SSH config is directly added to `spawn` arguments. Attacker-controlled `ssh.privateKeyPath` can inject malicious SSH options/commands.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Create malicious file path `"-oProxyCommand=touch /tmp/ssh_pwned"`.
    2. **Action:** Configure SSH connection with 'native' type. Set 'Private Key Path' to the malicious file path. Attempt to establish SSH tunnel.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** `spawn('ssh', args)` will interpret malicious path as option, executing `touch /tmp/ssh_pwned`. File `ssh_pwned` will be created in `/tmp/`.
    4. **Verification:** Check for `/tmp/ssh_pwned` after tunnel attempt. Verify command execution logs.

#### 10. Local File Inclusion via Import Path Traversal

- **Vulnerability Name:** Local File Inclusion via Import Path Traversal
- **Description:**
    1. Import services read file content using `readFileSync(importPath, 'utf8')`.
    2. If `importPath` is not validated and allows path traversal (e.g., `../`), an attacker can read arbitrary local files.
    3. While intended for SQL/JSON files, lack of validation allows reading sensitive configuration, source code, etc.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can read arbitrary local files from the server's file system.
    - This can disclose sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, source code, potentially leading to further compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. `importPath` is directly used in `readFileSync` without sanitization against path traversal.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Robust validation/sanitization of `importPath` to prevent path traversal.
    - Ensure `importPath` is within the intended import directory.
    - Use secure path handling functions to resolve paths relative to a safe base directory and prevent traversal outside.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Import functionality enabled and accessible.
    - Attacker can specify or influence the `importPath` argument.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/service/import/importService.ts`
    2. **Function:** `importSql(importPath: string, node: Node)`
    3. **Code Pattern:** `let sql = readFileSync(importPath, 'utf8')`
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: importSql(importPath: string, node: Node)
        Input: importPath (string, user-controlled file path)
        |
        v
        Read file content: let sql = readFileSync(importPath, 'utf8') // Vulnerability
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `readFileSync(importPath, 'utf8')` directly uses user-provided `importPath`. Path traversal in `importPath` allows reading files outside the intended directory.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Prepare sensitive file `/tmp/sensitive.conf` on the server.
    2. **Action:** Initiate import. Provide `importPath`: `"../../../../../../tmp/sensitive.conf"`.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** Application will read and attempt to process `/tmp/sensitive.conf`. Content might be in logs or cause errors.
    4. **Verification:** Check application logs/behavior for `/tmp/sensitive.conf` content or errors indicating access. Create a unique marker in `sensitive.conf` and search for it in application output.

#### 11. Zip Slip Vulnerability during File Import (Hypothetical)

- **Vulnerability Name:** Zip Slip Vulnerability during File Import (Hypothetical)
- **Description:**
    1. If import functionality handles ZIP archives, unsafe extraction without path validation can lead to Zip Slip.
    2. Malicious ZIP archives can contain entries with path traversal filenames (e.g., `../../evil.sh`).
    3. Unsafe extraction can write these files outside the intended extraction directory, potentially overwriting system files.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can write files to arbitrary locations on the server's file system during file import.
    - This can lead to local file overwrite, potentially enabling local privilege escalation or system compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High (if applicable)
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Not applicable to provided code as ZIP extraction is not seen in import services code. This is a potential future risk.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - If ZIP extraction is implemented, robust validation of file paths extracted from archives is crucial.
    - Validate target paths to ensure they remain within the intended extraction directory.
    - Use secure ZIP extraction libraries with built-in path validation or tools for effective validation.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Application has file import feature handling ZIP archives.
    - Attacker can upload/provide a malicious ZIP archive.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    - Not applicable to provided code. Proactive consideration for future ZIP handling.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** (If ZIP import exists) Create malicious ZIP with `../../evil.sh` entry and harmful content.
    2. **Action:** Initiate ZIP file import and upload the malicious ZIP.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** `evil.sh` will be written outside the intended import directory, based on path traversal.
    4. **Verification:** Check for `evil.sh` in unintended locations (e.g., parent directories of the intended extraction directory).

#### 12. OS Command Injection in `Node.openTerminal()`

- **Vulnerability Name:** OS Command Injection in `Node.openTerminal()`
- **Description:**
    1. `openTerminal()` in `/code/src/model/interface/node.ts` constructs shell commands to open terminals for databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, SQLite).
    2. For MySQL/PostgreSQL, password is directly included in the command string, e.g., `mysql -u ... -p${this.password} ...` and `PGPASSWORD=${this.password} && psql ...`.
    3. If `this.password` contains shell-sensitive characters and is not escaped/quoted, it can lead to OS command injection.
    4. Attacker controlling the database password can inject OS commands executed when a user opens a terminal.
- **Impact:**
    - An attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands when a user opens a database terminal with a malicious password.
    - This can lead to complete system compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. Password is directly embedded in command string without sanitization or quoting.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Properly quote/escape password when constructing shell commands. Use single quotes in bash, appropriate quoting for Windows cmd.
    - Use more secure password passing methods: password prompts, temporary files, avoid embedding in command strings.
- **Preconditions:**
    - "Open Terminal" feature enabled.
    - Attacker can influence/control database password.
    - User attempts to open terminal for connection with malicious password.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/model/interface/node.ts`
    2. **Function:** `openTerminal()`
    3. **Code Pattern (MySQL):** `command = \`mysql -u ${this.user} -p${this.password} ...\``, **(PostgreSQL):** `command = \`${prefix} "PGPASSWORD=${this.password}" && psql ...\``
    4. **Code Visualization (MySQL):**
        ```
        Function: openTerminal()
        Input: this.password (database password, potentially attacker-influenced)
        |
        v
        Construct command string: command = `mysql -u ... -p${this.password} ...` // Vulnerability
        |
        v
        Execute command via terminal API
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `${this.password}` is directly embedded in the command string for MySQL and used as an environment variable in PostgreSQL. Malicious passwords can inject OS commands.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Configure MySQL/PostgreSQL connection. Set password to malicious string with backticks (e.g., `` `touch /tmp/terminal_pwned` `` for MySQL) or command separators (e.g., `; touch /tmp/terminal_pwned` for PostgreSQL).
    2. **Action:** Select connection, "Open Terminal".
    3. **Expected Outcome:** Injected command `touch /tmp/terminal_pwned` will be executed before database client launch. File `terminal_pwned` will be created in `/tmp/`.
    4. **Verification:** Check for `/tmp/terminal_pwned` after terminal attempt. Verify command execution logs.

#### 13. SQL Injection in Data Dump Query Construction

- **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in Data Dump Query Construction
- **Description:**
    1. `getDataDump` in `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getDataDump.ts` constructs SELECT queries by concatenating user-supplied table names and WHERE clauses without sanitization.
    2. Attacker controlling dump config (table names, WHERE conditions via UI) can inject malicious SQL.
    3. For example, malicious table name: `users; DROP TABLE sensitive_data;--`.
    4. `getDataDump` builds query: `SELECT * FROM ${table}${where}`. Injected SQL commands are executed via `connection.query()`.
- **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized modification, deletion, or exfiltration of database contents.
    - Data integrity compromise, destructive actions (e.g., DROP TABLE).
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. No validation/sanitization of dump config parameters. No parameterized queries or escaping.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Strict validation/sanitization for user-supplied dump parameters. Whitelist allowed table names, validate WHERE clause syntax.
    - Use parameterized queries or properly escape SQL identifiers/literals when constructing queries.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker can modify dump settings (tables, WHERE conditions via UI).
    - Data dump operation (`getDataDump`) is triggered.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getDataDump.ts`
    2. **Function:** `getDataDump(node: Node, options: DumpOptions)`
    3. **Code Pattern:** `const query = connection.query(\`SELECT * FROM ${table}${where}\`);`
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: getDataDump(node: Node, options: DumpOptions)
        Input: options.dump.tables (user-controlled table names), options.where[table] (user-controlled WHERE clauses)
        |
        v
        Construct SQL query: query = connection.query(\`SELECT * FROM ${table}${where}\`); // Vulnerability
        |
        v
        Execute query: connection.query(query);
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `table` and `where` variables from user-supplied dump configuration are directly concatenated into the query string. This allows SQL injection.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Open dump config settings in the extension.
    2. **Action:** Set dump table parameter to malicious value: `users; DROP TABLE sensitive_data;--` or inject SQL in WHERE clause.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** Injected SQL commands will be executed on the database (e.g., `sensitive_data` table dropped).
    4. **Verification:** Confirm unauthorized SQL commands execution on the database (e.g., check if `sensitive_data` table is dropped).

#### 14. SQL Injection in Table Dump File Generation

- **Vulnerability Name:** SQL Injection in Table Dump File Generation
- **Description:**
    1. `getTableDump` in `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getTableDump.ts` generates DDL statements for schema exports, embedding user-supplied table names without sanitization.
    2. For example, `schema.replace(/^CREATE TABLE/, \`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ${table};\nCREATE TABLE\`);`.
    3. Malicious table names (via dump config) can inject SQL into the generated dump file.
    4. Malicious table name example: `users; DROP DATABASE important_db;--`.
    5. Dump file will contain: `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users; DROP DATABASE important_db;--; CREATE TABLE ...`. Importing this file executes injected commands.
- **Impact:**
    - Execution of unintended SQL commands upon dump file import.
    - Data loss (e.g., dropping databases), unauthorized schema modifications, broad data compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. No input validation/sanitization of table names before embedding in DDL commands. Assumes configured table names are safe.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Validate/sanitize table names from dump config before using in DDL statements.
    - Whitelisting or parameterized construction for DDL commands to ensure only valid table names are used.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker can modify dump config parameters (table names for export via UI).
    - Table dump operation (`getTableDump`) is initiated.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getTableDump.ts`
    2. **Function:** `getTableDump(node: Node, options: DumpOptions)`
    3. **Code Pattern:** `schema = schema.replace(/^CREATE TABLE/, \`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ${table};\nCREATE TABLE\`);`
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: getTableDump(node: Node, options: DumpOptions)
        Input: options.dump.tables (user-controlled table names)
        |
        v
        For each table in tables:
            |
            v
            Get table schema: schema = await node.getByRegion<TableNode>(table).showSource(false);
            |
            v
            Modify schema: schema = schema.replace(/^CREATE TABLE/, \`DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ${table};\nCREATE TABLE\`); // Vulnerability
            |
            v
            Return modified schema
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `table` variable from user-supplied dump configuration is directly embedded in DDL commands without sanitization. This allows SQL injection into dump files.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Access dump config interface in extension.
    2. **Action:** Set table name in dump settings to malicious value: `users; DROP DATABASE important_db;--`.
    3. **Expected Outcome:** Generated dump file will contain injected SQL commands.
    4. **Verification:** Inspect generated dump file to verify injected SQL. Optionally, import dump file in a test environment to confirm malicious SQL execution (e.g., dropping a test database).

#### 15. Unrestricted Port Forwarding via SSH Tunnel

- **Vulnerability Name:** Unrestricted Port Forwarding via SSH Tunnel
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker can configure SSH connections with arbitrary "Destination Host" and "Destination Port" in the "Forward" settings.
    2. The extension establishes an SSH tunnel and forwards traffic from a local port to the attacker-specified destination.
    3. By connecting to the local port, the attacker can access services on the attacker-specified host/port, even if they are not publicly accessible or behind firewalls.
    4. This turns the extension into an open proxy or gateway to internal networks.
- **Impact:**
    - Unauthorized access to internal network resources and services.
    - Bypassing network firewalls, accessing non-public services.
    - Potential data breaches, unauthorized control of internal systems, and further attacks within the network.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. The extension allows specifying arbitrary destination hosts and ports for SSH forwarding without validation or restrictions.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization for "Destination Host" and "Destination Port".
    - Whitelist or blacklist for allowed destination hosts. Ideally, restrict to database server-related hosts.
    - User warnings about security implications of port forwarding, especially to non-database ports or external hosts.
    - Principle of least privilege: Limit port forwarding to necessary database management functionality, not arbitrary port forwarding.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Public access to the VS Code Database Client extension.
    - SSH tunnel feature enabled.
    - Attacker can configure new SSH connections.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js`
    2. **Function:** `bindSSHConnection(config, netConnection)` and inner `forward` function.
    3. **Code Pattern:** `sshConnection.forwardOut(config.srcHost, config.srcPort, config.dstHost, config.dstPort, function (err, sshStream) { ... })`
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: forward(sshConnection, netConnection)
        Input: config (SSH forward configuration, including config.dstHost, config.dstPort - user-controlled destination)
        |
        v
        Establish SSH port forwarding: sshConnection.forwardOut(config.srcHost, config.srcPort, config.dstHost, config.dstPort, ...) // Vulnerability
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `config.dstHost` and `config.dstPort` (destination host/port) from user configuration are directly used in `forwardOut` without validation, allowing unrestricted port forwarding.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Install VS Code Database Client extension. SSH server (`ssh_server_ip`). Attacker HTTP server (`attacker_ip:8080`).
    2. **Configuration:** Create SSH connection to `ssh_server_ip`. Add forward entry: Local Port `9999`, Destination Host `attacker_ip`, Destination Port `8080`.
    3. **Action:** Connect to SSH server. Access `http://localhost:9999` in browser.
    4. **Verification:** HTTP server on `attacker_ip:8080` is accessible through `http://localhost:9999`, confirming unrestricted port forwarding.

#### 16. Local File System Path Traversal in SSH File Download

- **Vulnerability Name:** Local File System Path Traversal in SSH File Download
- **Description:**
    1. An attacker with SSH connection access can initiate file downloads.
    2. When prompted for a local save path, the attacker provides a malicious path with path traversal (e.g., `../../../sensitive_dir/malicious_file.exe`) or an absolute path (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    3. The extension uses the provided path directly to save the downloaded file without validation.
    4. This allows writing files to arbitrary local paths, potentially overwriting sensitive files.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary File Write. Writing files to any location on the local file system where the extension runs.
    - Local privilege escalation, client-side code execution, data exfiltration.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. User-provided download path is directly used without sanitization or validation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Input validation and sanitization of the download path to prevent path traversal and absolute paths.
    - Restrict download paths to a safe workspace or download directory.
    - Path canonicalization to verify path is within allowed directory.
    - User warnings about download security and safe locations.

    - Attacker can initiate download and provide a malicious save path.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/model/ssh/fileNode.ts`
    2. **Function:** `downloadByPath(path:string,showDialog?:boolean)` and `download()`
    3. **Code Pattern:** `const outStream = createWriteStream(path);` where `path` comes from user input via `vscode.window.showSaveDialog`.
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: downloadByPath(path:string,showDialog?:boolean)
        Input: path (local save path, user-controlled via showSaveDialog)
        |
        v
        Create write stream: const outStream = createWriteStream(path); // Vulnerability
        |
        v
        Pipe remote file stream to local write stream: fileReadStream.pipe(str).pipe(outStream);
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** `path` from user input via `showSaveDialog` is directly passed to `createWriteStream` without validation, enabling path traversal.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Install VS Code Database Client extension. SSH connection to test server. File on SSH server to download.
    2. **Configuration:** Open Database Explorer, SSH connection, browse to file.

#### 17. Local File System Path Traversal in FTP File Download

- **Vulnerability Name:** Local File System Path Traversal in FTP File Download
- **Description:**
    - Similar to SSH File Download Path Traversal, but for FTP file downloads.
    - Attacker with FTP connection access provides a malicious local save path with path traversal or absolute path during download.
    - The extension uses this path directly, leading to arbitrary file write.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary File Write. Same impact as SSH File Download Path Traversal.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. User-provided download path is directly used without sanitization or validation.

    - Same mitigations as SSH File Download Path Traversal.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Access to a configured FTP connection.
    - FTP file explorer and download feature enabled.
    - Attacker can initiate download and provide a malicious save path.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/model/ftp/ftpFileNode.ts`
    2. **Function:** `download()`
    3. **Code Pattern:** `const outStream = createWriteStream(uri.fsPath);` where `uri.fsPath` comes from user input via `vscode.window.showSaveDialog`.
    4. **Code Visualization:** (Same as SSH File Download Path Traversal, just different file and function)
    5. **Explanation:** Same as SSH File Download Path Traversal, but for FTP download. `uri.fsPath` from user input is directly passed to `createWriteStream` without validation.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Install VS Code Database Client extension. FTP connection to test server. File on FTP server to download.
    2. **Configuration:** Open Database Explorer, FTP connection, browse to file.
    3. **Action:** Right-click file, "Download". In "Save As" dialog, enter malicious path: `../../../Desktop/downloaded_file.txt` or `/tmp/evil.txt`. "Save".
    4. **Verification:** Check if file is downloaded to malicious path (e.g., Desktop, `/tmp/evil.txt`), confirming path traversal/arbitrary file write.

#### 18. Local File System Path Traversal in Export Functionality

- **Vulnerability Name:** Local File System Path Traversal in Export Functionality
- **Description:**
    - Similar to SSH/FTP File Download Path Traversal, but for database query export functionality.
    - Attacker initiates export and provides a malicious local save path with path traversal or absolute path.
    - The extension uses this path directly, leading to arbitrary file write.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary File Write. Same impact as SSH/FTP File Download Path Traversal.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - None. User-provided export path is likely directly used without sanitization or validation.
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Same mitigations as SSH/FTP File Download Path Traversal.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Public access to the VS Code Database Client extension.
    - Query execution and export functionality enabled.
    - Attacker can execute query, trigger export, and provide malicious save path.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/service/result/query.ts`
    2. **Function:** `send` method, 'export' event handler, calling `this.exportService.export(...)`.
    3. **Code Pattern:** (Likely in `ExportService.export` or similar function) `createWriteStream(exportPath)` where `exportPath` is derived from user input via `vscode.window.showSaveDialog`.
    4. **Code Visualization:** (Similar to SSH/FTP File Download Path Traversal in principle)
    5. **Explanation:** Likely that `ExportService.export` or a similar function uses user-provided export path from `showSaveDialog` directly in `createWriteStream` without validation.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Install VS Code Database Client extension. Database connection, execute query with results.
    2. **Configuration:** Open query result view.
    3. **Action:** Trigger export. In "Save As" dialog, enter malicious path: `../../../Desktop/exported_data.csv` or `/tmp/evil_exported.csv`. "Save".
    4. **Verification:** Check if exported data is written to malicious path (e.g., Desktop, `/tmp/evil_exported.csv`), confirming path traversal/arbitrary file write in export.

#### 19. OS Command Injection in Database Terminal Command Execution

- **Vulnerability Name:** OS Command Injection in Database Terminal Command Execution
- **Description:**
    1. Opening an external database terminal interpolates unsanitized connection parameters (username, password, host, port, etc.) into a shell command string.
    2. This command string is passed to VS Code’s terminal API via `terminal.sendText()`.
    3. Attacker supplying/modifying connection config (via UI) can embed shell metacharacters in fields like username.
    4. Example username: `attacker; echo INJECTION_SUCCESS > /tmp/injected`.
    5. Crafted command (e.g., `mysql -u attacker; echo INJECTION_SUCCESS > /tmp/injected ...`) allows shell to execute injected command.
- **Impact:**
    - Arbitrary command execution on the host system where the extension runs.
    - File manipulation, data exfiltration, malware installation, system compromise.
- **Vulnerability Rank:** High
- **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Command existence check (e.g., `commandExistsSync`).
    - **No validation or sanitization of interpolated connection parameters.**
- **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Sanitize and validate every connection parameter to remove/escape shell metacharacters.
    - Use process-spawning APIs with argument arrays (e.g., `child_process.spawn` with argument list) to avoid shell interpretation.
- **Preconditions:**
    - Attacker can supply/modify connection config values via extension's UI.
    - "Open Terminal" command is invoked.
- **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. **File:** `/code/src/model/interface/node.ts` (or base node for DB connections)
    2. **Function:** `openTerminal()`
    3. **Code Pattern:** Command string construction by concatenating `this.user`, `this.password`, `this.host`, `this.port` without sanitization before `terminal.sendText(command)`.
    4. **Code Visualization:**
        ```
        Function: openTerminal()
        Input: this.user, this.password, this.host, this.port (connection parameters, potentially attacker-influenced)
        |
        v
        Construct command string by concatenation: command = `mysql -u ${this.user} -p${this.password} -h ${this.host} -P ${this.port} ...` // Vulnerability
        |
        v
        Send command to terminal API: terminal.sendText(command)
        ```
    5. **Explanation:** Unsanitized connection parameters are directly interpolated into the shell command string. Malicious parameters can inject OS commands.
- **Security Test Case:**
    1. **Setup:** Open connection config UI for MySQL.
    2. **Action:** Set username to `attacker; echo INJECTION_SUCCESS > /tmp/injected`. Save config. Invoke "Open Terminal".
    3. **Verification:** Check if `/tmp/injected` is created, confirming injected command execution.
