- **Command Injection in Database Terminal Command Execution**
  - **Description:**
    The method that opens an external database terminal (for example, when switching to a MySQL terminal) directly interpolates unsanitized connection parameters (such as username, password, host, port, etc.) into a shell command string. When this command string is passed to VS Code’s terminal API via functions like `terminal.sendText()`, an attacker who can supply or modify the connection configuration (via the extension’s UI) can embed shell metacharacters. For example, by setting a field (say, username) to:
    ```
    attacker; echo INJECTION_SUCCESS > /tmp/injected
    ```
    the crafted command (e.g.,
    ```
    mysql -u attacker; echo INJECTION_SUCCESS > /tmp/injected -p[somePassword] -h [host] -P [port]
    ```
    ) lets the underlying shell interpret the semicolon as a command separator and execute the injected command.

  - **Impact:**
    An attacker may achieve arbitrary command execution on the host system where the extension runs. This might lead to file manipulation, data exfiltration, installation of malicious software, and eventual system compromise.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The code verifies that the external command–line tools exist (using a helper such as `checkCommand()` or functions like `commandExistsSync`).
    - **However, no validation or sanitization is performed on any of the interpolated connection parameters.**

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Sanitize and validate every connection parameter to remove or escape shell metacharacters.
    - Use process–spawning APIs that allow passing arguments as an array rather than as a concatenated string (for example, using `child_process.spawn` with an argument list) to avoid shell interpretation.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to supply or modify connection configuration values through the extension’s publicly accessible configuration interface.
    - The “Open Terminal” command must be invoked so that the unsanitized command is passed to the underlying shell.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/src/model/interface/node.ts` (or the equivalent base node for database connections), the code constructs a command string by concatenating values like `this.user`, `this.password`, `this.host`, and `this.port` without any sanitization before calling `terminal.sendText(command)`.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open the extension’s connection configuration UI for a supported database (e.g. MySQL).
    2. In one of the connection fields (for example, the username), enter a malicious payload such as:
       ```
       attacker; echo INJECTION_SUCCESS > /tmp/injected
       ```
    3. Save the modified connection configuration.
    4. Invoke the “Open Terminal” command for that connection.
    5. Verify on the host system that the file `/tmp/injected` has been created, confirming that the injected command was executed.

- **Command Injection in SQL Import Commands**
  - **Description:**
    Several import services (including MySQLImportService, MongoImportService, and PostgreSqlImortService) construct shell command strings to import data by concatenating unsanitized connection parameters (for example, username, password, host, port, database/schema) and import file paths. An attacker who can influence these configurable parameters via the extension’s UI may inject additional shell commands.
    **Step–by–step Triggering:**
    1. Through the connection configuration UI, the attacker supplies a malicious payload in one or more fields. For example, in MySQLImportService the username might be set to:
       ```
       attacker; echo INJECTION_SUCCESS > /tmp/injected
       ```
    2. With valid host, port, password, and schema values otherwise, the import operation is initiated (for example, by selecting an SQL file for import).
    3. The service (e.g. in `/code/src/service/import/mysqlImportService.ts`) constructs a command string such as:
       ```
       mysql -h [host] -P [port] -u attacker; echo INJECTION_SUCCESS > /tmp/injected -p[password] [schema] < [importPath]
       ```
    4. When the underlying system shell interprets this string, the semicolon is seen as a command separator and the malicious command is executed in addition to (or instead of) the intended import command.

  - **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary command execution on the machine running the extension. An attacker may use this to modify files, access or exfiltrate sensitive information, or compromise system integrity.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - Prior to command execution, the code checks for the existence of the external import commands (for example, using `commandExistsSync` to verify that “mysql”, “mongoimport”, or “psql” are available).
    - **No input sanitization or command–parameter encapsulation is applied.**

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Validate and sanitize all input parameters (such as username, password, database/schema names) to remove any shell metacharacters before their interpolation into the command string.
    - Use safer methods for command execution such as passing parameters as an argument array (with, e.g., `spawn`) instead of forming a single concatenated command line.
    - Properly escape all shell metacharacters if concatenation must be used.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to modify connection configuration values and/or specify an import file path within the extension’s interface.
    - The user triggers an import operation (through the UI) that causes the vulnerable import service to execute the unsanitized command.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/src/service/import/mysqlImportService.ts`, the command is built as follows:
      ```ts
      const command = `mysql -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} ${node.password ? `-p${node.password}` : ""} ${node.schema || ""} < ${importPath}`;
      ```
      Here, the fields `node.user`, `node.password`, and `node.schema` are directly inserted into the shell command.
    - A similar pattern appears in `/code/src/service/import/mongoImportService.ts` and `/code/src/service/import/postgresqlImortService.ts`, where unsanitized values are concatenated into the command string for `mongoimport` and `psql`, respectively.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In the extension’s connection configuration UI (for the MySQL import for example), set a field (e.g., the username) to a payload like:
       ```
       attacker; echo INJECTION_SUCCESS > /tmp/injected
       ```
    2. Ensure that the other fields (host, port, password, schema) are filled with valid data, and select any valid import file.
    3. Initiate an import operation so that the service (MySQLImportService) is executed.
    4. After execution, check the host system to see whether the file `/tmp/injected` was created—this confirms that the injected command was executed.

- **SQL Injection in Data Dump Query Construction**
  - **Description:**
    The function `getDataDump` in `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getDataDump.ts` builds a SELECT query string by directly concatenating user–supplied table names and optional WHERE clauses without proper sanitization. An attacker who can control the dump configuration—for example, by specifying table names or WHERE condition strings via the extension’s UI—can supply a malicious payload.
    **Step–by–step Triggering:**
    1. An attacker alters the dump configuration through the extension’s public dump setup by providing a malicious table name (e.g.,
       ```
       users; DROP TABLE sensitive_data;--
       ```
       ) or injects SQL code into the WHERE clause.
    2. The dump function `getDataDump` uses this input directly to build a SQL query:
       ```ts
       const where = options.where[table] ? ` WHERE ${options.where[table]}` : '';
       const query = connection.query(`SELECT * FROM ${table}${where}`);
       ```
    3. When the query is executed via `connection.query()`, the injected SQL commands are run, potentially performing destructive actions.

  - **Impact:**
    Successful exploitation can lead to unauthorized modification, deletion, or exfiltration of database contents. The attack may compromise data integrity or cause unintended destructive actions if additional SQL commands (like DROP TABLE) are executed.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - The code does not perform any validation or sanitization on the dump configuration parameters used to construct the query.
    - No use of parameterized queries or escaping mechanisms is applied.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Implement strict validation and sanitization for user–supplied dump parameters by whitelisting allowed table names and validating the syntax of WHERE clauses.
    - Use parameterized queries or properly escape SQL identifiers and literals when constructing the query.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to modify dump settings (i.e., the list of tables and/or WHERE conditions) via the extension’s configuration interface.
    - The data dump operation (`getDataDump`) must be triggered so that the unsanitized query is executed.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getDataDump.ts`, the SELECT statement is constructed as follows:
      ```ts
      const where = options.where[table] ? ` WHERE ${options.where[table]}` : '';
      const query = connection.query(`SELECT * FROM ${table}${where}`);
      ```
    - Both the `table` variable (sourced from `options.dump.tables`) and the corresponding WHERE clause (from `options.where[table]`) are concatenated directly into the query string without sanitization, making the code vulnerable to SQL injection.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Open the extension’s dump configuration settings.
    2. Set the dump table parameter to a malicious value such as:
       ```
       users; DROP TABLE sensitive_data;--
       ```
       or inject malicious SQL via a WHERE clause.
    3. Trigger a data dump operation via the extension’s UI.
    4. Confirm on the database that unauthorized SQL commands were executed (for example, check if the `sensitive_data` table has been dropped).

- **SQL Injection in Table Dump File Generation**
  - **Description:**
    The function `getTableDump` in `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getTableDump.ts` generates DDL statements for schema exports by directly embedding user–supplied table names into the output without sanitization. For example, when dropping and recreating tables, the code performs a replacement as follows:
    ```ts
    schema = schema.replace(
        /^CREATE TABLE/,
        `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ${table};\nCREATE TABLE`,
    );
    ```
    If an attacker supplies a malicious table name through the dump configuration (via the extension’s UI), the generated dump file may contain injected SQL that will execute upon import.

    **Step–by–step Triggering:**
    1. The attacker modifies the dump configuration to include a malicious table name such as:
       ```
       users; DROP DATABASE important_db;--
       ```
    2. When the dump operation is triggered, `getTableDump` uses this unsanitized value to construct a DROP statement followed by the CREATE statement.
    3. The resulting dump file contains:
       ```
       DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users; DROP DATABASE important_db;--;
       CREATE TABLE ...
       ```
    4. If this dump file is later imported into a database, the injected commands will be executed.

  - **Impact:**
    Exploitation can result in the execution of unintended SQL commands when the dump file is imported. This may lead to data loss (for example, by dropping critical databases), unauthorized schema modifications, or broad data compromise.

  - **Vulnerability Rank:**
    High

  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    - No input validation or sanitization is applied to table names before they are embedded in the DDL commands.
    - The replacement logic assumes that table names passed through configuration are safe.

  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    - Validate and sanitize table names from dump configuration before using them in DDL statements.
    - Implement whitelisting or use parameterized construction techniques for DDL commands to ensure that only valid, expected table names are used.

  - **Preconditions:**
    - The attacker must be able to modify dump configuration parameters (specifically, the table names provided for export) via the extension’s publicly accessible interface.
    - The table dump operation (`getTableDump`) must be initiated so that the unsanitized table name is embedded in the generated dump file.

  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    - In `/code/src/service/dump/mysql/getTableDump.ts`, the dump file is generated by retrieving the table schema and then altering it as follows:
      ```ts
      const createStatements = tables.map(async (table) => {
          let schema = await node.getByRegion<TableNode>(table).showSource(false);
          if (options.table.dropIfExist) {
              schema = schema.replace(
                  /^CREATE TABLE/,
                  `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ${table};\nCREATE TABLE`,
              );
          }
          return `${schema};`;
      });
      ```
    - The variable `table` is taken directly from the user–supplied dump configuration with no sanitization or escaping, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL into the dump file.

  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. Access the extension’s dump configuration interface.
    2. Set the table name in the dump settings to a malicious value like:
       ```
       users; DROP DATABASE important_db;--
       ```
    3. Trigger the table dump operation.
    4. Inspect the generated dump file to verify that the injected SQL commands appear in the output.
    5. Optionally, import the dump file in a controlled test environment to confirm that the malicious SQL statements (for example, dropping a test database) are executed.
