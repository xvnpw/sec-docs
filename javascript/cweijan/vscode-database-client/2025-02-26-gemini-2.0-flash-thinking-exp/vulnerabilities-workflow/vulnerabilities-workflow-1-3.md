### Vulnerability List:

- Unrestricted Port Forwarding via SSH Tunnel

- Description:
    1. An attacker connects to a publicly accessible instance of the VS Code Database Client extension.
    2. The attacker configures a new SSH connection.
    3. In the SSH connection configuration, specifically in the "Forward" settings, the attacker can specify an arbitrary "Destination Host" and "Destination Port".
    4. The extension will then establish an SSH tunnel to the configured SSH server.
    5. The extension will open a local port on the machine running the extension and forward all traffic from this local port through the SSH tunnel to the attacker-specified "Destination Host" and "Destination Port".
    6. By connecting to the local port opened by the extension, the attacker can effectively access services running on the attacker-specified host and port, even if those services are not publicly accessible or are behind a firewall.
    7. This allows an attacker to use the extension as an open proxy or a gateway to internal networks, potentially accessing sensitive services or data.

- Impact:
    - High: Unauthorized access to internal network resources and services. An attacker can bypass network firewalls and access services that should not be publicly accessible. This could lead to data breaches, unauthorized control of internal systems, and further attacks within the network.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None: The code allows users to specify arbitrary destination hosts and ports for SSH forwarding without any validation or restriction.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension should validate and sanitize the "Destination Host" and "Destination Port" inputs in the SSH forward configuration.
    - Restriction of destination hosts: Implement a whitelist or blacklist for allowed destination hosts. Ideally, restrict destination hosts to only those related to the database server the user intends to manage.
    - User awareness and warnings: Display clear warnings to the user about the security implications of port forwarding, especially when forwarding to non-database related ports or external hosts.
    - Principle of least privilege:  The extension should only allow port forwarding necessary for its intended database management functionality, and not arbitrary port forwarding.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have access to a publicly accessible instance of the VS Code Database Client extension.
    - The extension must have the SSH tunnel feature enabled and functional.
    - The attacker needs to be able to configure a new SSH connection within the extension.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/service/ssh/forward/tunnel.js`
    - Function: `tunnel(configArgs, callback)` and `createServer(config)` and `bindSSHConnection(config, netConnection)`

    ```javascript
    function bindSSHConnection(config, netConnection) {
        // ...
        function forward(sshConnection, netConnection) {
            /**
             * forwardOut() doesn't actually listen on the local port, so need create net server to forward.
             */
            sshConnection.forwardOut(config.srcHost, config.srcPort, config.dstHost, config.dstPort, function (err, sshStream) { // Vulnerable line
                if (err) {
                    netConnection.emit('error', err);
                    return;
                }
                tunelMark[id] = { connection: sshConnection }
                sshStream.on('error', function (error) {
                    console.log(err)
                    delete tunelMark[id]
                });
                if (netConnection) {
                    netConnection.pipe(sshStream).pipe(netConnection);
                }
            });
        }
        // ...
    }
    ```
    - The `bindSSHConnection` function, specifically the `forward` inner function, uses `sshConnection.forwardOut(config.srcHost, config.srcPort, config.dstHost, config.dstPort)`.
    - `config.dstHost` and `config.dstPort` are taken directly from the user-provided configuration (`configArgs` passed to `tunnel` function), without any validation or sanitization.
    - This allows an attacker to control the destination of the port forwarding, making it possible to forward traffic to any host and port they choose.

- Security test case:
    1. Setup:
        - Install the VS Code Database Client extension on a test VS Code instance.
        - Ensure you have access to an SSH server to use as a tunnel endpoint (you can use a cloud VM or a local SSH server for testing). Let's say the SSH server IP is `ssh_server_ip`.
        - On a separate machine (attacker machine), setup a simple HTTP server listening on port `8080`. Let's say the attacker machine IP is `attacker_ip`.
    2. Configuration within VS Code Database Client:
        - Open the Database Explorer panel and create a new SSH connection (it doesn't need to be a valid database connection for this test, just a valid SSH connection).
        - In the SSH connection settings, configure the SSH Host to `ssh_server_ip` and valid SSH credentials.
        - Navigate to the "Forward" settings within the SSH connection configuration.
        - Add a new forward entry with the following settings:
            - Local Address: `127.0.0.1`
            - Local Port: `9999` (or any available port)
            - Remote Address (Destination Host): `attacker_ip`
            - Remote Port (Destination Port): `8080`
        - Save the SSH connection configuration and connect to the SSH server using the configured connection.
    3. Access forwarded port:
        - On the machine running VS Code with the extension, open a web browser or use `curl`.
        - Access `http://localhost:9999`.
    4. Verification:
        - If the HTTP server running on `attacker_ip:8080` is accessible through `http://localhost:9999` on the VS Code machine, the unrestricted port forwarding vulnerability is confirmed.
        - You should see the response from the HTTP server running on the attacker's machine, indicating that the traffic is being forwarded through the SSH tunnel to the attacker-controlled destination.

- SSH File Download Path Traversal

- Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to a configured SSH connection within the VS Code Database Client extension (either by compromising existing credentials or if the instance is publicly accessible and allows connection configuration).
    2. The attacker navigates the remote file system using the extension's file explorer feature.
    3. The attacker selects a file for download and initiates the download operation.
    4. The extension prompts for a local save path.
    5. The attacker, instead of selecting a normal file path, provides a malicious path that uses path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../sensitive_dir/malicious_file.exe`) or an absolute path to overwrite a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    6. The extension uses the provided path directly without proper validation to save the downloaded file.
    7. The attacker successfully downloads the remote file to the attacker-controlled local path, potentially overwriting sensitive system files or placing malicious executables in arbitrary locations.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary File Write. An attacker can write files to any location on the local file system where the VS Code Database Client extension is running, limited by the permissions of the user running VS Code. This can lead to:
        - Local privilege escalation by overwriting system binaries or configuration files.
        - Client-side code execution by placing malicious scripts in startup folders.
        - Data exfiltration by overwriting legitimate data files with attacker-controlled content.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None: The code appears to directly use the user-provided download path without sanitization or validation against path traversal or absolute paths.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension should validate and sanitize the user-provided download path to prevent path traversal sequences and restrict saving to allowed directories.
    - Restriction of download paths: Implement a mechanism to restrict the user to select download paths within a designated workspace or a safe download directory.
    - Path canonicalization: Convert the user-provided path to its canonical form and verify that it is within the allowed directory.
    - User warnings: Display clear warnings to the user about the security risks of downloading files and the importance of choosing safe download locations.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have access to a configured SSH connection within the VS Code Database Client extension.
    - The extension must have the SSH file explorer and download feature enabled and functional.
    - The attacker must be able to initiate a file download operation and provide a local save path.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/model/ssh/fileNode.ts`
    - Function: `downloadByPath(path:string,showDialog?:boolean)` and `download()`

    ```typescript
    public async downloadByPath(path:string,showDialog?:boolean){

        const { sftp } = await ClientManager.getSSH(this.sshConfig)
        vscode.window.withProgress({
            location: vscode.ProgressLocation.Notification,
            title: `Start downloading ${this.fullPath}`,
            cancellable: true
        }, (progress, token) => {
            return new Promise((resolve) => {
                const fileReadStream = sftp.createReadStream(this.fullPath)
                var str = progressStream({
                    length: this.file.attrs.size,
                    time: 100
                });
                let before = 0;
                str.on("progress", (progressData: any) => {
                    if (progressData.percentage == 100) {
                        resolve(null)
                        if(showDialog){
                            vscode.window.showInformationMessage(`Download ${this.fullPath} success, cost time: ${progressData.runtime}s`, 'Open').then(action => {
                                if (action) {
                                    vscode.commands.executeCommand('vscode.open', vscode.Uri.file(path)); // Potential insecure path usage
                                }
                            })
                        }
                        return;
                    }
                    progress.report({ increment: progressData.percentage - before, message: `remaining : ${prettyBytes(progressData.remaining)}` });
                    before = progressData.percentage
                })
                str.on("error", err => {
                    vscode.window.showErrorMessage(err.message)
                })
                const outStream = createWriteStream(path); // Vulnerable line: path is directly from user input
                fileReadStream.pipe(str).pipe(outStream);
                token.onCancellationRequested(() => {
                    fileReadStream.destroy()
                    outStream.destroy()
                });
            })
        })

    }

    download(): any {

        const extName = extname(this.file.filename)?.replace(".", "");
        vscode.window.showSaveDialog({ defaultUri: vscode.Uri.file(this.file.filename), filters: { "Type": [extName] }, saveLabel: "Select Download Path" })
            .then(async uri => {
                if (uri) {
                    this.downloadByPath(uri.fsPath,true) // path from showSaveDialog is directly passed
                }
            })
    }
    ```
    - The `downloadByPath` function takes `path` as an argument, which is directly derived from `uri.fsPath` in the `download` function.
    - The `download` function uses `vscode.window.showSaveDialog` to get the download path from the user.
    - The `path` variable from user input is directly passed to `createWriteStream(path)` without any validation or sanitization.
    - This allows an attacker to manipulate the `path` variable to perform path traversal or specify absolute paths, leading to arbitrary file write vulnerabilities.

- Security test case:
    1. Setup:
        - Install the VS Code Database Client extension on a test VS Code instance.
        - Configure an SSH connection to a test server.
        - Ensure there is a file on the SSH server that you can attempt to download (e.g., a simple text file in the home directory).
    2. Configuration within VS Code Database Client:
        - Open the Database Explorer panel and navigate to the configured SSH connection.
        - Browse the remote file system to locate the file you want to download.
    3. Initiate Download and Malicious Path Input:
        - Right-click on the file and select "Download".
        - When prompted with the "Save As" dialog, instead of choosing a normal file name in a safe directory, enter a path traversal string or an absolute path to a sensitive location. For example:
            - Path Traversal: `../../../Desktop/downloaded_file.txt` (to attempt to save to the Desktop, regardless of the initial directory)
            - Absolute Path Overwrite: `/tmp/evil.txt` (on Linux/macOS) or `C:\evil.txt` (on Windows)
        - Click "Save".
    4. Verification:
        - Check if the file from the SSH server has been downloaded and written to the malicious path you specified (e.g., check if `downloaded_file.txt` exists on your Desktop, or if `/tmp/evil.txt` or `C:\evil.txt` was created).
        - If the file is written to the attacker-specified path, the path traversal/arbitrary file write vulnerability is confirmed.

- Command Injection in Import Functionality

- Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to the "Import SQL File" functionality within the VS Code Database Client extension. This functionality is typically available in the context menu of a database connection or database node.
    2. The attacker selects the "Import SQL File" option and is prompted to choose an SQL file from their local file system.
    3. The attacker crafts a malicious file path containing command injection payloads. For example, if the import path is directly passed to a shell command, the attacker could create a file with a name like ``; touch /tmp/pwned;`.json` or similar, depending on the context and the command being executed.
    4. The extension, upon initiating the import process, uses `child_process.exec` to execute a command-line tool (like `mongoimport`, `mysql`, or `psql`) for importing the SQL file. The file path provided by the attacker is included in the command without proper sanitization.
    5. The `child_process.exec` function executes the constructed command in a shell, and due to the lack of sanitization, the attacker's injected commands within the file path are also executed.
    6. The attacker achieves arbitrary command execution on the machine running the VS Code Database Client extension, with the privileges of the user running VS Code.

- Impact:
    - Critical: Remote Command Execution (RCE). Successful command injection allows the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the machine running the VS Code Database Client extension. This can lead to:
        - Full control over the user's machine.
        - Installation of malware or backdoors.
        - Data exfiltration from the user's machine.
        - Lateral movement within the user's network.

- Vulnerability Rank: critical

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None: The code directly uses the user-provided import file path in `child_process.exec` commands without any apparent sanitization or validation.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension must sanitize the `importPath` before using it in shell commands to prevent command injection. This should include removing or escaping shell metacharacters.
    - Avoid `child_process.exec`:  If possible, use safer alternatives like `child_process.spawn` and pass arguments as an array, which reduces the risk of shell injection. However, even with `spawn`, the arguments themselves must be carefully validated.
    - Principle of least privilege: The extension should minimize the use of shell commands and external processes, especially when dealing with user-provided input.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have access to a publicly accessible instance of the VS Code Database Client extension.
    - The extension must have the "Import SQL File" functionality enabled and accessible.
    - The attacker must be able to trigger the import process and provide a crafted file path.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/service/import/mongoImportService.ts`, `/code/src/service/import/mysqlImportService.ts`, `/code/src/service/import/postgresqlImortService.ts`
    - Function: `importSql(importPath: string, node: Node)` in each of these files.

    ```typescript
    // mongoImportService.ts
    import { exec } from "child_process";
    // ...
    export class MongoImportService extends ImportService {
        public importSql(importPath: string, node: Node): void {
            // ...
            const command = `mongoimport -h ${host}:${port} --db ${node.database} --jsonArray -c identitycounters --type json ${importPath}` // Vulnerable line
            Console.log(`Executing: ${command}`);
            exec(command, (err,stdout,stderr) => {
                // ...
            })
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```

    ```typescript
    // mysqlImportService.ts
    import { exec } from "child_process";
    // ...
    export class MysqlImportService extends ImportService {
        public importSql(importPath: string, node: Node): void {
            // ...
            const command = `mysql -h ${host} -P ${port} -u ${node.user} ${node.password ? `-p${node.password}` : ""} ${node.schema || ""} < ${importPath}` // Vulnerable line
            Console.log(`Executing: ${command.replace(/-p.+? /, "-p****** ")}`);
            const cp=exec(command, (err,stdout,stderr) => {
                Console.log(err||stdout||stderr);
            })
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```

    ```typescript
    // postgresqlImortService.ts
    import { exec } from "child_process";
    import { platform } from "os";
    // ...
    export class PostgresqlImortService extends ImportService {
        public importSql(importPath: string, node: Node): void {
            // ...
            const command = `psql -h ${host} -p ${port} -U ${node.user} -d ${node.database} < ${importPath}` // Vulnerable line
            Console.log(`Executing: ${command}`);
            let prefix = platform() == 'win32' ? 'set' : 'export';
            exec(`${prefix} "PGPASSWORD=${node.password}" && ${command}`, (err,stdout,stderr) => {
                // ...
            })
            // ...
        }
    }
    ```
    - In each of these files, the `importSql` function constructs a shell command using template literals.
    - The `importPath` variable, which is derived from user input (file selection), is directly embedded into the command string without any sanitization.
    - This allows an attacker to craft a malicious file path that injects arbitrary commands into the shell command, leading to command injection.

- Security test case:
    1. Setup:
        - Install the VS Code Database Client extension on a test VS Code instance.
        - Choose any database type supported for import (e.g., MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL). Configure a connection to a test database (it doesn't need to be a real database for this test, just a configured connection is sufficient).
        - On the attacker's machine, create a malicious file path. The exact payload might need to be adjusted based on the operating system and shell, but a common example for *nix systems is to use backticks or command substitution. For example, create a file named `` `touch /tmp/pwned` ``.json (for Mongo import) or `` `touch /tmp/pwned` ``.sql (for MySQL/PostgreSQL import). Note the spaces and backticks surrounding the `touch /tmp/pwned` command.
        - Place this file in a location accessible from the machine running VS Code.
    2. Configuration within VS Code Database Client:
        - Open the Database Explorer panel and right-click on the configured test database connection or database node.
        - Select the "Import SQL File" (or equivalent, depending on database type) option.
        - In the file selection dialog, navigate to the directory where you placed the malicious file and select it.
    3. Trigger Import:
        - Click "Import" or the equivalent button to initiate the import process.
    4. Verification:
        - After the import process (which may fail or seem to succeed depending on the command injected and the database type), check if the injected command was executed. In this example, check if the file `/tmp/pwned` was created on the machine running VS Code.
        - If the file `/tmp/pwned` exists, the command injection vulnerability is confirmed. The attacker was able to execute the `touch /tmp/pwned` command by crafting a malicious import file path.

- FTP File Download Path Traversal

- Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to a configured FTP connection within the VS Code Database Client extension.
    2. The attacker navigates the remote file system using the extension's FTP file explorer feature.
    3. The attacker selects a file for download and initiates the download operation.
    4. The extension prompts for a local save path.
    5. The attacker, instead of selecting a normal file path, provides a malicious path that uses path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../sensitive_dir/malicious_file.exe`) or an absolute path to overwrite a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    6. The extension uses the provided path directly without proper validation to save the downloaded file.
    7. The attacker successfully downloads the remote file to the attacker-controlled local path, potentially overwriting sensitive system files or placing malicious executables in arbitrary locations.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary File Write. An attacker can write files to any location on the local file system where the VS Code Database Client extension is running, limited by the permissions of the user running VS Code. This can lead to:
        - Local privilege escalation by overwriting system binaries or configuration files.
        - Client-side code execution by placing malicious scripts in startup folders.
        - Data exfiltration by overwriting legitimate data files with attacker-controlled content.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None: The code appears to directly use the user-provided download path without sanitization or validation against path traversal or absolute paths.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension should validate and sanitize the user-provided download path to prevent path traversal sequences and restrict saving to allowed directories.
    - Restriction of download paths: Implement a mechanism to restrict the user to select download paths within a designated workspace or a safe download directory.
    - Path canonicalization: Convert the user-provided path to its canonical form and verify that it is within the allowed directory.
    - User warnings: Display clear warnings to the user about the security risks of downloading files and the importance of choosing safe download locations.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have access to a configured FTP connection within the VS Code Database Client extension.
    - The extension must have the FTP file explorer and download feature enabled and functional.
    - The attacker must be able to initiate a file download operation and provide a local save path.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/model/ftp/ftpFileNode.ts`
    - Function: `download()`

    ```typescript
    download(): any {

        const extName = extname(this.file.name)?.replace(".", "");
        vscode.window.showSaveDialog({ defaultUri: vscode.Uri.file(this.file.name), filters: { "Type": [extName] }, saveLabel: "Select Download Path" })
            .then(async uri => {
                if (uri) {
                    const client = await this.getClient()
                    vscode.window.withProgress({
                        location: vscode.ProgressLocation.Notification,
                        title: `Start downloading ${this.fullPath}`,
                        cancellable: true
                    }, (progress, token) => {
                        return new Promise((resolve) => {
                            client.get(this.fullPath, (error, fileReadStream) => {
                                // ...
                                const outStream = createWriteStream(uri.fsPath); // Vulnerable line: path is directly from user input
                                fileReadStream.pipe(str).pipe(outStream);
                                // ...
                            })
                        })
                    })
                }
            })
    }
    ```
    - The `download` function uses `vscode.window.showSaveDialog` to get the download path from the user via `uri.fsPath`.
    - The `uri.fsPath` variable from user input is directly passed to `createWriteStream(uri.fsPath)` without any validation or sanitization.
    - This allows an attacker to manipulate the `uri.fsPath` variable to perform path traversal or specify absolute paths, leading to arbitrary file write vulnerabilities similar to the SSH File Download Path Traversal.

- Security test case:
    1. Setup:
        - Install the VS Code Database Client extension on a test VS Code instance.
        - Configure an FTP connection to a test server.
        - Ensure there is a file on the FTP server that you can attempt to download (e.g., a simple text file in the root directory).
    2. Configuration within VS Code Database Client:
        - Open the Database Explorer panel and navigate to the configured FTP connection.
        - Browse the remote file system to locate the file you want to download.
    3. Initiate Download and Malicious Path Input:
        - Right-click on the file and select "Download".
        - When prompted with the "Save As" dialog, instead of choosing a normal file name in a safe directory, enter a path traversal string or an absolute path to a sensitive location. For example:
            - Path Traversal: `../../../Desktop/downloaded_file.txt` (to attempt to save to the Desktop, regardless of the initial directory)
            - Absolute Path Overwrite: `/tmp/evil.txt` (on Linux/macOS) or `C:\evil.txt` (on Windows)
        - Click "Save".
    4. Verification:
        - Check if the file from the FTP server has been downloaded and written to the malicious path you specified (e.g., check if `downloaded_file.txt` exists on your Desktop, or if `/tmp/evil.txt` or `C:\evil.txt` was created).
        - If the file is written to the attacker-specified path, the path traversal/arbitrary file write vulnerability is confirmed.

- Export Functionality Path Traversal

- Description:
    1. An attacker gains access to the VS Code Database Client extension and executes a database query that produces results.
    2. The attacker initiates the export functionality for the query results. This is typically available in the query result view.
    3. The extension prompts for a local save path and export format.
    4. The attacker, instead of selecting a normal file path, provides a malicious path that uses path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../sensitive_dir/exported_data.csv`) or an absolute path to overwrite a sensitive file (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
    5. The extension uses the provided path directly without proper validation to save the exported data.
    6. The attacker successfully exports the data to the attacker-controlled local path, potentially overwriting sensitive system files or placing malicious data in arbitrary locations.

- Impact:
    - High: Arbitrary File Write. An attacker can write files to any location on the local file system where the VS Code Database Client extension is running, limited by the permissions of the user running VS Code. This can lead to:
        - Local privilege escalation by overwriting system binaries or configuration files.
        - Client-side code execution by placing malicious scripts in startup folders.
        - Data exfiltration by overwriting legitimate data files with attacker-controlled content.

- Vulnerability Rank: high

- Currently implemented mitigations:
    - None: Based on the pattern of similar vulnerabilities, it's likely that the export functionality also directly uses the user-provided export path without sanitization or validation.

- Missing mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension should validate and sanitize the user-provided export path to prevent path traversal sequences and restrict saving to allowed directories.
    - Restriction of export paths: Implement a mechanism to restrict the user to select export paths within a designated workspace or a safe export directory.
    - Path canonicalization: Convert the user-provided path to its canonical form and verify that it is within the allowed directory.
    - User warnings: Display clear warnings to the user about the security risks of exporting files and the importance of choosing safe export locations.

- Preconditions:
    - The attacker needs to have access to a publicly accessible instance of the VS Code Database Client extension.
    - The extension must have the query execution and export functionality enabled and functional.
    - The attacker must be able to execute a query, trigger the export operation, and provide a local save path.

- Source code analysis:
    - File: `/code/src/service/result/query.ts`
    - Function: `send` method, event handler for 'export' event.
    - Relevant Code Snippet:

    ```typescript
    }).on('export', (params) => {
        this.exportService.export({ ...params.option, request: queryParam.res.request, dbOption }).then(() => {
            handler.emit('EXPORT_DONE')
        })
    }).
    ```
    - The `send` function sets up an event handler for the 'export' event from the webview.
    - When the 'export' event is triggered, it calls `this.exportService.export` with `params.option`, `queryParam.res.request`, and `dbOption`.
    - Assuming `params.option` contains the user-provided export path obtained from a `vscode.window.showSaveDialog` similar to download functionality, and `exportService.export` uses this path directly in `createWriteStream` or similar file writing function without validation, it would be vulnerable to path traversal. The exact implementation of `ExportService` is needed to confirm this.

- Security test case:
    1. Setup:
        - Install the VS Code Database Client extension on a test VS Code instance.
        - Configure a database connection and execute a query that returns some data.
    2. Configuration within VS Code Database Client:
        - Open the query result view for the executed query.
    3. Initiate Export and Malicious Path Input:
        - Trigger the export functionality from the query result view (e.g., by clicking an "Export" button).
        - When prompted with the "Save As" dialog, instead of choosing a normal file name in a safe directory, enter a path traversal string or an absolute path to a sensitive location. For example:
            - Path Traversal: `../../../Desktop/exported_data.csv`
            - Absolute Path Overwrite: `/tmp/evil_exported.csv` (on Linux/macOS) or `C:\evil_exported.csv` (on Windows)
        - Select CSV or any other available export format and click "Save".
    4. Verification:
        - Check if the exported data has been written to the malicious path you specified (e.g., check if `exported_data.csv` exists on your Desktop, or if `/tmp/evil_exported.csv` or `C:\evil_exported.csv` was created).
        - If the file is written to the attacker-specified path, the path traversal/arbitrary file write vulnerability in the export functionality is confirmed.
