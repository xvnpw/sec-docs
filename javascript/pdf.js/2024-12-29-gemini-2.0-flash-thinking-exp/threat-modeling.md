### High and Critical PDF.js Threats

Here are the high and critical threats directly involving the PDF.js library:

* **Threat:** Parsing Vulnerability Exploitation
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a malicious PDF file with specific structures that exploit vulnerabilities in PDF.js's parsing logic. This could involve malformed objects, incorrect data types, or unexpected sequences of commands. Upon processing, PDF.js might crash, enter an infinite loop, or experience memory corruption. The attacker might distribute this PDF through user uploads, email attachments, or by hosting it on a website.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashing the user's browser tab or the entire browser, preventing them from accessing the application or other web resources.
        * **Memory Corruption:** In severe cases, memory corruption could potentially be exploited to achieve remote code execution within the browser's sandbox (though this is less likely with modern browser security measures).
        * **Unexpected Application Behavior:** Causing the web application to malfunction or display incorrect information.
    * **Affected Component:** Parser (specifically modules responsible for interpreting PDF syntax and object structures, e.g., `src/core/parser.js`, `src/core/obj.js`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High to Critical (depending on the exploitability and potential for code execution).
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep PDF.js Updated:** Regularly update to the latest stable version of PDF.js to benefit from bug fixes and security patches.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strong CSP to restrict the execution of inline scripts and the sources from which scripts can be loaded. This can help mitigate the impact if a parsing vulnerability leads to script injection.
        * **Input Validation (Server-Side):** If users can upload PDFs, perform basic server-side validation to check file headers and potentially scan for known malicious patterns (though this is not a foolproof solution for zero-day exploits).
        * **Browser Sandboxing:** Rely on the browser's built-in sandboxing mechanisms to limit the impact of potential vulnerabilities.

* **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Malicious PDF Content
    * **Description:** An attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code within a PDF file. When PDF.js renders this PDF, the embedded script is executed within the user's browser in the context of the web application. This can happen if PDF.js incorrectly handles certain PDF features or if there are vulnerabilities in how it renders specific content types. The attacker might trick users into opening this PDF.
    * **Impact:**
        * **Session Hijacking:** Stealing the user's session cookies or tokens, allowing the attacker to impersonate the user.
        * **Data Theft:** Accessing sensitive information displayed on the page or making unauthorized requests on behalf of the user.
        * **Redirection to Malicious Sites:** Redirecting the user to phishing websites or sites hosting malware.
        * **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the web page.
    * **Affected Component:** Renderer (specifically modules responsible for interpreting and displaying PDF content, including text, images, and annotations, e.g., `src/display/canvas.js`, `src/display/svg.js`).
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep PDF.js Updated:** Regularly update PDF.js to patch known XSS vulnerabilities.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP that disallows 'unsafe-inline' script sources and restricts script sources to trusted domains.
        * **Sanitization of User-Provided Content (if applicable):** If the application allows users to add content that might be embedded in PDFs, ensure proper sanitization to prevent the introduction of malicious scripts.
        * **Secure HTTP Headers:** Implement security headers like `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to prevent MIME sniffing attacks that could lead to script execution.

* **Threat:** JavaScript Injection through PDF Actions or Annotations
    * **Description:** An attacker crafts a PDF with malicious JavaScript embedded within interactive elements like form fields, buttons, or annotations. When the user interacts with these elements, the embedded JavaScript is executed by PDF.js.
    * **Impact:** Similar to XSS, this can lead to session hijacking, data theft, redirection, and defacement.
    * **Affected Component:** JavaScript Engine Integration (modules responsible for handling JavaScript execution within the PDF context, e.g., potentially within the annotation handling or form processing logic).
    * **Risk Severity:** High.
    * **Mitigation Strategies:**
        * **Keep PDF.js Updated:** Ensure PDF.js is up-to-date to address any known vulnerabilities related to JavaScript execution.
        * **Disable or Restrict JavaScript in PDF.js (if feasible):** Depending on the application's requirements, consider disabling or restricting JavaScript execution within PDF.js if the interactive features are not essential. PDF.js provides options to control this.
        * **Content Security Policy (CSP):** A strong CSP can help mitigate the impact of injected scripts.
        * **Careful Handling of Interactive Elements:** If the application processes or relies on data from interactive PDF elements, ensure proper validation and sanitization of this data.
