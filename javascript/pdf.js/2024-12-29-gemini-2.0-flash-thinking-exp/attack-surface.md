Here's the updated key attack surface list focusing on high and critical risks directly involving pdf.js:

*   **Malformed PDF Processing Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** pdf.js needs to parse complex and sometimes intentionally malformed PDF structures. Bugs in the parsing logic can lead to unexpected behavior.
    *   **How pdf.js Contributes:**  pdf.js is the component responsible for interpreting the PDF file format. Its parsing engine is the direct point of interaction with potentially malicious data.
    *   **Example:** A PDF with an invalid object definition causes pdf.js to enter an infinite loop, consuming excessive CPU and memory, leading to a denial of service in the browser tab. In older or vulnerable versions, could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially leading to browser crashes or hangs. In older or vulnerable versions, could potentially lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep pdf.js updated to the latest version, as updates often include fixes for parsing vulnerabilities.
        *   Implement timeouts or resource limits for PDF processing to prevent excessive resource consumption.

*   **Exploitation of Embedded JavaScript in PDFs**
    *   **Description:** PDFs can contain embedded JavaScript code. While pdf.js aims to sandbox this, vulnerabilities in the sandbox or the browser's JavaScript engine can be exploited.
    *   **How pdf.js Contributes:** pdf.js is responsible for executing the JavaScript code embedded within the PDF. Weaknesses in its sandboxing implementation are direct attack vectors.
    *   **Example:** A malicious PDF contains JavaScript that bypasses the pdf.js sandbox and accesses sensitive browser data like cookies or local storage, sending it to an attacker's server.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), information disclosure, potentially unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep pdf.js updated to benefit from sandbox security improvements.
        *   Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict the capabilities of JavaScript executed within the context of the PDF viewer.
        *   Consider disabling JavaScript execution in pdf.js if the application's use case allows it (though this reduces functionality).

*   **`GoTo` Actions and URI Handling Vulnerabilities**
    *   **Description:** PDF `GoTo` actions can redirect users to different parts of the document or external URIs. Improper handling of these URIs can lead to security issues.
    *   **How pdf.js Contributes:** pdf.js interprets and executes these `GoTo` actions, including navigating to specified URIs.
    *   **Example:** A malicious PDF uses a `GoTo` action with a crafted URI that injects malicious JavaScript into the application's context, leading to XSS.
    *   **Impact:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), potential redirection to malicious websites.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Sanitize or validate URLs extracted from `GoTo` actions before allowing navigation.
        *   Implement robust checks to ensure that redirects initiated by PDFs are to trusted domains.

*   **Exploitation of PDF Features (Annotations, Forms, etc.)**
    *   **Description:** Vulnerabilities can exist in how pdf.js handles specific PDF features like annotations, form fields, or embedded files.
    *   **How pdf.js Contributes:** pdf.js is responsible for rendering and interacting with these PDF features. Bugs in the rendering or interaction logic can be exploited.
    *   **Example:** A specially crafted PDF with a malicious annotation triggers a buffer overflow in pdf.js when rendered, leading to a crash or potentially RCE.
    *   **Impact:** Denial of Service (DoS), potentially Remote Code Execution (RCE).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Keep pdf.js updated to patch vulnerabilities related to specific PDF features.
        *   If possible, limit the usage of complex or less common PDF features if they are not essential.
