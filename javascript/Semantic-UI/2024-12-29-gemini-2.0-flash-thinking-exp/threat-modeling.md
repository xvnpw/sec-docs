*   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) through Vulnerable Component Rendering
    *   **Description:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into a Semantic-UI component, such as a form field or a modal, if Semantic-UI itself has a vulnerability in how it handles certain data during rendering. This script then executes in the victim's browser when they view the page.
    *   **Impact:** The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, redirecting the user to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Potentially affects various modules that render user-controlled data, including:
        *   Form Module (input fields, textareas, dropdowns)
        *   Modal Module (content within modals)
        *   Popup Module (content within popups)
        *   Any components using user input for display.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Regularly update Semantic-UI to patch known vulnerabilities.
        *   Carefully review any custom modifications or extensions made to Semantic-UI components for potential XSS vulnerabilities.
        *   While server-side sanitization is crucial, ensure Semantic-UI's own rendering logic is not vulnerable.

*   **Threat:** Logic Flaws in Semantic-UI JavaScript leading to Client-Side Manipulation
    *   **Description:** Bugs or logical errors within Semantic-UI's JavaScript code could be exploited by an attacker to manipulate the behavior of UI elements or bypass intended client-side logic *within Semantic-UI*. This might involve crafting specific user interactions or input sequences that trigger unexpected behavior within the framework's own scripts.
    *   **Impact:** Unintended changes to the application's state or UI due to flaws in Semantic-UI's logic, potentially leading to incorrect data display or unexpected behavior that could be further exploited.
    *   **Affected Component:**  Various JavaScript modules within Semantic-UI, depending on the specific logic flaw.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   Stay updated with Semantic-UI releases, as bug fixes often address such logic flaws.
        *   Report any discovered logic flaws in Semantic-UI to the maintainers.
        *   Thoroughly test the application's functionality, paying close attention to interactions with Semantic-UI components, to identify potential issues stemming from the framework itself.
