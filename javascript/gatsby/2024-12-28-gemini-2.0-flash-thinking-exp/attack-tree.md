## High-Risk Sub-Tree of Gatsby Application Threat Model

**Objective:** Compromise the application by injecting malicious content into the generated static site.

**Sub-Tree:**

Compromise Gatsby Application
*   Inject Malicious Content into Generated Site [HIGH RISK PATH]
    *   Compromise Data Sources [CRITICAL NODE]
    *   Exploit Gatsby Plugin Vulnerabilities [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Popular Plugins [HIGH RISK PATH]
    *   Compromise Gatsby Configuration Files [CRITICAL NODE, HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   Inject Malicious Code into `gatsby-config.js` [HIGH RISK PATH]
        *   Inject Malicious Code into `gatsby-node.js` [HIGH RISK PATH]

**Detailed Breakdown of Attack Vectors for High-Risk Paths and Critical Nodes:**

**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Content into Generated Site**

*   This represents the overarching goal of injecting harmful content into the final website that users will interact with. Success here directly leads to compromising the application's integrity and potentially user security.

**Critical Node: Compromise Data Sources**

*   This node represents the various ways an attacker can manipulate the data that Gatsby uses to build the static site. If successful, the malicious data will be incorporated into the final output.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploit Vulnerabilities in External APIs: Attackers target weaknesses in the APIs that provide data to Gatsby. This could involve injecting malicious data through API requests or exploiting vulnerabilities in how the API handles data.
        *   Compromise CMS/Backend System: If a CMS or backend system manages the content, attackers can gain unauthorized access and directly inject malicious content through the CMS interface.
        *   Exploit Vulnerabilities in Local Data Files (Markdown, JSON, etc.): Attackers who gain access to the development environment or repository can directly modify local data files to include malicious code or markup.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Gatsby Plugin Vulnerabilities**

*   Gatsby's plugin ecosystem is a significant attack surface. This path focuses on exploiting weaknesses within these plugins.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Popular Plugins: Attackers leverage publicly disclosed vulnerabilities in widely used plugins. This often involves using readily available exploits or tools.
        *   Exploit Zero-Day Vulnerabilities in Plugins: Attackers discover and exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in plugins. This requires more advanced skills and effort.
        *   Supply Chain Attack via Malicious Plugins: Attackers create seemingly benign plugins with hidden malicious code, hoping developers will install them, thus introducing a backdoor.

**High-Risk Path: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Popular Plugins**

*   This is a specific and highly probable attack vector within the broader "Exploit Gatsby Plugin Vulnerabilities" path. The popularity of certain plugins makes them attractive targets, and publicly known vulnerabilities make exploitation easier.

**Critical Node: Compromise Gatsby Configuration Files**

*   Gatsby's behavior is heavily dictated by its configuration files. Compromising these files allows attackers to directly influence the build process and the generated output.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   Inject Malicious Code into `gatsby-config.js`: Attackers modify the `gatsby-config.js` file to include malicious JavaScript code that executes during the build process. This can be used to load external scripts or manipulate the build output.
        *   Inject Malicious Code into `gatsby-node.js`: Attackers modify the `gatsby-node.js` file, which provides hooks into the build process. This allows for more sophisticated manipulation of the build, including injecting malicious content into generated pages.
        *   Manipulate Environment Variables: Attackers gain access to and modify environment variables used during the build process. This can influence the data used to generate the site, potentially injecting malicious content indirectly.

**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Code into `gatsby-config.js`**

*   This path focuses on the direct injection of malicious code into the `gatsby-config.js` file. The ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript during the build makes this a high-risk scenario.

**High-Risk Path: Inject Malicious Code into `gatsby-node.js`**

*   Similar to `gatsby-config.js`, this path involves injecting malicious code, but `gatsby-node.js` offers more control over the build process, potentially leading to more sophisticated attacks.
