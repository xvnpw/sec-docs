---

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Custom Rules or Configuration Files
  - **Description:**
    The markdownlint system supports loading custom rules and configuration files written in JavaScript (for example, files with names like `.markdownlint.cjs` or `.markdownlint-cli2.cjs`) as well as custom rule files specified in VS Code’s user or workspace settings. An external attacker who gains influence over repository content (for example via a pull request) could add a malicious custom rule file and modify the configuration to load it. When the linter runs in a trusted workspace (or in a CI build that does not validate the trust level), the custom rule file is executed without additional sandboxing. The execution of this untrusted JavaScript would allow arbitrary code execution in the environment where markdownlint is run.
  - **Impact:**
    If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in a trusted environment. In a CI or a developer’s machine where the workspace is marked as trusted, the attacker’s code could access sensitive files, modify build outputs, or even compromise the host system.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The README’s “Security” section warns that JavaScript from custom rules or configuration files could be dangerous and notes that VS Code’s Workspace Trust setting is honored to block JavaScript for untrusted workspaces. This means that if the workspace is not explicitly marked as trusted, custom JavaScript won’t run.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • There is no additional sandboxing or signature validation for custom rules or JavaScript configuration files when a workspace is trusted.
    • No static analysis or runtime restrictions (for example, via a secure evaluation or limited permissions runtime) are implemented to prevent malicious behaviors.
    • The system relies solely on the user’s workspace trust decision, which may be abused by sophisticated attackers.
  - **Preconditions:**
    • The application (or CI job) must be running in a trusted context where custom JavaScript is allowed.
    • An attacker must be able to modify repository content (for example, via a pull request) so that a malicious custom rule or configuration file is included and then loaded by markdownlint.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In the README file, the explanation of custom rules and configuration clearly details that JavaScript files (e.g., those prefixed with `./` in the configuration) are loaded automatically.
    2. The section entitled “Security” explicitly states that “Running JavaScript from custom rules, markdown-it plugins, or configuration files … could be a security risk” and that this risk is mitigated only by respecting VS Code’s Workspace Trust setting.
    3. No further checks are performed by markdownlint’s implementation to restrict what the loaded JavaScript may do. In a trusted workspace, a file such as `./.vscode/my-custom-rule.js` would be imported and executed without additional security validations.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled test environment (for example, a CI job running with a trusted workspace or a developer’s trusted VS Code instance), create a new branch that adds a new custom rule file (p. ex., `./malicious-rule.js`) with JavaScript code that performs a clearly observable side effect (such as writing a new file or printing a unique message to the console).
    2. Modify the project’s markdownlint configuration (or VS Code settings) to include the path to the malicious custom rule (e.g., `"markdownlint.customRules": ["./malicious-rule.js"]`).
    3. Trigger markdownlint (either by saving a Markdown file in VS Code or by running the linter in CI) and observe that the malicious code is executed (e.g., the side effect is visible in the command output or as a change in the file system).
    4. Verify that when the same code is run in an untrusted workspace, the malicious JavaScript is blocked, confirming that the only mitigation is workspace trust.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Dependency Resolution Due to Absence of a Package Lock
  - **Description:**
    In the CI workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the command used to install Node.js packages explicitly disables the use of a package lock file by using the flag `--no-package-lock` during `npm install`. Without a package lock file, dependency resolution relies solely on the version ranges specified in `package.json`. This non-deterministic resolution can allow an attacker to publish a malicious version of a dependency that still satisfies the version semver ranges defined, which might be picked up at install time.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker who successfully publishes compromised versions of a dependency that match the allowed version ranges could inject arbitrary code into the CI build process. This might result in arbitrary code execution within the CI environment, compromise of build artifacts, or even supply-chain attacks that affect downstream users.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The project’s CONTRIBUTING guidelines stress the importance of “pinning” dependency versions to ensure consistent behavior, but there is no technical enforcement of a package lock file during continuous integration.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • The CI workflow does not enforce the use of a package lock file (or a lockfile equivalent such as `npm-shrinkwrap.json`), leaving dependency resolution open to variation.
    • No integrity checking (for example, via npm audit or verifying package signatures) is performed during dependency installation in the CI job.
    • The explicit use of the `--no-package-lock` flag directly contradicts the push for dependency pinning, exposing the CI environment to potential malicious dependency updates.
  - **Preconditions:**
    • The project must have dependency version ranges (from a `package.json`) that do not strictly pin dependency versions.
    • An attacker must be able to publish (or compromise) a version of a dependency that falls within the allowed semver range and is later resolved by the CI process.
    • The CI workflow must run using the `npm install --no-package-lock` command so that a lockfile (even if locally generated) is not used.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In the file `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the step for installing dependencies is defined as:
       ```
       - run: npm install --no-package-lock
       ```
    2. The absence of a package lock file in the repository (and the explicit flag disabling its use) means that when running `npm install`, the system resolves dependencies based solely on the version ranges defined in the project’s metadata.
    3. This configuration creates a window in which the installed versions may differ from development or testing builds, thereby opening a potential supply-chain vulnerability.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled CI environment, simulate the publish of a dummy dependency update that includes an intentional “payload” (for testing purposes, the payload might log a unique string or modify a noncritical file).
    2. Adjust the `package.json` (or use a controlled dependency repository) so that the updated version falls within the allowed version range.
    3. Run the CI workflow and verify that during `npm install` the new dependency version is chosen (for example, by logging the installed dependency version) and that the payload code is executed.
    4. Repeat the test with a package lock file in place (removing the `--no-package-lock` flag) to demonstrate that dependency resolution is then deterministic and the malicious version is not automatically installed.
