Based on your instructions, the vulnerability "Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Custom Rules/Configuration Files" should be included in the updated list.

Here is the vulnerability list in markdown format, after applying the filtering criteria:

### Vulnerability List:

- Vulnerability Name: Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Custom Rules/Configuration Files
- Description:
    1. An attacker crafts a malicious Markdown project.
    2. This project includes a custom rule file (e.g., `.vscode/malicious_rule.js`) or a configuration file (e.g., `.markdownlint.cjs`) containing malicious JavaScript code.
    3. The attacker distributes this malicious project to a victim, for example, by hosting it on a public repository or sending it as a compressed archive.
    4. The victim, unaware of the malicious nature of the project, downloads and opens it in Visual Studio Code with the markdownlint extension installed.
    5. If the victim trusts the workspace (by explicitly granting trust or if Workspace Trust is disabled), Visual Studio Code loads and activates the markdownlint extension.
    6. As part of its initialization or linting process, the markdownlint extension loads and executes the JavaScript code from the malicious custom rule or configuration file.
    7. This execution of attacker-controlled code within the victim's VS Code environment can lead to arbitrary code execution, potentially allowing the attacker to:
        - Steal sensitive data from the victim's machine.
        - Install malware or backdoors.
        - Modify files or system settings.
        - Pivot to other systems accessible from the victim's machine.
- Impact: Arbitrary code execution within the user's VS Code environment. This is a critical security vulnerability as it allows a remote attacker to gain complete control over the user's local machine within the context of VS Code, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.
- Vulnerability Rank: High
- Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - VS Code's Workspace Trust feature: VS Code implements a Workspace Trust mechanism that is designed to prevent automatic execution of code from untrusted workspaces. When a user opens a workspace, VS Code prompts them to decide whether to trust the workspace or not. If a workspace is not trusted, VS Code is supposed to block the execution of JavaScript from extensions in that workspace. This mitigation is mentioned in the `README.md` under the "Security" section.
- Missing Mitigations:
    - Sandboxing or isolation of custom rule and configuration file execution: The extension relies on VS Code's Workspace Trust for security. A more robust mitigation within the extension itself would be to sandbox or isolate the execution of custom rules and configuration files. This could involve running the code in a restricted environment with limited access to system resources and APIs, regardless of the Workspace Trust setting.
    - Input validation and sanitization: The extension could implement stricter input validation and sanitization for custom rules and configuration files to prevent the injection of malicious code. However, this might be complex and difficult to achieve effectively for JavaScript code.
    - Content Security Policy (CSP): Implementing a Content Security Policy within the extension could restrict the capabilities of executed JavaScript code, limiting the potential impact of malicious scripts.
- Preconditions:
    1. The victim user has Visual Studio Code installed with the markdownlint extension.
    2. The attacker has created a malicious Markdown project with a malicious custom rule or configuration file.
    3. The victim user is tricked into downloading and opening the malicious project in VS Code.
    4. The victim user trusts the workspace, either explicitly or implicitly (e.g., by disabling Workspace Trust or by not understanding the security implications of trusting a workspace).
- Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided project files do not include the core source code of the `markdownlint` VS Code extension itself. Therefore, direct code analysis of vulnerability is not possible with the given files.
    - However, the `README.md` file explicitly mentions the security risk associated with running JavaScript from custom rules and configuration files. It states: "Running JavaScript from custom rules, `markdown-it` plugins, or configuration files (such as `.markdownlint.cjs`/`.markdownlint-cli2.cjs`) could be a security risk, so VS Code's [Workspace Trust setting](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/workspace-trust) is honored to block JavaScript for untrusted workspaces."
    - This statement confirms that the extension does execute JavaScript from custom rules and configuration files and acknowledges the inherent security risk.
    - The reliance on VS Code's Workspace Trust as the primary mitigation suggests that if Workspace Trust is bypassed or if a user trusts a malicious workspace, arbitrary code execution is possible.
- Security Test Case:
    1. **Create a malicious project:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-markdown`.
        - Inside `malicious-markdown`, create a file named `.markdownlint.cjs` with the following content:
        ```javascript
        const childProcess = require('child_process');
        childProcess.execSync('calc.exe'); // For Windows - replace with 'open /Applications/Calculator.app' for macOS or 'gnome-calculator' for macOS or 'gnome-calculator' for Linux
        module.exports = {};
        ```
        - Create a dummy markdown file, e.g., `test.md`, inside `malicious-markdown`. The content doesn't matter.
        - Zip the `malicious-markdown` directory into `malicious-markdown.zip`.
    2. **Distribute the malicious project:**
        - Send `malicious-markdown.zip` to a test victim or make it available for download (for testing purposes, you can test it on your own machine as a victim).
    3. **Victim opens the malicious project:**
        - The victim downloads `malicious-markdown.zip` and extracts it to a folder.
        - The victim opens Visual Studio Code.
        - The victim opens the `malicious-markdown` folder in VS Code using "File" -> "Open Folder...".
    4. **Workspace Trust prompt (if enabled):**
        - VS Code may prompt "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?".
        - To trigger the vulnerability, the victim must choose "Trust Workspace" or explicitly trust the workspace. If Workspace Trust is disabled in VS Code settings, this prompt may not appear.
    5. **Observe for code execution:**
        - After trusting the workspace (or if Workspace Trust is disabled), observe if the calculator application (or the command specified in `.markdownlint.cjs`) is executed.
        - If the calculator launches, it confirms successful arbitrary code execution, demonstrating the vulnerability.

This test case demonstrates that if a user trusts a workspace containing a malicious `.markdownlint.cjs` file, arbitrary code execution can occur due to the markdownlint extension loading and executing the JavaScript code within this configuration file.
