## Vulnerability List

There are no identified vulnerabilities of high or critical rank based on the analysis of the project, considering the specified inclusion and exclusion criteria for external attackers targeting publicly available instances.

After analyzing the nature of a VS Code extension focused on markdown linting and its operational context, no exploitable vulnerabilities were found that meet the criteria of being high or critical rank, valid, not mitigated, and exploitable by an external attacker in a publicly available instance.

The project primarily performs static analysis of markdown files within the user's local VS Code environment. It does not expose network services or directly process external user input from public sources in a way that could lead to high-severity vulnerabilities exploitable by external actors.

The concerns about custom rules and JavaScript execution are acknowledged as inherent risks of extensible systems, but these are mitigated by VS Code's Workspace Trust mechanism and are not considered vulnerabilities in the extension itself, exploitable by external attackers in a publicly available instance as per the defined criteria.

Therefore, based on the project's functionality, the defined scope, and the specified vulnerability criteria, there are no vulnerabilities of high or critical rank to report at this time.
