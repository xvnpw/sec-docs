## Combined Vulnerability List

Here is the combined list of vulnerabilities, consolidated from the provided lists and formatted as requested.

- **Vulnerability Name:** Arbitrary Code Execution via Malicious Custom Rules or Configuration Files
  - **Description:**
    The markdownlint system supports loading custom rules and configuration files written in JavaScript (for example, files with names like `.markdownlint.cjs` or `.markdownlint-cli2.cjs`) as well as custom rule files specified in VS Code’s user or workspace settings. An external attacker who gains influence over repository content (for example via a pull request) could add a malicious custom rule file and modify the configuration to load it. When the linter runs in a trusted workspace (or in a CI build that does not validate the trust level), the custom rule file is executed without additional sandboxing. The execution of this untrusted JavaScript would allow arbitrary code execution in the environment where markdownlint is run.

    Alternatively, an attacker crafts a malicious Markdown project. This project includes a custom rule file (e.g., `.vscode/malicious_rule.js`) or a configuration file (e.g., `.markdownlint.cjs`) containing malicious JavaScript code. The attacker distributes this malicious project to a victim, for example, by hosting it on a public repository or sending it as a compressed archive. The victim, unaware of the malicious nature of the project, downloads and opens it in Visual Studio Code with the markdownlint extension installed. If the victim trusts the workspace (by explicitly granting trust or if Workspace Trust is disabled), Visual Studio Code loads and activates the markdownlint extension. As part of its initialization or linting process, the markdownlint extension loads and executes the JavaScript code from the malicious custom rule or configuration file. This execution of attacker-controlled code within the victim's VS Code environment can lead to arbitrary code execution.
  - **Impact:**
    If exploited, this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in a trusted environment. In a CI or a developer’s machine where the workspace is marked as trusted, the attacker’s code could access sensitive files, modify build outputs, or even compromise the host system.  More broadly, arbitrary code execution within the user's VS Code environment is possible. This is a critical security vulnerability as it allows a remote attacker to gain complete control over the user's local machine within the context of VS Code, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, and further attacks.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** Critical
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The README’s “Security” section warns that JavaScript from custom rules or configuration files could be dangerous and notes that VS Code’s Workspace Trust setting is honored to block JavaScript for untrusted workspaces. This means that if the workspace is not explicitly marked as trusted, custom JavaScript won’t run. VS Code's Workspace Trust feature is designed to prevent automatic execution of code from untrusted workspaces. When a user opens a workspace, VS Code prompts them to decide whether to trust the workspace or not. If a workspace is not trusted, VS Code is supposed to block the execution of JavaScript from extensions in that workspace. This mitigation is mentioned in the `README.md` under the "Security" section.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • There is no additional sandboxing or signature validation for custom rules or JavaScript configuration files when a workspace is trusted.
    • No static analysis or runtime restrictions (for example, via a secure evaluation or limited permissions runtime) are implemented to prevent malicious behaviors.
    • The system relies solely on the user’s workspace trust decision, which may be abused by sophisticated attackers.
    • Sandboxing or isolation of custom rule and configuration file execution within the extension itself would be more robust than relying solely on Workspace Trust. This could involve running the code in a restricted environment with limited access to system resources and APIs, regardless of the Workspace Trust setting.
    • Input validation and sanitization for custom rules and configuration files could prevent the injection of malicious code, although this might be complex for JavaScript.
    • Implementing a Content Security Policy (CSP) within the extension could restrict the capabilities of executed JavaScript code.
  - **Preconditions:**
    • The application (or CI job) must be running in a trusted context where custom JavaScript is allowed, or the victim user trusts the workspace, either explicitly or implicitly (e.g., by disabling Workspace Trust or by not understanding the security implications of trusting a workspace).
    • An attacker must be able to modify repository content (for example, via a pull request) so that a malicious custom rule or configuration file is included and then loaded by markdownlint, or the attacker has created a malicious Markdown project with a malicious custom rule or configuration file and tricked the victim user into opening it.
    • The victim user has Visual Studio Code installed with the markdownlint extension.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In the README file, the explanation of custom rules and configuration clearly details that JavaScript files (e.g., those prefixed with `./` in the configuration) are loaded automatically.
    2. The section entitled “Security” explicitly states that “Running JavaScript from custom rules, markdown-it plugins, or configuration files … could be a security risk” and that this risk is mitigated only by respecting VS Code’s Workspace Trust setting.
    3. No further checks are performed by markdownlint’s implementation to restrict what the loaded JavaScript may do. In a trusted workspace, a file such as `./.vscode/my-custom-rule.js` would be imported and executed without additional security validations.
    4. The `README.md` file explicitly mentions the security risk associated with running JavaScript from custom rules and configuration files, confirming that the extension does execute JavaScript from these files and acknowledges the inherent security risk.
    5. The reliance on VS Code's Workspace Trust as the primary mitigation suggests that if Workspace Trust is bypassed or if a user trusts a malicious workspace, arbitrary code execution is possible.
    - **Note:** Direct code analysis of vulnerability within the extension's source code is not possible with the given files, as only README and CI configuration are provided, not the extension's core source code.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled test environment (for example, a CI job running with a trusted workspace or a developer’s trusted VS Code instance), create a new branch that adds a new custom rule file (p. ex., `./malicious-rule.js`) with JavaScript code that performs a clearly observable side effect (such as writing a new file or printing a unique message to the console).
    2. Modify the project’s markdownlint configuration (or VS Code settings) to include the path to the malicious custom rule (e.g., `"markdownlint.customRules": ["./malicious-rule.js"]`).
    3. Trigger markdownlint (either by saving a Markdown file in VS Code or by running the linter in CI) and observe that the malicious code is executed (e.g., the side effect is visible in the command output or as a change in the file system).
    4. Verify that when the same code is run in an untrusted workspace, the malicious JavaScript is blocked, confirming that the only mitigation is workspace trust.

    Alternatively, to test via malicious project distribution:
    1. **Create a malicious project:**
        - Create a new directory named `malicious-markdown`.
        - Inside `malicious-markdown`, create a file named `.markdownlint.cjs` with the following content:
        ```javascript
        const childProcess = require('child_process');
        childProcess.execSync('calc.exe'); // For Windows - replace with 'open /Applications/Calculator.app' for macOS or 'gnome-calculator' for macOS or 'gnome-calculator' for Linux
        module.exports = {};
        ```
        - Create a dummy markdown file, e.g., `test.md`, inside `malicious-markdown`. The content doesn't matter.
        - Zip the `malicious-markdown` directory into `malicious-markdown.zip`.
    2. **Distribute the malicious project:**
        - Send `malicious-markdown.zip` to a test victim or make it available for download (for testing purposes, you can test it on your own machine as a victim).
    3. **Victim opens the malicious project:**
        - The victim downloads `malicious-markdown.zip` and extracts it to a folder.
        - The victim opens Visual Studio Code.
        - The victim opens the `malicious-markdown` folder in VS Code using "File" -> "Open Folder...".
    4. **Workspace Trust prompt (if enabled):**
        - VS Code may prompt "Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?".
        - To trigger the vulnerability, the victim must choose "Trust Workspace" or explicitly trust the workspace. If Workspace Trust is disabled in VS Code settings, this prompt may not appear.
    5. **Observe for code execution:**
        - After trusting the workspace (or if Workspace Trust is disabled), observe if the calculator application (or the command specified in `.markdownlint.cjs`) is executed.
        - If the calculator launches, it confirms successful arbitrary code execution, demonstrating the vulnerability.


- **Vulnerability Name:** Insecure Dependency Resolution Due to Absence of a Package Lock
  - **Description:**
    In the CI workflow defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the command used to install Node.js packages explicitly disables the use of a package lock file by using the flag `--no-package-lock` during `npm install`. Without a package lock file, dependency resolution relies solely on the version ranges specified in `package.json`. This non-deterministic resolution can allow an attacker to publish a malicious version of a dependency that still satisfies the version semver ranges defined, which might be picked up at install time.
  - **Impact:**
    An attacker who successfully publishes compromised versions of a dependency that match the allowed version ranges could inject arbitrary code into the CI build process. This might result in arbitrary code execution within the CI environment, compromise of build artifacts, or even supply-chain attacks that affect downstream users.
  - **Vulnerability Rank:** High
  - **Currently Implemented Mitigations:**
    The project’s CONTRIBUTING guidelines stress the importance of “pinning” dependency versions to ensure consistent behavior, but there is no technical enforcement of a package lock file during continuous integration.
  - **Missing Mitigations:**
    • The CI workflow does not enforce the use of a package lock file (or a lockfile equivalent such as `npm-shrinkwrap.json`), leaving dependency resolution open to variation.
    • No integrity checking (for example, via npm audit or verifying package signatures) is performed during dependency installation in the CI job.
    • The explicit use of the `--no-package-lock` flag directly contradicts the push for dependency pinning, exposing the CI environment to potential malicious dependency updates.
  - **Preconditions:**
    • The project must have dependency version ranges (from a `package.json`) that do not strictly pin dependency versions.
    • An attacker must be able to publish (or compromise) a version of a dependency that falls within the allowed semver range and is later resolved by the CI process.
    • The CI workflow must run using the `npm install --no-package-lock` command so that a lockfile (even if locally generated) is not used.
  - **Source Code Analysis:**
    1. In the file `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the step for installing dependencies is defined as:
       ```
       - run: npm install --no-package-lock
       ```
    2. The absence of a package lock file in the repository (and the explicit flag disabling its use) means that when running `npm install`, the system resolves dependencies based solely on the version ranges defined in the project’s metadata.
    3. This configuration creates a window in which the installed versions may differ from development or testing builds, thereby opening a potential supply-chain vulnerability.
  - **Security Test Case:**
    1. In a controlled CI environment, simulate the publish of a dummy dependency update that includes an intentional “payload” (for testing purposes, the payload might log a unique string or modify a noncritical file).
    2. Adjust the `package.json` (or use a controlled dependency repository) so that the updated version falls within the allowed version range.
    3. Run the CI workflow and verify that during `npm install` the new dependency version is chosen (for example, by logging the installed dependency version) and that the payload code is executed.
    4. Repeat the test with a package lock file in place (removing the `--no-package-lock` flag) to demonstrate that dependency resolution is then deterministic and the malicious version is not automatically installed.
