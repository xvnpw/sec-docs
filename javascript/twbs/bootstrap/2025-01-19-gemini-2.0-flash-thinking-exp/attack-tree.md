## Attack Tree Visualization

```
*   OR: **Execute Malicious Code in User's Browser (CRITICAL NODE)**
    *   **AND: Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Bootstrap (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        *   OR: **Exploit Vulnerability in Bootstrap's JavaScript (CRITICAL NODE)**
            *   **Exploit Known Vulnerability in Bootstrap JS Library (e.g., CVE) (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
        *   OR: **Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Bootstrap Components (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   **Inject Malicious Code via Data Attributes (HIGH-RISK PATH)**
            *   **Inject Malicious Code via Unsanitized User Input in Bootstrap Components (HIGH-RISK PATH - CRITICAL NODE)**

## Attack Tree Path: [Execute Malicious Code in User's Browser (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/execute_malicious_code_in_user's_browser__critical_node_.md)

This is the overarching goal where the attacker aims to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser session in the context of the vulnerable application. Successful execution can lead to account takeover, data theft, redirection to malicious sites, and other harmful actions.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Bootstrap (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_bootstrap__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on leveraging weaknesses within the Bootstrap framework to inject and execute malicious scripts in the user's browser. The attacker exploits how Bootstrap handles or renders content, or vulnerabilities within Bootstrap's own JavaScript code.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Vulnerability in Bootstrap's JavaScript (CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_vulnerability_in_bootstrap's_javascript__critical_node_.md)

This involves targeting known or zero-day vulnerabilities within the core Bootstrap JavaScript library. If successful, the attacker can bypass application-level security measures and directly execute scripts through Bootstrap's functionality.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Vulnerability in Bootstrap JS Library (e.g., CVE) (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_vulnerability_in_bootstrap_js_library__e_g___cve___high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers identify and exploit publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) in the specific version of Bootstrap being used by the application. This often involves using readily available exploit code or techniques.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious HTML/JavaScript via Bootstrap Components (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_htmljavascript_via_bootstrap_components__high-risk_path_.md)

This path focuses on injecting malicious code through the various components provided by Bootstrap, such as modals, tooltips, popovers, and others. The attacker manipulates how these components render content to introduce harmful scripts.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Data Attributes (HIGH-RISK PATH)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_data_attributes__high-risk_path_.md)

Attackers inject malicious JavaScript code within HTML data attributes (e.g., `data-bs-content`, `data-bs-original-title`) that are processed by Bootstrap's JavaScript. When Bootstrap's scripts read and use these attributes, the injected JavaScript is executed. This often occurs when user-provided data is directly placed into data attributes without proper sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Inject Malicious Code via Unsanitized User Input in Bootstrap Components (HIGH-RISK PATH - CRITICAL NODE)](./attack_tree_paths/inject_malicious_code_via_unsanitized_user_input_in_bootstrap_components__high-risk_path_-_critical__4f5e6363.md)

This is a very common and critical attack vector. Attackers inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code into user-controlled input fields or data that is subsequently rendered by Bootstrap components without proper sanitization. When the application displays this unsanitized content using Bootstrap components, the malicious script is executed in the user's browser. This is a fundamental XSS vulnerability.
