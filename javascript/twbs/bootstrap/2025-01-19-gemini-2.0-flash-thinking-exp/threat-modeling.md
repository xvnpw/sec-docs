# Threat Model Analysis for twbs/bootstrap

## Threat: [Client-Side Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Bootstrap Tooltip/Popover `data-bs-content` attribute](./threats/client-side_cross-site_scripting__xss__via_bootstrap_tooltippopover__data-bs-content__attribute.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the `data-bs-content` attribute of a Bootstrap tooltip or popover. When the tooltip/popover is displayed (e.g., on hover or click), the browser executes the injected script. This vulnerability exists within Bootstrap's JavaScript if it doesn't properly sanitize or encode this attribute's content.
* **Impact:** An attacker could steal session cookies, redirect the user to a malicious website, or perform actions on behalf of the user within the application.
* **Affected Bootstrap Component:** `tooltip.js`, `popover.js` (specifically the handling of the `data-bs-content` attribute).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep Bootstrap updated to the latest version, as security patches are often released for such vulnerabilities.
    * Ensure that the application's usage of Bootstrap components does not involve directly setting `data-bs-content` with unsanitized user input.

## Threat: [Subresource Integrity (SRI) Bypass leading to Malicious Code Injection](./threats/subresource_integrity__sri__bypass_leading_to_malicious_code_injection.md)

* **Description:** If Bootstrap is loaded from a CDN *without* proper Subresource Integrity (SRI) checks, and the CDN is compromised, an attacker could inject malicious code into the Bootstrap files served to users. While the vulnerability isn't in Bootstrap's code itself, the *lack* of SRI usage when relying on a CDN directly exposes the application to risks associated with Bootstrap's code being tampered with.
* **Impact:** Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript or CSS, leading to XSS, data theft, or other malicious activities, effectively compromising the application through the tampered Bootstrap library.
* **Affected Bootstrap Component:** The entire Bootstrap library as served from the potentially compromised CDN.
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * **Always** use SRI tags when loading Bootstrap from a CDN. This is a critical defense against CDN compromise.

## Threat: [Using Outdated Versions of Bootstrap with Known Vulnerabilities](./threats/using_outdated_versions_of_bootstrap_with_known_vulnerabilities.md)

* **Description:** Older versions of Bootstrap may contain known security vulnerabilities within its JavaScript or CSS code that have been patched in later releases.
* **Impact:** The application becomes vulnerable to exploits targeting those specific vulnerabilities within Bootstrap, potentially leading to XSS, code execution, or other security breaches.
* **Affected Bootstrap Component:** Potentially all components, depending on the specific vulnerability present in the outdated version.
* **Risk Severity:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability (can be Critical).
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Keep Bootstrap updated to the latest stable version. Regularly monitor for new releases and security advisories from the Bootstrap team.
