# Threat Model Analysis for twbs/bootstrap

## Threat: [CDN-Hosted Bootstrap File Tampering (Spoofing)](./threats/cdn-hosted_bootstrap_file_tampering__spoofing_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises the CDN hosting Bootstrap's CSS or JavaScript files, or uses a man-in-the-middle attack to intercept the request, replacing the legitimate files with malicious versions. The attacker could inject code to steal user data, redirect users to phishing sites, or deface the website. This directly impacts Bootstrap because the attack vector *is* the delivery mechanism of the framework itself.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Complete compromise of user data (credentials, personal information).
        *   Redirection to malicious websites.
        *   Website defacement and loss of user trust.
        *   Potential malware distribution.
    *   **Affected Bootstrap Component:** All components loaded from the CDN (CSS, JavaScript, potentially fonts). This affects *all* Bootstrap components since they rely on the core CSS and JS.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Critical
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Mandatory:** Use Subresource Integrity (SRI) tags for *all* Bootstrap files loaded from a CDN.  This ensures the browser verifies the integrity of the downloaded files.
        *   Host Bootstrap locally and maintain strict control over the files.  This eliminates the CDN as a single point of failure.
        *   Regularly audit and verify the integrity of locally hosted files against known good copies.

## Threat: [Malicious CSS Overrides (Tampering) - *Specifically Targeting Bootstrap Classes*](./threats/malicious_css_overrides__tampering__-_specifically_targeting_bootstrap_classes.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability or another injection flaw to inject custom CSS that *specifically targets and overrides* Bootstrap's default styles. The attacker leverages knowledge of Bootstrap's class names to achieve a malicious outcome.  For example, hiding warning messages styled with `.alert-danger`, changing button appearances using `.btn-primary` and `.btn-danger` to mislead users, or altering layout elements using `.d-none` to hide crucial information. This is distinct from general CSS injection because it *relies on the presence and structure of Bootstrap's CSS*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Users tricked into performing unintended actions (e.g., deleting data, submitting forms to the attacker).
        *   Information disclosure (if hidden elements are revealed).
        *   Usability issues and confusion.
    *   **Affected Bootstrap Component:** Any component styled with Bootstrap classes that can be overridden. This includes, but is not limited to:
        *   Alerts (`.alert`, `.alert-danger`, etc.)
        *   Buttons (`.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-danger`, etc.)
        *   Forms (`.form-control`, `.form-label`, etc.)
        *   Layout utilities (`.d-none`, `.d-block`, `.row`, `.col`, etc.)
        *   Navigation components (`.navbar`, `.nav-link`, etc.)
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Crucial:** Prevent XSS vulnerabilities through rigorous input validation and output encoding.
        *   Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) that restricts the sources of CSS. Specifically, disallow inline styles (`style-src 'self'`) and only allow styles from trusted sources.
        *   Use a CSS linter to identify potentially dangerous CSS patterns, especially those targeting common Bootstrap class names.
        *   Regularly review custom CSS for security vulnerabilities.

## Threat: [DOM Manipulation of Bootstrap JavaScript Components (Tampering) - *Directly Targeting Bootstrap's JS API*](./threats/dom_manipulation_of_bootstrap_javascript_components__tampering__-_directly_targeting_bootstrap's_js__54d4a5d8.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits an XSS vulnerability to execute JavaScript that *directly interacts with Bootstrap's JavaScript API*.  The attacker leverages knowledge of Bootstrap's JavaScript functions and methods to manipulate components. Examples include bypassing modal dialogs using `$('#myModal').modal('hide')`, modifying tooltip content, disabling form validation by manipulating Bootstrap's validation classes, or forcing collapse/expand actions. This is a direct threat to Bootstrap because it targets the framework's *intended functionality*.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Bypass of security controls (e.g., confirmation dialogs).
        *   Display of misleading or malicious information.
        *   Submission of invalid or malicious data.
        *   Disruption of intended application flow.
    *   **Affected Bootstrap Component:**
        *   Modals (`modal()`)
        *   Tooltips (`tooltip()`)
        *   Popovers (`popover()`)
        *   Forms (validation classes)
        *   Collapse (`collapse()`)
        *   Carousel (`carousel()`)
        *   Dropdowns (`dropdown()`)
        *   Any component relying on Bootstrap's JavaScript.
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Essential:** Prevent XSS vulnerabilities through rigorous input validation and output encoding.
        *   Avoid using `eval()` or similar functions.
        *   Consider using a JavaScript framework (React, Vue, Angular) that provides built-in protection against DOM manipulation.
        *   Implement server-side validation for *all* form submissions.

## Threat: [Misuse of Visually Hidden Elements (Elevation of Privilege) - *Leveraging Bootstrap's Hiding Utilities*](./threats/misuse_of_visually_hidden_elements__elevation_of_privilege__-_leveraging_bootstrap's_hiding_utilitie_1b968fd0.md)

*   **Description:** Developers use Bootstrap's visually hidden classes (e.g., `.visually-hidden`) to hide elements intended for administrative use, but *fail to implement proper server-side authorization*. An attacker uses browser developer tools to remove the Bootstrap-provided hiding class, gaining access to unauthorized functionality. The threat is directly related to Bootstrap because it's the *framework's utility* that is being misused.
    *   **Impact:**
        *   Unauthorized access to administrative features.
        *   Potential data breaches or system compromise.
    *   **Affected Bootstrap Component:** Utility classes for hiding content, specifically `.visually-hidden` (and older versions' `.sr-only`).
    *   **Risk Severity:** High
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Critical:** Implement robust server-side authorization checks for *all* actions and data. Never rely solely on client-side UI elements for security.
        *   Thoroughly test all user interfaces, including hidden elements.
        *   Follow the principle of least privilege.

## Threat: [Exploitation of Known *Bootstrap-Specific* Vulnerabilities (Multiple Categories)](./threats/exploitation_of_known_bootstrap-specific_vulnerabilities__multiple_categories_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker exploits a known, unpatched vulnerability *within the Bootstrap framework itself*. This is distinct from general web vulnerabilities; the flaw exists *within Bootstrap's code*. This could involve CSS injection, XSS, DoS, or other attack vectors, depending on the specific vulnerability.
    *   **Impact:** Varies depending on the specific vulnerability, but could range from UI glitches to complete system compromise.
    *   **Affected Bootstrap Component:** Depends on the specific vulnerability. Could be any component.
    *   **Risk Severity:** Varies (High to Critical) depending on the vulnerability.
    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
        *   **Paramount:** Keep Bootstrap updated to the latest stable release. Subscribe to Bootstrap's security advisories or release announcements.
        *   Regularly scan the application for known vulnerabilities, specifically looking for outdated Bootstrap versions.
        *   Implement a robust patching process.
