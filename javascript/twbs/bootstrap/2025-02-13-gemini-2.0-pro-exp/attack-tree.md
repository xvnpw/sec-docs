## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated Bootstrap Versions](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_outdated_bootstrap_versions.md)

*   **Critical Node:** `[Outdated Bootstrap (e.g., v3.x)]***`
    *   **Description:**  The application is using an outdated version of Bootstrap (e.g., 3.x or earlier) that contains known, publicly disclosed vulnerabilities.  This is a critical node because it's a common and easily exploitable entry point.
    *   **Likelihood:** High (Many sites neglect dependency updates)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (Depends on the specific vulnerabilities present in the outdated version)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Identifying the version is often trivial)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie (Checking the version number)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Very Easy (Version number is often exposed)

*   **Critical Node:** `[Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in Older Version]***`
    *   **Description:** The attacker leverages publicly available exploits or develops their own based on disclosed vulnerabilities in the outdated Bootstrap version.  This is critical because it represents the actual exploitation step.
    *   **Likelihood:** Medium to High (Depends on vulnerability specifics and public exploit availability)
    *   **Impact:** Medium to Very High (Depends on the specific vulnerability exploited)
    *   **Effort:** Low to Medium (Public exploits reduce effort; custom exploits require more)
    *   **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium (Relies on intrusion detection/prevention systems and vulnerability scanning)

* **Attack Vector Details:**
    1.  **Reconnaissance:** Attacker identifies the target application and determines it uses Bootstrap.  They inspect the source code, HTTP headers, or use automated tools to identify the specific Bootstrap version.
    2.  **Vulnerability Research:** Attacker searches vulnerability databases (e.g., CVE, NVD) for known vulnerabilities affecting the identified Bootstrap version.  They prioritize vulnerabilities with publicly available exploits or those that are easily exploitable.
    3.  **Exploit Selection/Development:**  Attacker chooses a suitable exploit or develops a custom one based on the vulnerability details.  This might involve crafting malicious input, manipulating URLs, or exploiting specific Bootstrap components.
    4.  **Exploitation:** Attacker delivers the exploit to the target application.  This could be through a web form, URL parameter, HTTP header, or other input vectors.
    5.  **Post-Exploitation:**  Depending on the vulnerability, the attacker may gain XSS, achieve DoS, or gain other unauthorized access.

## Attack Tree Path: [Using Untrusted Bootstrap Themes/Templates](./attack_tree_paths/using_untrusted_bootstrap_themestemplates.md)

*   **Critical Node:** `[Using Untrusted Bootstrap Themes/Templates]***`
    *   **Description:** The application incorporates a Bootstrap theme or template obtained from an untrusted source (e.g., a random website, a forum post, a cracked theme repository). This is critical because it introduces a direct vector for malicious code.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Depends on developer practices; responsible developers use trusted sources)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (Theme could contain any type of malicious code)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (Downloading and using a theme)
    *   **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires code review, dynamic analysis)

*   **Critical Node:** `[Theme/Template Contains Malicious JS/CSS]***`
    *   **Description:** The untrusted theme or template includes malicious JavaScript or CSS code designed to compromise the application. This is critical because it's the payload delivery mechanism.
    *   **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Higher if from a known malicious source)
    *   **Impact:** High to Very High (XSS, data exfiltration, complete site compromise)
    *   **Effort:** Very Low (For the attacker who *uses* the theme; high for the attacker who *created* it)
    *   **Skill Level:** (User: Script Kiddie; Theme Creator: Intermediate to Advanced)
    *   **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires thorough code review, dynamic analysis, sandboxing)

*   **Attack Vector Details:**
    1.  **Theme Acquisition:** The developer (unwittingly) downloads a malicious Bootstrap theme or template from an untrusted source.
    2.  **Theme Integration:** The developer integrates the theme into their application, typically by including the theme's CSS and JavaScript files.
    3.  **Malicious Code Execution:** When a user visits the application, the malicious JavaScript or CSS within the theme is executed in the user's browser.
    4.  **Exploitation:** The malicious code can perform various actions, such as:
        *   **XSS:** Steal cookies, redirect users, deface the site, inject phishing forms.
        *   **Data Exfiltration:** Send sensitive data (form inputs, user information) to an attacker-controlled server.
        *   **Drive-by Downloads:** Attempt to install malware on the user's system.
        *   **Cryptojacking:** Use the user's browser to mine cryptocurrency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploiting Specific XSS Vulnerability (CVE-XXXX-XXXX)](./attack_tree_paths/exploiting_specific_xss_vulnerability__cve-xxxx-xxxx_.md)

* **Critical Node:** `[CVE-XXXX-XXXX (XSS)]`
    * **Description:** Represents a specific, known XSS vulnerability.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

* **Critical Node:** `[Craft Malicious Input to Trigger Stored/Reflected XSS]`
    * **Description:** The attacker crafts input to trigger the vulnerability.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

* **Critical Node:** `[XSS]*`
    * **Description:** Successful XSS execution.
    * **Likelihood:** Medium
    * **Impact:** High
    * **Effort:** Low to Medium
    * **Skill Level:** Beginner to Intermediate
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium

* **Attack Vector Details:**
    1. **Vulnerability Research:** Attacker researches the specific CVE and understands how to trigger the XSS.
    2. **Payload Crafting:** Attacker crafts a malicious JavaScript payload designed to achieve their objective (e.g., steal cookies, redirect users).
    3. **Injection:** Attacker injects the payload into the vulnerable input field.
    4. **Execution:** If the application doesn't properly sanitize the input, the payload is executed in the context of the victim's browser.
    5. **Post-Exploitation:** Attacker achieves their objective (e.g., session hijacking, defacement).

## Attack Tree Path: [XSS/Data Exfiltration (Resulting from Malicious Theme)](./attack_tree_paths/xssdata_exfiltration__resulting_from_malicious_theme_.md)

* **Critical Node:** `[XSS/Data Exfiltration]*`
    * **Description:** This represents the successful outcome of the malicious theme attack, where the attacker achieves XSS or data exfiltration.
    * **Likelihood:** Low to Medium (Dependent on the presence of malicious code in the theme)
    * **Impact:** High to Very High (Loss of sensitive data, account compromise, reputational damage)
    * **Effort:** Very Low (The attacker simply benefits from the user visiting the compromised site)
    * **Skill Level:** Script Kiddie (For the attacker leveraging the theme; the theme creator would have higher skill)
    * **Detection Difficulty:** Medium to Hard (Requires monitoring for unusual network traffic, data exfiltration attempts, and analyzing user behavior)

* **Attack Vector Details:** This is a *consequence* of the "Theme/Template Contains Malicious JS/CSS" node, so the attack vector is the same as described above. The focus here is on the *outcome* of the attack.
