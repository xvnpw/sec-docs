# BUSINESS POSTURE

The Bootstrap project aims to provide a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It offers a collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components and tools that enable developers to rapidly prototype and build web applications and websites with consistent design and layout across different browsers and devices.

Business Priorities and Goals:
- Provide a widely adopted, user-friendly, and well-documented front-end framework.
- Enable rapid web development and prototyping.
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness.
- Foster a strong community around the framework for continuous improvement and support.
- Maintain the framework as open-source and freely accessible.

Business Risks:
- Security vulnerabilities within the framework could impact a vast number of websites and applications using Bootstrap.
- Lack of timely security updates and patches could lead to widespread exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- Changes in web standards or browser technologies could render parts of the framework obsolete or insecure.
- Dependency on community contributions for security fixes might lead to delays or inconsistencies.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls:
- security control: Open-source development model allowing for community review of code. Implemented through GitHub repository and public contributions.
- security control: Reliance on community reporting for identifying potential vulnerabilities. Implemented through GitHub issue tracker and community forums.
- accepted risk:  Potential for vulnerabilities to exist in the codebase due to the complexity and scale of the framework.
- accepted risk:  Reliance on community for security contributions may lead to slower response times compared to dedicated security teams.

Recommended Security Controls:
- security control: Implement automated security scanning tools (SAST, DAST, dependency scanning) in the CI/CD pipeline to proactively identify vulnerabilities.
- security control: Establish a formal vulnerability disclosure and response process with defined SLAs for addressing security issues.
- security control: Conduct periodic security audits by external security experts to review the codebase and identify potential weaknesses.
- security control: Provide security guidelines and best practices for developers using Bootstrap to mitigate common security pitfalls in web application development.

Security Requirements:
- Authentication: Not directly applicable to Bootstrap framework itself, as it's a front-end library. Authentication is the responsibility of applications built using Bootstrap.
- Authorization: Not directly applicable to Bootstrap framework itself. Authorization is the responsibility of applications built using Bootstrap.
- Input Validation: Bootstrap components rely on developers to implement proper input validation in their applications. Bootstrap itself provides tools for form validation, but it's not enforced automatically. Developers must be educated on the importance of validating user inputs on both client and server-side when using Bootstrap forms and components.
- Cryptography: Bootstrap does not directly implement cryptographic functions. If applications built with Bootstrap require cryptography, developers must use secure and well-vetted cryptographic libraries and implement them correctly within their application logic. Bootstrap's role is limited to providing the UI elements and layout for applications that might incorporate cryptography.

    BuildServer -- "Run Build Scripts" --> BuildServer
    BuildServer -- "Run SAST" --> SAST
    BuildServer -- "Run Linter" --> Linter

    style Build_System_CI fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
    style Artifact_Repository fill:#eee,stroke:#333,stroke-width:1px
```

Build Process Description:

1. Developer writes code on their local Developer PC.
2. Developer commits code changes to the Version Control System (VCS) like GitHub.
3. Build Server (part of CI system) detects code changes in VCS.
4. Build Server fetches project dependencies using Dependency Manager (npm, yarn).
5. Build Server executes build scripts to compile CSS (Sass), bundle JavaScript, generate documentation, etc.
6. Build Server runs SAST (Static Application Security Testing) scanner to identify potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
7. Build Server runs Linter to enforce code quality and style guidelines.
8. Build Server publishes build artifacts:
    - Packages (JavaScript modules, CSS files) are published to a Package Registry (like npm).
    - Static assets (CSS, JS, fonts, etc.) are published to CDN Storage for CDN distribution.

Build Process Security Controls:

- security control: Version Control System (VCS) for tracking code changes and collaboration. Implemented using GitHub.
- security control: Secure Build Server environment. Implemented within CI infrastructure.
- security control: Dependency Management to control and track external libraries. Implemented using npm/yarn and `package-lock.json`/`yarn.lock`.
- security control: Potential future implementation of SAST scanner to automatically detect code vulnerabilities during build.
- security control: Linter to enforce code quality and potentially catch some basic security issues. Implemented using linters configured in the build process.
- security control: Package signing when publishing to package registries (if applicable and implemented).
- security control: Access control to build system and artifact repositories to prevent unauthorized modifications.

# RISK ASSESSMENT

Critical Business Processes:
- Maintaining the integrity and availability of the Bootstrap framework.
- Ensuring the framework is free from vulnerabilities that could be exploited in applications using it.
- Providing a reliable and trustworthy source of front-end components for web developers.

Data to Protect:
- Source code of the Bootstrap framework. Sensitivity: Publicly available, but integrity is critical.
- Build artifacts (CSS, JavaScript files, documentation). Sensitivity: Publicly available, but integrity and availability are critical.
- Documentation content. Sensitivity: Publicly available, but integrity and availability are critical.

Data Sensitivity:
- Publicly available data, but integrity is paramount to maintain trust and prevent supply chain attacks. Compromised source code or build artifacts could lead to widespread vulnerabilities in applications using Bootstrap.
