## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Application via Bootstrap Weaknesses](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_application_via_bootstrap_weaknesses.md)

This is the root goal. Success means the attacker has achieved their objective by exploiting Bootstrap-related issues.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Client-Side Vulnerabilities in Bootstrap Usage](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_client-side_vulnerabilities_in_bootstrap_usage.md)

This critical node represents the category of attacks targeting vulnerabilities in the client-side code of Bootstrap or its usage.
    * It encompasses exploiting known Bootstrap vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Known Bootstrap Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_known_bootstrap_vulnerabilities.md)

This critical node focuses on leveraging publicly known vulnerabilities (CVEs) in Bootstrap itself.
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Target Outdated Bootstrap Version:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Applications using outdated Bootstrap versions are susceptible to known vulnerabilities.
        * **Attack Steps:**
            * **Identify Application's Bootstrap Version:** Attacker determines the Bootstrap version used by the application.
            * **Check for Publicly Known CVEs:** Attacker searches for CVEs associated with the identified Bootstrap version.
            * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit Identified Vulnerability:** Attacker uses publicly available or custom exploits to target the known vulnerability in the outdated Bootstrap version.
        * **Impact:** Can lead to XSS, DOM-based vulnerabilities, or other client-side exploits, potentially resulting in account compromise, data theft, or defacement.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Exploit Misconfiguration or Improper Usage of Bootstrap Components](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__exploit_misconfiguration_or_improper_usage_of_bootstrap_components.md)

This critical node highlights vulnerabilities arising from how developers use Bootstrap components insecurely.
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit XSS via Bootstrap Components:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Improper handling of user input when used with Bootstrap components (like modals, tooltips, popovers) can lead to XSS.
        * **Attack Steps:**
            * **Identify Input Points:** Attacker identifies areas where user input interacts with Bootstrap components.
            * **Inject Malicious Payloads:** Attacker injects malicious scripts into input fields or URL parameters that are processed by the application.
            * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Trigger Bootstrap Components to Render Malicious Payloads:** Attacker manipulates the application to trigger Bootstrap components to render the injected malicious payloads, resulting in XSS execution in the user's browser.
        * **Impact:** XSS vulnerabilities can allow attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to session hijacking, account takeover, data theft, or defacement.

## Attack Tree Path: [[CRITICAL NODE] Compromise Local Bootstrap Files (If hosting Bootstrap locally)](./attack_tree_paths/_critical_node__compromise_local_bootstrap_files__if_hosting_bootstrap_locally_.md)

This critical node focuses on attacks where the attacker targets locally hosted Bootstrap files.
    * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Server-Side Compromise:**
        * **Attack Vector:** Exploiting server-side vulnerabilities to gain access to the server's file system and modify Bootstrap files.
        * **Attack Steps:**
            * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Exploit server-side vulnerabilities:** Attacker exploits server-side vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or Remote Code Execution in the application.
            * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Gain access to the server's file system:** Successful server-side exploitation grants the attacker access to the server's file system.
            * **[HIGH-RISK PATH] Modify or replace local Bootstrap files with malicious versions:** Attacker replaces or modifies the locally hosted Bootstrap files with malicious versions containing backdoors or malicious scripts.
        * **Impact:**  Serving malicious Bootstrap files to all application users can lead to widespread compromise, including data theft, account compromise, and complete application takeover.
