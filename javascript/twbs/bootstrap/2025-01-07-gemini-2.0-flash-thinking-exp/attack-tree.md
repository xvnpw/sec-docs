# Attack Tree Analysis for twbs/bootstrap

Objective: Attacker's Goal: To gain unauthorized access or control over an application by exploiting weaknesses or vulnerabilities within the Bootstrap framework used by the application (focusing on high-risk scenarios).

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Known Bootstrap Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_known_bootstrap_vulnerabilities.md)

* Exploit Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerabilities (Critical Node):
    * Attack Vector: Attackers identify and exploit XSS vulnerabilities within Bootstrap components (e.g., in older versions or specific implementations).
    * Critical Node: Inject Malicious Script via Vulnerable Bootstrap Component: This is the key action where the attacker injects malicious scripts.
        * Critical Node: Inject script through vulnerable attribute or event handler: The specific method of injecting the script.
* Exploit Dependency Vulnerabilities in Bootstrap's Dependencies (if any):
    * Attack Vector: Attackers target known vulnerabilities in libraries that Bootstrap relies on (e.g., Popper.js).
    * Critical Node: Leverage Vulnerable Dependency: The attacker focuses on exploiting a flaw in a Bootstrap dependency.
        * Critical Node: Exploit the vulnerability in the dependency: The actual execution of the exploit against the vulnerable dependency.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Developer Misconfigurations and Misuse of Bootstrap](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_developer_misconfigurations_and_misuse_of_bootstrap.md)

* Insecure Customization of Bootstrap Components (Critical Node):
    * Attack Vector: Developers introduce vulnerabilities while customizing Bootstrap's CSS or JavaScript.
    * Critical Node: Introduce Vulnerabilities During Customization: The act of modifying Bootstrap in a way that creates a security flaw.
        * Critical Node: Modify Bootstrap's CSS or JavaScript in a way that introduces XSS: A common mistake leading to a high-impact vulnerability.
* Using Outdated and Vulnerable Bootstrap Version (Critical Node):
    * Attack Vector: The application uses an old version of Bootstrap with known, unpatched vulnerabilities.
    * Critical Node: Exploit Known Vulnerabilities in the Outdated Version: Attackers target publicly known flaws in the specific Bootstrap version.
        * Critical Node: Exploit publicly known vulnerabilities for that version: The execution of exploits against the outdated Bootstrap version.
* Embedding User-Controlled Content Directly into Bootstrap Components without Sanitization (Critical Node):
    * Attack Vector: The application displays user-provided content within Bootstrap components (e.g., modals, alerts) without proper sanitization.
    * Critical Node: Inject Malicious Content via Bootstrap: The attacker leverages Bootstrap components to inject malicious content.
        * Critical Node: Inject malicious HTML or JavaScript through unsanitized input: The direct injection of harmful code due to lack of sanitization.

## Attack Tree Path: [Exploit Bootstrap's Reliance on Client-Side Rendering](./attack_tree_paths/exploit_bootstrap's_reliance_on_client-side_rendering.md)

* Manipulate the DOM Before Bootstrap Initializes (Critical Node):
    * Attack Vector: Attackers inject malicious HTML or JavaScript into the page before Bootstrap's scripts have fully loaded and initialized.
    * Critical Node: Manipulate the DOM Before Bootstrap Initializes: The crucial window of opportunity for pre-Bootstrap manipulation.
        * Critical Node: Inject malicious HTML or JavaScript before Bootstrap's scripts execute: The direct action of injecting malicious code early in the page load process.
