# Threat Model Analysis for twbs/bootstrap

## Threat: [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) via Data Attributes](./threats/cross-site_scripting__xss__via_data_attributes.md)

**Description:** An attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into HTML attributes that Bootstrap uses for dynamic content, such as `data-bs-content` in tooltips or popovers. When the browser renders the page and Bootstrap initializes these components, the malicious script is executed. This is a direct consequence of how Bootstrap handles and renders content from these attributes.

**Impact:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, potentially stealing session cookies, redirecting the user to a malicious site, defacing the website, or performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Affected Bootstrap Component:** Tooltip component, Popover component, potentially other components utilizing data attributes for dynamic content.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Always sanitize user-provided data before using it in HTML attributes, especially those used by Bootstrap components.
*   Utilize templating engines or security libraries that automatically escape HTML entities.
*   Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which scripts can be executed.

## Threat: [Supply Chain Attack via Compromised Bootstrap CDN](./threats/supply_chain_attack_via_compromised_bootstrap_cdn.md)

**Description:** An attacker compromises a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that hosts Bootstrap files. They inject malicious code directly into the Bootstrap CSS or JavaScript files served by the CDN. When users access a website using this compromised CDN, the malicious code, which is part of the Bootstrap library they are loading, is executed in their browsers.

**Impact:**  The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser, leading to data theft, session hijacking, redirection to malicious sites, or other client-side attacks.

**Affected Bootstrap Component:** All Bootstrap components, as the malicious code is injected into core CSS or JavaScript files.

**Risk Severity:** Critical

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Utilize Subresource Integrity (SRI) hashes for Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript files loaded from CDNs. This ensures the browser only executes the files if their content matches the expected hash.
*   Consider self-hosting Bootstrap files to reduce reliance on third-party CDNs.
*   Regularly monitor the integrity of hosted Bootstrap files if self-hosting.

## Threat: [Exploiting Known Vulnerabilities in Outdated Bootstrap Version](./threats/exploiting_known_vulnerabilities_in_outdated_bootstrap_version.md)

**Description:** A website uses an outdated version of Bootstrap that contains publicly known security vulnerabilities within its code. Attackers can directly leverage these vulnerabilities present in Bootstrap's JavaScript or CSS to compromise the website or its users.

**Impact:**  Depending on the specific vulnerability within Bootstrap, the impact can range from cross-site scripting to denial of service or potentially other client-side exploits.

**Affected Bootstrap Component:**  Depends on the specific vulnerability. It could be a JavaScript module, a CSS rule, or a combination within the Bootstrap library itself.

**Risk Severity:** High (can be Critical depending on the specific vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Regularly update Bootstrap to the latest stable version.
*   Monitor Bootstrap's release notes and security advisories for updates and patches.
*   Use dependency scanning tools to identify known vulnerabilities in the Bootstrap version being used.

## Threat: [JavaScript Injection via Improper Event Handling with Bootstrap Components](./threats/javascript_injection_via_improper_event_handling_with_bootstrap_components.md)

**Description:** Developers might directly manipulate Bootstrap's JavaScript event handlers or use inline event attributes in conjunction with Bootstrap components without proper sanitization. If user-controlled data is incorporated into these handlers, it can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript within the context of Bootstrap's functionality.

**Impact:** Similar to XSS via data attributes, attackers can execute malicious scripts in the user's browser.

**Affected Bootstrap Component:**  JavaScript components like Modals, Dropdowns, Carousels, and potentially any component where Bootstrap's JavaScript event handling is involved.

**Risk Severity:** High

**Mitigation Strategies:**
*   Avoid using inline event handlers where possible.
*   Sanitize user input before using it in JavaScript code that interacts with Bootstrap components.
*   Prefer using Bootstrap's built-in JavaScript API for event handling and avoid direct DOM manipulation with user-provided data that could be attacker-controlled.
