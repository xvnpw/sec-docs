## Attack Tree Path: [1. Exploit Client-Side Code Execution Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/1__exploit_client-side_code_execution_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **1.1.1 Bypass Client-Side Validation [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Attackers attempt to circumvent client-side checks (e.g., JavaScript form validation, regular expressions) to submit malicious input to the server.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **1.1.1.1 Submit Malicious Solution Code:**  Injecting code (e.g., XSS payloads, commands) into challenge solutions, hoping the server will execute it.
        *   **1.1.1.2 Manipulate Network Requests:**  Using browser developer tools or proxy tools to modify the data sent to the server, bypassing client-side restrictions.

## Attack Tree Path: [2. Exploit Server-Side Code Execution Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]](./attack_tree_paths/2__exploit_server-side_code_execution_vulnerabilities__high_risk_.md)

*   **2.1 Compromise Challenge Submission and Evaluation Process [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:** This is the most critical vulnerability, targeting the core functionality of code evaluation.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **2.1.1 Inject Malicious Code via Solution Submission [HIGH RISK]:**  Submitting code designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the server-side evaluation engine.
            *   **2.1.1.1 Command Injection:**  If the server executes user code directly (e.g., using `eval()` or system calls without proper sanitization), attackers can inject operating system commands.
            *   **2.1.1.2 SQL Injection:**  If user-submitted code interacts with a SQL database, attackers can inject SQL queries to read, modify, or delete data.
            *   **2.1.1.3 NoSQL Injection:**  Similar to SQL injection, but targeting NoSQL databases like MongoDB.
        *   **2.1.3 Exploit Vulnerabilities in Sandboxing/Containerization**
            *   **2.1.3.1 Escape the Sandbox/Container [CRITICAL]:**  If sandboxing is used, attackers try to break out of the isolated environment to gain access to the host system.

*   **2.2 Exploit API Vulnerabilities [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Targeting weaknesses in the freeCodeCamp API to gain unauthorized access or data.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **2.2.3 Data Exposure [HIGH RISK]:**  Exploiting API endpoints to leak sensitive user information (e.g., email addresses, progress data, personal details) that should not be publicly accessible.

*   **2.3 Exploit Dependencies [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:** Leveraging known vulnerabilities in third-party libraries or packages used by freeCodeCamp.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **2.3.1 Known Vulnerabilities in Node.js Packages:**  Exploiting outdated versions of libraries like Express, Mongoose, or other dependencies with known security flaws.
        *   **2.3.2 Supply Chain Attacks:**  Exploiting compromised dependencies, where a malicious package is injected into the software supply chain.

## Attack Tree Path: [3. Exploit Authentication and Authorization Mechanisms](./attack_tree_paths/3__exploit_authentication_and_authorization_mechanisms.md)

*   **3.2 Bypass Authorization**
    *   **3.2.1 Role Escalation [CRITICAL]**
        *   **Description:**  A user with limited privileges attempts to gain higher-level access (e.g., becoming an administrator).
        *   **Attack Vectors:**
            *   **3.2.1.1 Exploit Flaws in RBAC Logic:**  Finding bugs or misconfigurations in the role-based access control system that allow unauthorized privilege escalation.
            *   **3.2.1.2 Manipulate User Profile Data:**  Modifying user profile data (e.g., through API calls or database manipulation) to change their assigned role.

## Attack Tree Path: [4. Exploit Infrastructure Vulnerabilities](./attack_tree_paths/4__exploit_infrastructure_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **4.1 Misconfigured Cloud Services [HIGH RISK]**
    *   **Description:**  Exploiting misconfigurations in the cloud environment (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) where freeCodeCamp is deployed.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **4.1.1 Exposed Database Credentials [CRITICAL]:**  Database credentials (usernames, passwords, connection strings) being accidentally exposed in public repositories, configuration files, or environment variables.

*   **4.2 Compromised CI/CD Pipeline [CRITICAL]**
    *   **Description:**  Gaining control of the continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline to inject malicious code or steal deployment secrets.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   **4.2.1 Inject Malicious Code into Build Process:**  Modifying build scripts or injecting malicious dependencies to introduce vulnerabilities into the application during the build process.
        *   **4.2.2 Gain Access to Deployment Credentials:**  Stealing credentials (e.g., SSH keys, API tokens) used to deploy the application, allowing the attacker to deploy their own malicious version.
