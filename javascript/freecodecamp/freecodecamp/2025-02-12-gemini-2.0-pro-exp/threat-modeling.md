# Threat Model Analysis for freecodecamp/freecodecamp

## Threat: [Dependency Hijacking (Supply Chain Attack)](./threats/dependency_hijacking__supply_chain_attack_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker compromises a package listed in freeCodeCamp's `package.json` (e.g., a utility library or build tool). The attacker publishes a malicious version of the package to npm. When freeCodeCamp (or a fork) updates its dependencies, the malicious code is pulled in. The attacker could then execute arbitrary code on the server, steal user data, or deface the site. This is *critical* because of freeCodeCamp's large dependency tree and the potential for widespread impact.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Complete server compromise.
    *   Data breach (user data, learning progress, project submissions, etc.).
    *   Reputational damage.
    *   Potential legal liability.
*   **Affected Component:** Primarily the Node.js environment and any server-side code that uses the compromised dependency. This could affect virtually *any* part of the application, depending on the compromised package. Examples:
    *   `client/` (React components using a compromised UI library)
    *   `api-server/` (API endpoints using a compromised utility library)
    *   `config/` (build scripts using a compromised tool)
*   **Risk Severity:** Critical
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Dependency Auditing:** Use `npm audit` and tools like Snyk regularly to identify known vulnerabilities.
    *   **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Employ an SCA tool to continuously monitor dependencies.
    *   **Dependency Pinning:** Pin dependency versions (with caution, balancing security and updates). Use a `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file.
    *   **Private npm Registry:** Consider using a private registry with vetted packages for critical dependencies.
    *   **CI/CD Integration:** Integrate dependency scanning into the CI/CD pipeline to block builds with vulnerable dependencies.
    *   **Manual Review:** For critical or less-maintained dependencies, manually review the source code before updating.

## Threat: [Malicious Pull Request (Compromised Contributor)](./threats/malicious_pull_request__compromised_contributor_.md)

*   **Description:** An attacker gains access to a legitimate contributor's GitHub account (e.g., through phishing or password reuse). The attacker submits a pull request containing malicious code, subtly introducing a vulnerability or backdoor. If the review process is inadequate, the malicious code gets merged into the main branch. This is *high* risk due to freeCodeCamp's open contribution model.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Introduction of backdoors or vulnerabilities.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Code execution on the server.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Any part of the codebase could be affected, depending on the nature of the malicious pull request. Examples:
    *   `api-server/src/server/` (modification of API endpoint logic)
    *   `client/src/components/` (introduction of a subtle vulnerability in a React component)
    *   `curriculum/` (modification of challenge solutions or instructions)
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Mandatory MFA:** Require all contributors to use multi-factor authentication (MFA) on their GitHub accounts.
    *   **Strict Branch Protection:** Enforce branch protection rules on the main repository, requiring:
        *   Multiple pull request reviews.
        *   Passing status checks (linting, testing).
        *   Signed commits.
    *   **Code Review Training:** Train code reviewers to identify potential security vulnerabilities.
    *   **Automated Code Analysis:** Integrate static analysis tools (SAST) into the CI/CD pipeline to detect suspicious code patterns.
    *   **Anomaly Detection:** Monitor for unusual commit activity (e.g., large changes, commits at unusual times).

## Threat: [Stale Fork Vulnerabilities](./threats/stale_fork_vulnerabilities.md)

*   **Description:** An organization forks the freeCodeCamp repository but fails to regularly merge updates from the upstream (official) repository. Over time, the fork becomes increasingly vulnerable to known security issues that have been patched in the upstream repository. This is *high* risk because it's a common operational oversight.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Exploitation of known vulnerabilities.
    *   Data breaches.
    *   Service disruption.
    *   Reputational damage.
*   **Affected Component:** Potentially the entire application, as any component could have unpatched vulnerabilities.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Regular Upstream Merges:** Establish a scheduled process for merging updates from the upstream freeCodeCamp repository.
    *   **Automated Merge Process:** Automate the merge process as much as possible (e.g., using GitHub Actions or similar).
    *   **Security Notifications:** Subscribe to security alerts and notifications for the freeCodeCamp project and its dependencies.
    *   **Dedicated Maintenance Team:** Assign a team or individual to be responsible for keeping the fork up-to-date.

## Threat: [Malicious Code in Project Submissions](./threats/malicious_code_in_project_submissions.md)

*   **Description:** A user submits malicious code as part of a project submission (e.g., a JavaScript project that attempts to perform malicious actions or access server-side resources). If the code is executed without proper sandboxing, it could compromise the platform. This is *high* risk due to the nature of freeCodeCamp's challenge system.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Potential server-side code execution (if the code is executed on the server).
    *   Data breaches.
*   **Affected Component:**
    *   The challenge execution environment (likely within `api-server/` or a separate service).
    *   Any components that display user-submitted code (e.g., project showcases).
    *   Potentially, the database if malicious code is stored and later retrieved unsafely.
*   **Risk Severity:** High
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Strict Input Sanitization:** Sanitize and validate all user-submitted code before storing or processing it.
    *   **Sandboxing:** Execute user-submitted code in a sandboxed environment (e.g., a Docker container, a Web Worker, or a dedicated virtual machine) with limited privileges.
    *   **Static Analysis:** Use static analysis tools to detect potentially malicious code patterns in user submissions.
    *   **Code Review (for showcased projects):** Manually review code before showcasing it publicly.
