**2. Security Implications of Key Components**

Let's break down the security implications of each key component:

*   **2.1 Web Application (Client - React)**

    *   **Threats:**
        *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Malicious scripts injected into the application could steal user cookies, redirect users to phishing sites, or deface the website.  Stored XSS is a particular concern in forum posts and user profiles. Reflected XSS could occur through manipulated URL parameters.
        *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  Attackers could trick users into performing unintended actions on the platform (e.g., changing their email address, making unwanted donations).
        *   **Client-Side Logic Manipulation:**  Attackers could modify the client-side JavaScript code to bypass security checks or access unauthorized data.
        *   **Sensitive Data Exposure in JavaScript:**  API keys or other secrets accidentally included in client-side code could be exposed.
        *   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:**  Vulnerable third-party React components or libraries could be exploited.

    *   **Existing Controls:** Input validation (likely, but needs verification), CSP (likely, but needs configuration review), HTTPS.

    *   **Vulnerabilities:**
        *   Insufficiently strict CSP could allow XSS attacks.
        *   Lack of CSRF protection on sensitive actions.
        *   Reliance on client-side validation without server-side enforcement.
        *   Outdated or vulnerable JavaScript libraries.

    *   **Mitigation Strategies:**
