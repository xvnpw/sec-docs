Okay, let's create a design document for the freeCodeCamp project based on the provided GitHub repository.

# BUSINESS POSTURE

freeCodeCamp is a non-profit organization that aims to make learning web development accessible to everyone. The project's primary goal is to provide a free, comprehensive, and interactive platform for learning various aspects of software development, including front-end, back-end, data science, and more.

Business Priorities:

*   Accessibility: Make learning available to anyone, regardless of their background or financial situation.
*   Comprehensiveness: Cover a wide range of relevant technologies and skills.
*   Community: Foster a supportive and collaborative learning environment.
*   Maintainability: Ensure the platform is easy to update and maintain.
*   Scalability: Handle a large number of concurrent users and learners.
*   Reputation: Maintain a positive reputation as a trusted source of learning.

Business Risks:

*   Data Breach: Unauthorized access to user data (even if limited) could damage reputation and user trust.
*   Platform Abuse: Malicious users could attempt to exploit the platform for spamming, phishing, or other harmful activities.
*   Content Integrity: Ensuring the accuracy and quality of learning materials is crucial.
*   Availability: Downtime or performance issues could disrupt learning and frustrate users.
*   Funding/Sustainability: As a non-profit, ensuring continued funding is a constant concern.
*   Legal and Compliance: Adhering to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) is essential.

# SECURITY POSTURE

Existing Security Controls (based on observation of the GitHub repository and general knowledge of the platform):

*   security control: Authentication: Users can create accounts and log in using email/password or social login providers (GitHub, Google, etc.). Implemented in server and client components.
*   security control: Authorization: Basic role-based access control (user, moderator, admin) likely exists to manage content and user interactions. Implemented in server component.
*   security control: Input Validation: The platform likely implements input validation to prevent common web vulnerabilities like cross-site scripting (XSS) and SQL injection. Implemented in server and client components.
*   security control: Content Security Policy (CSP): Likely implemented to mitigate XSS and data injection attacks. Implemented in server component as HTTP headers.
*   security control: HTTPS: The platform uses HTTPS to encrypt communication between the client and server. Implemented in infrastructure.
*   security control: Rate Limiting: Likely implemented to prevent abuse and brute-force attacks. Implemented in infrastructure and server component.
*   security control: Regular Dependency Updates: The project appears to actively manage and update its dependencies, reducing the risk of known vulnerabilities. Implemented in build process.
*   security control: Code Reviews: The project uses a pull request system, suggesting code reviews are part of the development process. Implemented in development process.
*   security control: Static Code Analysis: Evidence of linters and other static analysis tools in the repository. Implemented in build process.

Accepted Risks:

*   accepted risk: Limited User Data: The platform collects relatively limited personal information, reducing the impact of a potential data breach.
*   accepted risk: Open Source Nature: While open source offers transparency and community contributions, it also means vulnerabilities can be publicly discovered.

Recommended Security Controls:

*   Implement a robust Web Application Firewall (WAF) to protect against common web attacks.
*   Introduce regular security audits and penetration testing.
*   Implement a bug bounty program to incentivize responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities.
*   Enhance monitoring and logging to detect and respond to security incidents quickly.
*   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for privileged accounts (moderators, admins).

Security Requirements:

*   Authentication:
    *   Support secure password storage using a strong hashing algorithm (e.g., bcrypt, Argon2).
    *   Implement secure session management.
    *   Provide options for social login and potentially multi-factor authentication.
*   Authorization:
    *   Implement granular role-based access control to restrict access to sensitive features and data.
    *   Ensure that users can only access their own data and resources.
*   Input Validation:
    *   Validate all user inputs on both the client-side and server-side.
    *   Use a whitelist approach to allow only known-good characters and patterns.
    *   Sanitize user input to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.
*   Cryptography:
    *   Use HTTPS for all communication.
    *   Store sensitive data (e.g., API keys, secrets) securely, preferably using a secrets management solution.
    *   Use strong, industry-standard cryptographic algorithms and libraries.

    DockerImage -- "Push" --> ContainerRegistry["Container Registry (Docker Hub, Quay.io)"]

```

Build Process Description:

1.  Developer pushes code changes to the GitHub repository.
2.  A webhook triggers the CI server (e.g., GitHub Actions, CircleCI).
3.  The CI server runs a series of checks:
    *   Linting: Code style and quality checks using tools like ESLint and Stylelint.
    *   Testing: Unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests using frameworks like Jest and Cypress.
    *   SAST: Static Application Security Testing using tools like Snyk or SonarQube to identify potential vulnerabilities in the code.
    *   Dependency Check: Checks for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies using tools like `npm audit`.
4.  If all checks pass, the CI server builds the application (e.g., `npm build`).
5.  A Docker image is built containing the application code and its dependencies.
6.  The Docker image is pushed to a container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Quay.io).

Security Controls in Build Process:

*   security control: Code Reviews: Pull requests and code reviews on GitHub.
*   security control: Linting: Enforces code style and helps prevent common errors.
*   security control: Testing: Automated tests help ensure code quality and prevent regressions.
*   security control: SAST: Identifies potential security vulnerabilities in the code.
*   security control: Dependency Check: Identifies known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
*   security control: Immutable Infrastructure: Docker images provide a consistent and immutable environment for the application.
*   security control: Least Privilege: CI server should have limited access to resources.
