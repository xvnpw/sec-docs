# Attack Surface Analysis for freecodecamp/freecodecamp

## Attack Surface: [Client-Side Code Execution (Learn Platform)](./attack_surfaces/client-side_code_execution__learn_platform_.md)

*   **Description:**  Users submit code (JavaScript, HTML, CSS, etc.) that is executed within their browser as part of the learning curriculum.
*   **How freeCodeCamp Contributes:** This is the *core* functionality of the learning platform.  The entire interactive learning experience relies on this.  The breadth of supported languages and frameworks increases complexity.  fCC's *implementation* of the sandboxing, input validation, and execution environment is the key factor.
*   **Example:** A user submits JavaScript code containing a malicious payload that attempts to bypass the fCC-implemented sandbox and access the user's cookies or perform a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against other users.
*   **Impact:**  Compromise of user accounts, data theft, defacement of the website, execution of arbitrary code in the user's browser, potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks if the sandbox is breached.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement *multiple, independent* layers of sandboxing (e.g., iframes with `sandbox` attribute, Web Workers, service workers).  This is entirely within fCC's control.
        *   Enforce a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) to limit the capabilities of executed code (e.g., disallow inline scripts, restrict network access).  fCC must define and maintain this CSP.
        *   Regularly update browser dependencies and sandboxing libraries to patch known vulnerabilities.  fCC is responsible for managing these dependencies.
        *   Implement robust input validation and sanitization, even *before* the code reaches the sandbox.  This is a crucial fCC-specific implementation detail.
        *   Consider using a separate, isolated domain (e.g., `code.freecodecamp.org`) for code execution to limit the impact of a successful sandbox escape.  This is an architectural decision for fCC.
        *   Implement monitoring and anomaly detection to identify potentially malicious code execution patterns.  fCC must build and maintain this monitoring system.
        *   Use WebAssembly (Wasm) for sandboxing where possible, as it offers stronger security guarantees. fCC's choice to use and how to implement Wasm is key.

## Attack Surface: [Server-Side Code Execution (Optional Challenges)](./attack_surfaces/server-side_code_execution__optional_challenges_.md)

*   **Description:**  Some advanced challenges may require server-side code execution (e.g., Node.js, Python) to test backend logic.
*   **How freeCodeCamp Contributes:**  The *decision* to include server-side challenges, and the *entire implementation* of the server-side execution environment (sandboxing, resource limits, input validation), are completely under fCC's control.
*   **Example:** A user submits a Node.js challenge solution that attempts to read system files, open network connections, or execute shell commands, exploiting a flaw in fCC's sandboxing implementation.
*   **Impact:**  Complete server compromise, data breaches, denial of service, potential for lateral movement within the freeCodeCamp infrastructure.
*   **Risk Severity:** **Critical**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use *highly restrictive* sandboxing techniques, such as containers (Docker) or virtual machines (VMs), with minimal privileges and resource limits.  fCC's configuration and management of these sandboxes are paramount.
        *   Implement strict input validation and sanitization to prevent code injection vulnerabilities.  This is entirely fCC's responsibility.
        *   Limit the resources (CPU, memory, network bandwidth, file system access) available to the executed code.  fCC must configure these limits.
        *   Use a dedicated, isolated network for server-side code execution, separate from the main application infrastructure.  This is an architectural decision and implementation detail for fCC.
        *   Regularly update the server-side runtime environment (e.g., Node.js, Python) and all dependencies.  fCC is responsible for managing these updates.
        *   Implement robust logging and monitoring to detect suspicious activity.  fCC must build and maintain this monitoring.
        *   Consider using a "serverless" architecture (e.g., AWS Lambda) to further isolate code execution.  This is an architectural choice for fCC.
        *   *Never* trust user-provided code, even in a testing environment. This is a fundamental security principle that fCC must adhere to.

## Attack Surface: [JWT Handling and Session Management](./attack_surfaces/jwt_handling_and_session_management.md)

*   **Description:**  freeCodeCamp uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for session management after the initial OAuth authentication.
*   **How freeCodeCamp Contributes:** The *implementation details* of JWT creation, signing, validation, and storage are entirely within fCC's codebase and configuration.  This is *not* a general OAuth concern, but specific to fCC's JWT usage.
*   **Example:**  An attacker discovers the JWT secret key used by freeCodeCamp (due to a misconfiguration or code leak) and uses it to forge JWTs, impersonating any user.  Alternatively, a flaw in fCC's JWT *validation* logic could allow an attacker to bypass authentication.
*   **Impact:**  Complete account takeover, unauthorized access to user data, potential for privilege escalation.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Use strong, randomly generated secrets stored *securely* (e.g., using environment variables, a secrets management service).  *Never* hardcode secrets in the codebase.  fCC's secret management practices are crucial.
        *   Enforce strong JWT validation, including signature verification, expiration checks, and issuer checks.  This validation logic is entirely within fCC's code.
        *   Use a well-vetted JWT library and keep it up-to-date.  fCC is responsible for choosing and maintaining this library.
        *   Consider using short-lived JWTs and refresh tokens.  fCC's implementation of refresh token handling is key.
        *   Implement robust key rotation procedures.  fCC must design and implement this rotation.
        *   Use HTTPS for all communication to protect JWTs in transit. fCC must ensure HTTPS is properly configured.
        *   Store JWT securely on the client-side (e.g. HttpOnly Cookie). fCC's implementation choice.

## Attack Surface: [API Endpoint Security](./attack_surfaces/api_endpoint_security.md)

*   **Description:** freeCodeCamp exposes various API endpoints for interacting with user data and functionality.
*   **How freeCodeCamp Contributes:** The *design, implementation, and security configuration* of *each* API endpoint are entirely under fCC's control.  This is not a general web API issue, but specific to fCC's API.
*   **Example:** An attacker exploits a vulnerability in an fCC-developed API endpoint to access or modify another user's progress data, or to perform a denial-of-service attack.  The vulnerability exists because of a flaw in fCC's code or configuration.
*   **Impact:** Data breaches, data modification, denial of service, potential for unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Risk Severity:** **High**
*   **Mitigation Strategies:**
    *   **Developers:**
        *   Implement strong authentication and authorization for *all* API endpoints.  fCC's authentication and authorization logic is key.
        *   Use input validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, NoSQL injection, command injection).  This validation is entirely within fCC's code.
        *   Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.  fCC must configure and enforce rate limits.
        *   Regularly perform security testing of the API endpoints (e.g., using penetration testing tools, fuzzing).  fCC is responsible for this testing.
        *   Follow secure API design principles (e.g., RESTful API best practices, OWASP API Security Top 10).  fCC's adherence to these principles is crucial.
        *   Use a well-defined API specification (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger) to document and validate API behavior.  fCC must create and maintain this specification.
        *   Implement robust error handling and logging. fCC's error handling and logging implementation.
