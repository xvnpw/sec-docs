## 6. Security Considerations

This section expands on the security considerations for the platform, providing more specific examples:

*   **Authentication and Authorization:**
    *   **Threat:** Brute-force attacks on login forms.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implementing rate limiting on login attempts, using CAPTCHA, and potentially account lockout mechanisms.
    *   **Threat:** Stolen or compromised user credentials.
    *   **Mitigation:** Enforcing strong password policies, encouraging the use of password managers, and considering multi-factor authentication (MFA) via TOTP or email verification. Securely storing password hashes using strong hashing algorithms (e.g., bcrypt or Argon2) with unique salts.
    *   **Threat:** Unauthorized access to resources.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implementing robust role-based access control (RBAC) to ensure users only have access to the resources and functionalities they are authorized for. Verifying JWT signatures on every protected API endpoint.

*   **Input Validation:**
    *   **Threat:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Implementing strict input validation on both the frontend and backend to sanitize user-provided data. Encoding output data before rendering it in the browser. Utilizing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to control the sources from which the browser is allowed to load resources.
    *   **Threat:** SQL Injection attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Using parameterized queries or Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) to prevent the injection of malicious SQL code. Implementing least privilege principles for database access.
    *   **Threat:** Command Injection attacks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoiding direct execution of system commands based on user input. If necessary, carefully sanitize and validate input before passing it to system commands.

*   **Data Protection:**
    *   **Threat:** Data breaches and unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Mitigation:** Encrypting sensitive data at rest in the database using encryption features provided by MongoDB Atlas. Encrypting data in transit using HTTPS for all communication between the client and server. Regularly backing up data and storing backups securely.
    *   **Threat:** Exposure of sensitive data through logging.
    *   **Mitigation:** Avoiding logging sensitive information (e.g., passwords, API keys). Implementing secure logging practices and access controls for log files.

*   **Code Execution Security:**
    *   **Threat:** Malicious code execution that could compromise the server or other users.
    *   **Mitigation:** Utilizing containerization technologies like Docker to create isolated and resource-limited environments for executing user code.
