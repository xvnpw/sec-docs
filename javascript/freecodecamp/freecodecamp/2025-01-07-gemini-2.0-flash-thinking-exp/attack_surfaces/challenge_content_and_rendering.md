        print("\n## Detailed Threat Landscape and Attack Vectors:")
        print("""
        The primary threat is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), which can manifest in several ways:

        * **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts are permanently stored in the application's database (e.g., within a challenge description) and executed whenever a user views the affected challenge. This is the most concerning type in this context.
        * **Reflected XSS:** While less likely in the core challenge content itself, if challenge content is ever dynamically included in URLs or other request parameters without proper encoding, it could lead to reflected XSS.
        * **DOM-based XSS:** If the JavaScript code responsible for rendering the challenge content manipulates the DOM based on user input (even indirectly), vulnerabilities in this code could allow attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the user's browser.

        **Specific Attack Scenarios:**

        * **Credential Harvesting:** Injecting JavaScript to capture keystrokes on the page or redirect users to a fake login page to steal their freeCodeCamp credentials.
        * **Session Hijacking:** Stealing session cookies to impersonate logged-in users.
        * **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to websites hosting malware or tricking them into downloading malicious software.
        * **Defacement:** Injecting code to alter the visual appearance of the challenge page, potentially damaging freeCodeCamp's reputation.
        * **Information Disclosure:** Accessing and exfiltrating sensitive information accessible within the user's browser context.
        * **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Exploitation:** While not directly XSS, successful XSS can be used to execute CSRF attacks on behalf of the victim.
        """)

        print("\n## Underlying Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses:")
        print("""
        The vulnerability stems from the application's need to render dynamic content, which inherently involves processing potentially untrusted input. Specific weaknesses can include:

        * **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** Lack of robust server-side sanitization of challenge content before it's stored in the database. This allows malicious scripts to persist.
        * **Improper Output Encoding:** Failure to properly encode challenge content when rendering it in the user's browser. This allows injected scripts to be interpreted as executable code.
        * **Weak or Missing Content Security Policy (CSP):** An improperly configured or absent CSP allows injected scripts to execute without restrictions. A strong CSP can significantly limit the damage of XSS attacks.
        * **Over-Reliance on Client-Side Sanitization:** While client-side sanitization can offer some defense, it's easily bypassed by attackers. Server-side sanitization is paramount.
        * **Vulnerabilities in Third-Party Libraries:** If the rendering process relies on external libraries, vulnerabilities in those libraries could be exploited.
        * **Lack of Regular Security Audits:** Without regular audits, vulnerabilities can remain undetected and unpatched.
        * **Insufficient Developer Security Awareness:** Developers may not be fully aware of XSS vulnerabilities and secure coding practices.
        """)

        print("\n## Enhanced Mitigation Strategies and Developer Responsibilities:")
        print("""
        The initial mitigation strategies are a good starting point, but here's a more detailed breakdown with actionable steps for the development team:

        **1. Implement Strict Input Sanitization (Server-Side is Crucial):**

        * **Whitelisting Approach:** Instead of blacklisting potentially harmful tags and attributes, define a strict whitelist of allowed HTML elements, attributes, and CSS properties for challenge descriptions and starter code.
        * **Utilize Robust Sanitization Libraries:** Integrate well-vetted server-side HTML sanitization libraries like:
            * **OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer (if using Java backend)**
            * **Bleach (if using Python backend)**
            * **DOMPurify (for Node.js backend)**
        * **Context-Aware Sanitization:** Apply different sanitization rules based on the context (e.g., more restrictive rules for starter code than for descriptive text).
        * **Regular Expression-Based Validation (with caution):** Use regular expressions to identify and reject potentially malicious patterns, but be aware of the limitations and potential for bypasses.
        * **Limit Input Length and Complexity:** Impose reasonable limits on the size and complexity of challenge content to prevent resource exhaustion and potential injection attempts.

        **2. Implement Robust Output Encoding (Context-Aware):**

        * **Context-Specific Encoding:** Encode data differently depending on where it's being rendered:
            * **HTML Entity Encoding:** For rendering within HTML content (e.g., using `&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&quot;`, `&apos;`, `&amp;`).
            * **JavaScript Encoding:** For embedding data within JavaScript code.
            * **URL Encoding:** For embedding data in URLs.
        * **Leverage Secure Templating Engines:** Ensure the chosen templating engine (e.g., Jinja2, React's JSX, Angular's templates) has robust auto-escaping features enabled by default.
        * **Avoid Rendering Raw HTML Directly:** Minimize the use of methods that directly render raw HTML strings without proper encoding.

        **3. Implement and Enforce a Strong Content Security Policy (CSP):**

        * **Principle of Least Privilege:** Design the CSP to be as restrictive as possible, only allowing necessary resources.
        * **`script-src` Directive:**  Strictly control the sources from which scripts can be loaded. Avoid `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` unless absolutely necessary and with extreme caution. Consider using nonces or hashes for inline scripts.
        * **`style-src` Directive:** Control the sources of CSS. Avoid `unsafe-inline`.
        * **`object-src` Directive:** Restrict the sources of plugins like Flash.
        * **`frame-ancestors` Directive:** Prevent the application from being embedded in malicious iframes.
        * **`report-uri` or `report-to` Directive:** Configure CSP reporting to monitor and identify potential XSS attempts.

        **4. Regular Security Audits and Penetration Testing:**

        * **Automated Security Scans:** Integrate Static Application Security Testing (SAST) and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) tools into the development pipeline to automatically identify potential vulnerabilities.
        * **Manual Code Reviews:** Conduct regular manual code reviews, specifically focusing on code related to challenge content handling and rendering.
        * **Penetration Testing:** Engage security professionals to perform penetration testing, specifically targeting the challenge content rendering mechanism.

        **5. Developer Security Training and Awareness:**

        * **Regular Training:** Provide developers with regular training on common web security vulnerabilities, especially XSS, and secure coding practices.
        * **OWASP Resources:** Encourage developers to familiarize themselves with resources from the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP).
        * **Security Champions:** Designate security champions within the development team to promote security awareness and best practices.

        **6. Content Moderation and Review Process:**

        * **Pre-Publication Review:** Implement a process for reviewing and approving challenge content before it's published, especially for content contributed by users.
        * **Community Reporting Mechanisms:** Provide users with a clear and easy way to report suspicious or potentially malicious content.
        * **Automated Content Analysis:** Explore using automated tools to scan challenge content for potentially malicious patterns.

        **7. Consider a Sandboxed Rendering Environment (Advanced):**

        * For particularly sensitive or high-risk content, consider rendering challenges within a sandboxed environment (e.g., using iframes with restricted permissions) to further isolate the application from malicious code execution. However, this can introduce complexities with user interaction and data sharing.

        **8. Principle of Least Privilege:**

        * Ensure that the accounts and roles responsible for creating and managing challenge content have only the necessary permissions. Limit the ability of lower-privileged users to introduce potentially harmful content.
