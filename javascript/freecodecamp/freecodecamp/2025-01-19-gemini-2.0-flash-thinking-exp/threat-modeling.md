# Threat Model Analysis for freecodecamp/freecodecamp

## Threat: [Malicious Content Injection via Embedded Resources](./threats/malicious_content_injection_via_embedded_resources.md)

* **Description:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious content (e.g., JavaScript, iframes leading to phishing sites) into freeCodeCamp's platform. If the application embeds content from freeCodeCamp, this malicious content could be executed within the application's context or displayed to users. This could happen through vulnerabilities in freeCodeCamp's content submission or moderation processes.
* **Impact:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, redirection to malicious sites, theft of user credentials or session tokens, defacement of the application's UI, or execution of arbitrary code within the user's browser.
* **Affected Component:** Embedded Content (e.g., lessons, challenges, forum posts iframes are used).
* **Risk Severity:** High
* **Mitigation Strategies:**
    * Implement a strong Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict the sources from which the application can load resources and the actions that embedded scripts can perform.
    * Sanitize and validate any data received from freeCodeCamp before rendering it within the application.
    * Use the `sandbox` attribute on iframes embedding freeCodeCamp content to restrict their capabilities.
    * Regularly review freeCodeCamp's security advisories and be aware of potential vulnerabilities.
