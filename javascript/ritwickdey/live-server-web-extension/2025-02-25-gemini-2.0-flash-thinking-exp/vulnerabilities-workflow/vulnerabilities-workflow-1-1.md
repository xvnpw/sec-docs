### Vulnerability 1

* Vulnerability Name: Insecure Proxy URI Configuration leading to Local File Exposure
* Description:
    1. A developer uses the "Live Server" VS Code extension and the "Live Server Web Extension" browser add-on for server-side development.
    2. The developer configures the "Proxy Setup" in VS Code's `settings.json` to use the browser add-on for live reload with a local server (e.g., XAMPP, PHP built-in server).
    3. An attacker, through social engineering or other means, convinces the developer to use a malicious `proxyUri` in their `settings.json`. For example, the attacker suggests using a `proxyUri` like `file:///c:/` or `http://malicious-server.com`.
    4. If the "Live Server Web Extension" blindly uses the provided `proxyUri` to construct URLs for requests or redirects without proper validation and sanitization, it might be possible to access local files or redirect to external malicious sites when the developer uses the "Live Server Address" provided by the VS Code extension.
    5. Specifically, if a malicious `proxyUri` like `file:///c:/` is used, and the extension attempts to fetch resources or rewrite URLs based on this base URI, it could potentially bypass browser security restrictions and expose local files from the developer's machine through the "Live Server Address".
* Impact:
    - High: A malicious actor could potentially gain access to sensitive files on the developer's local machine if the developer is tricked into using a malicious `proxyUri`. This could include source code, configuration files, credentials, or other sensitive data accessible on the developer's file system.
* Vulnerability Rank: high
* Currently Implemented Mitigations:
    - None apparent from the provided documentation. The documentation describes the "Proxy Setup" mechanism but does not mention any security considerations or input validation for the `proxyUri`.
* Missing Mitigations:
    - Input validation and sanitization for the `proxyUri` in the browser extension. The extension should validate that the `proxyUri` is a valid and safe URL and prevent usage of `file://` or other potentially dangerous URI schemes.
    - Origin checks and restrictions when using the `proxyUri` to construct URLs or fetch resources. The extension should ensure that it does not bypass browser security boundaries and expose local resources unintentionally.
    - Clear security warnings in the documentation about the risks of using untrusted `proxyUri` values.
* Preconditions:
    - The developer must be using the "Live Server" VS Code extension and the "Live Server Web Extension" browser add-on.
    - The developer must be using the "Proxy Setup" mode.
    - The developer must be tricked into configuring a malicious `proxyUri` in their VS Code `settings.json`.
* Source Code Analysis:
    - The provided project files do not include the source code of the browser extension (`background.js`, `reload.js`). Therefore, a detailed source code analysis is not possible based on the given information.
    - However, based on the description of the "Proxy Setup" and the functionality of live reload, it is plausible that the extension processes the `proxyUri` to rewrite URLs or fetch resources.
    - If the extension directly uses the `proxyUri` without validation and sanitization in functions that construct URLs or make network requests, it could be vulnerable to local file exposure if a `file://` URI is used as `proxyUri`.
* Security Test Case:
    1. Setup:
        - Install "Live Server" VS Code extension and "Live Server Web Extension" browser add-on in a development environment.
        - Create a simple HTML project.
        - Configure VS Code `settings.json` for the project to use "Proxy Setup" and set `proxyUri` to `file:///c:/windows/win.ini` (for Windows) or `file:///etc/passwd` (for Linux/macOS) and `baseUri` to `/`. Enable `useWebExt: true`.
        - Start the Live Server from VS Code ("Go Live").
        - Open the "Live Server Address" in the browser.
    2. Test:
        - In the browser's developer tools (Network tab), observe the requests made by the browser.
        - Check if the browser attempts to load resources from `file:///c:/windows/win.ini` (or `file:///etc/passwd`).
        - Alternatively, try to access a path under the "Live Server Address" that should correspond to the `baseUri` and see if the response contains the content of the local file specified in the `proxyUri`.
    3. Expected Outcome:
        - If the vulnerability exists, the browser might display the content of the local file (`win.ini` or `passwd`) or make a network request to a `file://` URL, indicating local file exposure.
        - If mitigated, the browser should not be able to access local files via the "Live Server Address" when using a `file://` `proxyUri`. The extension should either reject the invalid `proxyUri` or sanitize it properly to prevent local file access.
