- vulnerability name: Unauthenticated Remote Access
- description: |
  Live Server allows users to host a local development server that can be accessed from other devices on the same network. When configured to be accessible remotely (e.g., by setting the host to `0.0.0.0` or using the machine's local IP address), Live Server does not implement any form of authentication. This means that anyone on the same network can access the server and the files it serves without needing to provide any credentials.

  Step-by-step trigger:
  1. User configures Live Server to listen on all interfaces by setting `liveServer.settings.host` to `0.0.0.0` or by using the machine's local IP address.
  2. User starts the Live Server.
  3. An attacker on the same local network discovers the IP address of the machine running Live Server and the port it's listening on (default is 5500).
  4. Attacker opens a web browser and navigates to `http://<IP address of user's machine>:<port>`.
  5. Attacker gains access to the files being served by Live Server without any authentication.
- impact: |
  High. An external attacker on the same network can gain unauthorized access to the files being served by Live Server. This can lead to information disclosure, where the attacker can view sensitive source code, configuration files, or other data intended for local development. Depending on the nature of the served application, further exploitation might be possible if the attacker can manipulate or interact with the application in unintended ways.
- vulnerability rank: high
- currently implemented mitigations: |
  The default configuration of Live Server listens only on `127.0.0.1` (localhost), which restricts access to the local machine only. This is a default mitigation that prevents external network access unless explicitly configured by the user. The documentation in FAQs section explains "How to access the server from Mobile?", implicitly acknowledging and guiding users on how to enable remote access, but without mentioning any security considerations or authentication mechanisms.
- missing mitigations: |
  The primary missing mitigation is the implementation of authentication for remote access. Live Server should offer options to secure remote access, such as:
  - Basic authentication (username/password).
  - IP address whitelisting to restrict access to specific networks or devices.
  - A clear warning in the documentation and settings UI about the security risks of enabling remote access without authentication.
  - Consider disabling remote access by default and requiring explicit user consent and configuration to enable it.
- preconditions: |
  1. The user must explicitly configure Live Server to be accessible remotely by changing the `liveServer.settings.host` setting to `0.0.0.0` or their local IP address.
  2. The attacker must be on the same local network as the user's machine running Live Server.
- source code analysis: |
  Source code for the Live Server extension is not provided in the PROJECT FILES. Therefore, direct source code analysis is not possible. However, based on the feature description in `README.md` and settings documentation in `docs/settings.md`, there is no mention of any authentication or access control mechanisms for remote connections. The documentation focuses on how to enable remote access for testing on mobile devices, suggesting that the feature is designed for ease of use within a trusted local network environment, but lacks security considerations for untrusted network scenarios.

  It is inferred that the server implementation likely does not include authentication middleware or access control checks for incoming HTTP requests, especially when configured for remote access.
- security test case: |
  1. On a test machine (Machine A), install the Live Server VSCode extension.
  2. Create a simple HTML file in a new workspace folder. Include some text content that can be easily verified (e.g., "Live Server Test Page").
  3. In the VSCode settings for the workspace, set `liveServer.settings.host` to `0.0.0.0`.
  4. Start Live Server for this workspace using any of the standard methods (status bar button, context menu, or command palette). Note the port Live Server is running on (default 5500).
  5. Determine the IP address of Machine A on the local network (e.g., using `ipconfig` on Windows or `ifconfig` on Linux/macOS).
  6. On a separate machine (Machine B) connected to the same local network, open a web browser.
  7. In the browser's address bar, enter `http://<IP address of Machine A>:<port number>`. For example, if Machine A's IP is `192.168.1.100` and the port is 5500, enter `http://192.168.1.100:5500`.
  8. Observe that the "Live Server Test Page" is displayed in the browser on Machine B, confirming successful access to the server from a remote machine without any authentication prompt.
